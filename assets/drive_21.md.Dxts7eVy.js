The plot of the story-industrial spying/scientist developing radical life-saving process-was one I'd not run across before. It was evident from the facts that the author had done a lot of research. What made it enjoyable is that those facts were given to us in intersting conversation and narrative. The ending is a true nailbiter that kept me reading long after it was time to turn in for the night. I couldn't stand not knowing how it all turned out.I was pleasantly surprised to see that the cover accurately depicted the main couple and the decorations on the deck of the sailboat. If there was one &quot;show stopper&quot;, it was the fact that Alica, described on the back as a top scientist (biologist) dedicated to saving lives, falls into bed with Jason repeatedly without the use of protection.

He asks the reader to ponder the unsymbiotic dichotomy of beauty and goodness. Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \\"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book. A good read if for nothing else than the unsurpassed wit of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I usually try to go into English classes with a sense of optimism about the reading materials, and they're actually not usually bad. I find myself finishing almost every book ahead of schedule, and liking quite a few of them. So when I found out we'd be reading The Picture of Dorian Gray in junior year of High School, I started it with a positive mind. It was a famous classic after all! However, in this particular case, I was disappointed.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a novel with far too much unused potential. It's about the adventures of Dorian Gray, an upper class young adult living in the 1890's. Dorian acquires a magical portrait that diverts all physical traces of sin from him to his face in the portrait, allowing him to commit as much sin as he wants and remain looking youthful and innocent (i.e., after his insults drive his girlfriend Sybil to suicide, his portrait develops \\"a touch of cruelty in his mouth\\" [pg. 91] but his actual face remains the same). He gets advice from other characters about how he should live life, and after following his friend Lord Henry's way of life (outlined in a little yellow book that encourages Dorian to remain vain and shallow) and living hedonistically and selfishly for years and years, he finally realizes how \`ugly' his soul has become and launches an attempt at redemption. While it seems like there would be lots of action, I was disappointed at the lack of plot in general, and most of the book is actually rich people talking about human nature. Many of the book's lessons are taken from the obscure musings of Lord Henry, who acts as an outlet for Wilde's opinions, and while this is a decent way for Dorian to learn about life, I would much rather have read about him learning through experience as he traveled around doing something interesting. He could have been living a life of incalculable sin, and yet chooses to have sex and hang out in gardens smoking opium all day; not quite the worst decision ever, but not an exciting book.The lack of action isn't the only disappointing thing about the book. I constantly felt that Wilde was too busy sending messages to the audience to really give his characters life. Every dialogue read less like a real conversation and more like a (sometimes cryptic) scripted debate, and Wilde skips past something like twenty years' worth of Dorian Gray's character development (summarizing the slow corruption in one chapter). Other characters serve only to invoke development in Dorian, and no other characters show any significant development themselves, making the story just slightly distant. Wilde wastes space for the plot to talk about his ideas about human nature, crossing the line between novel and essay too much for my pleasure (\\"...you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you.\\" [pg. 220] is a good example of Lord Henry voicing Oscar Wilde's opinion on not just Dorian, but on life, and the Victorian generation). Another book that actually balances preaching with plot well is Animal Farm by George Orwell; it manages to simultaneously deliver a message about communism and entertain the audience. If you want a book where it is mostly messages and the entertainment is scarce, Dorian Gray is the book for you.Well, why is the story so famous? Part of its reputation is due to its shock value concerning homosexuality. There were various less-than-covert hints at homosexuality and adultery, which, unfortunately, are no longer effective in the 21st century. Now that the president is praising gay service in the military on national television, it is hard to be amazed about having gay characters in a book, and so a lot of impact is lost on me. Besides these homosexual exchanges between Dorian and the other male characters, the book is fairly void of plot, and Wilde's reliance on shock value make it boring and harder to take seriously at this point in time, no matter how revolutionary his writing may have been back in his era.The book was short enough to read through without losing focus, and to be fair, Wilde's writing is always very elegant with a signature fancy flair. Many of Lord Henry's musings are interesting, and most of the dialogues are widely quotable. The problem is that the story is just a little bit too boring for me to consider it a book you would normally read for fun, and combined with the superb premise of Dorian's magical portrait, this book's plot was really disappointing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"If the book was entitled \\"The Picture of Dorietta Gray\\" it never would have become a classic. The idea of a man's beauty when the book was written and even today is suspect. There is something feminine about a beautiful person, pretty eyes, long eyelashes, a voluptuous mouth and smooth skin. Masculine men are suppose to be rugged even if handsome, a jutting jaw, thin lips and leathery skin. That Dorian was barely a man when his portrait is completed is important because when he wished for eternal youth, he refused to become a man and to be a pretty boy as he aged was itself, a decadent act.The book begins with lots of talk about Art and how Dorian Gray himself was a work of art who shouldn't bother with the hurley burley of real life. His first corruption comes when he can't accept Sybil Vane is so in love him she loses her ability to inhabit the lives the Shakespearean woman she played so well. But then the book become less about how Dorian fails to live up to the art of his life and more about his shadowy, decadent ways.Men and women fall in love with Dorian Gray. After Ms. Vane, it appears that Dorian falls in love with no one but he lurks around the docks, bars and opium dens with other men. What he actually does that is so disreputable is never clear and but for those of us living post Stonewall have a pretty good idea that it involved casual sex with men.The novel anticipates the celebrity that consumes us. It also proudly promotes male beauty in a new way. But after setting up a grand discussion about art and beauty, I think the book transforms into something more pedestrian, a creepy tale of horror where art and beauty are forgotten."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Title of Book: The Picture of Dorian GrayBy: Oscar WildeReviewed by: M. PoppinsPeriod: 5Basil Hallward painted a picture of his friend, Dorian Gray. Dorian was about eighteen years old, and everyone said that he was very beautiful. Lord Henry Wotton (Harry), Basil's friend from Oxford, became Dorian's best friend after they met. After the picture was finished, Basil gave the picture to Dorian as a present, and Dorian made a wish that he would always be young, and the picture would grow old. His wish came true. Whenever he did something bad, the person in the picture would get older. Dorian's face never changed after the picture was finished. He never let anyone know about the picture. One day, Dorian showed Basil the picture and showed him how much the picture was altered. Dorian then murdered the man by digging a knife behind his ear, stabbing him again and again. The day after Basil was dead, Dorian made Alan Campbell (one of his former friends) get rid of the body, by blackmailing him. Dorian then decided that he was going to do. He was going to destroy the picture, because he thought that he was going to be in peace after the picture was gone. He grabbed the knife that he had used to kill Basil and stabbed the picture with it. A cry and a crash were heard. A while later, his coachman and footman went through the windows, up to where Dorian was. On the wall, there was a picture of Dorian Gray, young and beautiful. On the ground, there was a man who was wrinkled, withered, and loathsome of visage. They had to examine the rings for them to recognize who he really was.I liked this book because it was fun and interesting at the same time. This quote is what made Dorian's wish come true: &quot;...only if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that would grow old!&quot; He didn't know that his wish was to come true. I love when things like that happen!I also disliked the book, because in some parts, it just went on and on about things that I didn't understand. Also, there was too much philosophy in this book. This was something that Lord Henry said: &quot;I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, down-right cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated...&quot; The quote still goes on. I think that Lord Henry is too philosophic.My least favorite part of the book was when Dorian was stabbing Basil, because that was too nasty for me. That is what I hate to hear."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I expected Dorian Gray to be rather dry and restrained when I picked it up. However, it is anything but! This is an enjoyable fast paced novel.Basil Hawthorne paints his masterpiece inspired by (and the portrait of) Dorian Gray. In the blush of innocence, Dorian begins to spend time with Basil's friend, Lord Henry who revels in making shocking statements and defying social protocols. A quick study, Dorian takes this to new levels as he - spurred on by Lord Henry and his own vanity - winds his way down a road of moral corruption all the while horrified at the changes on the canvas. When Basil decides that he would like to exhibit the portait (unaware of what has become of the portait while hidden away by Dorian), Dorian can no longer hide the flaws that have been for so long protected from outside eyes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This story was really good. It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read.

If all that excess in the middle had been deleted, I would have given the book 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because &quot;the way of paradoxes is the way of truth&quot; (Dorian Gray).

It's worth reading, but I'd say Wilde's plays and poetry are more fun."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I think Dorian Gray is a book that is different for different people. For me it was a new experience, because I haven't read many books from the 19th century. I would believe that at the time when it was first published, it was a very different book for everyone. You can definetly see that the book contains lots of homosexual stuff. I think it's amazing that Oscar Wilde had the courage to write about that at such an early time.

If you want a feel for the book, read the intro/prelude; there are some interesting statements Wilde makes about &quot;ART&quot;. Otherwise, don't bother. There's only so much of art-imitates-life-life-imitates-art you can take."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Unfortunately I didn't like this classic story for many reasons. I downloaded theFree Kindle versionand read about half of it. I finished the story by listening to the Librivox audiobook recording using thefree smartphone app.I found Lord Henry to be quite unlikeable. His statements were absurd, contradictory, and got old quickly. Here are some loose quotes... \\"The only things that are necessary are those that are truly unnecessary.\\" He had MANY of those and I saw them coming when only three words of a sentence were out of his mouth. \\"I find people infinitely fascinating.\\" Which he quickly followed up with something like, \\"I pay no attention to people at all.\\" I believe Wilde was trying to paint a pompous, egotistical fool and he did a great job. It made me dislike the character greatly.The story was not balanced well. We started out by meeting Dorian and quickly jumped ahead through years and years of his life. There was very little build up of tension. Chapter nine was completely painful to go through. Did we need to read, in long, boring detail, about textiles and gems?My biggest complaint - various evil deeds and adventures are eluded to, but not shown to us. Dorian's actions are key to the concept of this story, but they are told to us at a distance and with very little feeling. Authors hear often that they are to show, not tell the reader what is happening. Chapter after chapter told us, in only vague hints, what kinds of things Dorian was up to. We skip over incidents very quickly. Some are just a word or two in a sentence. I realize that The Picture of Dorian Gray was written in an era when prostitution, drug use, and vile acts couldn't be written about in detail, but it could have been done so much better.This story reminds me ofThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They both have themes of - Be careful what you wish for. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was also written at a time when sadistic endeavors and deviant sexual practices couldn't be written in detail. Stevenson succeeded where Wilde failed. I felt Mr. Hyde's strength and power. I could see the lust and greed. Wilde didn't bring any believability to this story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Informative, deep analyis and fascinating to see Wilde's own annotations in the text. Highly recommended for a closer look at a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"It's been a while since I read The Picture Of Dorian Gray, but I'll try to review it as well as I can.The Picture Of Dorian Gray takes place in late nineteenth-century England, among the wealthy middle- or lower upper class. It is about Dorian Gray, a young man who is beautiful, charming and popular. His good friend Basil Hallward is painting his portrait, and during a visit at Basil's house he meets Lord Henry, another friend of Basils. Lord Henry is decadent and provocative, and Dorian is very impressed by him and his ideas.Lord Henry tells him about how precious his youth and beauty is, and how awful everything will become when he grows old (\\"When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter then defeats\\").When Basils painting is finished, Dorian sees his own beauty in it and is struck by the fear of aging. He makes a pact with the devil, and sells his soul so that he can remain young and beautiful forever, while his painting grows old and repulsive. His former kind and lovely self is gradually reformed, and he grows evil and corrupt although he still appears just as fresh and innocent as he has always been.This book is not the best one I've read, but it is pretty good. I think that the characters are sometimes turned into caricatures of themselves; they don't really appear to be real persons. Although I really liked Lord Henry's philosophical monologues, they sometimes grew tiresome and a bit too long. The novel, and in particular the ending, is quite predictable.However, the book is beautifully written (like most of the books I've read from that time (but I don't know if it's because of their superiority to the writers of today, or merely because the good ones are the only ones that are left to future generations))(...) There are strong homosexual tendencies in the friendship between Dorian Gray and both Basil and Lord Henry, and their friendship does not feel like a mere friendship.Apart from being a way for Wilde to, through Lord Henry, give voice to some of his philosophical ideas, I think the novel is about the shallowness and hypocrisy of the Victorian society, which considered outward appearance more important than ethics and moral."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"In the book the Picture of Dorian Gray Dorian, the main character makes a powerful wish that impacts his life and the lives of others.

It's relentless from beginning to end. All throughout you want to rush through the pages to see how the story concludes. What will happen to Dorian? What will become of the hideous painting?The book's three main characters are Basil Hallward, the painter; Dorian Gray, the paintee; and Lord Henry, the intellectual mind behind Dorian Gray. It seems as if all of Dorian Gray's evils are inspired by his sidekick, Lord Henry. So, throughout the story, the reader is left asking: &quot;Is this guy a villain?&quot; As to the answer to that question, it still remains uncertain to me.And the ending - oh! - flawless, impeccable, divine! I dare not give it away, for you must venture into those pages to find out where all the events lead to. The last page of the book is truly the climax. You'll be left shivering with sweat trickling down your forehead just to see what happens.&quot;Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature,&quot; Lord Henry claims in one part of the story. Nay, they don't, I must say - for it was an Englishman that produced this book!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is not just a book, it is a story that delves into each human's beliefs and views of the world, a book that makes a person really look differently at the world around them. Although Oscar Wilde wastes much space with over-explanatory details, the moments in which he tells his story are moments of inspiration and causes of great self-examination. The story, in which a good-looking young man gains eternal beauty, really makes its reader look within themselves and find the person they are and who they want to be. Also, through some very good symbols, Wilde is able to make his reader find new meaning in the world around them and is able to open the reader's eyes to the magnificence--and ugliness--of life itself.Even though the book is mostly filled with simple dialogue and extended (and sometimes, unnecessary) descriptions, the overall effect the story itself can have upon the reader's mind is overpowering. Not only does Wilde's occasional complex dialogue add to the reader's understanding of the world, the ideals with which Wilde writes (and therefore gives his character) make the reader work to understand where they fall within the spectrum of day to day life.The book was slow moving at first, but really started to pick up, due to its author's ability to excite the reader's mind, with the first meeting between the main character and the man who he would eventually blame for all of his problems. I would definitely recommend this book to those who have an open mind (there are some controversial ideas and lifestyles within the story) and are able to follow a character's complex mindset because, although most of the book is simple and in some people's eyes, artless, it still provides the reader with multiple \\"out-of-the-box\\" type ideas.I enjoyed the book, and the message it sent was one that I will probably never forget. It is one that forces the reader to question what they value in life, make them question what a \\"perfect\\" life would be. Because of the story's ability to reach within the readers mind and plant a new outlook on life, the book would be a great read for anyone who is interested in hearing the story of a man who gave up everything in order to keep the only thing he believed to be important within the world, the thing that he himself feared losing the most."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"A classic noir fiction novel were the worship of material values related to physical beauty and immortality drive the ego of a young man belonging to the upper classes of the English society of the XIX century to a tragic fate after circumstances force him to confront his real self.

There's a lot to be learned from Dorian Gray, I promise he's well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I decided to re-read Dorian Gray for an upcoming book club discussion but I knew that I wanted to read the annotated edition because I cannot resist special editions--books, films, and music-- with all the accompanying special features. I had not realized the extent to which Wilde's original version differed from the final published edition. This edition gives me everything I would ever want to know about Dorian Gray, including not only everything he wrote that was edited out later but extensive footnotes, illustrations, photographs and paintings of innumerable peripheral points of interest.The Picture of Dorian Gray bears similarities in my mind with other notable philosophical metaphysical fantasies of the nineteenth century--Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and one less well-known than those others but perhaps an even more direct influence on Wilde--Balzac's Le Peau de Chagrin, or The Magic Skin. In that novel, a man purchases a magic wild ass's skin that is supposed to grant his every wish. He, of course, indulges in every kind of debauchery and decadent, hedonistic activity he can imagine and discovers that the skin magically shrinks and his life span is correspondingly shortened with every wish fulfilled.All of these novels were published before Wilde wrote his philosophical fantasy and they all influenced him, along with other tales of magic portraits by Hawthorne, Poe and Gogol. Wilde used the device in a particularly unique way. The portrait is kept in a locked room in an attic as any reminder or repository of our darkest impulses would be, in a back chamber of the subconscious. In the final published version of the novel, there are connotations of homosexuality and bisexuality among the characters of the impossibly handsome Dorian, the effete artist Basil Hallward and the caustic, witty, married (and bisexual) Lord Henry Wotton. Each of these characters depict aspects of Wilde himself, with Lord Henry being the primary expounder of Wildean bon mots and witty aphorisms--\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about,\\" \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" etc.In the original, uncensored version one can easily see from our \`unsuppressed' 21st century perspective that Wilde is writing about characters that are gay or bisexual. Even though Wilde was writing between and through the lines about these matters of sexual identity, it wasn't subtle enough to not be used as evidence against him in his trial for \`gross indecency' a few years later.From the perspective of someone outside Wilde's era, the novel is a strange, nightmarish parable of sexuality, youth, immortality and moral conscience. Without the sexual components, the novel is a strange neutered fable and attempts to heterosexualize it, as in the famous 1945 film version, only produce strangely asexual men with nebulous fetishes.It is Wilde's only novel and it is a brave, noble attempt. Its weaknesses, of which Wilde was aware, stem from his experience writing for the theater. There are pages of dialogue that could have easily been lifted from a page of script in which not a line of descriptive narration appears. On the other hand, there is an entire chapter in which there is no character interaction whatsoever, no dialogue, merely an extensive, descriptive catalog of the cultural stimuli that contribute to Dorian's dissipation.Upon reflection, one wonders if Wilde would have felt the need to write this novel in a less sexually repressed era. In our current day there would be thousands of opportunities for objective purgings of the darker impulses to be manifested not only through painting but numerous other visual media. Wilde would be one of many gay authors. The novel cannot be separate from the time in which it was created, however, and in the England of 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray was an extremely daring shot in the face of Victorian social and cultural customs."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde is one hell of an elegant writer. He focuses a lot on beauty in his writing, and it really shows. The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a narcissistic man, only to fall in love with a a beautiful painting done of himself. He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better... The Importance of Being Earnest. Regardless, if not for the plot, read it for the experience in exceptional writing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This a well written unusual story with strong characters and definitely worth reading.

Interesting story as well, definitely worth the read. I recommend taking a spin through the book"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Believe it or not, I had not heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray until the movie League of Extraordinaty Gentleman came out. I know, crazy right. No, I havn't lived under a rock my whole life. I don't know how i missed it. Well, after seeing the movie I rented every movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray I could find and fell in love with the story. Then I read the book... and fell in love with the writing.Reading the first chapter is like being swathed in wonderful writing from head too toe. I felt completely surrounded by it. You can almost feel the warmth of the garden, hear the sounds of the birds and dragonflies, and smell the beauty of the flowers as you sit and listen to this conversation between Harry and Basil. The writing is an immersive experince. And Basil's description of his first encounter with Dorian and the feelings that Dorian stirs in him, sound almost... romantic. At the least there's definately a bromance going on. And we also see the first crack of Dorian's facade in this chapter, which Basil's decsription of how Dorian sometiems seems purposefully cruel to him. Isn't it interesting, the first chapter ends with Harry demanding to meet Dorian and dragging Basil into the house and we haven't even met Dorian yet ourselves.As I read the book it occured to me that it could also have been titled the Influence of Lord Henry Wotten, for Harry's (as he's called by his friends) opinions and influence are as central to the story as Dorian Gray himself and more of a factor than the portrait itself. Hardly a scene goes by that Harry, whether present or not, is not quoted as an authority. It was as if he was the potter and Dorian was the clay. Harry was fully aware of his influence, and Dorian... Dorian seemed to be racing from one sensation to another like a spoiled child.This was by far one of the best written, most interesting stories I have read. I will read it over and over and would recommend it to everyone.STATS:Nook Pages: 240Genere: ClassicRe-readability: Very High"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I was curious about this book from another book I recently read. I first picked up the audiobook narrated by Edward Petherbridge (8 disks, BBC Audio, 1994/2010) from my Library, but I couldn't stand Edward's narration. He was terrible. He spoke really fast, then slow all of a sudden. He was british but it just was NOT working. It's was like Narrator ADD, and I just HAD to put the Audiobook down.Then I took out another AudioBook, narrated by Michael Page (7 disks, Brilliance Audio, 1995), and it was absolutely AMAZING!!! Michael does a wonderful job of keeping the pace and volume easy to follow and the words were British and clear. WOW!! Great job! I highly recommend Michael Page for all audio recordings.The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)Moving on to the story....It was great! It is definitely a Gothic classic. It is a story about a boy, Dorian Gray, who is beautiful beyond belief, but naive as well. He is first discovered by an artist, Basil and becomes the artist's muse. Basil paints the most wonderful, telling portraits, when Dorian sits for him. His work like never before. The artist has a friend, Henry, who is an absolute cynic. Henry thinks he is enlightened, but he is just a miserable existentialist mess! Dorian takes to Henry and they get close, thereby pulling Dorian away from Basil the artist.Henry is full of skepticism, and a deliberate, mean, philosophy on life that he expresses through twisted words and phrases. To Dorian, this is all new and he starts to look up to Henry, emulating him, and following his words. The Good, beautiful, kind, and chaste Dorian becomes a wicked, evil, manipulative, infamous character that everyone is afraid of. His good looks remain, through a portrait made by Basil.Just as Dorian is an inspiration for Basil's blank canvas, so is Henry an inspiration for Dorian's mind as a blank canvas.That is the story.But my summary won't really help you understand the book, you just have to read it.It's very interesting, and well written. I definitely find myself getting angry at some of the things said and done. I am repelled, I feel disgusted, I feel for the minor characters. I sympathize with Basil and I hate Henry. This book got me good.It is am absolutely one-of-a-kind novel I highly recommend you read.

While you are remaining curiously young and ageless to your friends and the world at large, your aging portrait hidden from all eyes is inspected by you alone as the years go by with some trepidation as the case may be, and as time marches on. Not only is your true appearance accurately portrayed in the picture, showing your actual physical age, but revealing in great detail your personality along with your good deeds and misdemeanors etched meticulously across the painting. When friends of mine sent word recently saying \\"Expect us to look younger since you saw us a decade ago!\\", I was quick to respond \\"I fully expect you to look your appropriate age, and far superior than when you were last here\\". Although this was meant as a note of humor on my part, the thought of Wilde's masterpiece came to mind immediately and the air around me was chilly for a moment. As for Dorian Gray when he attempts to alter and amend his portrait (which might be interpreted as his soul), I shall leave new readers to discover the results of such an enterprise for themselves. A powerful and magnificent novel by one of the greatest literary figures of all times."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"My first encounter with Mr. Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray has left me feeling my soul has been put under the microscope and I have been forced to look into those secret dark places that I keep hidden from the outside world. The language and attention to detail envelopes the reader and at times seems to go on for pages with no end in sight (the section on jewels and music for instance). I love this about Oscar Wilde's writing style. How deliciously dark and disturbing this book is. I am astonished it has taken me so long to read such a brilliant book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Set in the 1800's in the streets of London, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a haunting story of corruption brought unto Dorian Gray by the Lord Henry Wotton. Oscar Wilde explores the pleasures of life, beauty, and temptation through the character of Dorian who, one day realizes that his beauty will fade after Lord Henry's comments on Dorian's youth being captured perfectly: \\"Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!\\" (Wilde 3). Dorian unknowingly offered his soul to the devil for his physical beauty in return, all his sins would be reflected in the painting.After his friend Basil, paints a masterpiece of Dorian, he tries to protect Dorian from Lord Henry's thinking and goals in life knowing where it would lead him. Although Hayward is only in the novel for a short time, his character inspired me to keep reading until the end where we can finally see how justice is served. Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil Halyward, who grudgingly introduced him to Dorian. Lord Henry is the character you love to hate; he is such a perfect character, you can sense that something is wrong with him.The young and handsome Dorian Gray is the main protagonist who made me rethink my future and how I looked at life. Although very rich and in good social standing, he chooses to hang out in the slums of London in opium dens and around the docks, symbolizing his sins and where his values lie. The way Oscar Wilde characterizes Dorian gives a vivid and accurate picture of a good boy gone bad.The principal theme of this novel is that self-worship leads to self-destruction, this is one of the main themes that pulled me into reading this book. However, another theme that goes hand-in-hand with the previous one is living a double life. Many speculate Oscar Wilde used this as one of his themes because he was inspired by the story; The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson.Although written over 120 years ago, this book is a must have and should be in every library across the world or on your shelf.

While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely.

That should be motive for reading through the entire book because one needs to get to the end in order to appreciate and understand the themes.

However, it's a classic, even if parts of the book are disappointing. Nevertheless, the beauty of the prose and the depth of Wilde's words are such that one can't fault the author for not living up to the standards he set for himself. If you're an astute reader and care to analyze the text, the points made by Wilde can change your life and why this book is a must read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \\"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \\"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a very dark tale of vanity, debauchery, drug use, murder and depression. When a nave and stunningly handsome young man unknowingly trades soul for eternal youth and beauty with a wish caught by the devils ear, he inevitably finds that physical perfection, charm and pleasures of the flesh are worth not at the cost of ones soul.Is this classic an enjoyable read?... that's a tough one to answer for such a ominous story , but I will say it's an interesting one that holds some entertaining characters and introduces many thought provoking ideas. Obviously THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is far from the best piece of literature I've ever experienced, but for me it was worth the short time it took to read, if for nothing else but for the appreciation of Oscar Wilde's famed wit."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The digital version (free) is quite good.

I saw the movie and decided to read it again and it never failed to entertain"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is my first Oscar Wilde book, and I finished the book very happy that I had read it. Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind. We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man. His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray. I feel that Lord Henry (Harry) was fully developed through his \\"musings\\" which are common throughout the book, yet the book's namesake sometimes seems to disappears into the background.The Kindle version seems to be complete (at least to someone who has never read the book before). A classic that definitely deserves to be read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde had a wonderful talent of being able to totally take the reader into whatever story he happened to be telling. In this tale of sin and tragedy, one can feel the fog wrapping around them, the cramped and dark opium dens, and the longing in the heart of Mr. Dorian Gray.If you are in the mood for a work of art that will capture your emotions and drag them along for a ride filled with 'shadows and early doom' (as Bob Dylan might say), this is the book for you. At its end it will leave you sitting staggered, feeling like you have been to the depths of a human soul and back again."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I first read The Picture of Dorian Gray in my senior year of High School. I was pretty sure I would hate it, because I've been forced to read all manner of \\"classic\\" books that were just ho hum dreary.However, Wilde did an amazing job! I just think its sad that he got such harsh reviews in his time. The book is full of mystery, and asks a question that is still valid in today's society. \\"What are you willing to sell for eternal beauty?\\"So, ask yourself that as you read this book. How far will you go for beauty?(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone.

There is a great difference.\\"The basic plot of the story is well known: thanks to mysterious/magical intervention the physical consequences of Dorian's action affect his portrait rather than his physical body. Urged on by Lord Henry Wotton (whose shocking/amusing/wicked epigrams are classic Oscar Wilde), Dorian descends into a life of ever-increasing debauchery, manipulation, hedonism, and the love of beauty above all else.Wilde brings up a number of themes in sometimes dizzying succession: the ability to \\"dominate\\" others, beauty as the supreme virtue, self-actualization as the guide to morality, yielding to temptation as a means of getting beyond temptation, physical consequences vs. consequences in general, the fascination of wickedness, etc. It is often unclear where Wilde stands on these matters since their proponent is Wotton who is \\"wicked\\" and the cause of much suffering, but speaks in the manner of Oscar Wilde. The moral ambiguity of the story lets the reader draw their own conclusions...fascinating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Part humorous fable, part mystery, part gothic suspense, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is another example of the late 1800s fascination with the soul, the senses, and science.Dorian Gray is a mere teen when the story begins, the muse of a local gifted artist, who paints Dorian's portrait in hopes of capturing his youth and beauty. Dorian's charm is also appreciated by Lord Henry, a rascally fellow, able to twist phrases and morals with his sly tongue. His winsome ways captivate Dorian, but Dorian soon finds himself pulled in the direction of a beautiful actress as well. These two loves tear Dorian in different directions, resulting in unexpected turns of events that send him down a road of sin and pleasure, though never with the rewards of true happiness. As his actions lead to even more drastic results, he finds himself fearing every shadow and questioning his own sanity.These events do not occur in a vacuum. With Dorian's sliding moral state, the portrait of his beauty begins reflecting the dark decay in his soul. Even as his own face refuses to age or show corruption, the painting becomes uglier by the day. Dorian is both fascinated and appalled by this. When, at last, he faces the consequences of his own selfish choices, he makes one final decision to try to destroy the evidence.I laughed aloud at many parts, particularly early in the book, then found the tone growing eerie and black. What a thought-provoking book! And one that kept my attention throughout. This is no glossed-over portrait of Mr. Gray, but a grisly depiction of evil--even when it masquerades in a cloak of civility.Oscar Wilde joined other writers of his day--H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Joseph Conrad--in wrestling with concepts of the soul and the senses in the light of scientific discoveries. What about the conscience? Where did theology and psychology fit in? What about free will? In the last few pages, Wilde paints his own sobering portrait of a man who has tried to live as though the soul and senses have no effect on each other.This now ranks as one of my favorite classic novels. The results of Dorian Gray's experiment serve as a mirror for all those who consider themselves holy, heathen, or hypocrite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \\"yearly re-read\\" shelf for certain."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have heard a lot about this book and, having read a few of Oscar Wilde's plays and enjoyed them, decided to give it a try. Overall is was a good book, if a bit inconsistent in pacing at times.Dorian Grey is a beautiful young man, who is corrupted by a Lord to worry about how his looks might one day fade. While a portrait of him is being painted he wishes to never grow old. Later he realizes that the portrait is changing to reflect any cruelty in his nature, yet he remains the same.Oscar Wilde is a genius at writing. The cleverness of the language he uses and the sharpness of the commentary on society is deftly done and makes the story a joy to read, most of the time. The footnotes in this version of the book help to explain some of the more subtle jokes that I would have missed without them.The book does have some flaws, especially when compared to modern literature. Wilde takes nearly half to book to set up his characters. You can tell Wilde is a playwright at heart because many of the characters wander off into multiple page long dialogues that get to be a bit too much and sometimes a bit boring. Even in the second half of the book there are times where Dorian is reading from the book he is obsessed with and it just goes on and on and on.The second half of the book is by far the strongest. Wilde stimulates the imagination by talking about Dorian's unspeakable acts but never revealing what the majority of the horrible acts are. I was a little disappointed that there isn't a lot more to the plot than what you read on the back of the book. That being said, the end of the book is remarkable and really made the book a wonder to me.Overall this is a very interesting book and worth the read. Some of the lengthy dialogues can get a bit trying to read through, but most of the book has a quick wit to it that is amusing. The ending of the book holds some wonderful surprises. I would recommend reading this, especially if you are a fan of Wilde's writing style."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) is best known today for his witticisms and classic plays such as \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Ernest.\\" However, Wilde also wrote short stories, poems and in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" a short but fascinating novel.The tale is a retelling of the Germanic legend of Doctor Faust. Young Dorian Gray is influenced by the evil Mephisto figure Henry Wotton to make a pact with the forces of evil. Gray will not age despite a career of debauchery, decadence, opium usage and murder. However, the portrait of him by the artist Basil Hallward will age as Gray descends into an inferno of crime.The Marguerite love interest from the Faust legend is young Sybil Vane. Sybil is a \\"vain\\" callow actress who portraits the great Shakesperean female roles such as Rosalind, Juliet and others every night on the stage of a seedy London theatre. Gray marries her but she commits suicide since the girl realizes he fell in love with the stage heroines and not herself. Sybil's brother the sailor Jack Vane will return from sea to seek out vengeance against Dorian Gray. He will be unsuccessful being shot during a hunting accident on a wealthy estate at which Gray is spending a weekend. Basil Hallward is the young artist who will be murdered by Gray who is driven mad by the haunting picture of himself. The novel ends in a way never to be forgotten by the reader.Oscar Wilde published this short novel in 1890. In many ways it resembles the better book \\"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" published in 1886 by Robert Louis Stevenson. That earlier work, like Dorian Gray, also looks at a character with a divided self in conflict with the norms and morality of society.Wilde's book is filled with aphorisms most of which are delivered by the cynical Henry Wotton The author is good at painting a scene so we feel as if we ourselves were in the garden and drawing room of wealthy Dorian Gray's London home or seeking an opium den in the foggy slums of fin de siecle London.The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the best selling classics in the Penguin Classics catalogue. It is a satisfying piece of fiction which will make you think on the nature of evil, the human mind and how role playing and mask wearing are part of everyday life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have read this book many times, and enjoyed it more each time that I did. I have to admit that Lord Henry's wit and wisdom was what kept me coming back to the book, not the important and intellectual issues about art, life, temptations and all the literary matters. I know there are other reviews with the literary facts and theories presented there, better than I can, so I'm not going to try.All I will say is this is a classic, worth more than 5 stars, should be read by everyone at least once in your life, first for the great writing, if its your first time reading Wilde, this is a great book to start with. You should read it slowly, because Wilde is a word smith, no words for words sake, each one polished like the gems that they are. If one could speak like he wrote one would be like a god, or have a late night talk show better than all others.Second, this is a good, clear and complete edition, so now you have no excuses, read on MacDuff, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses.

Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative.

This book, which takes place in 19th-century England, signifies the high price one young man had to pay for eternal youth.Basil Hallward, a mediocre painter, became infatuated with an extremely hansom but innocent young man, Dorian Gray. It was Dorian's picturesque beauty which inspired Basil to paint his best picture ever. Overcome by the beauty of his youth, Dorian wished that he would ramain young forever and that the portrait would deteriorate with age. However, when Dorian realised that his wish had come true and the picture took on the effects of his sins, his lifestyle signifcantly altered. Dorian went from leading a normal aristocratic life, to living a secretive life full of sin and slander.This book is proof that one can not be happy with youth and beauty alone. The suffering of Dorian Gray shows us that there is more to life than mere beauty. Dorian's life was ruined by a simple wish to be forever young. Although no one can stay young forever, this novel is a key example of why one should not simply focus on base characteristics such as youth and beauty, for these things will always fade."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This edition is slightly shorter than the others available, but it is the ONLY one whose text reflects Wilde's true intentions. Don't be fooled by the other editions claiming to be the \\"unabridged\\" or \\"complete\\" version. The material Wilde added later was meant to make the novel seem more morally edifying. It makes the novel worse. This one is WAY better -- and also way dirtier. A bunch of the more explicit stuff was cut by Wilde's editor. The editor of this ebook version has restored it all, based on Wilde's actual typescript, which he went and consulted in an archive. If you're a homophobe, get the other, more \\"moral\\" versions. If you want to read one of the great modern novels as the author wanted you to read it, get this one. You won't regret spending a couple of extra bucks."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde's strange and intriguing mind is apparent in this book, which is full of interesting concepts and bizarre happenings. Dorian Gray, a young man who is obsessed with his own good looks, befriends an English Lord and a struggling painter. After Basil, the painter, finishes Dorian's portrait, they are stunned by its magnificence and how lifelike it appears. Seeing this, Dorian is angered when he realizes that the portrait will live forever and retain its beauty while he himself is left to age. Dorian decides to trade his soul for everlasting youth, and to always retain his beauty, just like the portrait.Since Dorian believes himself to be immortal, he dabbles into various sinful acts. He carelessly pursues a relationship with Sibyl Vane, an actress, constantly letting her down and breaking her heart. Dorian is involved in several mysterious deaths, and he even explores the London underground opium scene. Even though Dorian does all of these things, somehow he remains young, to the surprise of his peers. In the end, however, Dorian receives the punishment he deserves through a series of bizarre events. The &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; theme is strongly emphasized in the conclusion of the novel, which serves as a fitting end for Dorian's struggle with sin.This classic literary work is frequently exciting, but can sometimes delve into the monotony of 19th century British affairs (which may be a little tedious.) All in all, the novel is a wonderful concept which is given life by the genius of Oscar Wilde. It is a perfect research topic as well because it contains many themes which can be applied to anything from English rhetoric to the Original Sin. I myself wrote a term paper on the book and it was very easy to express my ideas because Wilde is so straight forward in his literary agendas.

I am glad that I bought it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is a thought-provoking novel that vacillates between ambling, seemingly directionless conversation and a riveting narrative thread that eventually bubbles up to the surface with the intensity of a volcanic eruption. The Picture of Dorian Gray, though not much more than a century old, has already been deemed a \\"classic\\" by literature-lovers, and after reading the book, I can understand its status. Wilde's command of the English language is almost unparalleled in recent literature.Warning - Spoilers FollowHere's the gist of the book. Dorian Gray is a young man whose physical appearance is handsome and innocent. An aspiring artist paints a beautiful portrait of Dorian. Dorian wishes that he always look like his youthful appearance in the portrait. The wish comes true. Dorian remains the same - youthful and charming, but the portrait begins to transform itself into the image of his soul.When Dorian embraces a life of hedonism, he uses his good looks and charm to obtain whatever he desires in life. His insensitivity drives a friend to suicide. The evil desires of his heart eventually cause him to murder a friend in cold blood. Over a period of twenty years, Dorian becomes a monster on the inside (reflected by the portrait of his soul) even as he remains youthful and innocent on the outside.Oscar Wilde's homosexuality is no secret, and the reader can easily discern certain homosexual overtones in the book (especially at the beginning). Perhaps Wilde's subtle innuendoes of homosexuality have made his works so appealing to lovers of literature who tend to sympathize and approve of homosexual behavior.Upon reading Dorian Gray, however, I could not help but notice how the lifestyle of hedonism is so implicitly condemned by the narrative's outcome. If Dorian's hedonism includes sexual relationships with men as well as with women (and Wilde does hint at this), then homosexuality comes under the same umbrella as the rest of Dorian's sinful passions. One can hardly characterize The Picture of Dorian Gray as a pro-homosexual book.Readers of this blog will find the picture of depravity in Dorian Gray to be intriguing. Throughout the story, Dorian, even in his hedonism, acts in a manner that forces the reader to desire justice and redemption. The book's end emphasizes the need for punishment and retribution - pointing at death as the wages of sin.What does the life of unbridled hedonism look like? What does it do to the soul? What happens to the human being who seeks to fulfill his every passion and desire? How does sin affect us physically? Do we age because we sin? These and more are the questions that Oscar Wilde raises in The Picture of Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams.

Young Dorian Gray promised his soul in exchange for the favor of his body never aging. Instead, a portrait of him grows older in his place. An eerie idea, indeed.While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others.

I didn't really intend on reading it, but after fumbling through the first chapter, I was intrigued and soon thereafter was captivated by it. This book has mixed themes that are gothic horror at one moment, amoral and corrupt the next, followed by social political statement. I have not read a book before that compares with this one and is indeed one of the best that I have read. This book is full of quotes and one liners that are striking, thought provoking, and even horrifying to the reader. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great book to read and discuss with a friend or a book club."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I'm a sophomore in high school and usually I don't go for these older, classic books. Usually they bore me so much I can barely finish them. However, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was an exception to this rule. Though the language was a bit more intricate than is commonly found in the books of today (at least the ones I like to read), I found it to be more elegant and eloquent than tiresome and confusing.This book, with all of its discussion of morals, evil, and purity really is a window into late 1800s of England. Despite this, I found the book to actually be interesting. The real appeal this book held for me was its wonderfully potent imagery and mildly creepy, definitely surreal theme. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is also a very short book, which I thought was pretty cool because I don't have a very long attention span concerning books. In spite of how today's people are probably a great deal more jaded concerning morals, or rather the lack thereof, than the people of Oscar Wilde's time, a lot of this book was fascinating in an almost perverted way. That aspect is offset by the theme of good vs. evil, however. The only faults I found with this book were minor details concerning the definitions of good and evil, issues which I think this book was meant to rise anyway.If you're a parent or someone looking to buy a classic book for a friend or relative in high school, I think this would be a pretty good choice, assuming they like books. The vocabulary seemed fairly advanced to me, but they ought to be able to handle it. The conflict between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in this book is engaging, and the nature of the book is such that the reader has difficulty simply viewing matters in black and white. This makes the book deeper and more interesting to read. The transformations that occur in this book are slightly haunting, and at the end of this twisting tale of corruption and beauty lies a powerful, sudden, and very awesome ending. I really think that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"What can capture the soul of a man?Is there a devil's deal to be made at the crossroad?Dorian Gray shows that great physical beauty can be a lie.

The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book surprised me with its Gothic horror and surprising plot twists toward the end. This novel, for all its horrible philosophy on life, captures in a poignant way a lost person's search for fulfillment. Despite his indulgent quest for all kinds of pleasure, Dorian is still unfulfilled and in one of the most captivating passages of the book turns to opium to forget life. His descent into the opium den is characterized as a descent into hell, a personal hell which he has brought himself to and in which everyone sees through him and is against him.Though I wasn't a big fan at the beginning, as the book progressed I think it may have become one of the most memorable books I've read. The theme of the book is sin - its putrefying effect both on the sinner and those around him. One of the best moments of the book and one that sticks vividly in my mind is towards the end, when Dorian, sick of seeing his portrait so mangled and distorted by the sins he has already committed, does a \\"good deed\\" in order to try to start to clean it up. He races up the stairs, unlocks the secret room where his portrait is hidden, throws back the cover, and is faced with the same ugliness that had been there before. Then he is faced with a horrible realization of truth: because he had done the \\"good deed\\" out of motivation of making his own portrait/soul look better, he hadn't done a \\"good deed\\" at all and was now so deep in his depravity that even what he calls love has been warped into an all-encompassing egotism.Dorian's egotism gets progressively deeper. throughout the book. As Lord Henry says, It begins as innocent narcissism, but as it grows it begins to shunt blame for the sin of others and even motivates the good he does at the end of the book. Rather than his heavy sins bothering Dorian, \\"it was the living death of his own soul that troubled him\\" (226). His breakup with the young country girl was motivated more out of a desire to cleanse his portrait from its grime than any love for her, \\"for in hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self\\" (228). Being able to view his sin on the portrait in a sense made it more difficult to be selfless - \\"nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all\\" (106) - and Dorian recognized this difficulty.The idea of pleasure in Dorian Gray is portrayed as a goal to pursue but never reach. \\"A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied\\" (84). Despite Dorian's pursuit of pleasure (and pleasure of the most exquisite kind) he ends us dissatisfied and empty, jaded to the idea of the fullness of life. He is encouraged on by the influence of Lord Henry, who gives advice such as: \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it,\\" (21) and \\"sin is the only real color-element left in modern life\\" (31). Dorian is quickly influenced by Lord Henry's philosophy, aping to everyone else Lord Henry's views and words and acting out on them by plunging into the pits of hedonism.The portrait itself is a mirror of Dorian's soul. It was a \\"visible emblem of conscience\\" (96). As Lord Henry's pleasure seeking philosophy takes hold in Dorian's mind, he sees that \\"eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins - he was to have all of these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame; that was all\\" (109). However, in with a horrible fascination, Dorian \\"grew more and more enamored of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul\\" (131) for \\"what the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat away its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive\\" (122). Even though \\"the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away\\" (161) the portrait held on to its life of decay, just as Dorian held on to pleasure, refusing to be cleansed and beautiful again until Dorian's death.Quotes:\\"She was free in her prison of passion\\" (65).\\"She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy\\" (49).\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\\" (4).\\"Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others.

As curiosity got the best of me, I finally looked this person up on the Internet. Finding that Dorian Gray was the main character of a most elaborate and interesting tale, enthralled me. Therefore, I set out to read this novel. From the preface alone, I was spellbound and couldn't put the book down.Lord Henry, with his quips and one-liners literally made me think twice. His tranquil ability to convince anyone of anything, sans Basil Hallward, amazed me. Although, I did find a few opinions of Lord Henry to ring true, for the most part I found myself thinking: \\"He's absolutely correct. Oh, wait! That's completely immoral and self-indulgent!\\" Needless to say, Lord Henry was my favorite character in the book.This book truly puts one's own life into perspective. It makes one think, and re-think of the importance of being true to only oneself without influence of others. As Lord Henry said it best: \\"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development.

It is over one hundred years old, but has aged gracefully and is still easily understood and as relevant to matters of life now as it was when it was first published. Though there have been many imitations of it and many film depictions of it, none of them do justice to the real thing. This timeless classic follows the development of a teenager, Dorian Gray, into manhood as the people that he calls his friends corrupt his soul. This is symbolized in a portrait that Gray hides, which was painted by the man who was perhaps his only good-hearted friend, Basil, who later met his untimely demise. Along with the exceptional plot and surprising twist at the end comes the message that Oscar Wilde cunningly imparts to the reader: One must be master of oneself because outside influences often disfigure one down to the deepest part of their soul. On top of all this, the book is also simply well written and entertaining. It is enjoyable because Wilde uses his mastery of everything from satire to suspense to convey his message and an extraordinarily compelling plot to the reader. You should read this book if you are looking for new knowledge, literature with a deep message, or simply a good time. This edition is especially helpful because it has a glossary for the meanings of some older words and supplementary reading written by Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde is a witty and brilliant writer, and his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a treasure. One of it's best aspects is something another reviewer mislabeled as a flaw, that every viewpoint presented by Wilde is contradicted in another part of the book. This is absolutely brilliant. By building an entire book out of contradictions, the reader can take absolutely any message they want from the book, or no message at all. It meet Wilde's goal (if indeed anything Wilde said can be taken seriously - remember that the paradoxical Henry Wotton is basically a fictional version of Wilde) of \\"art for art's sake,\\" but it can just as easily be a morality tale for anyone that wants one. Henry Wotton can either be the worst kind of villain or a quite harmless and likeable chap who a dumb kid took too seriously.So read this book for it's witty and memorable dialogue, mostly from Henry Wotton. Read it for the shocking (at least at the time) tale of Dorian Gray. Read it for the myriad meanings you can take from it. Just don't skip it because it doesn't have one, consistent message. Anyone can write a message. It takes a genius to write a collection of messages that perfectly balance and disprove one another."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Of all the fears that creep into a man's heart,the most disturbing is the fear of one's own self. A man may evade the whole world but can't deny his conscience and as William Shakespeare remarks somewhere,\\"Conscience doth make coward of us all\\". One may accomlish painting goodliness on one's visage but would never be able to blend his soul in a similar fashion. The whispers of the soul about one's past sins and misdeeds keep lingering in one's heart.And that's precisely the theme of Oscar Wilde's only novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\". It is a telling tale about a stunningly handsome,almost beautiful,man's bizzare idiosyncracy of authoring his own tragic doom,about how a youth so splendidly bestowed with beauty,wealth,royalty and women could get sucked in by the myriad forces that he himself gave rise to,about a man's confused,complex frame of mind.Dorian Gray is that ultimate effigy of an ideal youth gifted with all arts and talents. He's the instinctive and eternal source of inspiration,\\"simply a motive in art\\" to his friend,artist Basil Hallward. The backdrop is the gentry and the royalty class of London during the late 19th. century and the Irish writer's genius lies in exploiting this landscape to picture in words and absolutely ethereal imageries man's obscure desires. Dorian becomes obsessed with his portrait traced by Basil and in the general flow of the tyde,conceives an unimaginable notion:to remain forever young whilst the portrait may wither! Indeed such a wish lurks deep inside everyone and so does the realisation o its fruitlessness. But for once,at least in fiction,the fantasy is translated into truth,a dark,troublesome truth.Evey novel,and for that matter every incident,requires a certain spark to unfold a series of actions to conglomerate into a rare item called literature. That urge in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is impelled by Lord Henry Wotton, a cynical and witty man just ten years older than Dorian,whose eloquent gush of words \\"touched some secret chord\\" in Dorian's heart and sets it \\"vibrating and throbbing to curious impulses\\". The philosophies and crisp remarks by Lord Wotton about life in general and youth in particular push the youth onto his demise.Supernaturally Doian Gray's desire to remain young for good does manufacture itself into a fascinating reality but there's nothing called free lunch under the sun. Commencing from the time when Dorian turns an implicit murderer of his lover Sibyl Vane through the constant denudation of principles and character in the subsequent fourty or so years culminating in him murdering his friend Basil,Dorian stays protected under the shade of evergreen youth whilst his portrait consistently deteriorates and ages---it even turns a mirror of Dorian's own soul with dark contours signifying the crimes committed by him lining its entire figure and in his attempt to relieve himself of the picture,and with it his hideous sins,the eponymous potagonist brings about his own end.The theme of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is singled out to be about how we get disturbed by our own souls but there're other ideas webbed in as well. That the author Oscar Wilde had an inclination towards gay culture is of course a subtle truth and this is ever so slightly pictured in Basil Hallward's unassuming and suspicious admiration of Dorian. The general occurrences in the gentry society and invokation to women's feelings too are colossaly and humourously penned down superadded by a streak of confusing and often conflicting ideas of life that never falter.There was never really a Faust who sold his soul to the Devil but it was actually Goethe's authorical magic that made it seem so. There was never really a Dorian Gray who exchanged peace for youth but it's actually Oscar Wilde's staunch belief that \\"it is the spectator,and not life,that art really mirrors\\" that materialiases into a concrete portrayal of life in fiction. After reading Emile Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\",we rue that the authoress never composed any other novel and similarly after imbibing the charisma of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\",which just remains on the margins of a psychological insight into a man's nature,we regret that we can't lay our hands on another classic by this wonderful,wonderful writer."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Wilde's only novel contains some of the greatest dialogue of any literature written in the english language. There are few books that could be considered more quotable, and even fewer that could be considered more insightful. The novel is enjoyable even upon a cursory reading, but its splendor is revealed only when it is studied. Wilde reveals so much of himself in his art, and through reading of Wilde's biographies, plays, and the literature that inspired him, the reader becomes intimate with Oscar, and is able to understand him more throughly than most authors would allow from a study of their work. This is a piece I have truly enjoyed, and continues to be one of the premier pieces of English literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray.

Through this novel Mr. Wilde presents many characteristics of the human heart and mind. It hits hard telling the truth of the way in which people really are. Mr. Wilde in his novel asks the question how far would one go to obtain beauty and youth forever to please society? And in doing so presents the desires of most humans to remain young forever and the lengths in which they might go to obtain it. This novel illustrates the obession society has with the outward appearance rather than the inward and is shown in the novel by the Dorian Gray being accepted into the 'circle' despite the 'rumors' that he is a bad man. Through Dorian Gray and Lord Henry Mr. Wilde also illustrates the influence of people over people. Resulting in the destruction of character.I enjoyed the book Dorian Gray because of the fact that it does tell the truth and quite often people don't like to hear the truth, but Oscar Wilde went against what society would view as good and did and wrote what he believed, which makes an wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I decided to be the FIRST to review this one here. Haha, go me.Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Wilde gives a new definition to the good. Dorian Gray's problem, despite the fact all his sin is transmited to a painting, art reminds him of the good, and this reminding is enough to be in discord with himself. I don't feel, as some suggest, that Dorian regreted his wish of eternal youth and beauty, but the images of the painting, art itself, drove him crazy - his self doubt. The art showed his inauthentic life, how his feelings and actions were not in harmony. In De Profundis Wilde talks about Jesus' criticism of the Pharasee for studying, but not living what they know - they have no feeling for life, they are souless driviling intellects. Dorian\`s cognizance of his own inauthentic soulless profanatory abject self did him in, he died killing the reminder of his splintered self, and of the frustrations of being an aesthetically induced schizopherenic. Wotton's warning was that conscience makes egoists of us all. Is it the dualistic nature of conscience that drives Dorian to kill himself, not regret? In the end he desires to do good, but is it? Can he? Is he? Wilde, the master of Paradox, leaves some poignant questions, if not eschatological questions, availab.le to be thought upon. Wilde is highlighting the importance of art as truth and art as a mirror, but in the end who is the mirror? Art makes reality, as far as reality is a truth anyway, a perception of truth and reality that is more meaningful than these nonexistant abstracts. But then there is sin to ponder on, is it real? Wilde would say so."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"After reading Dorian Gray, it took numerous books to accept that not all authors can have the genius and prose gifted to Wilde.

He wishes that he--not the painting--will remain forever young and beautiful, while the painting ages and decays. Dorian's wish comes true and it is the painting that not only shows his age, but also all his sins. Oscar Wilde crafted not only a brilliant horror novel, but also a treatise on art and reality. Despite the claims of Lord Henry, art does reveal the truths of life. The painting reveals the true soul of Dorian Gray. When Dorian's beloved actress discovers true love (not the dramatic imitation), she is no longer able to participate in the elevated dramas on the stage. Then she loses Dorian's love. A book is what fully corrupts Dorian and causes him to live a life of sin. This is a story of the inability to bring truth and art together. This is one of the greatest books to do the often over-used theme of appearance vs. reality.

I never did, but thought I would give it a try as I really enjoy dry British wit and intelligent prose. Beyond that, I wasn't sure what else I was expecting, but for my tastes, I didn't end up entirely satisfied.The opening 10 or 20 pages insinuated themselves into my imagination and I felt that I would be entertained by the main characters throughout the rest of the novel. The detailed descriptions of the lovely country setting and extravagant flowers gives one an impression of decadence and a high society jadedness that I somehow expected from Oscar Wilde, having read none of his previous work. Unfortunately, the remainder of the novel didn't hold as much pleasure for me.Dorian Grey is a relatively uninteresting central character who is but a blank canvas for Lord Henry to experiment upon; Dorian's own thoughts and musings are not so compelling in and of themselves and yet we are treated to quite a few pages of them throughout. Lord Henry himself is an interesting character whose mean-spiritedness, which approaches evil in some instances, is obscured by his verbose bantering on half-baked, jaundiced observations on Victorian life. These also consume considerable paper stock, and as witty as his musings start out (his thoughts on marriage were particularly humorous to me), they start to run together and become somewhat of a misshapen lump through which I felt I was slogging at times.Anyway, the story is relatively well known to most at this point, regardless of whether you have read the book in question or not. It progresses more or less as one might assume, which is not entirely a bad thing (I would not classify this tale as a mystery or as a horror novel, a genre to which I see it is sometimes curiously attributed). Oscar Wilde is definitely saying something here, and there seem to be many elements of allegory contained within the story. I have read that he saw parts of himself within all three of the main characters, and they do seem to represent different facets of a single personality. Unfortunately these same characters are hamstrung by this very fact, as they each seem only part of a personality, part of a character, and not well rounded or believable in their motivations or actions.This is the first Oscar Wilde I have attempted to read, and I won't say it is my last, but there are classics of English literature which are as well written, more engrossing, and, in the end, more memorable, at least to this reader (\\"Silas Marner\\" comes to mind as a fine book I only just recently read for the first time as well).So, overall, about 3 stars from me. In my opinion it poses some interesting questions, sparkles in a few spots, and held my attention for a few hours, but it's not something I would return to or recommend for pleasurable reading.As a side note, I am somewhat surprised by the criticisms of the homoerotic nature of the relationships portrayed within the novel. Wilde portrayed the passionate nature of what amounts to a love triangle in a very effective (if slightly florid) way, and, as has been noted before, the relationships between the men seem more genuine and believable than those involving the fairer sex. Maybe this type of undertone would be out of place in a Hemingway novel but good grief it's Oscar Wilde! Scratch beneath the surface and read about where this man was coming from and the times in which he lived and worked."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I read this book(translated to the portuguese), here in Brazil about twenty years ago.Being writen in XIX century, this novel remains a classic book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Wilde's literary genious is evident throughout.

So beautiful, in fact, that only the best artists can capture his charisma and perfection in a painting. When Dorian looks into the eyes of a portrait of himself, he is overcome with jealousy.

His only novel, Oscar Wilde's satire of the upper class in late 19th century Britain mocks their vapid lifestyle, while at times glorying in it, though the story arc comes from the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe. The combination is both delicious and shocking. \\"Picture\\" is also a veritable gold mine, or should I say minefield, of ironic aphorisms, most of them emanating from the mind and mouth of Gray's friend and mentor Sir Henry Wooten, who is kind of like Michael Scott of \\"The Office\\", except with a functioning brain.Brilliantly written, entertaining and thought provoking, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" stands highly recommended to readers young and old. It's sad that Wilde lived at a time when homosexuals were persecuted, in his case prosecuted, even moreso than they are now. A giant of 19th century literature could have contributed well into the 20th century, but died penniless, estranged from his birthplace in Ireland, and home in England, at the age of 46 in the year 1900."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a quick, easy and enjoyable read. I knew the very basic premise of the story from watching the 2003 movie, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I also had a lot of wrong preconceived notions because of the the movie.The Picture of Dorian Gray was less supernatural in nature than I expected. Other than not aging and having the picture age for him, Dorian was a regular guy. When given the opportunity to live his life without his behavior marring his beauty, he chose debauchery. I found myself thinking, who wouldn't? He tried to experience everything the world has to offer (a noble pursuit) and finds that life can become pointless without boundaries.Dorian's friend, Harry, is the absolute shining star of this novel. He counsels Dorian in the way of the world, full of his own theories and cynical viewpoints. He's humorous and more often than not, what he says makes a lot of sense.The one thing I disliked about The Picture of Dorian Gray was that it seemed like the most interesting pieces of the story were missing. Oscar Wilde was very vague about exactly why Dorian actually did in the years he spent corrupting his soul. People who were once his friends couldn't stand to be in the same room as him and no explanation was given. Perhaps in 1890, when the book was published, saying that he did vile, cruel, disgusting things was enough. Now, 120 years later, I need more. I need to know and it still bugs me that I don't know what Wilde was alluding to."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Beautiful and lyrical told with biting wit.

I AM ALSO A HUGE BEN BARNES FAN"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Most people never truly contemplate the real meaning of beauty. It has an alluring quality that cannot be fully understood, even in an abstract form. One of English author Oscar Wilde's motivations was to write a work that praises beauty as an art but simultaneously reveals its darker nature. That is what I believe he attempts to accomplish in his sole novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The work is set in late 19th century London at a time when the cultural excesses of the Victorian era reached their zenith. Infused with elements of Gothic horror, it is a work of Symbolist prose, the Symbolists being a group of literary luminaries who sought to glorify beauty and aesthetic decadence almost as a kind of spiritualism. Wilde is no doubt part of this new endeavor to perceive beauty in an innovative fashion, and he objectively promotes a rather original world outlook through the dynamic characters he creates.The Picture of Dorian Gray is built upon an interesting premise. A local artist named Basil Hallward is fully enamored by the subject of his latest portrait, the eponymous Dorian Gray. Basil, like almost everyone else, is impressed by Dorian's pulchritude and handsome features. As Dorian indulges Basil by sitting for a portrait, another one of Basil's friends, a dignified aristocrat named Lord Henry Wotton, enters and, he too, takes a tremendous liking for the vigorous youth. Later, Dorian holds a discussion with Henry about senility and Wotton reveals to him his hedonistic worldview: \\"To me, beauty is the wonder of wonder. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world lies in the visible, not the invisible. [...] A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do.\\" With this in mind, Dorian upholds a new creed by swearing that youth is the only noble quality worth possessing; he would rather have Basil's new portrait of him age in exchange for remaining eternally young. Consequently, Dorian proceeds to engage in every sort of pleasurable vice possible, while the picture of himself hanging in his room slowly decays. The plot proceeding from this point forward holds up well, though the climatic conclusion may seem clich&eacute; in light of the Gothic horror stories that many readers are acquainted with.Wilde does a splendid job of displaying a tone of biting sarcasm. His clever use of wit and double entendre to reveal introspective truths with all the effort he can muster is one of his valiant triumphs. Dorian's lust for sensual pleasure reveals the author's taste as an aesthete and suggests another aspect of the novel's motifs, that of duplicity. Dorian leads a double life by interacting with aristocratic high society during the day and indulging his senses at night. This dualism of Dorian's character underscores the dramatic complexity of his inner struggles.Dorian Gray can be seen as a man willing to exchange his very soul for what he craves. He candidly discards his reputation and eventually risks his life for his lofty desires, which is reminiscent of the Faust legend. Wilde's protagonist is not very remorseful for his debauchery and is constantly being manipulated by his friend and confidant, Henry Wotton. Ultimately, Dorian is a tragic hero participating in an Aristotelian tragedy where he is subtly cognizant of his impending doom and experiences multiple catastrophes. His hamartia proves to be his downfall.While every work of fiction has its shortcomings, Dorian Gray's are minimal. The author exhibits a delightful candor in his narration and characterization, and his nuanced writing style is replete with metaphorical and psychological analyses of flawed individuals.

But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better.

So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Every so often one has the good fortune of discovering an author whose work reaffirms all that is appreciable in literature by exemplifying its worst. Oscar Wilde, after reading whose novel and two fairy tales, quickly obviates any further need or desire to be further acquainted. The knowledge found on the cover of my paperback edition, between the obligatory sickly hagiography that usually betrays the expectation it inspires, that The Picture of Dorian Gray was apparently the author's only fruitful attempt at a \`full-length' novel, leaves one snickering ante facto in not entirely facetious gratitude. Wilde was seemingly more at home in the realm of fairy tales, and this 217-page full-length novel not by itself finding ground to fill the space between the covers, finds itself supported by three samples of that genre.One might be forgiven for assuming that the novel portends to explore an emotional or philosophical metaphor of a relationship between the eponymous painting and its subject, but the implied exploration is unfortunately mostly specious. The metaphor, to be sure, is there, but it is a mere seed that never takes root or grows out of its entirely obvious and superficial form, and the story thus fails to fulfil its promise.Furthermore, the filling leaves one with a bad aftertaste. None of the three characters have any endearing features to redeem themselves for the gall they otherwise freely spew. \`Lord Henry' in particular has no characterizing dimension other than denigration of everything else in the form of dull pseudowitticisms, from which comparison we take it the aristocrat was intended to benefit. We learn his contempt of clergy (bishops \\"don't think\\"), stockbrokers (\\"even a stock-broker can gain a reputation for being civilized\\"), dowagers (they are \\"overdressed\\"), academicians (tedious), the middle class (not modern), Americans, marriage, women, and Jews (I don't believe any mention of the religion ever lacks the adjective \\"fat\\"). The misogyny in particular is so pungent and the female characters so weak that the protagonists cannot otherwise but treat them with the contempt that they do. If indeed \\"women are decorative\\" it is merely because the men do not have a vision that sees beyond superficialities. This is no parody of aristocratic vanity (in the style of Thackeray, for instance) so one quickly finds oneself wishing for one of these maligned targets of Lord Henry's dull wit to return the favor with a dull but well-deserved kick in the [rump].When the characters are not railing against the world, they are theorizing about it, but the obvious inconsistencies and utter inanity of the theories make them impossible to consider seriously. To give an example, and not have one character take the brunt of all the book's failings, the artist Basil Hallward states first (speaking of his own work) that \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter,\\" but six pages later that \\"an artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.\\" A story dealing ostentatiously with a profound relationship between ars and artis, in which the artist doesn't remember from one moment to the next whether or not he put feeling in his art, reveals that its author has lost control of his subject. Othertimes the theories are merely silly and quite impossible to take at face value. What to make, for example, of the idea that \\"beauty is a form of genius- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation,\\" or that \\"people say sometimes that beauty is superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.\\" This is just tripe without considerable meaning.Within this theorizing there are faint reverberations reaching toward some oblique philosophy of hedonism, but never quite advancing beyond a mere slogan. Without actually doing the work of fully expounding the philosophy, or having the courage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot. One of the adjunct characters, Jim, whose sister Sibyl later commits suicide over the protagonist, finds out he is a bastard son, his mother was orphaned, and forgives her (what for, we are left to guess), all within the space of three quarter page. Dorian's swings of attitude toward Sybil from ignorance through love through despisement through sorrow to self-forgiveness are so extreme and irrational that they make a pastiche of emotion. Jim's completely unfounded anger toward Dorian is so unrealistically sudden and out of proportion that it is obvious how Jim's fears will be realized and that there will be a confrontation. There is no mystery, less a sense of a world to discover than of being dragged along by an uninterested parent. The rhetorical questions Dorian asks in his histrionic despair are answered immediately, it is for me simply to get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on.Even more fundamentally, the characters are shallow, undeveloped, and quite stereotypical, the dialog stilted and unrealistic- altogether a surprisingly unsophisticated style, especially in the light of the beautiful writing of his contemporaries. Dialog has a tendency to spin off into unrelated tangents that are unceremoniously and artificially \`snapped back' to the main thread. Henry's inability to speak in any other form than witless aphorism is at first merely unfunny, then quickly boring, later irritating, and finally not bearing further reading. And this is unfortunately barely the only character development in the story at all, the only other characters having little strength of will of their own to resist mimicking this trite ascerbicism.If the book has revealed anything at all, it is not a deeper analysis of art or hedonism, but a much more animal homoeroticism. Dorian Gray is much more than anything else a love story with the trimmings (envy and a murder-suicide), and all the less respectful because it dares not speak its name. Female emotions are contemptible, but the same expressions of liking (Wilde can never bring himself to call it more), admiration of beauty, and extreme flattery by men towards other men, are accepted naturally and not subject to this contempt."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Well, I had to read this book for a school assignment. I'm not really sure what I expected from this book, but I know I didn't get it. This book shows the true demoralization of our society- past and present. The absloute worst part of the book (about 90% of it) was the long, monotonous, verbose speeches that consisted of the characters'ideals that were just &quot;off the mark&quot; by a little. I would not suggest reading this book, partly because of the boring content, but mostly because of the fact that I still haven't found a plot."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \\"preaches\\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful. This is not a book that I would recommend to other people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Please refer to page 212 of the Baronet Books version of The Picture of Dorian Gray.

No swordfights, no prince and princess, no happy ending. Dorian Gray is a very dark work with drug use, murder, and depression. One of the main themes is homosexuality. It shocked and outraged the public when it was first realeased. It is scary. It scared me . Frankly, I doubt very much that many children would appreciate this book. Colleges study this book in literature classes. That's not to say no child would not get stuff from this book, but the few children that could would probably be just fine with the original work. Folks, stick to Treasure Island and White Fang for the kids. And if you want something kinda spooky, try Phantom of the Opera.

A friend of Dorian Gray, Basil Hayward, paints a picture of Dorian which the painting's subject falls in love with. Dorian wishes that he could remain as beautiful as the picture and that the picture may take on the effects of human aging in his stead. In Wilde's creative twist, Dorian's wish comes true, although this only becomes evident to him as his life becomes increasingly chaotic. As the novel progresses, Dorian, in obsessive love with himself, fights to keep his sanity as the burden of his stress, sins, and guilt, are transfered to the picture which increasingly haunts him.Wilde's writing is colorful and his characters' emotions realistic. This novel is a cutting, yet accurate, observation of human nature in general, especially in our modern, self-glorifying societies. Wilde makes the perfect critique of our selfishness and vanity when Dorian Gray says: \\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.\\" For many in our TV and Hollywood crazed world, this statement is not troublesome but rather, a personal mantra."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I had really high expectations for this novel, which were not fulfilled. The novel consists of mostly &quot;mindless&quot; dialogue and the true story does not really occur until the book is half over. then the story picks up pace until Dorian's descriptions of a book (totally unrelated to the rest of the novel) drag on. Once that portion of the book concludes, the end briskly approaches. Overall, I think I was expecting a more emotional response to this, which never occured."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This story about a man whose wish for eternal youth comes true through a portrait of himself delves into numerous philosophical nether regions. Set in upscale 19th century London, The Picture of Dorian Gray deals with such topics as truth, death, and most especially beauty.Dorian Gray's portrait ages while he remains his youthful self. Gray uses this to his advantage (let's be honest, who wouldn't?). Gray breaks hearts, corrupts others, and avails himself of numerous vices...most notably opium. Gray also takes advantage of his youth by learning new things...music and gemology come to mind. But Gray's self-enhancement does not make up for the copious sins he commits, both large and small...and even though his face does not bely his crimes, the portrait's face does.Wilde's play on eternal youth was almost certainly novel for the time. These days the concept has been played out time again. But I do not begrudge Wilde for this...in his time, he was an innovator.Four major things irked me about this book:First, the prose is overly flowery. I don't read many books written in the 19th century...maybe most of the books were written like this. Second, Wilde seems to use this book as a platform to give us his take on philosophical issues large and small. True, most good works of fiction are a reflection of the society in which the author lives, but Wilde is NOT subtle about giving us numerous opinions on art, love, life, beauty, etc. I think he could have been a bit more subtle doing this. Third most of characters seemed overly naive. Granted, this story is supposed to be set in a time and place where the rich did not concern themselves with trivial matters. Nonetheless...so much was going on under the characters' noses! Even, Henry Wotton -- Gray's longtime friend -- seems to come down with a bout of extreme naivete toward the end of the book. Somehow, this made the characters seem shallower than they otherwise might have been. And my final gripe kind of ties in with the characters' overall naivete. From the time that Dorian Gray is granted eternal youth by whatever powers that be, to the end of the book, nearly two decades elapse. There is only one, very minor, mention of Gray's youthful looks toward the end of the book. Didn't anyone notice that this guy has, supposedly, aged nearly twenty years and yet still appears as youthful as ever? Come on, even these days with plastic surgery and $100+ cosmetic cream, a 40 year old doesn't look half his age. Why did only Gray's closest friend only offhandedly mention this toward the end of the book? Surely someone else must have noticed?Wilde's concept had a lot of potential, and it certainly does make one ponder life's intangible mysteries, but Wilde spent to much time proselytizing his 19th century philosophy for this book to really stand out. This book is only recommended to those who enjoy Wilde's other works."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I do not know words to describe the way I feel about this book. The first time, with the exception of one chapter, I could not put it down. I have been hooked on Oscar Wilde since. I researched the period and wrote a term paper on this book alone, and after that, when I still was not satisfied, bought his complete works, a book of quotations, and a book about his plays. I only wish by byeing these books I could understand and be swallowed into the beauty of his wisdom. I can sometimes be an obsessive person, and I suppose this is how my review sounds at this point, but don't let your opinion of me detract you from interest in this book.It's worth giving a try...you may become hooked too (by the way for Wilde fans..the movie WILDE is a great window into his life). This book is written with beauty and the words flow like poetry...warning though...people with closed minds towards homosexuality should think of choosing a different book. One of the most descriptive and hiddenly believable parts of this book is the secret feelings Lord Henry has for Dorean. I don't want to misinterpret the book, but i believe Lord Henry's feelings to be more than fatherly...great excelent story!! my favorite book!! what more can be said???-SArah"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is just a warning to prospective kindle customers - the kindle version of this book is not \\"lavishly illustrated\\" which is not so surprising in a digital edition. But what was more surprising to me, Nicholas Frankel's extensive notes, which run alongside the text and which exceed the actual length of the novel itself, are not included. In fact, both the paperback and kindle editions are 'reader's editions'. Yes, there are two rich scholarly introductions, replete with notes, and some three pages of notes to the actual text (which are also included in the hardback) , but the \\"annotations\\" which have excited so much comment from reviewers are in fact missing from the kindle edition. There was no warning from Amazon that the kindle edition omits the textual notes that run side by side with the text in the hardback.

So that was very nice.In fact Stonewall Riot Press has a complete, uncensored \\"reader's\\" edition on Amazon for 9.19.

I am in LOVE with this story. The way Wilde writes is fabulous- I am an increasingly voracious reader of the classics, and Wilde's writing style is exactly what I like. It is written in the eloquent verbage of the time, but not so much so that I find it stifling and hard to get through ( I am currently reading an Emily Bronte, and am having this problem). The story itself is charming and devious, with an ending that you expect and yet are shocked by.

Like a lot of free public domain ebooks, this one isn't exactly user-friendly. The lack of a title page doesn't bother me, but this book is also missing a table of contents. If you're reading this for a class or a reading group, that missing table of contents might be a deal breaker. Additionally, while you can always refer to line numbers, this book lacks pagination. Again: I realize this isn't something that's going to bother everyone, but if you need to refer to page numbers in an essay, you might be in trouble if you use this copy.If you're like me and you're interested in reading this book just for fun, page numbers and a table of contents probably don't matter much to you. However, I think everyone can agree that things like page breaks and proper spacing between chapters vastly improve one's reading experience. That's the real rub: There are none. Paragraphs sit immediately atop one another like a great wall of text. Chapters receive the same treatment and are only demarcated by plain text- no bolding, no new section, nothing. The whole effect is not only visually unappealing, but just plain annoying.So the layout of this Kindle edition isn't great, but this book isn't all bad. For one thing, it's free. You get what you pay for formatting-wise, but it's a fantastic story and it's yours forever at absolutely no cost. Plus- and this is also big- this ebook isn't riddled with spelling errors and typos like a lot of the other public domain books available on the Kindle.

The soft cover is 176 pages in length.Maybe one of Wildes' most famous works. An increasingly macabre tale set in London, England during the 19th century.Most are familiar with the plot behind this book...but some *SPOILERS* ahead for those that don't want to know.A most handsome young man has a most lifelike portrait done of himself by a up and coming young London painter. In his youthful exuberance over the detail and beauty of the work, he casually remarks that he'd give his soul to remain young and beautiful, like in the painting, forever.His curse is that he stays young while his friends age and the face and body in the portrait grows old through the years. But the portrait does more than just grow old, it reflects every bad or evil thing he's done (using his beautiful looks to gain unfair advantage); resulting in a framed visage that becomes more grotesque and ugly with every new sin he commits.*END SPOILERS*Beautifully written, with great descriptive detail (maybe at times, a little too much). Wilde conveys a tense atmosphere filled with forebodling and apprehension as he gets into the second half of his extraordinary novel.Conclusion:A short, brilliant work.

As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \\"which came first, the chicken or the egg\\" type of thing.

This book offers rich ideas on everything in life guided by the moral decay of Dorian Gray who's fulfilled wish of youth becomes the means to vices and sins. Meanwhile two friends offer opposing advice- and through it all there is no black and white and moral judgement. Simply a tale of human desires and dissapointments.

The more shallow and superficial the pursuits in life, the more corrupt, evil, wicked and proverted one can become. This is a fact, no \\"religious right\\" or anyone else, made it up. Many just turn their backs or ignore the truth. Mr. Wilde himself should have taken a lesson or two from his own story. What a tragedy with his talent to die sick, corrupt, lonely and penniless.

And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an \`immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a \`spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"With today's slippery morals and exhausting vanity, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an eerie comparison to &quot;then&quot; and now.

He makes a wish that he will remain young and beautiful and the picture will age and take his sins for him. In the end, though he is beautiful on the outside, he is horrendous on the outside.Definitely a good read for high school students. It's interesting and short, and not as cumbersome as other Romantic novels can be. You can relate it to today's times and it is not a hard read.

The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it.

When I was beginning the novel it was a little slow and even a little dry. But, as the plot thickened and the story went on, I can say it is one of my most favorite books ever read.

As the years pass Gray doesn't age but the picture does. His conscious and eternal youth ends up becoming well ........ You'll have to read to find out.People most likely to read and enjoy this novel would probably be late teens and older. Mainly because it has a lot to do with being young and having all the time in the world to do whatever and learn and experience so much. It also is a little bit harder to read for someone younger.

By now everyone knows that young Dorian makes a childish wish that a beautiful portrait of his should age in his stead, and that he should remain forever young and vibrant, and somehow this wish is granted. What follows is a tale of increasing debauchery and depravity that poison a man's soul, while leaving no visible clue upon his face.This is not the most entertaining or gripping novel that you will ever read. Far from it, in fact, but the real merits of the novel come not from the action and plot, but from the extremely clever dialogue and the shredding social commentary. (not surprisingly, this novel took a long time to get published, and was later used as evidence against Wilde during his trial for indecency) Wilde takes several shots at the aristocracy, especially their values, as well as art itself, hedonism, and the very concept of morality.Perhaps the finest aspect of the novel are Wilde's quotes, often through his favorite mouthpiece: Lord Henry Wotton. Henry serves as a goad to Dorian through all of his excesses, and he waxes philosophical upon almost any subject that he can get anyone to listen to. He's wonderful and horrible all at once, and best of all, he doesn't even believe half of what he says. This is definitely a 'classic' novel, and well worth the read. Again, if you're expecting high paced action you'd probably best look elsewhere, but if you're in the mood to think a bit, then chances are you'll enjoy &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book.

It is loaded with epigrammic sentences by a writer who continues to hold interest. Its concept was highly original and has inspired generations of science fiction, fantasy and horror literature since its debut. Wilde stows a lot of his themes and notes on society and character into its pages, so that it often reads like a stack of dispatches from the late 19th century. The dinner party scenes are priceless. It is certainly worth reading in order to understand why Dorian Gray has entered our language, so often alluded to.While possessing the above traits, the novel does have its flaws that are more pronounced under the glare of contemporary light. Wilde's bigotry shows through. Some of the passages are melodramatic and wooden. Dorian Gray's physical beauty is a work of art, and as Wilde says at the outset, all art is useless. However much he embodies many of Wilde's ideas, he remains rather vapid, even when he is at his most corrupt. Part of that is due to the fact that many of the actions that condemn him are only spoken of or hinted at. Mostly we see the highlights, the suicide of a young girl to whom he was unjustly cruel and some subsequent deaths."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Loved this story in school and it just gets better with rereading.

Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a classic about the timeless quest for youth and beauty. The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \\"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book. I liked the story and Wilde's writing style. It's a classic \\"must-read.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This sophisticated but crude novel is the story of man's eternal desire for perennial youth, of our vanity and frivolity, of the dangers of messing with the laws of life. Just like &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;The immortal&quot; by Borges.Dorian Gray is beautiful and irresistible. He is a socialit&eacute; with a high ego and superficial thinking. When his friend Basil Hallward paints his portrait, Gray expresses his wish that he could stay forever as young and charming as the portrait. The wish comes true.Allured by his depraved friend Henry Wotton, perhaps the best character of the book, Gray jumps into a life of utter pervertion and sin. But, every time he sins, the portrait gets older, while Gray stays young and healthy. His life turns into a maelstrom of sex, lies, murder and crime. Some day he will want to cancel the deal and be normal again. But Fate has other plans.Wilde, a man of the world who vaguely resembles Gray, wrote this masterpiece with a great but dark sense of humor, saying every thing he has to say. It is an ironic view of vanity, of superflous desires. Gray is a man destroyed by his very beauty, to whom an unknown magical power gave the chance to contemplate in his own portrait all the vices that his looks and the world put in his hands. Love becomes carnal lust; passion becomes crime. The characters and the scenes are perfect. Wilde's wit and sarcasm come in full splendor to tell us that the world is dangerous for the soul, when its rules are not followed. But, and it's a big but, it is not a moralizing story. Wilde was not the man to do that. It is a fierce and unrepressed exposition of all the ugly side of us humans, when unchecked by nature. To be rich, beautiful and eternally young is a sure way to hell. And the writing makes it a classical novel. Come go with Wotton and Wilde to the theater, and then to an orgy. You'll wish you age peacefully."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a mesmerizing read dominated by two amazing personalities. Dorian Gray is certainly interesting, but I was much more impressed by his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton. Dorian is a perfectly nice, well-meaning young man when we first meet him in the studio of the painter Basil Hallward. Hallward in fact is so drawn to the youth that he draws his greatest inspiration from painting him and just being with him. It is the influence of Hallward's friend Lord Henry which leads to Gray's downfall. There are few characters in literature as decadent, witty, and somehow enchanting as Lord Henry. He is never at a loss for words, fatalistic observations of life and people, sarcastic philosophical musings, and brilliantly devious ideas. Among his world of social decadents and artistic do-nothings, his charm remains redoubtable and highly sought-after. Gray immediately falls under his spell, soon devoting himself to living life to its fullest and enjoying his youth and beauty to the utmost. He solemnly wishes that he could remain young and beautiful forever, that Hallward's exquisite picture of him should bear the marks of age and debauchery rather than himself. To his surprise and ultimate horror, he finds his wish fulfilled. Small lines and creases first appear in the portrait, but after he cruelly breaks the heart of an unfortunate young actress who then takes her own life, the first real signs of horror and blood manifest themselves on his portrait. His love for the ill-fated Sibyl Vane is a sordid, heartbreaking tale, and it marks the culmination of his descent into debauchery. He frequents opium dens and houses of ill repute, justifying all of his worst actions to himself, while the influence of Lord Henry continues to work its black magic on his soul. He hides his increasingly grotesque portrait away in an upstairs room, sometimes going up to stare at it and take pleasure in the fact that it rather than he bears the stains of his iniquities. In time, his obsession with his secret grows, and he is constantly afraid that it will be discovered by someone. For eighteen years he lives in this manner, moving among the members of his society as a revered figure who magically retains his youth, but eventually he begins to see himself as he really is and to curse the portrait, blaming its magic for his miserable life of ill-begotten pleasures and loss of moral character. The final pages are well-written, and the climax is eminently satisfying.Exhibiting the undeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, this wonderful novel serves as a morality play of sorts. One can understand why its unique nature upset a British society emerging from the social constraints of Victorianism, but this reader is hard pressed to see why this novel proved so damaging to Wilde's eventual imprisonment and punishment. Dorian Gray is no hero, nor does his ultimate internal struggles and yearnings for rebirth inspire one to engage in the sort of life he himself eventually came to regret. The only \\"dangerous\\" character in this novel is Lord Henry; his delight in working his evil influence on others as a type of moral experiment and the silver-tongued charm he exploits to aid him in such misbegotten quests have the potential to do harm to a vulnerable mind such as that of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry's evil genius makes him much more interesting than his disciple Dorian Gray. By today's standards, this book is not shocking, and indeed it is much more dangerous to censor work such as this than it is to read it. This book in eminently quotable, and it still manages to cast a magical spell over readers of this day and age. Quite simply, The Picture of Dorian Gray deserves a place on the shelf of the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"What made Oscar Wild(e)?The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press has published a new edition of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. While there is no burning need for such a volume in the day of Lady Gaga and marriage equality, it's important to remember that Wilde spent two years in prison for being gay and for having the guts (stupidity?) to flaunt his sexuality. In many ways, it was the flaunting rather than the act themselves that so angered his persecutors.And Dorian Gray, his first and only novel, was certainly a shot fired directly into the heart of Victorian prudery.And in this day of Kindles, e-books and tweets, this is truly a magnificent job of bookmaking. Oversized, lavishly illustrated and gorgeously presented, Oscar would have loved it. The text is examined minutely, with a variety of comparisons from various publications of the novel, as well as Wilde's original manuscript. While there's nothing particularly new to discover in the emendations from the sources, merely a reinforcement of the outrageousness inherent in the piece, the scholarship is both astounding and informative.The annotator and editor, Nicholas Frankel, easily and effortlessly places the modern reader in Wilde's time and place, London's late Victorian Age in London. There is still a tingle to Dorian's story of endless debauchery while he remains looking pure and innocent for decades and the painting ages and grows monstrous, reflecting his sins and crimes.Strangely, the book seems more modern than one would imagine. Rather than merely a potboiler from two centuries back, WIlde's genius imbues the story with a strange and haunting immediacy, and a cautionary tale for us all: Be careful what you wish for.One could hardly wish for a more beautifully accoutered book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Is your soul a good bargaining chip for perpetual youth and beauty? Young Dorian Gray was led to believe so and impulsively struck that bargain. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is the story of his decline into depravity following that ill-advised trade-off. The story is well-known in popular culture. An artist becomes obsessed with his young model's attractiveness. He and his jaded friend compete for influence over the young man. The friend corrupts young Dorian, encourages him to embrace a life of sensual pleasure and to prize his own beauty. Dorian exclaims that he resents the portrait because IT will keep the freshness of youth -- then the fateful words, that he would give his soul if the picture could decay instead of his own face and body.Be careful what you wish for! Over the next twenty years Dorian sinks into the depths of moral slime and watches the hidden portrait show all the signs of that immorality, while his own face and figure keep the blush of youth.Along with the adulation of youth and beauty, Oscar Wilde delves into the theme of art as morally neutral, a principle of the aesthetic school of thought. Can art be moral or immoral? Should it teach us, improve us? That was the common 19th century view but the school of aestheticism believed that the arts had no role in moral enlightenment. The preface of the book lays out this theme in a series of proclamations.The entire book, like all of Wilde's work, is packed with \\"sound bites.\\" The corrupting friend, Lord Henry Wotton, is particularly prone to Polonius-like declamations, and Dorian tells him, \\"You cut life to pieces with your epigrams!\\" In fact Wilde does that, ripping into polite society and the opium dens of London alike.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Oscar Wilde's only published novel. It first appeared in a magazine in 1890 as a shorter work, and was later expanded and edited to remove some of the more blatant homosexual references. His writing is exquisite, his themes repugnant but (dare I say it?) edifying. \\"What does it profit a man ...\\"Highly recommended as a true classic of modern literature. I read this book when I was young and thought I understood it. Now that I'm not so young, I'm sure that I don't.NOTE: I listened to this book on CD, not tape, but I chose this product link because it's the same production. The Brilliance Audio Library Edition, read by Michael Page, was incomparably presented and added a great deal to my enjoyment of this absorbing book.Linda Bulger, 2008"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book contains the story 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' - in original typescript form. This is the way Oscar Wilde wanted the novel to actually read before the publishers got hold of it. There are two other versions of the novel out there - the version printed for magazine publication & the one printed in novel form. After the publishers got hold of the manuscript a lot of changes were made because of content - the homoerotic element was toned down. The novel version is also longer - Wilde expanded the story. There are pictures, illustrations, & extensive notes included to explain all the changes. It's very interesting to see a version in print that is how Wilde intended it. If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde's works or of Dorian Gray in particular, you will appreciate having this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Basil Harwood talks to his friend, Lord Henry Wotton, about his latest painting, a portrait of a striking young man named Dorian Gray to whom he has taken quite a fancy. He feels that his art has never been alive as it has since meeting this young man. Intrigued at his friends acute interest, Lord Henry determines to meet the young man himself, and quite by chance, manages to remain in the studio as Dorian arrives and stands for the finishing touches to his portrait.Once it is completed, Lord Henry comments on how youthful the painting is, remarking how unfortunate it is that the portrait will always remain as young as on the day it was painted, whereas Dorian will slowly age, losing his youth and looks to time. Dorian frets over this and says that he would give anything if only his portrait would age instead of him.Weeks later, after an unfortunate scene with his fianc&eacute;e, Dorian notices a subtle change to his portrait, a certain cruel turn of the lips. As the days pass, he notices more changes and begins to realize that he can commit every vice and cruelty imaginable without any harm coming to him. His portrait will bear the brunt of his adventures. But at what price? As the years pass, he begins to wonder about the state of his very soul and if he can change, perhaps bring the portrait back to its original beauty.This is a great novel, dealing for the most part with man's quest for eternal youth. Who wouldn't want to stay young forever? We go through fad diets, gyms, botox, plastic surgery -- all in the name of trying to remain healthy and youthful. Dorian is given a unique opportunity, the consequences of which show him the havoc that all the vices and cruel acts have upon his soul (or his conscience). We also get to see how getting what you wish for doesn't always turn out the way you thought it would.It's a well-written story, full of unique characters. The majority of the male characters seem to have no problem whatsoever having intimate relationships with other men. By his actions, Basil appears to be in love with Dorian. Dorian, in turn, is infatuated with Lord Henry, even thought both of them do have relationships with women (for Dorian, a fianc&eacute;e; for Lord Henry, a wife). There's even a bit of jealousy on the part of Lord Henry's wife when she finally meets the man who's been monopolizing her husband's time.At times, though, it does move slowly due to long passages discussing the place of art in society and philosphizing about the quest for youth and beauty. In these passages the text seems to turn more into a lecture rather than a novel. That, however, does not take away from the enjoyment of the novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"While Oscar Wilde's central theme of corruption initially captures the readers attention, the character development does not help to hold the reader's attention for a long period of time. Dorian Gray, the central character, has the potential to be a very romantic and dumbfounding character, but because Wilde does not go into great character development, he seems almost more like the painting that comes to represent him ... dimensionless. The point of the novel is to point out how changed Dorian becomes over the years and how he goes from being the epitome of beauty to someone that is hardly recognized as the person he once was. However, in order to feel this transformation, the reader would need to feel as if he or she knew the original Dorian Gray. Because the beginning of the novel does not describe him enough, the full effect of Dorian's startling transformation is unable to be fully comprehended.In addition, although the theme of outer beauty coupled with inner corruption is a strong one, this book seems more like one that should be read in a class and discussed in groups. It is not a novel that is easy-reading for pleasure. The style of writing makes it hard to breeze through the book, although on the positive the book brings about much self-contemplation and is very thought provoking. The reader cannot put it down because the whole novel leads to the very disturbing, although somewhat predictable, ending.In general, it is a book that should be read and will be enjoyed by many. The reader can relate to the feelings felt by the main characters and the themes in the book are ones that can be witnessed in real life. The general faults of the novel are eventually outweighed by the suspense and the intrigue as the painting of Dorian Gray, once a masterpiece, becomes more defiled with each horrible act committed by Dorian."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into.

He falls in love with a beautiful young actor who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. Once again, due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery.

In addition, we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made.

I was skeptical that it could be bad, because I'm very familiar with the wit of Wilde. As far as gothic novels go, this book ranks high in the Victorian era. Looking back from a historical perspective, I can see why the critics of the time disliked it. But from today's perspective, it is nothing short of brilliant. Wilde weaves a story like few authors could ever dream of doing, and of course his wit is played out beautifully in this book as well. full of quips and quirks, this book is a must read for anybody who has a love of sharp, intelligent writing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"One of the great joys of fiction is the positive encouragement to discard the intentions of the author and draw out individual meaning from its pages. This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in \`The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book was truly one of the jewels filled with beauty that will never fade with time.

When Dorian's friend Basil paints a portrait of him, Dorian exclaims that he wished the portrait got old instead of him.This comes true and under further tutelage of Lord Henry, Dorian lives a life of debauchery, hedonism and the like while the portrait bears his age and sin, becoming more malformed with each act. The book is full of philosophical digressions on sin, beauty and indulgence and its most fabulous aspect is the fact that it is (or as least I think) both an ode to hedonism and an allegory against it all in one, all perfectly blended, all achieved through the medium of the witty writing of Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"No one really impresses me when it comes to Literature.

This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot.

Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil.

Throughout the book, Dorian Gray becomes very popular and attracts all sorts of attention just by waltzing into a room. People find him so innocent and pure, he's alluring (which soons turns sour.) But they don't see his other life. His loathing of the once-beautiful portrait which now displays his age, sins and iniquities. This deep hatred drives him to do many strange things in this dark, twisting tale of morale, age and youth. The book follows Dorian through love, loss, murder, disdain, hurt and ofcourse, happiness. Because it covers most every subject, its a wonderful classic, and a must-read.Though because its written in England in the 19th century, some of the vocabulary is bewildering. Its best to read with a dictionary near by or atleast some knowledge of English Literature and diction."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"A comely, vain, innocent young man named Dorian Gray gets his portrait painted and hides it away in an unused room in his house. After a love affair with an actress goes terribly wrong, he notices that his portrait has altered itself in a curious way. He proceeds to live his life by indulging himself in episodes of increasing debauchery and immorality, wrecking other people's lives and committing blackmail and even murder, and all the while his portrait bears the physical signs of his aging while his own body remains young and fresh. The novel offers some weighty questions: Would we choose to be immoral if we knew we were immortal? Is an artist's work the manifestation of his own latent immorality? Are the world's imperfections, sins, and shames represented better through art than through reality?As much as I admire Oscar Wilde's great play &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest,&quot; I must admit that I found some faults with this short novel of his. Despite its florid prose and dialogue containing wickedly caustic wit and punchy aphorisms that evoke a time when conversation was an art, the novel has a strangely artificial, stiff tone. With dialogue that sounds like it would have to be rehearsed before spoken and many scene descriptions that seem like stage directions, it often reads like a play that's been converted into a novel. Interior furnishings are described in the meticulous detail of a Sotheby's catalog; a nice touch, but what's the point? This is an intriguing novel that combines elements of gothic horror and social satire, but it is marred by too many moments of unintentional goofiness."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"In London, the well-known artist Basil Hallward meets up with a wealthy young gentleman, Dorian Gray.

Sibyl is so caught up in her love for Dorian, she loses her ability to act well and perform as she did before and his love for her vanishes.

In certain parts of the book he starts to show a nervous side of himself. He does this because he is witnessing that a certain picture of someone is changing before his very eyes. Whose picture you're asking, what do think that I'm going to tell you! Stop asking, and read the book already. Anyway, the setting of this book is taking place around the Victorian Times in England. In England there is an art studio in which Basil Hallward, the artist that paints a certain picture, works and spends most of his time. The problem in the story all started when Dorian spoke a &quot;request.&quot; He &quot;requested&quot; that, &quot;Why can't this picture age instead of myself?&quot; Dorian will be scared of what happens after the next few months.

Not only do I have much of the book highlighted, but it is worn from reading again and again. I would definitly reccomend this brilliant novel to anyone who wants to walk away with a feeling as if they've discovered a treasure they must share with the world."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Basil Hallward is an artist, who paints a portrait of Dorian Gray, a very good looking and nave young man. The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\\"The picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"If you want a new slant on this classic novel, read 'The Ripper Code' by Thomas Toughill. This is the book which reveals that Oscar Wilde was blackballed by the Oxford Union."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century.

Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man.

Dorian Gray is captured at the height of his physical charms in a painting and soon discovers that the corruption of his body and soul is reflected in the painting while he retains his youthful attractiveness. His life becomes one of increasing debauchery and narcissism.The most quotable of authors, Wilde uses a friend of the young man to deliver an endless collection of axioms and witty observations that add another dimension to the plot.As Gray becomes more convinced of his invincibility he grows more callous toward others and his actions become less human and more monstrous as the story progresses."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Am I no less agreeable?

This was my first Wilde, and I don't think it will be my last. Another reviewer said that this book was about people doing horrible things, and yet the book was impossible to put down.Nearly everyone knows the story. Dorian Gray wishes that his portrait will show the ravages of time and wickedness while he remains young and beautiful - and he gets his wish. I knew that Dorian's life was going to be ruined - and at times I could predict what was going to happen next. Usually that turns me away from a book. But Wilde's storytelling is so delectable, so riveting that (to use a cliche) it was like watching a train wreck. Terrible to see, but I couldn't look away. I was fascinated.I have heard complaints about the 'flowery' language, but I loved it!Being the overthinker that I am, this book also raised some questions for me: Was Dorian really corrupted by Lord Henry, or did Lord Henry merely show the world Dorian's true hidden nature? Was Basil to blame somehow for painting the portrait? This was probably Wilde's goal - to make us think, and to make us question our hidden nature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Ever since I got my kindle, I've been downloading free classics and The Picture of Dorian Gray was one of them. I remembered it was an option to read for our British Literature final paper so it caught my eye. I started reading the book knowing absolutely nothing about it and within the first few pages I was caught up in its beautiful writing and witty banter between the characters. It's a great story about how a man basically trades his soul for his youth. Wilde writes about the debauchery that Dorian goes through without being so literal about it, which is probably because he was living during victorian times, but it's great because it lets your imagination wander. He doesn't outright say that Dorian seduces women, gets high, or is bisexual, but you assume all of that from his writing. This is not a story that teaches you to choose the \\"good\\" path in life. It's a story that tells us that if we could be a little hedonistic without consequences we would. I'd love to live Dorian Gray's life for a week to know what it feels like...but then have it erased from my life.The negative reviews were basically that the book is boring. I admit there was this one part of the book where it describes everything that Dorian Gray bought, but it's only for a chapter. Another negative reviewer wrote that this book is full of quotables without substance, and well, I don't think the quotes are a bad thing. It's funny! I personally love reading all types of books, both classic and modern, but the ones that keep me fascinated are the classics. The style of writing is just beautiful."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"It felt longer than the actual (approx) 280 paper pages it is.

Although, there are a few typos on the Kindle version."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Though many of us no longer believe in \\"corruptible souls,\\" Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" still holds up as literature and a container of meaning. Though the metaphysics of the novel were likely a mere literary device even in Wilde's day, they nonetheless strike at something deep. Essentially, they ask two perennial questions, \\"what does it mean to be a good person?\\" and \\"How do I know if I'm a good person?\\" Unlike most non-literary mortals, the extremely corruptible (aren't we all?) Dorian Gray has direct empirical evidence of the state of his \\"goodness.\\" He receives, via a Faustian pact sans Faust, a \\"soul mirror\\" from the hapless painter Basil Hallward. As Gray develops from an innocent, almost waifish, youth endowed with irresistible masculine beauty into the Marquis de Sade of the English leisure class, the painting records his increasing dissoluteness. In trade, his physical being retains all the luster of youth and beauty he possessed at 18. This would provide a near irresistible bargain for many twentieth century people, and one wonders at the number of real but metaphorical equivalents of Gray portraits that exist today. But universal belief in a soul, especially as a \\"chalkboard of one's self,\\" has become quaint (even those who believe in a soul probably don't imbue their lives with this belief). Who then, apart from religious adherents, today really worries about \\"damage to the soul\\" in an eschatologically consistent manner that would make Wilde's book blare a meaningful warning signal? Hasn't such thought gone the way of the ether and phlogiston (even though exorcists still dwell among us)? Why read this novel?The simple answer is that \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" remains great literature, though even that concept carries far less weight today than fifty years ago. But if by \\"great literature\\" we mean a story with depth, intrigue, drama and unforgettable characterization then maybe more antennas perk up. Many have also called it a \\"horror story,\\" so perhaps one can subsume it under precursors to Steven King and other morally based modern horror novels? Whatever convenient label one puts on such works, great stories, be they novels, movies, video games, hieroglyphics, songs, dances, buildings, or even a splotch on the sidewalk, teach us something about ourselves. They flip that often neglected \\"introspection switch\\" somewhere in our wiring that supercharges the wonder mechanism. So regardless of the now ancient metaphysics and 19th century ethos of this novel, the telling of such a story as a \\"horror fable\\" still touches that ineffable part of us that strives for \\"goodness,\\" whatever that means. Dorian Gray explores this theme by depicting the abstraction of goodness in visual form that morphs in sympathy with some objective measure of that quality. This in itself summons the creeping question \\"what would my portrait look like?\\" As well as \\"what standards would make my portrait writhing and horrid?\\" The novel suggests, amongst other things, that disregarding the situations of others and focusing selfishly on one's own pleasures makes one corrupt. Sybil Vane's tragic end, arguably the result of Gray's selfish cruelty, produces the portrait's first \\"scrupulous twitch.\\" We still experience these wispy twitches today, with or without a belief in souls. But our increasingly individualistic world throws rationalizations up for any parallel behavior. In a curious twist to the enlightenment-inspired right of \\"pursuit of happiness\\" we suddenly find ourselves morally justifying the destruction of others in the name of principles of \\"individual freedom.\\" This novel seems to eschew such thinking all the way to Gray's macabre and unforgettable death scene. The portrait wasn't so detached from the body after all, it seems. Reducing the book's \\"moral\\" down to a platitude such as \\"selfish hedonism doesn't pay\\" belittles Wilde's achievement. Though really, it says as much but in a beautiful and horrifyingly satisfying way. And it says it in a way that even touches the modern sensibility. Fables can still have impact in an emergent posthumanist era.Another reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is that, being Wilde's only novel, one can claim to the unknowing that \\"I have read all of Oscar Wilde's novels\\" and come across as quite educated indeed. Of course Wilde was well known for his plays. And the sensibilities of the playwright do appear throughout this short book, with the exception of some long passages of narrative summary in the book's second half. Copious dialogue inhabits large sections, especially when the loquacious Lord Henry Wotton spews his neo-hedonist views. These play a role in Gray's corruption and also suggest a fear of contagious and dangerous ideas. Can ideas corrupt? \\"Dorian Gray\\" seems to say \\"yes.\\" But this novel will not corrupt. It will entertain, being a great story, and it will inspire thinking, because it has substance. And since it spins a great yarn it also has the ability to moralize without the appearance of moralizing. Double bonus. So voluminous reasons exist to pick up and chew at this old tale, either in fiber or electronically. And, finally, if you're going to write only one novel, make it a jaw-dropper. Wilde did."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Beautiful beautiful copy. I was delighted to receive this in the post.

As Wilde as written, &quot;there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book.

However, The Picture of Dorian Gray gets bogged down with trifles too often, which is distracting. There is an air of stuffiness and superficiality that becomes a little tiresome.Also, there are few redeeming characters in the novel, as the principal ones are nauseating. Take Lord Henry for instance. His long-winded philosophies and monologues dominate a good deal of the book; rather than adding much to the story, they become heavy-handed, like a point is being shoved in our face too often. And, then there is Dorian. So overdramatic and high-maintenance. Everything revolves around him and his precious little world. I get that he is supposed to be vain and materialistic, but there's little sympathy for him at all, especially when you realize he's more about forgetting his sins than actually repenting them. I realize that Wilde is philosophizing through his characters and the plot, but the means with which he goes about this is tedious.Still, there are redeeming aspects to the novel. Wilde does give us a moral to take away from the reading experience, as the Faustian angle of selling one's soul for beauty becomes apparent in Dorian's life. As Dorian ultimately chooses vanity over spirit and conscience, he sets the wheels of fate in motion. With devil in disguise Lord Henry egging him on, he gradually sees the portrait embody his tarnished soul: vanity, pleasures, sins. Wilde does give the book a very Gothic vibe. Dorian's portrait almost seems alive with grotesqueness, something horrible and monstrous hiding behind that sneer.While I did enjoy the Gothic aspects and the moral to Wilde's novel, I didn't like this novel as much as others."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I ordered this book some months ago for my love, and it arrived quickly and was in phenomenal shape; exactly as the description stated, and was priced very fairly."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Only read three pages.

Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \\"beauty for beauty's sake\\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I got this free for my iPad and I enjoyed reading it.

Mostly because it was the one book that Oscar Wilde wrote and it express a philosophy of the time in a fictional setting in a very unique fashion. The covert homosexuality is clear, for my personal taste, tolerable. It was an important part of his life. Also, the price was right: free."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was the only novel written by Oscar Wilde. The basic idea behind it is well-known even to those who have never read the book or seen any of various film adaptations. A beautiful young man named Dorian Gray possesses a portrait of himself, painted by his friend Basil Hallward. Dorian, who is very vain about his looks, expresses the wish that he could remain young and beautiful while the portrait grows old, only to find that he has made an unwitting Faustian bargain, because this is precisely what happens. Influenced by the hedonistic philosophy of another friend, Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gives himself over to a life of debauchery, remaining forever young while the signs of ageing begin to appear on the painting. The portrait, moreover, does not simply reflect Dorian's chronological age. It also acts as a reflection of the state of his soul. By the end of the story Dorian is no more than middle-aged, but the picture is that of a hideous old man, disfigured by a life of sin and vice.When the novel was first published in 1890 (in magazine form) it was highly controversial, for two reasons. The first reason was its undoubted homoerotic overtones, although Wilde toned these down somewhat when the novel was published in book form the following year. Explicit gay sex scenes would, of course, have been taboo in the 1890s, but coded references to famous homosexual lovers from history and mythology (Hadrian and Antinous, Edward II and Piers Gaveston, Jupiter and Ganymede) can be taken as an indication that Dorian's debauches are not exclusively of the heterosexual variety. There is also an indication that Basil's feelings for Dorian, and possibly Lord Henry's as well, go beyond mere friendship.The other reason why the novel was so controversial was that Wilde was wrongly thought to be espousing Lord Henry's world view and advocating a love of beauty and pleasure as the only good in life. This impression was strengthened by Wilde's Preface, which consists solely of twenty-five epigrams about art, including \\"There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all\\". These statements appear to align Wilde with the literary and cultural movement known as Aestheticism, or sometimes as the Decadent Movement. This movement adopted as its slogan \\"Art for Art's Sake\\", interpreted by many of its followers such as the French poet Theophile Gautier as a denial of the idea that there was any association between art and morality.Wilde's epigrams, however, should not be taken as the Twenty-Five Articles of a prescriptive artistic credo; they were rather intended as provocative aphorisms intended to stimulate discussion. The author himself frequently wrote works with a quite overt moral agenda- children's stories like \\"The Selfish Giant\\", social satires like \\"A Woman of No Importance\\" and \\"An Ideal Husband\\", poems like \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\". Indeed, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" itself can be interpreted as an overtly moral work. In a letter, Wilde said of the three main characters: \\"Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be--in other ages, perhaps\\"- an interesting remark, given that Basil is both the only character in the novel who is a creative artist and also the representative of a traditional, and often explicitly Christian, morality, which contrasts sharply with Henry's amoralism. Henry is a cynical dandy, much given to witty aphorisms, but like other similar characters in Wilde's works is not to be taken as a self-portrait of the author.If Dorian is a Faust-figure, Henry is his Mephistopheles, but he is a devil less corrupt than the man he tempts. For all Henry's cynicism, he never descends into the depths of depravity in the same way as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; does. He never quite has the courage to practise what he preaches, being guilty of what might be called inverted hypocrisy, making himself out to be worse than he really is. As Basil says to him \\"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\" Dorian's sins, however, are not limited to sexual debauchery and drug addiction (he becomes an habitu&eacute; of opium dens). His callous behaviour drives his fianc&eacute;e, the young actress Sibyl Vane, to suicide, and in an attempt to preserve himself from exposure he resorts to blackmail and murder.One thing that does link Wilde to the Aesthetic movement is his undoubted love of physical beauty; the story is written in a very rich, lush style with many striking descriptive passages, such as the opening description of the beautiful summer's day on which Dorian first meets Henry. Yet his attitude to Aestheticism is a critical one, and is perhaps closer to that of earlier writers such as Ruskin and Morris, both of whom promoted an appreciation of beauty not as an end in itself but as part of a wider political and social agenda. Wilde clearly saw the limitations, and the dangers, of a cult of beauty divorced from moral and human concerns. It is perhaps significant that, after committing his murder, Dorian sits down to calm his nerves by reading the poetry of Gautier, the writer most closely associated with the \\"art for art's sake\\" ideology. He breaks off his engagement to Sibyl after seeing her give a bad performance in the theatre; her explanation for the decline in her acting skills is that, having discovered real love, she can no longer be inspired by fictional love. For him, artistic concerns are paramount over human ones; for her, it is the other way round.As one might expect from the only novel of a highly original, idiosyncratic writer, the book occupies a unique place in the history of English literature. It is sometimes classified as Gothic fiction, and the work to which it bears the greatest similarity is perhaps another classic \\"Gothic\\" novel from the late 19th century, Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\", published five years earlier. Like Stevenson, Wilde wanted to explore the duality within the human soul between the virtuous public side and the darker private side which we are compelled to keep hidden. As a homosexual forced to conceal his homosexuality, this theme had an obvious appeal for him.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a complex, multi-layered work, and there is insufficient space in this review to touch on all its many aspects. It is, however, a work which well deserves its status as a literary classic more than a century after the death of its author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is to my knowledge, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde.

Upon witnessing his youth preserved in art, Mr. Gray wishes it could perhaps, be the other way around...and his wish is granted but, in a nightmarish way. For now the painting reflects his sins. Believe me, he has more than enough. This is a great, if tragic story and I'm so glad it was free, as this was my first time reading it!

Why? Because, despite the reams of column inches I've read over the years on how scary the blessed thing is, I couldn't find myself even turning a hair. Simply put, Wilde was a comedian, albeit a bitter, misanthropic comedian. The man didn't have it in him to write horror the way the Jameses (M. R. or Henry, take your pick) or Poe did. (Though one should note that none of those three acknowledged masters of nineteenth-century horror ever produced what we would consider, today, a novel-length work of horror, whereas Wilde did; Poe's only novel was a fantasy, while the longest works of James one and James two are both novelettes.) So if you go into it expecting a horror novel, you may well find yourself disappointed. If you look at it, however, as yet another exposition of the incredible strengths of Oscar Wilde's creativity--the biting satire, the homosexuality so repressed it's half-erotic when someone stands up from a table, the rampant quotability--then like everything else the man ever wrote, &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em> will be right up your alley. It contains some of Wilde's most-recognized one-liners (\\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\", \\"If the cave-man had known how to laugh, history would have been different\\", \\"It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting.\\", and dozens of others), some thoroughly entertaining characters, a plot as old as time itself bent to Wilde's indomitable will, and any number of good, solid laugh-out-loud moments. It also, of course, comes with an excellent backstory that inspired Wilde's most important one-liner of all: \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written.\\" Needless to say, were this not the former, there wouldn't have been such an uproar over it, would there? ***"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The book \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", written by Oscar Wilde, deals with the issue of getting old and the question of how you want to live your life. In my opinion the book is a typical book from Oscar Wilde which shows the difficulties and the pressures in the community. Oscar Wilde is a critical author who always writes about his own point of view. Furthermore you can also learn about his personality and the society this time.I think that the Picture of Dorian Gray represents the wish from every person to stay young and beautiful with all the opportunities and chances, waiting for you to grab them. Also the second chance and the possibillity to change is a facility which is usually offered to the youth.Also the end is a perfect rounding which brings all topics and themes together to one point. And as Oscar Wilde shows in his opinion, the point is not how you look, it is more how you lived and what you did. At least the ending says that when you die,you die as the person you were and it does not matter who you pretend you are.The story of Dorian Gray is in my opinion a very gripping book which did not leave me until I finished it. And even then it makes me think about these things. Oscar Wilde's writing is very fast-moving and there are no long or boring scences in the book.Bringing all considerations together I have to say that I enjoyed the book very much, which is why I have read it in only three hours."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's color commentary on the tug of war between Basil Hallward (good) and Lord Henry Wotton (evil--think Wormwood in C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters). The rope they pull is the young Dorian Gray. The score in this classic battle is widely known; in the end Wotton pulls Gray completely to his end of the field with Hallward dragged face-down in the mud. For those who have not read it, I will not reveal the absolute ending.Several themes apply to us all: the high price of pleasure and self-indulgence as a way of life; the absurdity of our superficial preoccupation with outward beauty; and how idolizing appearances blinds us to the truth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"What would a portrait of your soul look like?More than anything else, this question beats at the heart of this thought provoking book.For Oscar Wilde, his alter ego Dorian Gray would not be too pretty.As the book demonstrates, years of sin ultimately rob Gray of his youthful beauty. But, consistent with a wish made by Gray, this theft occurs only a canvas copy of him made by an adoring male artist when Gray was still young.While it would seem that eternal youth is a great prize, especially to the very vain Gray, it ends up becoming a curse. Gray locks the aging picture away in an attic only periodically returning to it to witness the ravages that would have been visited upon him were he not to have made his wish.In this way, while Gray is permitted to retain his external beauty, he's also forced to witness his moral deterioration.As with the more contemporary Angels in America, self reproach over one's homosexuality moves deeply along the subcurrents of this book. Though most don't know it, homosexuality was prohibited by law in Great Britain until 1967 and those convicted of it were forced into harsh punishments and even harsher treatments intended to \\"cure\\" them.It's this deeper sense that most people resonate with in one way or another...substituting their own private sins for those of Gray in their estimation of their moral appearance.Having said all that, it still prompts consideration that Gray himself and his friend Lord Henry -- sinful that they are -- are the most interesting characters in this book. Unintentionaly (perhaps), Wilde is suggesting that it's our sins that make us noteworthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is a review for the Penguin Classics hardcover edition of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", ISBN: 0141442468. Amazon.com, despite its general excellence, fails to take into account the bibliophile for whom the quality of the edition he determines to purchase matters, so, this is not a review for the intellectual content of the volume I have recently bought, but, rather, a review of the quality of this particular volume's production.I had hoped, that Penguin had finally decided to market its considerable store of intellectual wealth to those who desire a book of some distinction, to those who still admire the craftsmanship of a finely wrought tome. Largely, in this edition (and in those others, similar to it) they have succeeded. The cloth covers of these editions are attractively designed; the typesetting modern, attractive, and readable; the cloth marker a thoughtful edition. However--and this is a thing unabidable--the binding is glued and does not have signatures. Sewn signatures are a sign that some care has been taken to ensure the longevity of a book. The crude, merely glued together pages make this volume little better than some cheap paperback in deceiving, meretricious garb. I will not again be purchasing a book from this line, and would advise anyone else to avoid doing the same."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Dorian Gray is a young man of pure beauty. He befriends an artist named Basil, and at first Basil uses Dorian as a model for paintings, putting him into classical scenes. Eventually, however, he decides to paint a portrait of Dorian as he truly is. Around the same time, Dorian befriends one of Basil's acquaintances, Henry, and Henry makes Dorian more cynical and jaded. When Dorian finally sees the portrait Basil has painted, he weeps and wishes that he would remain young, and the portrait would age in his place. When his wish comes true, Dorian will go to murderous lengths to keep the secret.Sometimes, a girl just needs a little bit of the classics in her life. Thank goodness Amazon offers a wide variety of public domain books available for free Kindle download. This was my first foray into Wilde, and I wonder how different of an experience reading his work in his own time would have been. To me, the homoerotic undertones leap from the page, but I wonder how much of that was intentional on his part, and how much of that is me being influenced by what we know of Wilde himself. Regardless, there is something sensually sinister about the interactions of the men in this book. And while most of them do have relations with women, very few seem to value or enjoy female interactions at all.I very much enjoyed this dark, cautionary tale of a wanna be Narcissus. It did take me a while to get into the pacing of the more classical language and writing style, having been reading a lot more modern books lately, but once I was about a third of the way through the book I literally devoured it. I know Wilde did not write as prolifically as some classical writers, but I believe I will be seeking out some of his other works.I could not help but feel some pity for Dorian Gray. He became exactly what everyone groomed him to be, then everyone scorned him for being what they had wanted him to be in the first place. Someone needs to get this book to Lindsay Lohan as soon as possible, she may find it familiar. Which make me wonder, with all the modernizations and mash ups of classic literature out there, why hasn't anyone done anything with this story? It seems to me that it could be redone with a modern twist, or vampires or something really well if the right person did it. Of course, if the wrong person did it, it would be wretched, so maybe it is best left alone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This novel is one of the best classics available. It is more entertaining for its controversy value than for anything else. Lord Henry Wotton is probably the most engaging character in the entire novel, and one gets the impression he is the mouthpiece of Oscar Wilde himself.

This is a fast pased book that doesn't have a single speed bump, you are forced to create them yourself putting down the book every few chapters to marvel at EVERYTHING. The dialog is world class, the theme's truer today than back then, the characters moving and dynamic, all tied up in as few of pages as possible. With the exception of one chapter, you'll know it when you read it.The dialog, I haven't read a book that I am more impressed with. The poet and playwrite in Wilde shows through here. The constant gloomy witt of Lord Henry is awesome. The dinner scenes are great, and you just want to memorize a few sayings to pull out at the next party you go to. Things like, \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yeild to it.\\", or \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" Now you might come off thinking this is a book for an angry teenager, but there is a lot more here than that.

This was not a comfortable read for me; in fact, it was quite difficult for me to finish. However, the difficulty did not arise because it was poorly executed; rather, it was so well done that I couldn't bear to watch the destruction of one man's soul.Oscar Wilde writes beautifully and eloquently, and this book overflows with witticisms and epigrams that are eminently quotable. However, many of these bon mots come from the observations of Lord Harry, who is the cynic that leads Dorian Gray down the road of temptation and vice. For that reason, I could not fully enjoy all of these wonderful sallies, knowing from whom they came and whose mind composed them.Dorian Gray is by no means an innocent throughout this book. However, he begins the book as An Ideal - the physical embodiment of all that is good, youthful, innocent and free of sin. In fact, his ideal purity is what inspires his friend, Basil, to paint the titular picture of Dorian Gray. Once Dorian makes the acquaintance of Basil's friend, Lord Harry, however, Dorian is fascinated by Lord Harry's worldly and cosmopolitan views. In a burst of youthful enthusiasm, Dorian wishes for the picture to bear the physical outcomes of his actions so that Dorian can retain his beauty. He soon discovers that his wish has been granted. Adopting Lord Harry's way of life, Dorian descends into a lifestyle of vice and pleasure seeking and perversely (and childishly?) anticipates the devastation he can wreak on the portrait without bearing any evidence on his own physical form.The levels of Harry's influence, Dorian's self-destruction, and Dorian's blindness to the true elements of his fall from \\"goodness\\" combined to make for a powerful read. I couldn't help but get a Faustian vibe throughout this novel, and I found myself calling Harry (in my head) \\"Mephisto! Mephisto!\\"The story told in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" of the ruination of a man's good character and moral compass is terrible, tragic, and, despite the fantastical nature of a portrait that reveals the blackness of one's soul, terrifyingly realistic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is really a must read, I recommend it highly.

The book was quite \\"revealing\\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \\"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book.

The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \\"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that \`Ugliness is the only reality.'\\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that \`All art is quite useless\\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled \`useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \\"All art is quite useless,\\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called \`Aesthetic Movement,\\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\\"\\"\`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\\"\\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\\"\\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\\"\\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"To define is to limit.\\"\\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\\"\\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage.

Today it would be difficult to get people to read it. As a former English teacher, I was fascinated and intrigued by Wilde's sentence structure and word choice; most readers today would find it stilted and actually difficult to read. In addition, the class structure adds more problems for understanding how the characters behaved. Lastly, the older British custom of describing men and their feelings about their friends would put off many readers. (Same problem with some of Shakespeare's sonnets.) While it is certainly a classic, there are many contemporary authors who deal with the theme as well as Wilde. It is probably a great choice for English literature majors; however.

Once, when I thought that that was all that the book was, I still liked it: after all, the story was a good one, the one-liners were mostly good, and if the two didn't fit well together, well, that was a pity, but it didn't prevent the book from being fun to read.I realise now that the book packs a greater moral punch than I'd thought. Wilde makes evil seem genuinely attractive; and this is not to be done merely by telling us that so-and-so finds evil attractive, and then giving a spurious causal explanation. When Dorian performs his first act of genuine cruelty, not only Henry, but the author as well, tell us to forget about it, that it doesn't really matter. They even give us some genuinely good arguments. (Whereas Basil, the force of good, seems to be able to do little but utter stolid platitudes.) So we forget about it as much as Dorian does, and are hit over the head all the more smartly by the end of the book. It's true, Wilde still gets a bit carried away with himself in places; and the effect of seeing so many of his epigrams together in the one place is to make us wonder if we could write a computer program capable of creating a couple of hundred more; but I was wrong in my initial reaction. The flippancy and the deep seriousness are both necessary. They contrast, but they do not clash."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised. I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \\"deal with the devil\\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book.The Picture of Dorian Gray Starring: George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Dorian Gray, a young man of high English society, possesses a beauty that any man or women would long for. However, the reader soon realizes that even the purest beauty can not save us from the horrors and intrigue of sin. After seeing his portrait, Dorian curses the fact that soon his beauty will fade and declares \\"if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture to grow old! For that - I would give everything\\". Dorian soon finds that his ill-fated wish has come true, and his portrait now carries the burden of age. As the years pass, Dorian becomes obsessed with sins and evils, for they do not afflict his personal appearance, but rather aid in the deterioration of his portrait, his soul. But, although Dorian continues to sin and think nothing of the consequences of his actions, he is consumed with an overwhelming fear that his portrait and sins will be revealed to the world. Through the actions and sins of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde shows human's weakness to the evils of the world. Wilde urges all readers to renounce sinning for it leads to the deterioration of one's moral principles, but more importantly, creates an everlasting fear that can destroy one's soul and eventually destroy one's desire to live. This story should be read by teenagers everywhere for it shows that the true nature of our character is judged by the beauty of one's soul, rather than the beauty of one's face."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Though it's rather slow to get going in the initial chapters, Oscar Wilde's &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; builds up into a splendidly effective piece, written in highly polished prose. Dorian Gray, who is suggestively described as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; ... is painted by his friend and admirer, Basil Hallward. Dorian, a self-centered social luminary whose character is reminiscent of Narcissus, makes a bizarre sub-Faustian wish which tragically comes true: that his beautiful portrait may age, while he retains his youthful looks. The conclusion is disastrous, the culmination of a narrative containing elements of murder, suicide, blackmail, a confrontation in a grimy alley and an episode in an opium den. The characters are very well sketched out, particularly the triad of Dorian, Basil and the intellectual cynic, Lord Henry, Dorian's mentor and the mouthpiece of some of Wilde's most cutting amoral opinions. The style is, typically, marvellous, characterised by brilliant exchanges and aphoristic gaiety. Wilde lacerates English bourgeois culture, the conceptions of sin and virtue and the attitudes towards art of his time with tremendous aplomb. Some of his quips are patently snide, sometimes mysogynistic, as in: &quot;Woman represents the triumph of matter over mind, while man represents the triumph of mind over morals.&quot; Oh, isn't that just despicable?! I love it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \\"phew\\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"What a wonderfull book. I Love the classic's. There are plenty of great books written today, but the classic's are from other periods in time that show life in a different light."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I picked up a an audio cd of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' at the same time I was reading 'A Stranger's Child' by Alan Hollinghurst. Interestingly the respective narratives move through Edwardian England while peeling back the layers of sexual repression and eroticism associated with the era. The author Diana Galbaldon accomplishes this successfully, too, with attendant similar homo-erotic themes in her Lord John (Grey)series.While both listening and reading similar books simultaneously I was trying to keep the characters aligned with each story. In fact, several characters from each book have the same name. 'Dorian Gray' begins with a prologue by the author that addresses in advance the freedom to publish content that Wilde surely felt would be controversial. This proved to be prescient.The main character for whom the book is named in effect sacrifices his soul for the vanity of youth and life's experiences and excess. Up to a point, one could make a contemporary parallel to a life lived by a celebrity (i.e. Mick Jagger, Lindsay Lohan, etc.) at least from a public perception perspective. The song 'You're so Vain' by Carly Simon could easily have been written as homage to the Dorian Gray character.There exists in the story line a protagonist (the painter of the picture) and antagonist - a friend of the painter's who, arguably is a devil incarnate, guides by suggestion Dorian Gray down a path of self-gratification, vanity and excess.For those of us that recall the Twilight Zone TV series from the 1960's, this book - a classic for it's time - would have made a marvelous episode."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has appeared in nearly a dozen forms, some reflecting publishers' objections, some adding new material by Wilde to compensate for cuts, and some simply bowdlerized in pirate editions. For the first time, Wilde's original manuscript submitted for publication has been printed as he wrote and intended it, before other people's prejudices and pressure caused him to alter the text. This is a beautifully produced large format book, beautiful cover with Caravaggio's \\"Narcissus\\" cropped and darkened, detailed introduction, bibliography and analysis of the complete publishing history of this unusually tortured author and book. All variants are included in the notes and annotations. Of particular interest is the fact that it is this text, which has not previously been published, that Sir Edward Carson, Counsel for the brutal and sociopathic Marquis of Queensbury whom Wilde absurdly sued for libel over an open note in a men's club in which Queensbury, father of Wilde's infamous lover Bosie Douglas, wrote \\"Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic).\\" But for Wilde's utterly mad legal action against Queensbury, he would not have faced the tremendous wealth of testimony and written evidence placed before the civil court by Carson, and would not have been prosecuted for any crimes, as he was after losing his libel action. Many of the passages which appear only in this new edition of \\"The Picture\\" were used by Carson to paint Wilde into a corner of criminality; and it is interesting to see just which sentences and paragraphs were accumulated to impeach Wilde on cross-examination. All in all, this is a wonderful book, almost too grand for its subject matter.

Wilde has taken an old story and transformed it into a tale of Victorian excess and corruption.

However, I was utterly disappointed. The disappointment had nothing to do with the novel's themes but rather its characters and delivery.As a literature major, I am one who enjoys long novels full of detail and old romantic language such as that of Jane Austen. While The Picture of Dorian Grey was written with glorious detail and all the flowery language that I love I found myself very bored. There were many places where I found that the story dragged and though I am sure they were meant to be brilliant social commentary I could not stand the countless scenes where Lord Henry or Dorian sat about with their friends and chatted.I may have still been able to give this book at least a three star rating if the boring scenes scattered throughout the book were the only fault but unfortunately what truly put me off was the characters. I cannot enjoy a book whose characters I do not come to love or at least care for in some small way. By the end of the novel I did not care one bit what happened to Dorian Grey; he was a spineless boy and a cruel man. Lord Henry was always a wicked man and a tiresome preacher of what he considered to be cleverness. Basil Hallward was the only character that I enjoyed and somewhat identified with but he was not enough apart of the story to redeem it and nothing could make up for Dorian himself.I was extremely disappointed in this book and I cannot say that I would recommend it to anyone other than a literature fanatic looking too read as many classics as possible."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Ugh, what to say about this book. I wanted so badly to love it, but I didn't. I didn't even like it a little bit. That's terrible when you don't really enjoy the very first classic you read. This isn't setting a good stage for the future and planning on reading one classic a month. Good thing Alice in Wonderland is next month. That will definitely make up for the suck of this one. Don't you hate it when you hear such good things about a book and you go in expecting to love it only to be completely disappointed? Yeah, that's what happened here.The book follows Dorian Gray (the original Mr. Gray, if you will) who is apparently a very beautiful man who is envied by many only he doesn't quite understand why. I liked Dorian but I didn't feel like his character had much depth. I liked that he wasn't all look how sexy I am you know you want this, but at the same time he was kind of a sissy. He follows this Lord Henry guy around like he's a lost little puppy dog and puts up with him bashing him on numerous occasions. I don't know who this guy thinks he is but I had to force myself not to skip over his parts. The only rational person in this book (minus his psycho obsession over Dorian) is Basil but he isn't in enough of the book to really care too much about.I think I know why I couldn't get into this book as much as the rest of the people who told me about it. Have you seen the movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Okay, I see Dorian Gray in that movie when I think about him. I see Stuart Townsend in all his \\"I'm the bomb get over it\\" glory. I cannot and will not picture him as the pushover that he was in this book. That movie ruined the book for me. I remember watching the actual Dorian Gray movie but it was boring too. I may have to watch it again just to see how terrible it was in comparison to the book, but I vaguely remember falling asleep at some point.The only reason I didn't give it one butterfly is because I was able to finish it. It was hard and it seemed like forever, but I did it. And the only reason I did it was to get to the end. I read on and off for like five days just to read about the scene I could have watched in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen after only an hour and a half. Stuart Townsend will always be my Dorian Gray. This book just didn't do it for me. However... Dorian is a VERY cool name. Props to Mr. Wilde for that."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I feel perplexed about The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. On one hand, the story is well written about a young man being moulded and shaped. On the other hand, this book was incredibly flowery and doesn't really start for 100 pages. Dorian doesn't really know about life and meets an artist and an aristocrat that help him though his journey into manhood. The artist paints his portrait, subsequently making him keep his youth. The aristocrat had the biggest influence on Dorian Gray, though Lord Harry Wotton is very annoying. He talks and talks the whole way through this book, thinking he's so witty.Dorian Gray starts off in this novel as a blank slate, an easily influenced young man. Thoughout the rest of the story he gets moulded and pushed into shape. After Basil paints his portrait Dorian starts to unravel, afraid to show the picture, he locks it way in a room and never lets anyone see it, protecting it at all costs. The whole thing symbolising the way we hide our real selves from the rest of the world, scared of what they may think.The Picture of Dorian Gray would have been controversial in its day, with strong homosexual themes. Though the book itself is more about the life and morality, Oscar Wilde did a brilliant of capturing this element of the book. For me the biggest downfall of this book was that Lord Wotton was too loud and dominates throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is an incredibly well written, wonderfully illustrated, and very interesting book to read.

Dorian does not die when he looks at his portrait; in fact his observation of the changes in his picture is one of the main elements of the story. Basil, an artist that is obsessed with the beauty of one man, Dorian, paints a portrait so beautiful that the subject is pained by the fact that the portrait's beauty will outlast that of his mortal body, and he wishes that this formula could be reversed, with the portrait aging in his place. He gets his wish, but at what price? Dorian, now free from the bounds of mortality, is no longer afraid to sin, since there he thinks that nothing can happen to him. But his behavior was not all due to his immortality; it was also due to the fact that the negative influence from Lord Henry corrupted his pure soul. The fact that he was able to keep his beauty but not able to keep his soul shows that judgment based on appearance is not only wrong, but inaccurate. This book is recommended, but not to the highest extent. The story picks up quickly, as it must with such a limited amount of pages. One of the only flaws in this book is chapter 11, the long, unwanted pause.

It was a true page turner. It left me wondering about Oscar Wilde's state of mind...LOL!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"With his life spanning the later half of the 19th Century, Oscar Wilde wrote in a wide variety of mediums, ranging from poetry to plays and from essays to fairy tales, and one novel. His fairy tales are arguably the most accessible of his writings, and as is the case with fairy tales revolve around some moral theme being conveyed. For instance in \`The Selfish Giant' a giant places a wall around his garden to keep the children out, and thus spring never comes on his garden, causing him to realize the result of his selfishness. Similarly in \`The Star-Child' a beautiful boy is forced to come to terms with his prideful cruelty.The Picture of Dorian Gray can be seen as a continuing of this fairy tale manner of writing, except in novel form (though even then the novel is fairly short).The story begins in the art-studio of Basil, a painter who is putting the final touches on what is said to be his most greatest painting. With him is Lord Henry, a shallow obscurantist of high society who upon hearing of the figure in the portrait desires to meet with him - the figure being that of a young and impressionable Dorian Gray. The two become friends and eventually the philosophy of Lord Henry begins to have its affect on him.In the words of Lord Henry, this amounts to \\"if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal-to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be... The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"Throughout the course of the novel Dorian comes to embrace this ideal, giving into his own inner nature: \\"Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins-he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all... For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. \\"Thus Dorian Gray enters into a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of scenario with himself where he resolves to do away with his conscience - where Mr. Hyde reveals the truth of Dr Jekyll, the portrait comes to reveal the truth of Dorian Gray, and before the end he must come to face that truth.The book is enjoyable, and at around 180pgs can be read in an evening. Like his fairy tales it comes away with a moral, though modern renditions of the character seem to miss this point.Memorable Quotes:-\\"You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can makemodern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing isdelightful if one only hides it.\\"-\\"Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.\\"-\\"Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed thatthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep theunsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due tothat. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sureswift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment.Not \\"Forgive us our sins\\" but \\"Smite us for our iniquities\\" should bethe prayer of man to a most just God.\\"Specific CriticismsI don't believe I have any real criticisms or complaints about this book. I do have to say that I greatly disliked the character of Lord Henry, and the book can be read much more quickly if you skip all his dialogue after his first few rants. If you've read one of his conversations you've read them all; the basic model is that he says something absurd or outlandish and then the other characters alternately gasp and fawn over his words.Every now and then this is interrupted by him saying something exceptionally bland, such as remarking that \\"They are both simply forms of imitation\\" when Basil makes the statement that \\"Love is a more wonderful thing than art.\\" Or by making some contradiction in terms, such as \\"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.\\"Little nuances of character stand out, such as Henry and Dorian constantly remarking about the shallowness of other characters while demonstrating a pointed shallowness throughout the book. Of course this isn't a criticisms of the book or the writing, it is likely in fact a praise of the writing, that he can create such a distasteful character.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Especially considering the time of writing, this book sets out a rare insight into the workings of the human mind.

Into this realm of things which were not dared to be spoken, along came Oscar Wilde to say them. Wilde's gay background formed a subtext both in the novel and in his personal life that both titillated and repelled much of England.THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a reworking of the popular literary motif of the consequences of making a deal with the devil. The average Englishmen well knew of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus who had signed such a pact with Mephistopheles involving the exchange of power and knowledge for Faustus' soul. Every human being has a soul worth bartering; Wilde dared to suggest to a homophobic England that even a gay man's soul was as well.Dorian Gray is a young, handsome man whose portrait is painted by Basil Hallward. Beginning with the very introduction of Gray, Wilde consistently combines two seemingly unrelated themes: the role of the artist in society and the role of the gay man in that same society. In the Preface to his book, Wilde maintains his aesthetic belief that the only purpose of art is to have no purpose: \\"All art is useless.\\" Wilde connects this inutility about the nonpurpose of art with the aging and the dissipation of the painting that grows progressively more unattractive the more that Gray sins. Lord Henry Wotton, who is surprisingly the most interesting character in the book with his witty epigrams and biting cynicisms, is the rou&eacute; who leads--or perhaps seduces--an initially innocent Dorian into a life on nonstop debauchery. Dorian, urged on by Wotton to drop Dorian's newest girlfriend, the actress Sybil Vane, crudely berates what he saw as a second rate theatrical performance, causing her to commit suicide in grief at his cutting remarks. After her death, Wotton leads Dorian into a two decade long life fall into sin. Eventually, Dorian considers it time to clean up his act and this is where many readers have become confused with Dorian's advice about art in the Preface and Wotton's advice about art in the book. When Wilde asserts in the Preface that art is useless, he rejects the current Victorian notion that art ought to be used for the betterment of humanity. He states that the contrary is true. Art must not be used for betterment. He further implies that his belief's corollary must be true too: that art cannot harm human life. In fact, as he finishes his Preface, he notes, \\"All art is useless.\\" Yet, in the novel, Wotton rejects Dorian's claim that his painting has led Dorian's beauty on a straight line road to disaster--for Dorian, for Sybil, and earlier for Basil, whom Dorian has murdered. What is apparent, at least to Wotton if not to Dorian, is that it was not art that was responsible for their deaths, but Dorian, who in his hubris wanted to assume the same mantle of godlike near immortality that damned Faustus centuries earlier. Thus, art had nothing to do with Dorian's descent into evil. It was nothing more prosaic than pride gone berserk.Wilde's not so subtle intent at painting his own portrait of a homoerotic connection between Wotton, Dorian, and debauchery has also been a source of much confusion. Wilde could not afford to state explicitly that Dorian was involved on a gay level with Wotton, Adam Campbell or anyone else, but it is pretty clear that homoeroticism was just one in a long line of events that Wilde knew would point out the ongoing degradation of Dorian. But if Wilde allowed Dorian to escape the consequences of his seduction by Wotton, then he might not have been able to find a publisher. It was hard enough the way it was to do that.Readers today regard THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY as a fascinating if not a dated period piece about trading one's soul for forbidden delights, but no other book warns of the consequences as eloquently as this one."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I picked up this book to read, partly because I am a big fan of Wilde's plays, and partly because the concept behind this novel has become such a part of our collective conscious that I wanted to know what was behind it.It was filled with all the wit and cynicism that I expect from Wilde, but, I found it to be a bit tiresome to read. I suspect that this is partially due to the fact that it is so solidly grounded in the late 1800's that the concerns of the characters are a bit distant.Still, I must say that I feel that it is a book worth reading. Anything that has seared itself into the western world's consciousness is worth investigating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \\"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant. If you've never read it, pick it up and savor it. Don't rush through it for the plot. Ponder it as you read. If you have already read it, put it away and try it again in five or ten years. You may discover new meaning, and much that you missed. That's the beauty of a timeless novel. Its wisdom will wait patiently until you've had time to catch up."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, a story of morals, psychology and poetic justice, has furnished Oscar Wilde with the status of a classical writer. It takes place in 19th-century England, and tells of a man in the bloom of his youth who will remain forever young.Basil Hallward is a merely average painter until he meets Dorian Gray and becomes his friend. But Dorian, who is blessed with an angelic beauty, inspires Hallward to create his ultimate masterpiece. Awed by the perfection of this rendering, he utters the wish to be able to retain the good looks of his youth while the picture were the one to deteriorate with age. But when Dorian discovers the painting cruelly altered and realizes that his wish has been fulfilled, he ponders changing his hedonistic approach.Dorian Gray's sharp social criticism has provoked audible controversy and protest upon the book's 1890 publication, and only years later was it to rise to classical status. Written in the style of a Greek tragedy, it is popularly interpreted as an analogy to Wilde's own tragic life. Despite this, the book is laced with the right amounts of the author's perpetual jaunty wit."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This has to be one of my favorite books of all time. This is breath-takingly honest look at life when the physical is all we look at...and many of us do.From the brilliant quotes to the numerous times when Dorian Gray proves what a scoundrel he is, this book makes any reader think and enjoy their own lives much more to see what that type of thinking causes. Here is a man who looks lke a Greek God and he takes everything for granted because he knows his powers will never allow his looks to be tarnished. Then he loses his sanity and actually commits murder on his artis who painted him and then does himself in!Not only brilliant, but pretty funny, too!Check out this book! It's a once in a lifetime experience!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The greatest marriage of classic literature and modern philosophy, poetry masquerading as prose, and a psychological epic in art-house clothing ever created! The genius of Oscar Wilde knew no bounds, and this book remains disturbingly chilling and alarmingly familiar over a hundred years after its first controversial publication. Though the plot could never exist anywhere outside of fiction, it is at once starkly shocking and believeable, never once wavering from the quietly accusing mood set early on.Dorian Gray is a beautiful youth who becomes painter Basil Hallward's artistic obsession, and the masterpiece painting Basil creates of Dorian seems to mock the young man, who grows jealous of the fact that it will never grow old or ugly, as he knows he will. He silently curses the painting and wishes it would age instead of him, and eerily enough, the painting becomes in itself a picture of Dorian's vain, ugly, hedonistic, and murderous soul.Indelibly true and deliciously quirky, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a treasure trove of genius observations and statements so true and yet so stunning you'll be forced to look over it a second time, just to make sure you didn't miss any of Wilde's poignant words. Well worth your time and energy, this book is reason enough to fake sick from school or work so you'll have the extra time to read it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde is a man who is obsessed by appearances. In this particular novel, he follows from the moment Dorian Gray sells his soul to the devil named beauty and youth, pleasure and enjoyment, to his death and he describes how someone who looks perfect, perfectly young, intelligent, brilliant, beautiful, moral and healthy is in fact nothing but a monster decaying in all possible immoral actions, deeds and ways just under the surface. It is a very strong criticism of victorian society that considers appearances as more important than real ethics and morality. He exposes the hypocrisy of such a society where a whole class of people are nothing but perambulating pictures of perfection hiding the mire and mud of crime and evil. We can also feel another dilemma in this book. Oscar Wilde's own dilemma who has to keep up appearances, the appearances of a well behaved, well educated and perfectly integrated man in this aristocratic society of his, and who yet lives a passion and a whole basket of desires and impulses that are absolutely rejected as crimes by victorian society. We know he will not be able to hide this deeper nature forever. But the book shows that no one can evade one's being exposed and rejected, condemned and sentenced to some punishment forever. There always comes a moment when one will be exposed and rejected. This shows how deeply Oscar Wilde must have suffered in his life. The painting is nothing but a mirror of the deeper self of Dorian Gray, but a mirror who will become one day his accuser.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Wow.

It is beautifully done like a silk tapestry or a work of art. His ideas about life and what place art has in life are equally as interesting. It is obvious to the reader from the moment he or she picks up the book that it is mostly about art, as the title itself shows---The Picture of Dorian Gray. It becomes clear to the reader Art was the true basis for this book. Dorian himself is a physically beautiful man who collects art, and he enjoys all the splendor of a fashionable existence. Oscar Wilde was a man who also shared interest in these things so it clear that the base for his most successful book is his ideas about art ( as show in the preface) the relation ship between artist observer and art. The characters in this book are playing the parts of his opinions of art wonderfully and in doing so reveal to the reader their inner most thoughts and feelings.Dorian and his painting that he holds so dear each have a different place in Oscar Wilde's ideals as the art and the artist .One of Oscar Wilde's statements about art is \\"The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is the artist's aim\\". (3). Dorian's outside appearance that he \\"reveals\\" becomes an illusion, a sort of mask, which hides or \\"conceals\\" his inner unhappiness and inability to live. Dorian's outer persona becomes his \\"art\\", the elegant illusion that he offers to the world, while his inner feelings are the \\"artist\\". Dorian's \\"artist\\" is his soul, but in fact while he is revealing this beautiful surface to the world and enchanting everyone he is concealing his true self. He separates himself from the aging and corrupted painting. Putting on this act is to \\"conceal the artist\\" which is the artist's aim. For Dorian Gray, hiding away all signs of aging and keeping up a surface youth, beauty, and innocence is creating himself as a work of art. This point is further illustrated in the text when after basil's visit to him he nearly goes mad about protecting his painting or his soul \\"when his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.... yet he thought it best to be on his guard...his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work ...Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing...Now, it was to hide something that had a corruption of it's own, worse than the corruption of death itself-something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.\\"(103-4). The most obvious point that this paragraph shows is Dorian's need to \\"conceal\\" his soul or himself. The Venetian coverlet symbolizes Dorian's \\"art\\" or need for splendor and beautiful things to conceal his true identy. Dorian's need to conceal himself is shown with literal symbolization he is taking his art or Venetian coverlet and putting it over his \\"painting\\" to hide his soul. As the paragraph goes on he describes the painting or his \\"soul\\" in a way that shows you his true feelings about his soul he thinks of himself as being corrupt, horrible, and worse than death and naturally wants to separate his art or outter self from his painting or inner self. Oscar Wilde's theory's about art and artist's relationship connects perfectly with Dorian grays feelings about himself.Dorian has no conscience about other people's feelings because he does not expect his own which relates to Oscar Wilde's opinion that an artist has no ethical sympathies. Oscar Wilde says, \\"No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style\\" (p. 3). Dorian seems to be without human emotions. He remembers his parents only through their outward appearance--- the lips or shape of the face that he has inherited. He does not remember their feelings for him or his attachment to them. It may have been that he was raised without emotional ties. The only time that his family is mentioned, Dorian calls his memories of them hateful (p. 103). In Victorian High society, feelings and emotions were considered less worthy than opinions or ideas. This has caused Dorian to grow up and not understand moral conscience he believes that the only thing that is important is new innovation and ideas, because he was taught to be that way. That is demonstrated when he decides to show Basil his soul:\\"You can tell the whole world about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you, if they did believe; they would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do\\" (p, 133). He says that his age---the end of the nineteenth century---was more pre-occupied with style than substance, so his youthful glamour---and the fact that the had a secret for escaping ageing---would inspire envy and imitation, not horror. But it is show in the story with basil's reaction to the painting or his \\"soul\\" that people will in fact be horrified by someone who destroys their soul by keeping themselves enterally young and beautiful or renovating their \\"art\\". And by saying \\" I know the age better than you do \\" he is actually proving the opposite and that he doesn't have any ethical sympathies because he so obviously doesn't the nineteenth- century does care about a persons soul. It also relates to the modern day struggle over plastic surgery whether it is a way to keep yourself beautiful or a way to become obsessed with your appearance and destroy your morality you could say that a modern day Dorian Gray is a Michael Jackson someone who is once loved and admired by his public but then after turning to plastic surgery and shopping to better his appearance he becomes a joke and loses his admiration much like Dorian Gray. They both do not relate to the public and have lost their moral conscience do to constantly trying to better their appearance or better their \\"art\\". Dorian Gray doesn't understand other people's ideals because he is not willing to except the fact that he thinks of his internal self as an ugly disgusting thing. Dorian plays into Oscar Wilde's opinions about artists not having ethical sympathies because he does not understand moral conscience of his society. He also shows the reader his inner feelings that he thinks of himself as something awful.Basil and Dorian are like art and observer basil's ideals about Dorian are mirrored on to him. Basil Howard's influence is reflected in this quote from the preface; \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their own peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" (p. 3). The spectator in this story is Basil Howard. Basil Howard sees Dorian through his own eyes as a beautiful young man who is full of life and innocence. Basil's soul of truth, love, kindness and caring for others is put into his painting. Dorian's external appearance is appreciated by a spectator (Basil) so it begins to mirror what the spectator sees, and other people also come to see Dorian as a prince of art. Like when an observer looks at art they interpretative it in their own way. This is shown when basil comes to talk to Dorian about the way he is perceived to society \\"I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you to get rid of the hateful people you associate with...you have wonderful influence, let it be for good and not evil\\" (p, 132). This shows basils admiration for Dorian and the way that he thinks of Dorian that it mirrored in the way that he will see him. He is in fact saying that he wants to lead a life where the world respects him and that he has wonderful influence because all he knows about Dorian Gray is what he knows about himself. In the page before basil talks about Dorian's face and the way that he looks means that must not be a bad person but that is only a surface opinion, like that you have of art, once you learn something about the artist, you interpret in another way. Basil doesn't know Dorian's \\"artist\\" or soul he doesn't see him he only sees himself, so basils beautiful heart and soul are projected onto Dorian's appearance. Again Oscar Wilde's ideals of the relationship between the artist and the spectator are interpreted on to his characters Dorian is just a mirror of basil, Just as art is just a mirror of the spectator. It also shows that basil wants to respected by the world, and have wonderful influence.A person could spend days and pages and pages explaining why Oscar Wilde's ideas of art reflect on the characters of The Picture of Dorian Gray and what it reveals about the characters true feelings. Here are the most important Dorian Gray and his painting reflect on the his ideas of the artist and the art, Dorian Gray and his ideas of artists not having ethical sympathies, and that Dorian and Basils relationship is the same as the art and the artists relationship. And a person could also go into the fact that according to Oscar Wilde's ideals about art the critic is he who can translate into another manner and I hope that was done in this essay.please anyone don't steal thi sessay as your own, because believe it or not if your teacher is smart and will type in the first sentance of this essay in google and this will come right up and you will be expelled.thank you for reading"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Who knows? But right-wing orthodox Catholic monarchist readers will be required to steel themselves through the first two chapters which consist of a drawn-out slap fight between Elton John, Graham Norton and Ian McKellan. Now I like a cat-fight as much as the next guy, but a tussle among effete Brit cats with man parts is just icky. So the narcissistic homo-erotic banter opening the book was significantly under-appreciated by this reader. But after you get through those chapters the book gets much, much better.It is difficult to maintain that the book represents a defense of amoral Aestheticism, since the embodiment of the aesthetic ideal, Dorian Gray, is shown to be a damned man. That is not to say that Wilde embraces Catholicism in the novel, as the narrator often posits confusing opinions on issues of conscience and sin. At times Wilde seems to suggest that only immoderate (quantitatively speaking) behavior is immoral; and yet, at other times, it appears some actions themselves ought to be avoided. Is Wilde acknowledging that there are exceptionless moral norms? And what is the reader to make of rotten Wotton, whose epigrammatic phrases seem so akin to Wilde's? Hallward points out that Wotton's cynicism is a pose. He never says a moral thing, but he never does a wrong thing. So are we to take his Wilde-isms seriously? Are we to take Wilde seriously? Wilde says art is neither moral nor immoral, yet Gray is poisoned by A Rebors, a book by another decadent author who, oddly enough, also converted to Catholicism. And then there's the picture itself, the fruit of Hallward's homosexual obsession, which is clearly cursed, in spite of its initial apparent beauty.Wilde's protests notwithstanding, it is a book with a moral informing the reader that he cannot escape his conscience, that he cannot reject nature and nature's God, and that the wages of sin are death. But therein lies hope, for if God is to be believed regarding the wages of sin, then why should we doubt Him regarding our Redemption? Unfortunately, this message is made ambiguous by an author who, rather than unintentionally creating a distorted image of an idea that cannot be fully represented, intentionally peppers the novel with paradox for the sake of cuteness. But the Truth is not cute. He's terrifying, and Wilde knows better. Therefore the book is best left to the orthodox or the decadent.

I couldn't relate to the British aristocracy system and was utterly appalled at how unbelievably shallow the characters were, although Wilde was probably going for that effect. I was also disappointed with the ending. I thought the point of the novel would be to eliminate the stereotype that bad people are ugly, but it just perpetuated it.

I feel that Oscar Wilde used this as a semi-autobiographical vehicle to transport his radical, eccentric ideas and ideals. He speaks through his characters of Lord Henry and Dorian Gray. They seek to justify debauchery and murder and they kill off anyone who is good, kind, moral or differs in opinion with them. A good read, perhaps, for the likes of the 42nd president of the USA.

The narrative is characteristic of the author's flamboyant nature and readers will find certain descriptions a little uncanny. Overall, this is an interesting story, written with purpose and to me this was the most important thing. Although the moral of the story has been copied over by many other authors (with slight variations), the dilemma remains the same - is one willing to sacrifice his internal peace for the price of the eternal beauty? The best answer to this question is a quote from Thomas Wolfe: \\"The surest cure for vanity is loneliness.\\"- by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"What would you do if someone or something else took all the falls for your sins?Dorian Gray made a life changing wish, that he might, forever, stay looking young and beautiful, that his portrait should bear all the marks of age and sin that would ever befall him. Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of \`relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"A book for all time.

This story is about a young man who grows to be a sinful and terribly vain man driven by love, beauty and art.The Main character, Dorian Gray, at the beginning of the book is a beautiful and youthful man. Dorian was a man everyone wanted to be around just because he had innocence and he was different. \\"He has a simple and beautiful nature.\\" Says Basil Hallward. This innocence and beauty changes as he becomes friends with Lord Henry and his values of life change him. Because Dorian was so nave, Lord Henry lured Dorian into a whole new life and new philosophies about love, beauty and selfishness. This is not the only deep friendship that is developed in this book. Dorian also becomes friends with Basil Hallward and Basil paints a portrait of Dorian and Basil puts his whole heart into this painting for it to ultimately destroy himself and Dorian. Anyway, Dorian wishes that he could stay young all his life and always be beautiful. As he grows older Dorian does many terrible and shocking things but he still remains beautiful and untouched while his painting of himself shows the real nasty, terrible, and corrupted Dorian.One part of the book that really captivated me is when Dorian murder's one of his good friends. I think this is one of the turning points in the book because I believe Dorian realizes that life shouldn't be based on the appearance of things but more about quality and spirit. Dorian understands that his lifestyle of upscale parties with London's elite, and his friendship with Lord Henry is not all that it seems to be. You can see that after Dorian murders someone he questions himself and the painting because he realizes what the painting has done to him. During the last pages of the book we can see how Dorian self-destructs and finds away to restore the painting of exquisite and youth.This book was very different from anything I read and I loved it. I like how Oscar Wilde wrapped me into this book with many compelling and interesting thoughts. The main lessons I learned from this book is question your role models and to value your life. Another lesson I learned is to not worry about beauty because if we only pick things that are beautiful we miss the wonderful and mysterious things that don't look pretty but deep inside they are."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel is one of the best books I have ever read. The story is fascinating, and one that most people have heard of--that Dorian Gray, a young, beautiful man, makes a fervent wish that he would never grow old, and that the portrait just painted by his artist friend would age instead. This occurs, leading Dorian down a path of debauchery and cruelty, most of which must have been too horrific for Oscar Wilde to go into detail without violating obscenity laws.The book is a masterpiece in examining manipulation. The artist introduces Dorian to a friend, Lord Henry, who calls Dorian's attention to his beauty, and Dorian, formerly innocent and sweet, becomes vain. It is amazing to see just how potent the power of suggestion is, and this novel demonstrates it perfectly.The writing is less than perfect. One chapter goes on and on about artifacts that Dorian has collected around the world, leaving the reader saying, &quot;Okay, and who cares?&quot; Wilde's prose is far from flawless, but the story is so engaging that the reader will be willing to overlook the imperfections and will be intrigued in spite of this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This fascinating story of extreme narcissism and moral dilemna provides food for thought on the author's strange and sometimes twisted views on society as played out by the characters.

I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil. The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins. Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue. Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul. And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness. It's sad that for all of Dorian's shallowness he had to physically see it to feel the weight of his conscience instead of just knowing what he was doing was wrong but this is the flaw of the character and the reason behind his downfall. Dorian was a true aesthete to a dangerous extreme. Oscar Wilde was making a statement about society that many even today either don't get or don't want to get.The Picture of Dorian Gray is written in a nice flowing prose. It's written in a third person perspective novel, not first person perspective, not alternating, and certainly not epistolary (which was a very popular style of fiction writing in Oscar Wilde's time).I strongly recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray.

It is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde was born in Dublin in 1854. He was a poet, playwright and author, though is perhaps a little more widely known for his wit. He studied at both Trinity College Dublin and at Oxford's Magdalen College - where he became a part of the Aesthetic Movement. At Trinity, he won the Berkeley Gold Medal while at Magdalene, he won the Newdigate Prize in 1878. He subsequently graduated from Magdalene with a double first - however, he failed to be elected to the Oxford Union, which is something I'd imagine they're very embarrassed about now. After a very colourful - though, at times, difficult - life, he died in 1900 and is buried in Pere Lachaise in Paris. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Wilde's only novel, and was first published in 1891.Basil Hallward is a highly-regarded and well-known artist. As the book opens, he has just completed his latest portrait - one of his latest muse, a young gentleman called Dorian Gray. Hallward's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, thinks it's the finest work completed by Hallward and suggests it should be exhibited in the Grosvenor - Hallward, however, disagrees. He feels he has put too much of himself into the portrait, insisting it would reveal more of the painter than the subject. Basil has become obsessed with Gray : he sees him daily, and describes his presence as \\"absolutely necessary\\". Wotton naturally becomes intrigued, and is keen to meet Gray. Basil, on the other hand, wants to keep them apart - knowing Henry would be the worst possible influence. Unfortunately, Gray calls round unexpectedly and he has to introduce them...Basil's fears were well founded. By the end of their first conversation, Dorian is completely in Henry's thrall and is convinced that his youth and beauty will only gradually fail - leaving him with nothing of value. He offers his soul, if his looks remain as they are, while his portrait ages in his place. Under Henry's guidance, Dorian dedicates to the \\"new Hedonism\\" - and, in time, he notices the portarit not only ages but becomes more hideous with each sin.I found it difficult to see exactly how Basil and Henry came to be friends. Apart from a little pretentiousness and plenty of flouncing - especially in the book's early pages - they appeared to have nothing in common. I did find it a little difficult to take Henry seriously, though - luckily, for the book - Dorian proves to be as impressionable as he is vain. He is dominated by Henry's malign influence and - despite occasionally considering returning to the straight and narrow via Basil - generally remains happy to follow the path Henry set out for him. A book that gets better as it goes along, as it starts to deal with Dorian's internal struggles - and is certainly much better than some other classics I've read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have never read this book before getting it for my Kindle.

A morality tale wrapped up in a story dripping with homoeroticism and hedonism. I can't imagine how much pleasure Wilde had when he wrote this story and how much went on his head that never actually made it onto the page as a result of the laws of the time. This luscious, lusty Faustian tale is so dark and delicious; discreet when it has to be, suggestive when it wants to be. And the picture I have of Dorian Gray in my mind is that of the most beautiful man on earth--yes, we're all suckers for a bad boy, aren't we!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I'm really not sure why a lot of people have not read this. It truly is a work that can only be appreciated when read and reread. This is my second time reading through the pages that Wilde weaves with this epigrams and curious cascading delight for words. Each sentence is as interesting and beautiful as the last as he speaks of sin conveyed in the most interesting of manners.Truly, Dorian is a fall from grace. A Lucifer that could have looked upon what he would become if he had the choice. Perhaps the concept of the Devil hanging over Dorian's shoulder is what makes this story so interesting. Sin never weathers Dorian's face, he remains as beautiful as he was when he was in the prime of the human age. Only the tell-tale signs of age and sin and hate and cruelty are etched upon the portrait that Basil so intricately painted. It is an ugly thing that portrays every crime Dorian ever committed. Even, towards the end of the novel, when he wished to become 'good' the old sin cannot be washed away. Even so, Dorian cannot conform to the 'good life' and instead forces himself to an unknowing demise because he cannot cope with the prospect of living a wholesome life. He would have to give up the sweet taste of sin, that which he had known without reprimand for years."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Dorian Gray is an exceptionally handsome young man, but when he sees his portrait and realizes his own beauty he wishes that the painting would grow old while he could remain young. At first he is mortified when he finds changes in his painted image, but influenced by a friend Dorian begins to seek the pleasures in life. No matter what depths he sinks to his handsome face remains unchanged, while the portrait grows uglier and more hideous, burdened not only by age but by his debauched lifestyle.I don't know if this work of literature is as widely read as it maybe once was but I was quite taken in by the story. It's interesting that Dorian, instead of using the portrait as a type of conscience to correct his actions, instead takes strange delight in observing the change. He revels in his freedom from outward consequences and digs deeper, delving into every pleasure. In some ways the separate manifestations of the individual reminded me ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, while his recognition of his outward appeal and how it would fade seemed to have shades of Bradbury'sDandelion Wine. And the character of Lord Henry is interesting, always in the background congratulating him and encouraging Dorian's sensual hedonism. But it's also a critique of society, both Victorian and today: we spend our time and money trying to reverse the effects of age (the gym, cosmetics and cosmetic surgery, etc.); companies spend billions idealizing (or idolizing) \\"youth\\"; and some even even seek to excuse away weakness and place blame elsewhere. In all, it may not be a perfect story but it's very interesting and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was an amazing book that had an incredable thought process.

It's better the second or third time.Dorian Gray, a fabulously good-looking young man with a poetic glow about him, starts out innocent and pure. His more worldly acquaintances spoil him with many observations on how wonderful it must be to be young and fabulously handsome.Reflecting on his own beauty in an amazingly like portrait of himself, his obsession becomes never growing old. The earnest prayer he utters before the portrait grants his wish. Now only the portrait will show the effects of age. And the stains on his character.For the rest of the book we see his life become his beauty. All the other important things in life fall away. Everyone wishes they could have his life of fortune and youth, but they have no idea how his soul is suffering. Neither does he.There are some passages that might appear wordy. There are many moving and inspiring passages, if one takes the time to reflect on them.This is a great book.

The book builds up beautifully towards the climax.

It's easy to see why the book aroused so much controversy when it was released, and why it had an integral role in Wilde's subsequent imprisonment: the moral dilemna the book presents is disturbing even today. Wilde was truly a great writer; it's obvious from reading this book. Not only was his wit top-notch as is often ackwnoledged, but his prose is very smooth and polished, very refined. Wilde's attitudes towards art are well-known - indeed, he says in the book's introduction that \\"all art is quite useless\\" - but it seems obvious now that he was a natural talent. I hesitate to say things like He was meant to be a writer, but it certainly seems true of Wilde. This is one of the books that shakes our moral foundations. Wilde's high-class lifestyle is well-documented - it seems his surname was utterly appropriate - and one can definitely see where the plot and perhaps some of the details of this book came from his own experience. Undoubtedly, the main premise of the novel - a man selling his soul for eternal youth - most likely sprung from a desire that Wilde himself expressed. Perhaps he was having doubts about his hedonistic lifestyle even when this book was written, several years before his imprisonment. One can conjecture all one wants, but the fact remains that this book is a marvelous piece of work. The wonderful, polished prose is a joy to read - with aphorisms abound - and I, for one, see it as a deep regret that this was the only novel Wilde ever wrote. We missed out on a lot of great literature, especially with the general disdain the plays are now looked upon with in our society. Alas, read this masterpiece, and you will miss out less."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since.

Wilde provides an irresistible coupling of his fascinating wisdom and seductive voice in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, a self-portrait.In a story of forbidden love, Wilde languishes in an idyllic setting eager with curous onlookers whom he delights in stimulating. He insists upon being provocative and alluring, taking 'strange pleausre in saying things that he is not sorry about having said.' THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is an image drawn by a lover whose passion for realism is transcended only by the hands of a writer who leaves everything to your imagination. As Dorian Gray protests, &quot;Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to.&quot;But this IS a book about thinking - and deeply. A book that fathoms the deep erotic recesses of the human heart and speaks its language perfectly."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Dorian Gray was definately an excellent book, although the wording was somewhat outdated. It is an excellent piece of work, but I just had one question about it. Do you really think it was all Dorian's fault that everything happened? I believe Dorian's horrid fate would never have existed if Lord Henry had not been introduced to him. Lord Henry put outrageous ideas into an innocent litte head, and should be noticed as the fault of all of Gray's actions. It just killed me that no one realized what was really happening! But besides that question of fault, it was a grade A book, that I would read again, but not without a dictionary by my side. I recommend it to anyone who likes intelectual reading, and who is willing to sit through outdated talk. Just go for it, it's worth your time, and better yet... it's a short novel!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"A tale of beuty, love, innocence and cruelty. Wilde did a wonderful job of telling the story of young Dorian Gray, a timeless beuty that never shows his age and whose face never displays his sins. He betrays close friends, is fuel for many a suicide, is down right cruel and unfeeling to any of his numerous loves, is selfish and self immersed; yet his young, beutiful face never shows a trace of ill being. Being in a room with him, drowns anyone with pleasure, peacefulness and charm- it is impossible to look at his face and believe that someone so sweet and innocent in looks would commit any of the evil he is rumored to have done. Instead of himself being affected, a portait of him as a young man endures the strain of his uncouth behavior.This timeless tale, set in England at the turn of the century, would be an excellent story line for any modern novel and would make a wonderful movie. Wilde's writting style is proliferic, poignant and delightful. It captures the language of the time period, yet was easy to read and easy to relate to. Wilde conveys the evil of the aestetic world and how it can drive one to stop at nothing for fear of losing it. And though he hints at such controversial topics such as drugs and homosexuality; it is neither detailed nor graphic; and is only slightly touched on. Throughout the novel, Wilde creates an image and lets the reader fully develop it for himself. I absolutley adored this book and highly reccomend it to anyone. Not for a moment did I think it dull, or too wordy. It is a very easy read (which is difficult to say of such a classic), and incredibly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book fits Wilde's description of a cigarette as a perfect pleasure - portable and brief, yet leaving you unsatisfied. Like Dorian Gray himself, this book is superficially charming, with its numerous and clever epigrams, but with some very ugly undercurrents, e.g. virulent anti-semitism, misogyny, and homosexuality. We never connect emotionally with Dorian Gray, who never matures into a complex or interesting character, but remains as some gay ideal with psychosis. Read Henry James' &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; or Edith Wharton's &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; for a far better written, devastating attack on Victorian morals and hypocrisy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Indudablemente Oscar Wilde es uno de los m&aacute;s grandes escritores de la Literatura Universal; pero m&aacute;s que eso fue uno de los pocos que se atrevi&oacute; a enfrentar a una sociedad adoctrinada y primitiva, siempre dispuesta a estigmatizar aquellos que no se alineaban con los patrones impuestos por ellos mismos.

He doesn't grow old but the picture of him does, in the most awful and frightening ways.Dorian shows his friend who painted the picture how it has changed - his friend reaches for a knife and charges at the picture. Dorian restrains his companion and kills him with the knife. Dorian grows more and more evil as the picture grows from awful to hideous.

Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale. The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale.

And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was a great allegory.

Certainly, it is dated insofar as many other Edwardian novels out of Nineteenth Century England seem trite and shallow (faring badly with what was coming out of Russia at the time: Gripping, universal, human stories from titanic authors like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy). But, cultural handicaps aside, let's give Wilde his due: The book is a treasure trove of wit--from his brilliant epigrams to its very fascinating plot, which anticipates Magical Realism by at least 50 years. That is to say, when one thinks of &quot;Twilight Zone-esque&quot; writing one is put in mind of Kafka, Borges or Grabriel Garcia-Marquez. The best in World Literature. But all of these writers take their cues from Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book was so well written and covers so many important, seemingly timeless dilemmas that I felt guilty while I was reading it. Even though there is no explicit language, there was a subtle sexual undertone throughout the work that was frightening. It is one of those books that people love to hate and hate to love because it hits so close to home for people in so many walks of life. I think the reason it can touch so many people is because it makes people wonder about how well their friends would think they are doing rather than how well they themselves think they are doing. \\"What would I look like if the mirror were to show my 'inner' self rather than my 'outer' self?\\" is the pervasive question here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I enjoyed reading this book I chose it because of the Author.

I'm a fan of Oscar Wilde, and I could'ntmiss this great classical novel. The book is dominated by two amazing and strong personalities :Dorian Gray,a character full of life, and his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton.The story is deliciously dark and unusual, and as far as I know this is the only novel Wilde hadever written. It provides an interesting look on the society of the time through this multi-layeredstory, and Dorian Gray is a perfect representation of the human species. The novel depicts anundeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, and allows thereader to understand better why it upset the British society that was emerging from the socialconstraints of Victorianism. I appreciated the beauty of his writing style, always elegant, witha flow that looks like poetry all along the book.

We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well.

Oscar Wilde was a \\"wild child\\", and he gives a glimpse into the often vain and decadant world of English society through the wanton excesses of Dorian...who appears to remain beautiful, youthful, and untouched by evil. It is Dorian's portrait that decays with every misdeed, including murder. The picture haunts Dorian as he travels among the rich, and also into the opium dens and low life of the waterfront. This edition contains a glossary of lesser known terms and references, for us modern folk. It was a quick and fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I knew relatively little going into this book...and what little I did know was from less than 100% accurate retellings such as in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or references from cheesy shows or horror flicks (I think perhaps there was a reference in Scooby Doo somewhere?). I had the basic gist...there's a guy, Dorian Gray, who has some magical painting that ages while he stays young and wonderful forever. Not much to go on, but I was still excited to read it. I was pleasantly surprised that the book had much more depth to it.&lt;u>Plot&lt;/u>The plot is intriguing and has been used in other stories, though I think this one has more depth than I've seen before. Essentially, Dorian makes a wish that he will be forever as pristine as the painting made of him and that instead the painting will take on it the toils of his life. Whatever supernatural forces allow this to happen are irrelevant...the wish is granted.It's more than a simple \\"young forever\\" contract. Although age plays into the plot in a couple of places, the primary things that distorts the picture are the vices that Dorian engages in. The first transformation of the painting happens after an intense argument with the first woman he loved. It was interesting to me how quickly Dorian recognized the cause of the change for what it was, but had he belabored the motive for too long, the pacing of the book would have stalled and become unacceptable.Dorian uses his \\"power\\" to be ruthlessly reckless in his living. Dorian Gray becomes entirely uninhibited, taking everything to its limit, seeking absolute pleasure. He even sneaks out at night (so as not to tarnish his pristine reputation) to the \\"bad side of town\\" and lives a sort of double life in opium dens with gangs and prostitutes.In many ways (perhaps because I so recently read it), I felt many similarities to the morale commentary presented in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I felt that Wilde did a better job of delving into the psyche of the hypocritical character, largely because we were able to get into Dorian's head and think and feel with him, while in Jekyll/Hyde, we were kept at a distance by a third person narrative.&lt;u>Characters&lt;/u>There are three pivotal characters in this book.The first, obviously, is Dorian himself. For the first many chapters (perhaps nearly the first half of the book in fact), I wasn't terribly pleased with Dorian as a character...he felt very flat to me. He was basically a mirror to one of the other primary characters (Harry) and didn't ever show his own opinion. He was hailed as pure and beautiful. Perhaps it's all the art references in the book, but I often felt as if Dorian existed more as a classical statue than as a living, breathing character. As his interaction with the 'picture' progresses and once he takes some rather unexpected steps, he became a deeper character and a lot of fun to be with.The second primary character is Lord Harry (or was it Henry...blast those Brits for swapping those names interchangeably so often *grin*). Harry exists as the provocative, cynical, always-with-a-comment-about-anything mentor to Dorian. Harry is absolutely encouragable and a lot of fun to listen to. His speeches often have to do with the pursuit of pleasure at any and all costs and the hazard of a virtuous and peaceful life. His influence over Dorian is profound. As I mentioned above, it often felt as if Dorian existed merely as a mirror for Harry's advice. Harry didn't seem to follow all of his own advice, but Dorian took it readily to heart and strove to live a 'come-what-may' existence. Harry had some of the funniest and most profound comments of the entire narrative. He's a fabulous character.The third character I want to point out actually existed as more of a background character, but I feel the need to call him out merely because of his pivotal involvement in the plot. I actually can't even remember his name now...but it will suffice to call him, \\"the artist.\\" He's the one who paints Dorian's picture. He's the one who introduces Dorian to Harry. He's the one who tries to give Dorian good advice to counter all the reckless advice that Harry poisons him with. The artist was kind of like Dorian's \\"Jiminey Cricket\\"...his conscious that was often (always?) ignored until it was far too late. He showed up in surprisingly few scenes considering the huge importance he had to the plot.&lt;u>Style, Pacing, etc&lt;/u>The language used in this book was truly beautiful. Wilde wrote flowing, vivid descriptions of characters, places and actions. At times it was very poetic. It may be a bit too flowery for readers who don't enjoy that sort of description...it came very close to being 'over the top' to me in a few places. Still, I generally enjoyed the formality of it and the life it gave to the text. The first dozen or two pages were tedious to me...whether because of the language or just the style and thematic pacing, I'm not sure.The pacing was a bit slower than I would have liked. The main difficulty I saw was that Wilde was trying to present so many themes that he often had to result to lengthy passages praising or condemning one thing or another. There were often very long monologues by one of the three primary characters mentioned above. Harry's were generally offset by bits that made me laugh by their extremity while speeches from Dorian and the artist sometimes made me want to slap them and tell them to shut up.&lt;u>Overall&lt;/u>I was a little torn on my overall feeling for the book. It took me a while to get into it and there were long passages that were drudgerous to push through. However, from a high level, this is one of the better books I've read this year...or even for numerous years. It had a plenitude of intriguing themes that left me thinking in between readings. It had a lot of humorous quips and paradigms as presented by Harry that I laughed out loud at. It had surprising twists and tension that left me curious as to the true outcome (as opposed to that from rip-off stories). There are a couple of spots that could be considered \\"climax\\"...the confrontation with the artist is the main turning point in the book. Personally, I would have rather seen more pages after that turning point than before it. I think the last 1/3 of the book was far more engaging. At the same time, the buildup was necessary to promote the intended mood.Overall, this is a book I definitely recommend, with the caveat that you should be aware that it does slow down at points. Just push through those. The overall work is worthy of a couple of slow zones. In fact, perhaps those slow zones serve the purpose of allowing more pondering.****4.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This was a rather difficult book to get through.

The use of descriptive language and mood is exquisite.The only downsides that I can mention would be how slowly it moves in some spots. Once in a while, the story takes sort of a vacation, and you are given a lot of details that don't really apply to the overall plot. Some of the things that are discussed are good at shedding light on some of the things that Mr. Gray was doing throughout the years that this book took place, but they can get a little boring. Truth be told, I skipped most of one chapter because it went on, and on, and on about the things that piqued Dorian Gray's interest. It doesn't stop there, but it explains why it did, what he did about it, and some other people that he associated with while he was pursuing a certain subject, like gemology. In this edition, many of the names that are given through these pages are given an endnote in the back, but to the average person these don't hold much interest. Even to some hardcore fans of classic literature and Gothic Horror could find certain chapters (one at least) very tedious.That being said, there is certainly more good in this book than needed to balance out the less interesting parts. In the beginning, we get to see where the corruption of young Mr. Gray comes from. As the book progresses, you can see the corruption finally consume him, culminating in a surprising finale. I read at work, and my jaw dropped more than once, which I only realized after a co-worker brought attention to it. Even though most people have heard of the themes in the book, this is a fine example of taking an existing theme, and making it into a brilliant new idea.The ideas contained in this book can be a little disturbing to some with a weak stomach. Some of the language can be a little stiff and hard to read, but remember it was written in the 1890's.This book is highly recommended for anybody who has an interest in the Classics or Gothic Horror. Not for the faint of heart, but if it's ever crossed your mind to read The Picture of Dorian Gray, pick this book up! If you want to start reading Gothic Horror, I would suggest something a little lighter to start with -- Edgar Allan Poe, The Phantom of the Opera, or something like that. Those are a little easier, and give you a good idea of what the genre is all about.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"\`So, Henry, how is that young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of yours progressing, hem?Lord Henry paused to saviour his glass. Pleased, he set it down, just so, beside his dinner plate, and turned to Lord Fermor.\`Pundits say troubles come in threes, Uncle,' replied Lord Henry. \`What the pundits omit in their gabardine rush to spread their misery to others in a foolish attempt to alleviate their own, is that the best in life never travels solo. Take, for example, the wine and dinner before us. Both French. Together they constitute a meal to entice the gods down from the Mount. When did you ever come across a bad French meal, or a good French man? Yet when wine and food march together, they repay the Creator.'\`No doubt,' replied Lord Fermor, \`but you evade the issue. I asked about the young chap you have taken into your entourage, you know.' Lord Fermor struggled to recall the name, \`that chap who poses for Mr Hallward here.'Basil Hallward felt the heat of recognition first on his brow, then running through his whole body. A retiring man, more at home with his easels and sitters than at high table, he shrank from the public glare.Recognising the signs, though failing to sympathise with them, Lady Agatha piped up.\`Mr Hallword has many sitters, do you not, Sir.'\`Er, yes, indeed I do,' replied Mr Hallward, grateful for the prompt. \`For example, just today I encountered a young man of exquisite appearance, youth in all its pomp. He has promised to sit for me. Lord Henry, I fancy, will try to take him away and teach him of the world, thereby spoiling him as a object d'art.' He laughed to denote humour, simultaneously glancing at his friend to convey the serious meaning behind his joke. Keep away Lord Henry, the glanced announced, shielded behind the laughter. Keep away from this young man lest you send him on the eternal search for fulfilment and in so doing corrupt his soul.Lord Henry roared.\\"Why Basil, you surpass yourself! Hiding a serious message behind a joke so that you may deliver it in public. Would that the Good Book decked itself in such garlands, the better to frighten the masses. You are a greater artist than your canvasses know.'\`I fear my husband is avoiding your question, Lord Fermor,' laughed Lady Victoria. \`When it comes to hiding a serious message behind the veil of farce, he may rival Dante himself.'\`What is the name of your young beauty?' Inquired Lord Henry amidst the general humour. \`I only ask,' he pressed, \`so that I may avoid him. Let us hope I have more success than Eve, who expressed no desire to harvest the only tree in the garden that contained a serpent, until admonished not to. Of course,' Lord Henry continued, \`our Creator did not warn off the firstborn with laughter on his lips. Had he done so, perhaps we would be consuming ambrosia still. Mind you,' he reflected, \`this French cuisine is an adequate substitute.'\`Yes yes yes Henry,' broke in Lord Fermor, \`but what about your young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e? Has he a fine future, seeking the dark mysteries of life of which you profess to be so fond?'\`Should he avoid hubris, I see for him a long, comfortable and satisfactory life.'\`And should he fail to avoid hubris?' teased Lady Agatha.\`Then I see for him immortality in print and prose. Hubris is man's affirmation of his living soul, his insistence that all must be as he ordains, and his rage that it is not. Should Basil paint hubris he would reveal Caliban.\`Modesty, on the other hand, is pleasing to the casual senses but fleeting, like snow on the chimneystack. Modesty and prose combine to produce the barely adequate. Hubris and prose combine to produce immortality, but not personal happiness.'\`And this choice, modesty of hubris, is one you see before Dorian Gray?' queried Mr Hallword.\`Dorian who?' Lord Henry responded. He reached again for the reassuring certainty in his wine glass. \`I was referring to my Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Oscar Wilde.'"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is definitely a disturbing book. I think there is great worth in reading it, particularly when paired with a book such as Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe or Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. Contrasting Dorian's sordid downfall with with the heroic ascension of Uncle Tom or Jean Valjean is particularly beneficial.The Picture of Dorian Gray begins with Dorian, a young and handsome gentleman who is involved with philanthropy, sitting for a portrait while his new friend, Lord Henry, a sarcastic and hedonistic man of society, watches on. Dorian is described as being \\"unspotted from the world\\" and his beauty inspires the artist to his very best work. Lord Henry exclaims how lovely the portrait has turned out, but laments that it is too bad that the picture will stay young forever, whereas Dorian will eventually age and lose his youth and beauty. A vexed Dorian makes a wish that he will stay timeless and the picture will age instead of him.Taking Lord Henry as a mentor, Dorian sets out to apply Lord Henry's selfish and narcissistic worldview into nearly every facet of his life. In time, Dorian realizes that his wish has magically come true. He remains beautiful, while his painting takes on all the consequences of his wicked actions. As the debased Dorian sins more and more, the picture becomes more hideous and tortures Dorian's soul.Despite being filled with Wilde's signature wit, this is a haunting story showing the consequence of selfish character and the downfall of the soul due to despicable and hideous behaviors. Dorian loses his inner beauty long before he realizes that his soul's ugliness will destroy him.It's interesting to note that he chooses a French novel as his own Core Book, a personal classic which guided him throughout his life. In comparison, Uncle Tom and Jean Valjean both chose the Bible as their Core book. Near the end of the book, Dorian laments, \\"You poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.\\"Wilde clearly shows that books exert an amazing influence over our lives. We must be wise in our choice of what we read. As Thoreau once said, \\"Read the best books first, or you may not have the chance to read them at all.\\" I would only add to that, \\"Read the best books most often, for they will color your soul.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"A classic and moving novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde discusses man's desire for youth, as well as his involvement in vanity. A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet grippingOscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her. We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \\"responsibly\\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \\"own sake\\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \\"Penguin\\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \\"Pocket Book\\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \\"Japanese effect\\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"All art is quite useless. Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century. Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake: he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty. The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality. At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it. Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young. Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach. It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain. Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art. Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity: \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" \\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy: the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is quite a book. Mr. Wilde has quite a literary ability. His characters are as vibrant as a Van Gogh, his plot is tense, and he has quite a gift for quips and comebacks. All of this combines for a great piece of literature, regardless of the topic or story.This book explores the darker side of humanity, along the lines of Faust, Dr. Jekyll, and Lord of the Flies. We all feel this dread and anxiety deep within our soul; Wilde does not hold a mirror, but a picture for us to look upon and marvel. You get the chills up and own your spine as you watch Lord Henry seduce Dorian Grey.I think the high point of the story was in Chapter XI when Dorian sets a mirror next to the foul picture and goes back and forth looking at his baby-face and then the incubus in the painting. What is crucial is that Dorian is so detached: he sees himself as the smooth-faced god, but in reality, he is the demon in the picture. But his detachment is what is so crucial. He knows what his soul looks like, but he doesn't care!At times this books seems like a play, which has Wilde's native element. But the prose has such a smooth flow that you do not notice.

He created something that people can relate to because each of us has a Dorian Gray within us, at least, to some degree.I don't know if Wilde meant to be so philosophical or psychological with this story, but it is a work of genius.

However, the portrait-a grotesque reminder of his double life-documents every immoral act.Focusing on duplicity and aestheticism, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a captivating and cinematic tale. Oscar Wilde's knack for dialogue is what made him a famous playwright and parts of Dorian Gray are rich with clever play-like exchanges.Lord Henry's wit is exceptionally tantalizing.

He's basically just a dumb pretty person that everyone coddles despite the fact that he's a terrible human being.**Side note**The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's only novel.

Woven through its themes of beauty, decadence, age, and the nature of art is a thread of shimmering doom that becomes more poignant the longer one spends with DORIAN GRAY and the more one considers its relationship with its author.It is a peacock's fan of luminous wit and glimmering color, dripping with venom and smelling of strange perfumes. We are all familiar with the general flavor of things: an innocent and exceptionally beautiful youth has his portrait painted one fateful afternoon; upon viewing the piece, he is paralyzed by the sudden revelation that one day he will be old and hideous while the painting will retain its beauty and life. In a devil's bargain, he wishes that it would be the other way around. And then, under the influence of a particularly deleterious gentleman, Dorian Gray begins to change: his innocence gives way to corruption and his beauty seems apt to languish under the spell of opium, cruelty, and languor. One day Dorian notices that the painting has begun to transform, while he himself retains all the beauty of an innocent despite the ever-swelling ocean of his sins...Few works of literature are as effervescent as DORIAN GRAY and just as few are as utterly pessimistic; that it is capable of fusing remarkably disparate parts into a whole that is absolutely cohesive is a fascinating example of its author's gifts. Like Wilde's SALOME, DORIAN GRAY is as colorful as it is bleak, and even its weaknesses, in context, seem like strengths.Seldom is an artist's most famous work also his most erudite and brilliant: this is one of those works. I have approached it perhaps six or seven times in the last five years, and each reading has left me more enraptured than the last--which is high praise for a novel that relies a great deal on suspense and aesthetic splendour. I consider it one of the finest things I have ever read--daring, sultry, venomous, eloquent, and radiant in its own decay.(From my Gothic fiction blog:[...]"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"My impetus for reading this book, since I read few novels, was a book entitled \\"The Ripper Code\\" by Thomas Toughill. That book's author posed the theory that in writing \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Oscar Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at one of his erstwhile friends, and possible homosexual lovers, as London's \\"Jack the Ripper.\\" This intrigued me, particularly since Wilde's book was published only a year or so after the last of the Ripper murders, and, as Toughill noted, Wilde and his suspect lived only about six miles from the Whitechapel district, where the murders took place, and Wilde clearly chose the date of the last Ripper murder, November 9, 1889, as the date which brought his story to its climax. So, in reading this book, I couldn't help but bear that in mind.After reading this book, it is clear that Wilde based some, if not all, of the main characters in his novel on persons whom he knew and, in all likelihood, on actual conversations he had had with those and other prominent people in London society. And there are certainly clear similarities between at least two of the most prominent characters in his novel and Wilde's friends: namely Dorian Gray, himself, and Wilde's presumed suspect, George Francis \\"Frank\\" Miles, an artist who contracted syphilis and died in 1891 shortly after the final Ripper murder; and Dorian's first love and suicide victim, the young actress Sybyl Vane, and the actress, Lilly Langtree, who Miles and Wilde both knew in her early days and whose career they clearly advanced. Other than that, however, there is little to suggest that Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at Miles or at anyone else.As for the novel itself, I found it to be extremely interesting and hard to put down. I was particularly impressed by the author's apparent insight into human nature, as reflected in some of the ideas expounded on many occasions by Dorian Gray's friend and mentor, Lord Henry Wotton. Some of those passages were rather long, and perhaps a little tedious, but still interesting if one persisted. I consider this to be a classic which most readers would enjoy, but, in my view, Wilde simply drew on his experiences and chose certain events and characters to help sell his book. Frank Miles can rest in peace --- at least for now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"When asked to pick a favorite passage from a book, a lot of people will choose a vivid description. These people like authors to create beautiful scenes for them that they can forever conjure up in their heads. For this kind of reader, The Picture of Dorian Gray is probably a pleasure. Unfortunately, I am not this kind of reader.It is perhaps fitting that a book about beauty is defined by the images it creates rather than by the story or the dialogue. However, Oscar Wilde's mastery of dialogue is what makes his plays such a pleasure. For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray will never live up to Wilde's plays. This is not to say that the book is completely irredeemable; whenever Lord Henry is around, the book becomes better (but only insofar as it becomes more like a play, more focused on dialogue).You will love this book if you like descriptions, if you, unlike me, were able to read the chapters of The Grapes of Wrath that rambled about the land and that did not contribute to the plot. If you are like me, on the other hand, this book will be readable but not particularly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking. However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece. Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader. Be it fondness, admiration, sympathy for the hero or hate of the villain. I had no emotional interest in any of the characters in this book. I simply didn't care about any of their fates. Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"If you have never read an Oscar Wilde book, read this one. It is easy to read, entertaining and throughly enjoyable. The language doesn't trip you up. I have enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The most disappointing part of this book is that it read more like a non-fiction philosophy book than a story or novel. I would say 70% of the pages were portrayed as thoughts of a character or a speech of a character contemplating life, women, how we are suppose to live, etc.The actual story was hidden throughout the book, but you have to drone on through many pages to find it. The story itself is highly predictable and yet still has many missing parts to it. Many years of Dorian Gray's life is missing where it is hinted to that he commit's the most awful sins. I think reading of those sinful actions was to be more entertaining than the rabbit trails that Wilde goes on.Despite these facts, I am glad that I read the book once. It held my attention enough and was brilliant enough that I did learn something from the book, which is a great accomplishment in itself, to teach a reader a few principals that may slightly help or change on any small level, the readers actions. So I do recommend this book if you have no more pressing serious books on your reading list.On a side note, I do disagree with all the reviews I have seen on this book where the reader says that they can not relate to Dorian Gray's sins and that his sins are outdated. His chief sins in the book are (SMALL SPOILER ALERT) murder, drug use, pride, treating others harshly and without respect, using women in many ways, etc. are all sins practiced today even if they are not practiced exactly the way they are in the book. If you can relate to none of those sins in any way, then you are a better person than I, or suffer from foolish pride which is the chief sin in the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I'm being made to read this book for the third time (once in high school, twice in college), but I've always rather detested it. I've been told I need to \\"appreciate\\" it, and to that effect I've been reading a number of reviews (both positive and negative) of this book, trying to get a grip on *why* it's so highly regarded. The basic story is this: Dorian (a pretty twentysomething without much personality) makes a tacit (implied, not stated) bargain with a painter: his portrait will grow old and sick while he remains young and beautiful, no matter what he does to himself. And he does *plenty* to himself. 230 pages later, he grows a conscience and tries to destroy the painting, bringing age/sickness on himself and thus dying, unpunished for his \\"sins.\\" The Faust parallels are evident; unfortunately Dorian Gray is no Faust, and lord Henry (his \\"corrupter\\") is no Mephistopheles. The book is told as a series of banal witticisms and jests which sound good the first time you read them but get chewed up and spat out the second they're exposed to intelligent analysis. (Example from the preface: \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex and vital. When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.\\")Synthesizing all the reviews, I get the sense that people who *really* like it--the \\"witty\\" verbiage, the Faust-lite storyline, and the moral heavy-handedness--like it because it shields them from the knowledge of their own inner emptiness. That sounds harsh; let me explain further. Since everything is stylized, pre-determined, and \\"fake,\\" there's no danger of self-discovery--no danger of discovering anything true. Oscar Wilde was deeply alienated against his own self (most homosexuals living at that time and in that society were), and so is not capable of feeling honestly, or expressing himself with any sincerity. Human nature (in the wider, not baser, sense) is \\"reduced\\"--that's the only word I can think of to describe it. Words are everything; appearances; everything. But words are empty sounds without the meanings attached to them (anyone who knows more than one language knows *that*), and appearances are superficial and deceiving, to trot out that old cliche. Human beings do not exist merely to think up verbal ripostes to personal attacks, and yet, here, this is all they do. Well, that and \\"sin.\\" But what a \\"sin\\" is is never really defined, and Dorian Gray doesn't really \\"sin\\" much (he seduces a girl, dumps her, and there's some implied homosexuality---*yawn*).\\"Dorian\\" is a morality tale, like the story of Jesus. It is something to tell children with no imagination, to warn them of the dangers of societal rejection--the dangers of being \\"different.\\" In a subtle way, it encourages conformity--and it *definitely* encourages repression. It is false to me in so many ways that I can hardly stomach it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"nicely bound, beautifully embossed, priced especially well considering the binding and compared to other retailers such as Anthropologie; contains a sewn in ribbon bookmark which I love.

Sadly, perhaps it will be even more so in 100 more years hense.These are powerful reasons to read and enjoy Wilds only full length novel. Besides the wit and satire that can be enjoyed for the sake of humor, the book screams out to each of us, to live for pleasure or wisdom.This is one of the choices Wilde plays with in many of his works, and this is one of the best to understand and think about.I can't imagine someone who has not read this book, but if you have not, and you are hear today, then its time to do so.

I bought it and shelfed it for awhile until one day I picked it up and was subjected to its enchanting content. When reading about such characters such as Lord Henry for instance, you can only admit that you are being worked by the words and charms of a great novelist. It is sad that this is the only full novel Oscar Wilde ever did.(he did do a fair amount of plays, short stories, and essays however). After reading it, you will find yourself quoting it for a good while. And the plot device used is one of the better one's in all of fiction. I must say I plan on re-reading this one, the language, the wit, and the overall story that Wilde creates is very alluring and worthy of all the praise you might hear about it.Pick it up, read it, love it, and then recommend it to all of your friends."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"After a few months of cajoling, my parents finally convinced me to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde. Actually, part of what motivated me was not my parents' persistant pestering (and occasionally threatening), but the fact that Oscar Wilde is the favorite author of the lead singer from my favorite out-of-date band, The Smiths (Morrissey, yes).But anyway, to the book. When I started to read, I was in some kind of rapturous awe of Wilde's writing. It was so utterly beautiful, shaped and molded as finely as the face of the man Wilde so eloquently describes, Mr. Dorian Gray himself. It has the operatic and tragic occurence of an opera, or at least a play, but had The Picture of Dorain Gray been written as a play, it would have shirked the story of the wonderous use of the English language that so holds this novel up.Admittedly, it was a bit thick to wade through at times, but other than that, it's a ripping good ride, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the evils and attraction of physical beauty."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The description of the condition of the book was spot on, I would even go as far as to say that it might have been overstated. the book was in great shape, basically new except for some highlighting, but seeing as im in college notes are very helpfull.

It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed.

This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \\"wanted\\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person.

At the center is a young man of strikingly good looks who's portrait is painted by a dear friend - a portrait that then absorbs and reflects the young man's soul as he makes decisions that affect others as he slides into a life of debauchery.Highly stylized, the prose contains classic lines such as \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\" Wilde's only novel, the book was viewed as scandalous and immoral when published despite the fact that the immoral - or, more accurately, amoral perpetrator of ill deeds suffers as he chases empty pleasures and eventually comes to reflect upon the impact that his actions have had upon others and himself.The book is not the easiest of reads given the heavy style, the setting, and pervasive use of cultural references from high society in the late 19th century.

Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \\"expressing,\\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \\"let it all hang out.\\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \\"as easy and graceful as ever.\\" The company was rather dull. His hostess's married daughter had \\"one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered.\\" Things became livelier when Lord Henry Wotton arrived, very, very late. The table discusses the amours of Madame de Ferrol. Lord Henry summed her up: \\"Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\\" Henry preens himself when accused of wickedness: \\"It is perfectly monstrous ... the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.\\"The question arises at Lady Narborough's: are we such a sorry lot because it is \\"the end of the century\\" (fin de siecle)? or the end of the world (fin de globe)?

The immediate power of Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian retains a demonic hold on its confused subject, taunting and torturing his vanity with its strangely metamorphizing characteristics. Who's changing, and what exactly is changing? Wilde creates an unforgettable \\"portrait\\" here of one man's (or is it the whole of Victorian society?) demise. Many critics of Wilde have seen him and \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" as pure evil and criticized the undertones of homosexuality, and linked it with a lifestyle of debauchery and degradation.

This is a fault.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Wilde's Dorian Gray is such a powerful book because it explores the path of one man's sins and their effect on his life and the lives of those around him. Wilde uses Dorian as an example to demonstrate the struggles of humanity coping with its flaws. Wilde's plot is simple enough. Dorian was a man who had everything going for him. He was young, beautiful, wealthy, and unspoiled. Then he met Lord Henry, whose bizzare philosophies that he himself didn't even take seriously had a great impact on the impressionable Dorian. Lord Henry had convinced Dorian that once his youth had passed, he would have nothing enjoyable left in life, which caused Dorian pray aloud that a portrait he had of himself would take on his own physical burdens. As Dorian becomes more and more corrupted by Lord Henry and commits more sins, he notices that the painting (which represents his conscience) is becoming more and more wretched. He occasionally feels remorse and tries to change, but his plans always fail when Lord Henry draws him back under the shadow of his influence. The discouraged Dorian finally resolves to start his life anew by destroying the painting, the only record he has of his sins. When he stabs the picture, however, he kills himself.This is a powerful story that portrays the important lesson that sins are inescapable and everybody's actions catch up to them. This isn't a hard concept, but Wilde's writing is very challenging. He uses very poignant expressions constantly throughout the book that can get the reader off track because they tend to cause him to attempt to frequently stop and process what has just been said. I think that this was a great book, but it wouldn't be good to require it at Mercy High because it takes so long to get through."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"More than a story, The Picture of Dorian Gray contains many of Oscar Wilde's most famous commentary on life.

The novel revolves around our hero Dorian, the tensions within his own character and the forces that conspire in his eventual destruction.The book begins with Dorian seeing for the first time a portrait of himself painted by his friend Basil Hallward and Dorian's wish that the portrait would age while he remained forever the same as he was on that day. The \\"prayer of his pride\\" is answered and not only does the picture carry the assault of time for Dorian, but also the full weight of the casual cruelties and crimes he commits, evolving from a reproduction of his physical form into a mirror image of his soul. Realising this, Dorian is driven to even greater excesses safe in the knowledge that he can get away with it until finally his own guilt catches up with him.In his only novel, one can't help but feel that Oscar is giving us an insight into his own soul and the guilt he suffered over his sexual orientation. But on a deeper level, Wilde shows us the damnation of one soul and in that gives us a metaphor for our world and ourselves. Despite the Victorian idea that a person&#65533;s nature is written on their face, which is frankly ludicrous with the hindsight of the last century, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a truly wonderful and thought-provoking story heavily laced with the famous wit and wisdom of the great man himself."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"To be honest, I had two reasons for choosing this book. One was for a class assignment. Having a list to choose from lead to the second reason I picked this- a friend told me she had greatly enjoyed it. Therefore, I began reading with the expectation of having a &quot;nice&quot; read. Other than that, I didn't expect much from the novel. This is one of the times I am glad to say that I was wrong. &lt;i&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt; providea, first and foremost a good storyline. A young man, worried that once his youth and beauty departs he will lose everything, wishes that a portrait painted of him bear all reprecussions of time. After a period of time, this young man, Dorian Gray, discovers he has gotten his wish. However, an old maxim proves true once more in this novel: be careful what you wish for, as Gray learns he will, in fact, get what he deserves as a result of a life of debauchery. Yet an interesting (and certainly unsettling, at least at the time it was written) story line is not all the book has going for it. Wilde provides the reader with three main characters who are well-developed enough to make them convincing. We are given a tempramental artist (another good reason to read this book: anyone with any sort of artistic temprament will greatly appreciate some of the commentary made within the dialogue of the story), who is given to jealousy, a jaded, rather intellectual man who always has an opinon and never hastens to inform those in the vicinity of it, and, finally, a young man who begins the story as a very naive person and changes throughout the book in a seemingly natural manner. A wide variety of smaller characters also help to enhance the plot. In short, this book was one of the most interesting I have ever read. At times, I found myself getting the attention of someone nearby, to point out a line found in one of the passages that I felt they might enjoy or somehow relate to. In one way or another, it is my opinion one would be hard-pressed to find someone who did not relate to something the book. Overall, it was an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The idea of never growing old and having a painting take on all your admoralities is appealing.Dorian reacts as anyone would. He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book is sooo good, I think no jaded reader can deserve that title without having read this book. Dorian Gray, an astonishingly beautiful young aristocrat, receives the gift of eternal youth in the form of a painting one of his friends has made of him. Later, prompted by another friend, the divine dissolute Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gradually falls into a dissipate lifestyle and the eerie painting shows both the ravages of age and the advance of Dorian's moral decay, while he retains his breathtaking looks. As Dorian becomes more and more obsessed with the painting's worsening appearance, the changes in his once sweet and naive personality are explained in the story, and Dorian lives in fear of the painting being exposed to the world, therefore showing him beyond any doubt as the sleazy creep he is, until it comes to a point when the gift he prized so much ends up turning against him. Dorian Gray is one of the least likable characters I have seen on print, but I really liked his wicked friend Lord Wotton, who in the story is the one in charge of leading Dorian astray and dishing criticism after witty criticism of nineteenth century English society. I later learned this particular character was a sort of mockery of Oscar Wilde himself. A mellower version of this character can be found in another of Wilde's works, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, my second favorite story by this author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Contrary to some opinions I've come across, this book does NOT romanticize or promote a loss of morals. It is the exact opposite. Yes, Dorian becomes corrupted, but does the ending suggest that Wilde was making Dorian a hero for it? By no means. Dorian did not live happily ever after. It is a very moral book in that it clearly reinforces the principle of inevitable consequences of one's actions. Yes, at times it was a little slow (that is when the characters went into long life-philosophies)but all around it was very interesting and provided an insight into the late Victorian world in which Oscar Wilde lived. It addresses some key concepts such as appearance and its relation to virtue and the double-sidedness of one's character. Overall this book was not bad at all. A good read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I am a fan of many writers, but Oscar Wilde holds a special place in my non-existant but nonetheless real Hallway of Marble Busts of Famous Dead Guys. Obviously, Wilde was aware of his already-forming legend status at the height of his popularity, and his arrogance is permeated throughout every one of his works. This does not, however, disqualify him from being rightly honored by his huge and admiring readership. It also doesn't change the fact that he was victim of his own irony, dying young and humiliated in jail. No one illustrates tragicomedy better than Oscar Wilde. This particular book is the Bible of the Infinitely Quotable Strokes of Verbal Genius. My personal fave: &quot;Cigarettes are the perfect form of the perfect pleasure. They are exquisite and they leave one unsatisfied. What more could one want?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Besides the clever fiction and vivid details that draws you in deep, this book brings out the shame of humanity and puts it on display so elegantly.

I read the reviews and saw how people praises the book a lot. I liked the concept so figured I'll read it first before I'll watch the movie. I really thought I'd walk into a grotesque environment but it ended up so intriguing. Its exhilarating and atmospheric. I admire Oscar Wilde's brilliance in creating the characters, specifically Lord Henry. He is Dorian Gray's (the evil one) creator and honestly, Henry is the keystone of the story. His lines are perfectly constructed making them alluring even if he wasn't brave enough to do them himself. If I were like Dorian who grew up seeing only 4 walls and suddenly got freed, then get to talk to a man as eloquent as Henry is, I really believe his influence will be so great too. The characters of the book also show deep interest in art of different forms including Painting of course, literature and fashion which reflects the artist within Oscar himself. The author described Dorian Gray as \\"art\\" himself, I figured it will be challenging to find a person to play the part in the movie so beautiful to be called \\"art\\". Amazingly, Ben Barnes lived up to the role. Being chosen to play that role brings pressure and flattery of course, but the challenge is, if he can bring to life the Dorian Gray Oscar Wilde created. Its a good read! Oscar Wilde is a talented writer as we all know. This book can change your point of view of some aspects in life if you let it!! As what Ben said, \\"there's a great difference between pleasure and real happiness\\". You can try the movie too, its wonderfully made; great acting and the story line is nice. they made a few modifications and additions from the book at it made it more interesting. Colin forth and Ben Barnes were fabulous! The movie is lush, exhilarating and extremely sexy!!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"A fascinating look into the human ego and basic selfishness,this story could as easily have been written regarding our society as that of 1890s England.

NOW."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This cover art features a portrait of an unknown, bearing no resemblance to the blonde Dorian in Wilde's novel.My parents kept a page of chapel sayings from Bob Jones Sr. on our refrigerator for many years. Some of their friends sent their children there long before I was born. Pastor Jones might have had Dorian Gray in mind when he said: \\"Dissipations of youth must be paid for with a draft on old age.\\"Wilde's Dorian Gray is devoted to the fanciful premise that a soul might scar itself with the most horrible of depraved debauchery, which in Victorian London included opium dens, prostitution, and in the case of Mr. Gray, murder, both by proxy and in personal excess of temper. So, if you exercise patience, a murder mystery unfolds. (Lots and lots of patience!)What dark meditations crossed my mind, and how like ice was my countenance while feasting in Wilde's psychological eulogizing of scarlet sins and opulence from dozens of characters famous in classical Western history. As my mother was a history major with emphasis in fine arts, I've seen many of the anecdotal persons from art and mythology named in this book, experienced their art and literature and stories in our own collections and the local library. I've read their sad, sordid sense of moral turpitude, the decay of dynasties possessed of great art, luxury and wealth.Dorian's zeal to experience every pleasure on which he might lay his hands is reminiscent of the Ecclesiastes, though more lengthy and of less lucid outcomes. Accused sometimes of misanthropy, Oscar Wilde is nonetheless a master of florid verbosity. As once observed by author Ursula K. LeGuin, each sentence must dedicate it's reason for being, to an introduction of the next sentence.I might not have read all of this novel, except that I'm awed in admiration of the incredibly artful architecture of Wilde's sentences. One simple sentence might introduce what literature teachers will scold their students about being a \\"run-on-sentence.\\"But Wilde philosophizes elaborate arguments in the heads of his characters. There is nothing wrong analytically, or logically with attaching the cohesive phrases and clauses of two or more sides of an argument all together into a unified thought, even wielding a dozen commas to conjoin these articulated opposites.The style evokes memories of reading St. Paul in the King James English Bible, or the sublime constructions found in the tragedyRamona (Signet Classics), by Helen Hunt Jackson. I would never subject juvenile readers to the philosophy of Dorian Grey. Even as an adult, I'm grateful to have experienced a healthy dose of Shakespeare, prior to microscopically examining the minutia of a deeply troubled mind preoccupied with male beauty."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I started out disliking this book: too much silliness, not enough serious message. However, as time progressed, it turned out that the silliness (often shown in people's favorite quotes) is froth, and the body underneath is substantial: good, evil, innocence, and corruption. Wilde is a sublime genius at meshing the two levels in one work."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"this was a well written book but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone who wants a relaxing read.

To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware.

Given a magical portrait that protects the subject from the consequences of immorality, Rod Sterling would have ended it the same way.Still reading through a contemporary lens, Dorian Gray provides rich imagery of life in the 19th century. Wilde disadvantages this strength of the novel by exhaustively listing image after image while Dorian immerses himself in sensory experience.

You can't flick between chapters as you can with other Kindle publications."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Those poignant words spoken by the devil (Al Pacino) in The Devil's Advocate come to mind when talking about Dorian Gray. As a young, beautiful and conceited man, Dorian finds comfort in the company of Lord Henry, a morally corrupt aristocrat in Victorian England. Already teetering on the verge of chronic narcissism, Dorian is pushed off the edge into the abyss of eternal damnation by Henry's seductive, imaginative, and in the end, destructive speech.This classic, cautionary tale of the woes of youth has vanity at its core. Dorian, like all of us, is afraid of becoming irrelevant and unloved as a consequence of old age. Only in his case, he let his paranoia coupled with bad influence (Lord Henry) devour him. The story isn't unique in the sense that it happens everyday in the form of inconsequential lives consumed by gyms, beauty salons and drugs, chasing reluctant love and evasive youth.If you haven't read this classic in school, I highly recommend you do now. Lord Henry's lines, though evil, are very entertaining and almost too poetic. No man I know has a wit and sharp tongue like Lord Henry, but again, he is not a man. He is the devil's incarnate."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"That famous quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet certainly applies to Dorian Gray. And Lord Henry Wotton couldn't help using this quote, much like he couldn't help baiting Dorian Gray. Lord Henry admires the man in Basil Hallward's new portrait so much that he has got to meet him. Is he as beautiful in real life as he is in the painting? Is he ever! He is an Adonis, a young man as pure on the inside as he is on the outside. No wonder Hallward is obsessed with him! So begins Lord Henry's attempts to corrupt the young man. In no uncertain terms, he tells Dorian Gray that \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\" He also goes on to tell him that his wonderful youth and good looks are his best qualities, too bad someday they will fade. Dorian Gray is upset. His portrait will remain young and beautiful forever, whereas he will age and lose with his physical beauty. If only it were the other way around...That is all I'll share in terms of plot. You have got to read this magnificent novel to know the rest. The Picture of Dorian Gray, first published in 1890, is one of the most disturbing works of fiction I have ever read. No wonder it is so popular! It is thought provoking from beginning to end. Dorian is a cross between Narcissus and Faust -- his vanity is obvious from the very start, and Lord Henry is depicted as a devil, whereas Hallward is the angel who tries to maintain Dorian's innocence. Yes, as it has often been observed, the novel does have some not-so-concealed references to homosexuality. The aforementioned theme, mainly noticeable in Hallward, is, in the words of Marianne Dashwood in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, \\"implied but never declared.\\" There was no need for Wilde to say it in so many words, but he dropped hints here and there, like the rumors that Hallward moved to San Francisco. I doubt he would have been able to be more inconspicuous in his time. This novel could cover long hours of discussion. There are so many themes and symbolism and magic realism and foreshadowing here, and Lord Henry's crude but honest musings and observations are fascinating. He is definitely the most interesting character in the book. This is my first time reading this book. I'd wanted to read it since I read Amanda Filipacchi's Nude Men ten years ago. Why it took me so long to give it a whirl I will never know. Better late than never, I guess. And if you haven't read it, well, need I suggest that you do? You won't regret it.

It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines. Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \\"dandy\\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy. You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Innocent and young Dorian Gray is seduced by some bad influences, and taught to worship youth, beauty, and sensation. Due to a passionate prayer, the physical effects of a life dedicated to self-gratification and pleasure-seeking are borne by a painting of him instead of by his own body. The story focuses not on the actual events of Dorian's life, but the discussions on the philosophies supporting such a life. To this reviewer, the message is that a life of selfishness and self-gratification corrupts, and in the end we can have no separation from this corruption. Dorian Gray is a tad slow at times, as the conversations can get long, but it is still educational, and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \\"Importance of Being Earnest.\\" And his \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The quickest way to sum up this book in one word is \\"wow.\\" I will admit that for awhile I didn't find the book 5-star worthy, but I soon found myself thoroughly engrossed. Wilde has written this story like a symphony in four movements with an overture, ballad, climax, and finale. The prose is absolutely lyrical.Beauty is a dominant theme. Wilde excessively alludes to Greek Gods and the perfection of Adonis. The concept of beauty is also represented in the idea of man vs. himself, or better yet as beauty vs. immortality. Dorian wrestles constantly with his inner self and with the immortality his beauty presents to him. But with his beauty comes sins and pleasure that have no effect on him because their consequences marr his self portrait. Dorian uses his beauty to sin which ultimately leads to violence; his emotions often confuse his sins with pleasure.A secondary theme is the absence of reality. In the Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde echoes a similar line as that from Dorian. He writes that the two most attractive types of people are those who know nothing at all or absolutely everything. Three key characters represent varying degrees of reality, as well as Wilde's description of attractive people. Dorian knows nothing and Lord Henry knows absolutely everything, but Basil is the medium ground between the two that represents reality. Basil is the only one who sees/acknowledges things for what they truly are, but he is shunned by others who don't want to see reality. Characters like Dorian and Lord Henry have the idea that to see reality is to be scared of life. It is bad to be a spectator to one's own life. Dorian even admits that \\"He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realise the situation.\\" If he didn't acknowledge it, it simply did not exist.Lastly is the theme of homosexuality. Wilde does not mention any specifics of homosexual relationships, but what one has to read between the lines jumps off the page with equal magnitude of the written text.All in all, this book is excellent. Read this book, you will be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote that pride is the greatest sin. It is the doorway to all other kinds of evil. Though this was certainly not what Oscar Wilde was writing about, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a perfect illustration of this. The protagonist's pride causes him to go to horrible lengths. In the end it causes everyone around him (and eventually himself) great pain. I have read Wilde's works only a couple of times since being introduced to them in high school. Each time I do, I remember how much I like him as an author. This time, I was once again reminded how masterful Wilde was as a writer. His keen wit and incisive humor is refreshing. His prose is clean and unlabored. I don't know why I haven't read his stuff more often. I certainly will now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This story is positively a masterpiece. Dorian Gray is a young boy at first, whose beauty is so entirely dazzling that Mr. Basil Hallward, an artist, becomes utterly obsessed with the portrait he is painting of Dorian. Feeling certain he has not only achieved his best artistic work yet, he confesses shamefully that he has put so much of himself into the portrait that were it ever displayed publicly, the world would glimpse his soul. In short, Basil is in love with the image of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry Wotten befriends Dorian, much to the chagrin of Basil, who feels a near homosexual jealousy. When Basil presents the finished portrait to Dorian, Dorian makes a whimsical wish \\" If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that - for that - I would give everything!\\"From that moment on, Dorian's life changes. Lord Henry becomes his mentor of sorts, and a finer fictional character I have yet to meet. Indeed, Lord Henry has a profound influence on young Dorian, and his philosophies will hypnotize you, as they often do Dorian Gray. The portrait takes on sinister and looming proportions, and eventually Dorian must face the consequences of that one whimsical wish, and fight the ultimate battle - for his own soul. An amazingly fabulous book you absolutely MUST read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"When Wilde landed in America in 1882 for a lecture tour, he was asked if he had anything to declare. He responded, &quot;Only my genius.&quot; Okay now, an attitude like that didn't exactly make me want to read any of his works for a long time. Finally, I decided to try The Picture of Dorian Grey, and I found that it really was a work of genius.The novel is the story of Dorian Grey who at the beginning of the novel has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward. The picture turns out to be remarkable, and Grey becomes jealous because the picture will remain young and beautiful while he will age. He expresses a wish that the picture would age instead of himself. To his delight, his wish becomes true, and believing himself to be immortal, he embarks on a path of of hedonism. He always searches for pleasure above happiness, and above all things he loves beauty. Along the way, the portrait chronicles the total moral decay of Dorian Grey.The are a lot of interpretations to this novel. My favorite is to read it as a moral tale warning of the consequences of leading a life of hedonism. It could almost be read as &quot;The Picture of Oscar Wilde&quot; as he seems to be criticizing his own lifestyle. This is probably also the most ironic reading of it since Wilde continued after the novel to preach aestheticism. But anyway, taken within itself, the novel is marvelous. The prose is well-polished. The pacing is elegant and the plot is always interesting. The points is makes are important.

Over the years I have read plenty of Wilde's works, but for some reason or another, missed this one over and over. I recently sat down, and decided that it was time to give this a read. To be honest, I knew very little about this actual book prior to reading it, other than it involved a picture that aged rather than he in the painting.I expected to have difficulty reading this book, since it had been such a long time since I had read anything from the Victorian era, however the language was surprisingly simple, and Wilde's wit is as sharp as ever. Almost sharp enough to harm the reader should they not be forewarned or guided through the readings. Should someone of a weaker mind read this book, it would be easy to fall into the trap of Dorian, who himself was poisoned by a book and the words of his friend.Summary without giving too much away: Dorian Gray is an Adonis-like beauty, young and full of life and innocence at the beginning of our story. His beauty has attracted the obsession of a painter who paints picture after picture of him. Basil (the painter) tries to keep young Dorian pure and in love with life. Henry, a friend of Basil's comes to the studio as Basil paints his master work - a portrait of Doran. Henry fascinates young Dorian in his vile manner of speaking and sarcastic wit. His talk instills in Dorian both a fear of losing his beauty and a lust for all that is selfish and vile in life. Dorian's notable debauchery follows in exquisite detail with Henry always along for the ride to prod young Dorian down the wrong road. Several suicides and a murder or two later, complete madness begins to make its appearance.Wilde was brilliant in his writing of this book, he captures the time perfectly... the lust of it, the sexuality of it, the debauchery of it... all in the name of truth. In their words they say things that their hearts dare not to believe and their smiles are masks hiding the truth. And what if someone believed in these lies? What if they lived their life according to what they had been told? Then they would be Dorian Gray... and we will see what happens to him. This is a brilliant read, and for those of you who will have to write papers on it... the story is not long, but it is thick with meaning. There are very few stories that I would give 5 stars to, this is one of them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Published in 1890, this novel by Oscar Wilde is a startling, fantastic portrayal of fin de siecle indulgence and hedonism.The novel is dark in its tone as it describes Dorian's fall from purity, and it involves itself heavily with suicide, death and supernatural occurences. The novel is also somewhat satirical, as Wilde makes reference to the absurd state of social affairs in Victorian London. Ironic and suspenseful, the novel keeps the reader interested in each plot development, and keeps the reader engaged and moved by the beautiful, carefully crafted prose.The story begins with Lord Harry Wotton, utterly captivated by a painting by a friend, the artist Basil Hallward. The painting is of the handsome and unspotted young Dorian Gray. Dorian is stunned at the worldly knowledge of the older gentleman, and soon finds himself under Lord Wotton's care and attention. Harry, the eternal pessimist, schools Dorian in his existential, hedonistic view. Dorian wishes in his vanity that the beautiful painting might age instead of he. When Dorian falls in love with and coldly rebukes a young actress, he returns home to find that the painting bears a faint expression of cruelty and callous; a certain sneer about the mouth. His wish had come true; \\"the canvas [bore] the burden of his passions and his sins.\\"As the story goes on, Dorian falls further and further into his own mind, indulging his every whim, strangling the lives of most everyone he touches by the ropes of scandal that Dorian is entangled in.Resonating throughout the story are the themes of power and love, overriden by vanity and swept beneath by slight homosexual undertones (easily overlooked by anyone who wants to overlook it).I thoroughly enjoyed this novel; the characters were well-developed, and I could identify with Dorian's desire to find a balance between his selfish motivation to indulge himself and his moral need to free himself from his sins. It is the endless plight of human existence: The moral drive to overcome the sins of our nature. The way the novel was written gives the reader a deep appreciation for Oscar Wilde, and the way in which he writes. The novel was a little difficult here and there, not because it was verbose or stylistically challenging, but merely because it was very in-depth. The book itself is a beautiful work; but moreso than the book itself are the ideas behind it. This is a book that makes one think about consequences of actions, the importance of emotions, of repentance and redemption.I would highly recommend this book.\\"Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.\\" - Basil Hallward to Dorian Gray, Chapter 9."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have always heard of Dorian Gray, but never got around to reading it until now.

Compelled by my teacher to read it, I didn't think this book could give me so many hints. Thanks to Oscar Wilde I had my first approach to the Aesthetic ideolgy, absolutely one of the most involving and interesting: let's do &quot;Art just for Art's Sake&quot;! Dorian Gray embodies the new intellectual who thinks life should be lived as a work of art, so that it is possible to stop the destructive power of time. He also stated the only reality is that of impressions and sensations, and everything in life should be done in order to experience every kind of sensations, no matter how to do and what society could think. Well, I'm just a teenager and maybe for this reason I share some of Wilde-Dorian's instances: like me, the protagonist tries to reconcile wills of rebellion, linked to his soul's corruption, with desires of worldiness.

One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \\"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \\"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY.

Wilde provides an insight into the hedonistic lifestyle that he lived and championed. Indeed, one of the basic tenets of Wilde's philosophy - aestheticism - is presented in contradictory terms. While aestheticism attempts to redefine art as a means of beauty with no moral purpose, the novel's artwork - the portrait of Dorian Gray - shows the moral consequences of Dorian's hedonistic and narcissistic lifestyle.In a way, Dorian is the work of art, for he never changes his appearance. It is his portrait that is burdened with the sins and iniquities of Dorian's wickedness, for his portrait becomes haggard and disheveled as Dorian's soul sinks further into a dark abyss of nefarious behavior. On the outside, Dorian shows the luminous beauty of youth and a pure mind, yet the true soul of Dorian is diseased and dying. Any attempts at changing his inner essence only reveal him to be a hypocrite and egotist.Another cautionary tale is that in one of idolizing others and falling for their influence. Dorian begins his descent into immorality when he becomes enamored with Henry Wooten's philosophies that \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it\\" and \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders.\\" The cynical and satirical Henry Wooten espouses his hedonistic lifestyle, yet does not become entrapped in it like Dorian. Then, it is Dorian's influence who corrupts and ruins the lives of nearly all those with whom he is intimate.It is easy to see why this novel was criticized and decried as immoral in Victorian England. From the first chapter, there is a definite homosexual undertone. Henry and Basil admire Dorian's beauty and Basil declares that he cannot live without seeing Dorian everyday. Indeed, Basil's fondness of Dorian could just as easily describe romantic feelings toward a woman. Although there are heterosexual relationships, they are shallow and fleeting. Dorian's own deplorable actions are never revealed, save for opium, yet his corruption of young men implies that he engaged in acts of \\"gross indecency\\", the very same acts for which Oscar Wilde would be tried and convicted years later. Perhaps Wilde is attempting to justify his own lifestyle and criticize moral judgments, for \\"it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\"Although this is essentially a dark, Gothic novel, it does contain scenes of wit and humor. Henry's dialogue and witticisms convey the same tone as many of Wilde's highly acclaimed plays. Through satire, Wilde reveals the superficial nature of the aristocracy. Despite rumors of Dorian's sins, he is still highly desirable in London society, as his beauty and youth trump all.This is a superb novel by Wilde. I only wish that he would have honored us with a few more novels."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Dorian Gray was quite the read.Dorian Gray is a young man who has exquisite, wonderful features. He is good-looking. He is a model for Basil, a painter. Basil paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry, one of Basil's friends, meets Dorian and remarks how sad it is that Dorian will not always retain his youth and beauty. Dorian grows sad about this - and thinks, if only this picture would grow old and I can always stay young! He envies his own picture, because he thinks that the picture will forever retain its youth - while he will bear the wrinkles of life.Then things start becoming strange. After an unpleasant experience with his fianc&eacute;e, an actress, he looks at his picture and notices a cruel twist of the mouth. This is only the beginning. As Dorian makes his descent into debauchery and sinfulness, the picture bears the weight of his actions. Everytime he commits a transgression, the picture grows uglier and uglier. The picture becomes his sort of \\"conscience.\\"This book is one worth reading. I had heard of Dorian Gray and was curious. Wilde's writing was descriptive, yet easy to read. It is one of the easier classics, in my opinion.The only flaw to this novel was, at one point, there is a stage where Dorian collects a lot of things - like embroidery, etc. It describes the things he collects and makes lots of references and allusions to seemingly random people (perhaps famous people in history?). This seemed to me like a non sequitur, and just lots of rambling. Furthermore, it was confusing because I didn't know who the people being mentioned were. It was tedious, although I endured it. I'm glad I did, because the story progressed wonderfully.The ending is... quite morbid, but didn't come across as a complete surprise.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth your while. It will make you think - is eternal youth worth it? It will trigger lots of probing questions in your brain.

Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work.

Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil.

It was hardly surprising that following the publication of this book, the authorities sought to have him arrested for homosexuality. If aestheticism is embodied by Lord Henry, Henry is a despicable character, whose philosophies sound not only juvenile and sophistic, but ignorant due to his lack of practicing what he preached. He didn't act out his hedonistic, immoral theories, only Dorian behaved that way, and when doing so brought torment, shame, and guilt upon himself. And to preface the book with &quot;All art is quite useless&quot;? That makes no sense, since the picture was the most useful, significant, meaningful thing in life. Was Wilde's goal to declare his own dear philosophies completely worthless? If so, he succeeded, but I am much more impressed by someone who sets out to justify his philosophies rather than someone who sets out to debunk them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I love the classics and somehow this one escaped my attention until now. I wish only that it hadescaped my attention forever. This rambling book of boring, sexually unstable rich people with nothing better to dowith their lives than look at pretty Dorian (because, Dorian is very pretty), and insult the commoners who have no rank or class,is tedious, boring and a complete waste of time.Dorian has his portrait painted while the painter and another man oogle him and tell him how pretty he is.The painter said his life was not complete until pretty Dorian came to sit for him.Dorian is very pretty..Dorian wishes he could stay young and pretty and that the painting would age instead of him.,,.. because he's young and prettyand men and women alike tell him how pretty he is.Dorian gets his wish and then the book ignores all his issues and goes off into the prose land of mushrooms.We next see Dorian decades later, the painting is hideous but Dorian is pretty. All his sins have left him pretty and the painting ugly.What happened in that time span is not told.Dorian is pretty.There is zero character developement and by the end I was just hoping everyone character in the book would die.Even Dorian, who is very pretty. We do not not know him, or the painter and have only a glimpse of the life of thethird main character in the book. He thinks Dorian is pretty too.*****************Spoiler Alert*****************I guessed the end about 1/3rd of the way through, I only missed that I figured Dorian (he, who is pretty) would torch the painting insteadof stabbing it.*****************End Spoiler Alert*****************I'm sure all the world is aflutter because of the daring topics discussed, or not discussed as it wasn't in this book. For its time period, I guessit would be shocking. Dorian, however, is still very pretty and that remains regardless of when this book was written.So, I hear this is only an edited version and somewhere out there is the REAL version, and it is oh so much better, but, nothing could savethis travesty of words. I wasted enough time with these pathetic characters (and author) although I think Dorian is still very pretty according to everyone.I'm only glad I read it on my Kindle so a tree didn't die in printing this boring book.

Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader.

When I watched that movie I had no idea who the character of Dorian Gray was. The movie wasn't that good, but I was still interested in that character. When I saw The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, I decided I wanted to learn more about that character.This book was not easy to read at all. It wasn't because of the language that it was written in, which did add to its difficulty. The part that bothered me the most about this book, other than its length, was the horrible lack of flow. I got the main idea of the book, I understood most of why certain parts of the book were there, but there were so many parts that did not add to the plot that for many pages at a time you would read about things like a jewel collection, book collection or whatever else fancied Dorian Gray at the time. It was so hard to finish this book because there were so many times that I couldn't grasp why I was reading what I was reading. There were so many times that Dorian or his friend Harry would go into these monologues for absolutely no reason at all.There were a few redeeming qualities to this book, but unfortunately they did nothing to help me enjoy it at all. The one thing I did like was the basic premise of the book. Dorian Gray could not age and he was beautiful so he could do whatever he wanted to. His lack of need to preserve his soul led him down the path of evil. His friend guided him down that path as well. The whole time I was reading this book I was thinking about Harry as the devil. He would plant thoughts into the brain of Dorian that led him further and further down his path of destruction.The book was a let down and I hope that the next classic fiction book I choose is a good one.If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle.

I began reading this book upon the premise that it would contain fascinating worldviews, as well as a gripping plot. Rather, the book fell flat on its face. Wilde reflected his views of the importance of art, the pitfalls of beauty, and the horror of aging in this novel, and though it wasn't the views that were a problem, it was how they all contradicted one another. The author claimed, \\"all art is useless\\" in the preface of the novel, yet eventually it is art itself that becomes the bane of Dorian Gray's existence.The novel follows a young, beautiful young man, Dorian Gray, along with two of his friends, Basil, who paints a stunning picture of Dorian, and Harry, who leads Dorian into a world of lies, sin and betrayal. Though it starts off interestingly enough, the novel drags after the 50th page, and it only gets worse and worse until the very end. It is meant to shock its readers, with tales of murder and drugs, yet the writing isn't sophisticated enough to support these statements. The downward spiral of Dorian Gray's life is deserved, and the novel fails to leave the reader with a strong residual message. To its credit, however, the original premise was interesting, and the decay of Dorian Gray's existence and how he views himself makes for a decent plot.I will not bother to go into the details of the novel, for example the sexism and the portrayal of women in the book, and how it is questionable whether the characters are more in love with women, the idea of women, each other (yes, they are all male), or themselves. The homosexuality in the novel did not bother me, though the inaccurate portrayal of women did.If you are interested in reading about art, corruption or murder in the late 19th century in England, please, spare yourself the torture of reading Dorian Gray, though it is only a little over 200 pages."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel.

I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.)

The two main characters, Dorian Gray himself and his mentor Lord Henry Wotton, lead lives of extreme self-indulgence.Lord Henry constantly spews forth his theories and philosophies regarding everything about human nature. Although they are numerous, Henry's ideas can be condensed into one main point. Early in the narrative when he is first exercising his right to influence under the title of mentor, Henry exclaims to Dorian that the only thing worth having is youth. Youth, which is, according to Henry, the only stage where beauty can be found, comes with an ever-present hedonistic lifestyle. This is the template for which the impressionable Dorian bases his life upon.Dorian becomes the ultimate purveyor of self-indulgence and corrupts everything he associates himself with, all the while accompanied on his journeys by a curse of grave implications. To the disappoint of many, I will not give away more of the story; as I'm sure most of you are already salivating over the details I have put forth.The story unfolds at first in a matter of weeks and then jumps several years, yet the focus of the novel does not waiver. This Romantic Period novel is filled with the standard mystery, and a central dealing with human nature. It is well written and comes with excellent detail, as required by this writing period. It also comes with the characteristic whit of Oscar Wilde. The dialogue between characters is excellent and Lord Henry's theories are exquisite often bordering on comical, but always cynical.Wilde seems to warn against the excess of hedonism and uses the story of Dorian Gray as a deterrent. More importantly I believe this is a social critique of high society, which breeds excess and cultivates decadence, while often regarding everything with a selfish eye. The book is filled intellectual quips about human nature and society, yet it is a short book and relatively easy read. This book is required reading for many, so possibly you've already read it, but if not, during commercial breaks of course, give this a try."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth.

The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature.

That said, the higher threshold of today's readers for topics that would have made a Victorian-era bookworm blush doesn't take away at all from the bona-fide quality of writing, and depth of thought, manifested within the complex discourses of Oscar Wilde's characters time and again throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\"The storyline itself is interesting -- a young man, driven to trade his soul for lifelong youth and beauty, is left with a brutally accurate reminder that the burdens of the soul are inescapable. Nevertheless, the clever plot is the lesser of the art forms Wilde exhibits in this book.The most impressive feature of Wilde's writing in this novel is the manner in which his characters express and justify devious thoughts. Corrupt and evil notions are so explicitly well-rationalized, with such a seemingly undeniable logic, that the reader is almost forced to pause, mid-paragraph at times, to debate in his own mind whether he agrees with what he just read. As the story unfolds, and the maladies brought about through the gradual corruption of Dorian Gray grow more and more apparent and profound, one almost needs to turn the pages back to the stanzas previously used to justify an ill-fated thought simply to reconsider why such statements at first seemed to be such decent insights about humanity. Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray? If so, that is the genius of Oscar Wilde in this work.This novel is not simply one to be read; rather it is a novel to be read deeply into.

Many of us our familiar with the basic Dorian Gray fable - a man yearns for immortality and gets it. In Wilde's take, Dorian Gray, a young handsome teenager wishes the deprecating effects of age to strike his portrait and not his flesh. He gets his wish and at the goading of Lord Henry becomes an absolute hedonist. Always within though there seems to be a remorseful conscience, a longing for purity. But the ease of depravity squashes moral sentiments before they take root. In the end though, the ageless man finally confronts his portrait...After learning of the author, Oscar Wilde, I was surprised that the book came from his pen (thinly veiled homoeroticism nonwithstanding). I interpreted the book as a cautionary tale against heedlessness and indulgence - basically against the materialist character of Lord Henry. It is a moral tale that explores themes of beauty and its subsidary: age.

This book will tell you an engrossing moralistic tale that paints the picture of where the deadly sin of vanity can take you. It will take you into a descent into a hell full of shadows where the light will never touch you.This is a classic dark tale of intrigue. It is filled with the depths to which the human condition can sink. It is a page turner, but it may leave you feeling empty at the end. That is what it did for me. Nevertheless, it is a haunting book that is well worth reading. Oscar Wilde will speak from his grave throughout the centuries through this book.As the author of a spiritually-themed book entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I appreciated this book for the most unusual reasons. I am a former addict who knows what it is like to experience hell within life. The hopeful note within this book is that it will wake the reader up to taking responsibility for his or her own life. That is what I have had to do with my own. Thank God for books that can wake us up to that reality so that we do not have to sink into the abyss of nothingness.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \\"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The experience of reading Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is tantamount to engaging in a philosophical debate with a person suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder--and they're winning. The exquisite attention to detail paired with a sharp analytical wit delivers an indomitable argument. One cannot help but succumb to temptations along with the charismatic Dorian and echo his cries of despair when the effects of sin become prominently displayed, marring the handsome features.Wilde creates a subtle trap, luring the reader with Dorian's innocence and naivet&eacute;. The snare gently tightens as the pure boy slides deeper into depravity and becomes corrupted by pleasure. So slowly is the reader introduced to the poison, by the time realization hits there is no hope of escape. They are as thoroughly embroiled in the life of hedonism and aestheticism as the protagonist. Dorian becomes subsequently more callous with every act of debauchery he commits and the impact of his actions is reduced by the sheer number of skeletons in his closet. Rather than becoming appalled as his wickedness grows, the reader is simple hardened for what is to come. When Dorian finally carries out the act of treachery that tilts the scale, no one is surprised.The pictures painted by Wilde's careful words are elaborate to the point of being mind-numbing. Explicit descriptions of Dorian's hobbies fill pages while serving no apparent purpose. Closer examination determines the usefulness of aforementioned descriptions in drawing the reader closer to the child-like curiosity of Dorian, perhaps justifying his eventual corruption. Unfortunately this knowledge is not enough to banish the tedium and some passages must simply be suffered through.Oscar Wilde has created a thought provoking masterpiece. An excellent read for those who have ever question the morality of society of have peered out across seas of corruption and vowed to stay away. Not for the faint of hear or easily distracted, hose who choose to take the plunge will find themselves pleasantly rewarded."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"a classic literary staple of the modern world! a must read for any intellectual. every sentence is brimming with stimulating ideas and paradoxes."},{"Title":"Lemongrass and Lime: New Vietnamese Cooking","review":"I will give a fair warning and say that the following review is quite harsh, but I will try to be as fair as possible.Okay, on the plus side this book has beautiful photos almost too beautiful to have in a working kitchen. Some of the pictures are so artful one asks the question of what is the picture's purpose? For many of the photos are not instructional photos that show techniques or states of the food except as finished product.Design --It is a outsized volume that is perfect for the coffee table but maybe a bit unwieldy in a book holder. The size I am sure, was determined by the photo layout and not the recipes for they occupy very little space.The layout is of ingredients listed way on the bottom with instructions for the recipe not quite center with the use of a lot of white space and very artistic photos of something that may not be related to the dish. All thisdone on glossy paper.Problems --Poorly edited: The book forgets steps in the use of ingredients and has the unique distinction of having an editor who did not bother providing temperature setting equivalents for UK oven markings. So it is not geared for the American kitchen at all. What does Mark # mean for your temperature specific oven? Good guessing is required or a reference. The writer or editor might have tried to do the simple modification of providing both English and degree settings for the recipes. It shows a lack of care.The Recipes --I will grant that this is supposed to be 'NEW' Vietnamese cuisine but I find the book making way too many changes and tradeoffs to have it termed Vietnamese except in the broadest sense. An example is the use of butter in recipes e.g., beef and chicken stock. Also, the recipes may require more than what your average thrifty Vietnamese grandma might use such as, veal bones and 10 egg whites to clarify the stock.The chicken broth/stock was pretty thin in the making just the use of chicken wings which creates a thinner less full broth which may shortchange the strength of broth based dishes. More traditional recipes would actually use a whole chicken to provide fuller flavor and maximize the thriftiness of having a chicken cooked at the same time for another dish.Vietnamese cooking already has French influences and has chosen and discarded based on what is appropriate so I found it a bit disconcerting that some recipes seem to go very French in technique and then shift to what I term, (fast) cooking where trade-offs are made for unclear reasons. I guess what I am saying is that the vision of the book and its recipes were unclear.The recipes seem to be a marriage of alot of French technique with some Vietnamese spicing. But is it THE torch of a new direction in Vietnamese cuisine? I hope not because it would be robbed of a depth of flavor and boldness of vision.My recommendation is do not get this book if you are a serious cook or even a novice for the recipes are more complicated than the novice needs while the serious cook will gain nothing useful from the volume in either background, technique or flavor that is not already in their repetoire."},{"Title":"Lemongrass and Lime: New Vietnamese Cooking","review":"Lovely as a coffeetable book or to get your tastbuds going, but don't try to actually use any of the recipes.In a casual review of recipes, I found numerous editing mistakes. For example, one recipe gives you detailed directions for baking and mashing a potato. It then moves on to the next ingredients and never tells you what to do with the perfectly mashed potato! Similarly, there are references to ingredients not previously mentioned and inane instructions like refrigerating fresh fish for a MAXIMUM of one hour.Overall, it feels like the book was rushed to market and/or published by cookbook neophites. Disappointing as the title, pictures, and dish descriptions are all quite mouth-watering."},{"Title":"Lemongrass and Lime: New Vietnamese Cooking","review":"As a Vietnamese-American, I want to learn more about preparing and cooking Vietnamese cuisines. Along with Mai Pham's &quot;Pleasures of the Vietnamese Table,&quot; I bought this book because of its beautiful images of Vietnamese food. These images evoke childhood memories.As soon as I finished skimming through the book, I was quite devastated that I didn't recognize anything as Vietnamese cuisines. All these recipes are practically French, New Age, or fusion hosh-posh. Yes! I am a purist when it comes to international cuisines.Furthermore, the recipes are so difficult to follow. It seems that Mr. Read is so obessesive over the glossy photos that he forgets include complete instructions.I donated the book to the local public library."},{"Title":"Lemongrass and Lime: New Vietnamese Cooking","review":"Although I agree with some of the criticisms raised about this cookbook, I think the harsh reviews are excessive. Indeed, the ingredient lay-out (in a line at the bottom of the page) is poor, and there are some errors in editing. And I can't say anything about its Vietnamese authenticity (I will trust those who wrote earlier reviews--that it is poor). However, all of the dishes I have tried so far have been wonderfully easy to make and absolutely delicious to eat. I'll admit I haven't made even a quarter of the recipes included (yet!), but I have enjoyed and expect I will continue to enjoy cooking from this book and being inspired to do so by its interesting dishes and beautful visual pictures."},{"Title":"Lemongrass and Lime: New Vietnamese Cooking","review":"I am usually wary when westerners write Vietnamese cookbooks and this book is the reason why. Get Mai Pham's book if you're looking for Vietnamese food. I don't know what this stuff is."},{"Title":"Glass Wings","review":"Glass Wings presents three gothic, haunting tales of forbidden or unrequited love, rendered with beautiful artistry by Misuzu Asaoka. The three stories are almost Shakespearian in their tragic elements. In the first story, Hagane and Ruriha are brother and sister and both born with the \`deathblood' which can infect and inflame all who come in contact with it. They are prisoners of a woman named Tsubaki, who loves Hagane and claims to have given birth to the pair, although it seems likely that birth may be in a sort of vampiric sort of manner as opposed to literally giving birth to the pair. The brother and sister merely want to live their life together and free from torment but Tsubaki says she will never let them go.In Firefly we meet Yuinne, who comes from a race of ghoul-like creatures that the nearby villagers refer to as freaks. They need to live on the blood and bodies of dead bodies in order to survive. When Yuinne runs away, trying to escape this horrific life, he is taken in by a young village girl named Mia who is unaware that he is a freak which soon puts the pair into conflict with the rest of the village who wants to kill Yuinne as Mia tries to help him. Finally in Jion Princess we meet a sickly young princess named Yura whose condition seems to be beyond a cure, that is until an orphan girl named Soyogi, who resembles Yura finds that she has empathetic powers to take all of Yura's ills and sicknesses into her body so that Yura will live, but does Yura show Soyogi any gratitude?As the titles suggests, Glass Wings explores the fragility of love and relationships and the often strange partnerships that come about in life, no matter how different people can be. Asaoka's art is very beautiful, particularly in the opening story. Genuine sympathy is garnered for these sad siblings who only want to live with each other without asking anything of the rest of the world. This was truly a touching story.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Glass Wings","review":"There are three stories in this single-book anthology. The first, and longest, is about two pretty teenagers whose diseased blood kills on contact. Thier greatest dreams are to live together and alone, happily in love and isolated from any people they could kill. To accomplish this, they ran away from a seductive woman who may or may not be thier mother, and may or may not want the boy to be her lover, and speaks of posessing him while torturing his sister and/or girlfriend. But they return to her, and go back to thier intial routine of being seduced and tortured until they aren't anymore. In the next story, a boy is being chased by someone who wants him to give in to his curse as a corpse eater. A girl is kind to him, but he ends up alone and devastated and prodded by his pursuers anyways. Lastly, an orphan is able to siphon disease off of a princess whom she loves-despite said princess thinking her savior a pile of dirt and letting her know it with constant abuse. They come to some kind of understanding in the end, featuring two pages worth of the princess being somewhat less nasty to the orphan.Make sense? Yeah, I didn't get it either.That's the gist of \\"Glass Wings\\", overall darkly presented and a big jumble of confusion. The entire time I was trying to figure out what-if any-point each story really had. I suppose that the messages were simple enough, but it was really all obscured by flurries of moments attempting to be deep and poignant- it wasn't all unsucessful, but the overall feeling was hazy. The coherency simply wasn't there-the moment of clarity that could give true empathy for the characters never appeared. This was especially a problem in the first story, because it was the longest. The other two, being short, could at least get away with a skeptical \\"Oh. I see.\\" quality. They didn't have the oppurtunity to mix themselves up too badly. But in the first story, tragedies and words seem to blur into each other until they're as distracting as the masses of curls and frills themselves.The artwork is the strength of this book-the girls are all dressed in the prettiest lolita outfits imaginable and have elaborate hairstyles, frills and ringlets galore.The boys are perfect eyecandy with thier stylish leather and belts. They're all incredibly cute, even if a bit too much so.(eyes taking up 90% of a girl's face is stretching it, even for anime.) But it might actually contribute to the problem of the story-it's hard enough to try to piece together the plots without being ovewhelmed with dense panels crammed with the greatest possible amount of ribbons. The mangaka comments that she spent too much time on the clothes and not the faces-but really, she spent too much time on the drawing and not on the planning. If you plan on getting Glass Wings, be aware that you're doing it for the sheer visual beauty of it, not for the stories. They got stuck in thier own potential and never became anything incredible."},{"Title":"Glass Wings","review":"Occasionally, one runs across a book that is haunting, lyrical, artistically beautiful, and which inspires a great deal of thought long after finishing the ending. Often, these books are labeled \\"haunting\\" or \\"gothic,\\" as this book was.Too bad it didn't prove to be one of them.All three \\"stories\\" are a big jumble of confusion, containing very little coherent plot, a great deal of gratuitous violence for no discernable reason, and no character development to speak of. The art is decent, but nothing particularly original -- it reminds me of Arina Tanemura's style, but with less development and visual interest.This book might appeal to some people. It tries to be creepy and tragic and haunting, and perhaps it does succeed in being that way for some. But it failed utterly with me; I found myself feeling only disgust at the amount of seemingly pointless gore, annoyance at the story's lack of anything resembling original plot, and irritation at its failing to live up to the tone it so clearly was trying to achieve.I was hoping to discover something in this book that was reminescent of Vampire Princess Miyu or Alichino or even Bizenghast -- but instead, I found nothing more than a mess.Don't buy this book."},{"Title":"The Silver Hand (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 2)(Library Edition)","review":"This is one of 3 books in the best trilogy I ever read.

The characters, for reasons it is hard for me to describe, became extremely real to me. I always have trouble identifying why this happens (characters become very real), but when it does a book becomes more than a book - the adventure becomes more real, the characters become like real friends. I found in Llew a \\"goodness\\" that was believable and very refreshing - like some of the \\"goodness\\" I have found in the characters of George MacDonald or CS Lewis.

I absolutely love how intelligent and intriguing this story is. It pulls you in with compelling storylines, complexity of characters, and illustrates wholesome values often undervalued in modern society. I was given the set as a gift and have already read them all 3 times through to make sure I didn't miss a detail. I will admit the final book in the series was not my favorite of the three, but I think that's more to force the reader to feel the hero's utter devastation at the turn of events and you end up regretting how things inevitably conclude. I think the author did a decent job of helping you understand how he takes the first step toward getting on with the rest of his life, as regrettable as it is to him and to us.I'm now a fan and I'm back to see how many more Stephen Lawhead novels I can scoop up.

This book is told from the perspective of Tegid, Chief Bard. The Isle of the Mighty is once again facing deadly foes, and Tegid and Llew are central to restoring balance to the land. The struggles that they undergo are harder than in the first book, they are both physically disabled but they perservere and learn to overcome their weaknesses.

One thing I really liked about the book was that the first book written from the standpoint of Lewis/Llew, but for this second book it shifts to Tegid's viewpoint while maintaining the same characters and continuing the story.

Although I already have the paperbacks, these books are some of the few for which I will pay again to get the electronic version, since I enjoy reading them over periodically.Based primarily in an alternate reality, on and around the island of Albion, and steeped in the mythology of the ancient Celts and the folklore of the British Isles, this is an epic tale of courage, destiny and ultimate triumph in the face of tremendous adversity. The plots are deep, intricate, and resound with a sense of authenticity which draws you completely into this fantastic world. I especially found the concept of kingship as depicted in these novels to be fascinating and thought provoking - the ideas that the king exists ultimately to serve his subjects and that the king is appointed and anointed to the position rather than inheriting it by bloodline.One is taken on a roller coaster ride with our protagonist as we journey with Llew from Oxford in England to a parallel universe with an alternate Briton filled with warriors and heroes and villains, vying for the high-throne of Albion. Just writing about it makes me want to start reading them again tonight. Enjoy the ride with Llew from a nondescript Oxford student to a warrior to almost a king to a maimed outcast, to a... well, you'll just have to read all three to see where it goes.A thoroughly engrossing tale, rich in the detail of another world, with an unusual conclusion that I don't think I really fully got until the 2nd or 3rd time through.

I understand why it was done, but you don't know who the narrator is until a few pages in. However, once you get used to the fact that Tegid is narrating, it's a deep read with rich descriptions and an activity that bounces you all over, which can be distracting.It's an interesting book about the right of kings and of sovereignty. What exactly does a king mean to the people, the land or to himself? I think that this is a question that bothers Llew throughout the book. The answer isn't clearly defined, and you see the destined king stumble, but the pondering of the question is a valuable task.That said, I would say that there is a lack of depth to the plot. You know that everything is supposed to come out right at the end. Things that should be difficult to accomplish are dispatched with ease.

While I flew through the first book, this second installment was one I had to keep setting aside and picking up later on. It was difficult for me to figure out why exactly I struggled to get to the end of this book. The writing is just as masterful as the first book. I think what caused the difficulty was the plot itself. While there was a lot going on it wasn't as epic in my opinion as the first book. A great deal of the book dealt with the logistical processes of Tegid and Llew establishing their own base and gathering people there. There were battles and other events, but I often found myself wishing the book would gloss over some of the detail and get to the final conflict quicker. Another problem in my opinion is that the enemy in the first book was a mysterious evil entity, so part of the joy of reading that book was finding out what would happen. Part of the problem with the second book is that there was not much mystery. The enemy is a man leading an army. And the resolution to one of Llew's constant conflicts during the book can be figured out by reading the title of the book (I apologize for being vague, but I am trying not to give spoilers.). Needless to say I knew how the Silver Hand would resolves itself before I got to the end, even if I didn't know the details.That being said, despite the slow pacing, the payoff was worth it. The final conflict was nicely done, and while I had guessed much of it, it was still well written and executed. It makes me sad to not be able to give this book a full five star rating. Sometimes I think I suffer too much from a need for instant gratification like I get from watching constant explosions in action films. If that is the case then I apologize for being too harsh on this book.Despite what I saw as this books short comings there was a lot to enjoy. The characters and setting are interesting and entertaining. I will be reading the next book to find out what finally happens to Llew.

This review covers the trilogy in general:1. I loved the beginning of Book 1, which had a humorous tone and was set in modern day Oxford. It reminded me of Brideshead Revisited in some ways, and was so laugh-out-loud funny that I wish the author would set a fantasy novel solely in modern day Oxford.2. Because I loved the setup so much, I was taken aback by some of the character development later on. (I won't give away any plot but you probably know which character I'm talking about if you read it.) I just didn't believe some of the changes based on the beginning, even after reading the entire trilogy and the author's explanation. I do think some of his characters were too \\"black\\" or \\"white\\" and had too many motivations based on plot convenience, but that's okay. I also think he does better character development in his new Robin Hood trilogy - more complex.3. The author does a great job of world building, with lots of description and a real sense of being there and experiencing the Celtic world. Sometimes, I could do with a little less description and more plot/dialogue, but that's just me.4. I think his female characters can be a little boring - amazingly beautiful, wise, graceful, and good, they're sometimes interchangeable. I wish he'd mix things up a little and make them more flawed/human.5. As a Christian reader, I got a lot out of all three books spiritually and really liked some of his analogies to the Christian life.6. I was satisfied with the plot in general. Some things I guessed at the end. Others, I had no clue. It was a fairly wild ride and I had a lot of fun reading it.When it was all over, I spent a lot of time thinking about it and had trouble getting it out of my head. For me, overall, it was a 5-star read.

There is relatively little of the modern world invading this title. Instead, the focus is firmly on the Otherworld, the setting which is the meat of this series.Even though it is slightly better than the rest of the series, it is probably not worth picking up.

Lawhead's Song of Albion trilogy, and, in general, is more involved with the young bloke that becomes Lugh in Albion, and how that happens. He has learned to be a warrior.It details the choices he has to make about fighting, violence, and who to protect and how to protect them when you can, giving shelter and aid to those that need it."},{"Title":"The Silver Hand (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 2)(Library Edition)","review":"The Song of Albion trilogy are some of the best books I have ever read!! They deserve 10 stars! I read fiction critically, paying attention not only to the quality of plot, but also quality of writing and, most importantly, development of characters. Stephen Lawhead's books in general, and this trilogy in particular, satisfy me in every detail. The plots are original and very well researched, and the writing is excellent, with inspiring but not over-used metaphors and subtle alliteration. The characterization is excellent! I could not believe when reading some of these reviews that the reviewer had read the same books that I did. I can truly say that I have never read books in which the characters are better developed than in these. These books deserve to be compared with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, which are my all-time favorite books!Read these books if you like, as I do: Celtic mythology; high fantasy; believable fictional characters; writing that is at once both poetic and gritty; anything written by Tolkien; well-written fantasy with Christian values...I could go on, actually--let's just say READ THESE BOOKS.For those people who thought that the Celtic mythology setting of these books was not accurate and rather forced, I beg to disagree. Having studied Celtic mythology informally quite a lot for the past couple of years, I happen to know that these books are VERY well researched. The more that I learn about Celtic mythology, the more I am impressed by the accuracy of the Song of Albion setting. You will have learned more than you know, as you will find if these books inspire you to look further into this fascinating genre of mythology! And the Otherworld setting is, to me, very believable. I could almost believe it is real. It was a mysterious experience to visit a full-sized model of Stonehenge at sunset, during the time-between-times.Another great thing about these books is that musicians Jeff Johnson and Brian Dunning have written music to go with them. I originally heard of these books through this music. I have all the &quot;Songs from Albion&quot; CDs and highly recommend them, especially if you like contemporary Celtic-style music that is original composition, with a touch of New Age, rock, and medieval styles.That is my review of the series. About this book in particular--I do not need to go over the plot since that has already been done here, and I would not want to ruin it for you anyway. This is the best of the three books, imo. It is poignantly beautiful. The ending nearly made me cry for joy! (For someone who commented that the magical events have no explanation, when did magical events ever have an explanation in fantasy? They just are.) When I finished this book I did not want to start the third one, because the ending was so wonderful I just wanted it to stay that way forever. As for everything else in the book, it is all really good too. :-)Well, I'm done raving now. READ THESE BOOKS!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Silver Hand (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 2)(Library Edition)","review":"Lawhead continues his stunning \\"Song of Albion\\" series with this sequel to \\"The Paradise War\\". Once again this effort bears all the hallmarks of good literature - articulate language, imaginative worlds, mystery and suspense, fairy-tale magic, noble kings and princesses, and enduring themes of justice, sovereignty, truth and right. Lawhead creates a fantastic atmosphere similar to the 1001 Arabian Nights, but on a grander and more glorious scale. While fantastic fiction, the passions of sorrow and joy Lawhead arouses with his story are very real. Lawhead has the ability to draw a reader to heights of joy and exuberance, and dash them to the depths of tragedy and tears. Few writers can make readers cry with joy and with sorrow, but Lawhead is certainly one in this class. There are depths of sorrow that make you weep, and heights of glory that make you cry out! The moment when Llew's hand is cut off, and Tegid is blinded stands out as a striking example of literary fiction with the power to create passion.While the first book in the series was narrated by Llew, this novel sees a disturbing shift in perspective as the bard Tegid assumes the role of narrator. This inexplicable shift takes some getting used to, as we have identified with Llew and grown to love him and see the other world through his eyes, but in the end it doesn't detract from the story. Unlike the story of the first book, in \\"The Silver Hand\\" the modern world doesn't really enter the picture, and all the focus is on events in the other world of Albion. After the cruel murder of Meldryn Mawr, Llew (student Lewis Gillies in the real world) is chosen by the bard Tegid Tathal as the new king. But Llew's kingship is challenged by Meldryn's son Meldron, who is allied with the king's former champion Paladyr and Llew's former friend Siawn (Simon in the real world). After Meldron slaughters Albion's bards, all of Albion is threatened by his rebellion, enslaved by his depraved desire for dominion, and plunged into civil war. Left for dead by Melron, Llew and Tegid regroup and build Dinas Dwr, a city on a lake, to where the faithful remnant of Albion come and pledge their allegiance. But that's just the beginning. Will Llew prevail and will the true kingdom be restored over against the evil that threatens it?Again Lawhead draws on much Biblical imagery, as the following allusions illustrate: The Psalms: \\"The Goodly-Wise heard our song and reached down with his Swift Sure Hand and plucked us out of the sea - and out of the grave Meldron intended.\\" (p93); God's providence: \\"there surged within me a sudden conviction that we had been led to this place; the Goodly-Wise had directed our steps.\\" (p100); The sabbath rest: \\"In my world, people are granted a day of rest from their labours - one day in every seven. In past times it was a jealously guarded gift, though now it is no longer recognized as such.\\" (p192); The three meeting of the three Old Testament strands of prophet, priest and king in a Messiah figure: \\"Prydain, Meldryn Mawr, Ollathir, in these three did the essence of Albion reside. And now these three strands met in one person: Llew\\" (p344); Dependence on God: \\"I raised my staff as they passed and called upon the Swift Sure Hand to uphold them through the fight; I invoked the Goodly-Wise to guide their steps; I entreated the Gifting Giver to grant them the victory.\\" (p351) All in all, it's classic Lawhead, a thoroughly worthy sequel as the magnificent Song of Albion continues! Lawhead, please keep that pen singing!"},{"Title":"The Silver Hand (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 2)(Library Edition)","review":"In this second book of the &quot;Song of Albion&quot; series, Lawhead fleshes out his landscape and characters, yes, and even the villians. For some reason, he switches narrators and unnecessarily forces the reader to make a mental jump, but once that jump is made, the story breezes along.Tegid, the bard, and Llew, the reluctant king, set about carving a new life for themselves while Meldron, the usurper, thinks they're dead. They have time to rebuild and form a company of sorts, but when Meldron catches on to their survival, we know the showdown will eventually come--and to mostly satisfactory results.Lawhead fills his story with rich details and memorable scenes, but, as in the first book, he makes some apparent blunders. Though I was intrigued by the re-appearance of Nettles from the first book, his character never played a true role in the events of the story. Lawhead seemed to set him up for significance, then let me down. This type of thing happens occasionally in Lawhead's writing, whether due to poor plotting or forgetfulness, I do not know.Overall, though, I have to give this book a glowing recommendation. Once finished and set aside, I couldn't get it out of my mind. The scenes were still there, the characters still breathing, the questions still rumbling through my thoughts. Maybe, in this fictitous world come to life, like the real world we inhabit, people and events don't always react or go as planned. Maybe, there are bigger purposes, as of yet unknown to this reader. Maybe, I don't care...I just want to believe the Otherworld is out there, and the Song of Albion is being sung, bringing life to all who hear it."},{"Title":"The Silver Hand (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 2)(Library Edition)","review":"Here we are again, Lewis Gillies has returned to the land of Albion to complete unfinished business. King Meldryn Mawr is dead and his killer must be brought to justice. These two things begin the second leg of this intriguing journey through Albion. No longer the awed American scholar. Lewis has a new name, Llydd Ap Dicter (Anger, Son of Fury) and has found new life among Albion's people.Llydd is soon forced to face a monumental decision and realizes that in order to do that which he originally set out to do, he must bend himself to the will of wise bard and friend Tegid Tethal regarding a crucial subject. Now that Meldryn Mawr is dead, Albion and her people need a new King. Therefore, due to his closeness qirh Meldryn, Llydd is chosen King and given the name Llew.Naturally the dawn of Llew's Kingship does not sit well with others among the populace and stiff opposition is faced. During the conflict, flight, and journey that ensues Llew will grow to be called Silver Hand, for a reason that is self-explanatory but I will not divulge it. Read it yourself and see how it fits into the story well.The meat of this book is the story of the quest to oust a villainous claimant to the throne of Albion. Again, it is filled with rich examples of Celtic legend and lore. Tegid's use of songs and stories to convey lessons is quite effective and touching. The love between Lady Goewyn and Llew Silver Hand is explored again, after being hinted at and begun in THE PARADISE WAR. The friendships, relationships, and love (and hate) between various characters is written convincingly and engagingly.All in all this is a great book and a worthy sequel to THE PARADISE WAR. Again you may find it difficult to put it down and wish that you never had to leave the world established by this book and this series. But that's just the mark of a great writer taking you on a journey through a great story. And that's just what THE SILVER HAND is, step two of a wonderful and engaging story."},{"Title":"The Silver Hand (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 2)(Library Edition)","review":"After the somewhat disappointing first book in this series, The Silver Hand turned to be quite good. The plot is exciting, the action is non-stop, and the Celtic lore was very interesting. Moreover, there were moments in this novel when I had to put the book down because could believe what had just happened. People are maimed, women raped and murdered, entire nations put to the sword. In fact, there were times when I thought the violence depicted went too far, but I also felt it was in keeping with the setting and alternate time period so it had to he accepted. If I had to make one complaint about the novel, it's that the ending was tied up a little too neatly, but not so bad that I didn't thoroughly enjoy the novel."},{"Title":"The Silver Hand (The Song of Albion trilogy, Book 2)(Library Edition)","review":"Had this book for years and wanted it for my kindle.

I had never read SRL before, but the concept of this series really caught my attention. Needless to say I was hooked. I have since read just about everything SRL has written, since March!As may have been mentioned before, the book takes a little while to get started (most Lawhead's books do), but it was all necessary backround and character development. I guess he could have just created a \\"time machine\\", but that wouldn't have been anywhere nearly as interesting a storyline Lawhead has created here. Part Fantasy, part historical fiction/speculation, I found this whole series both entertaining and educational and really created a good foundation for his other Celtic based storylines (i.e. Pendragon series, Hood, Celtic Crusades etc.)I would definetly start with the first book, The Paradise War, since this is a \\"true\\" trilogy, meaning it was meant to be a series right from the start and one book builds on the next with no \\"real\\" ending until the final chapter of the last book. The good thing is, the whole trilogy is complete and you don't have to wait for the next book in the series to be written. I read one book right after the other in about a week.

The something important is the use of folk explanations of behavior. We constantly try to understand our own behavior and that of other people, using simple commonsense attributions. Many of these commonsense attributions have found their way into the self-help literature and have become the stuff of magazine articles and talk shows. Unfortunately, these commonsense attributions are often wrong.Malle does something very interesting by describing explanations of behavior as both cogntive and social acts, and proceeds to show how this dual explanation provides a richness and texture that we have really missed in the past.The book is well written, and does something that I regard as essential, but which is so often missing from contemporary books: he points out the counter arguments and makes some sensible suggestions for further research."},{"Title":"How the Mind Explains Behavior","review":"This volumes deserves to be recognized as a classic in social-sognitive psychology for it does three things that classic works do: (1) It clalrifies historical mistakes in the reading of Heider's original work on attribution both by Jones & Davis and by Kelley, (2)it develops theories both of the conditions under which explanations of behavior are seen as needed and (3) gives an appropriately complex account of the four forms of behavioral explanations that people usually offer. In doing so, he shows how much we as scientists have to learn from the folk explanational conceptual framework that already exists--tho unsystematized until he came along. A book to celebrate and appreciate!"},{"Title":"Crossing America","review":"my copy was an old one-so naturally it was pretty much useless."},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"It is perhaps perfectly appropriate that the author of \`The Cloud of Unknowing' is himself or herself unknown. This is a spiritual classic, a masterpiece in the real sense of the word. The style of writing is grand, well-versed and perfectly in concert with the subject; the ideas contained are some of the most sublime and inspired pieces of writing ever written in the English language. The book does not subscribe to any particular denominational or institutional framework, making it a piece of art and wisdom available to the whole of Christendom, and even appeals to those outside the formal bounds of Christianity.In the preface to this edition by the Paulist Press, Simon Tugwell compares this work with C.S. Lewis, Plato, with other Christian mystics and theologians, with good reason. \`The Cloud of Unknowing' is part of a chain, influenced by and in turn influencing many other mystical writers. This is not a work of philosophy or apologetics, as the author is not concerned to prove the existence of God or set up any sort of metaphysical framework which must be accepted. The world around us is a given, and God is a given, and our task is to order our attention and love toward God so that it incorporates and includes the reality that is around without distraction. One perhaps hears echoes of this in Tillich's ultimate concern?One of the things that makes \`The Cloud of Unknowing' a popular piece on an ongoing basis is this respect for reality. The author does not require super-human feats of contemplative power; this would be to deny the reality of the creature that we are, as God's creation. Contemplative work must be done in tandem and in cooperation with the rest of our life's needs. The virtuous life is one in accordance with nature (for the most part), making creation a blessing rather than a curse - one can hear echoes of Meister Eckhart here, perhaps; like Eckhart, the author of \`The Cloud of Unknowing' also looks not for enlightenment through rational means or higher attainments but through the depths of our souls. There we will find God, for if God is all, then we can certainly not be at the centre, even of ourselves.This edition of \`The Cloud of Unknowing' begins with a scholarly introduction, as do the other volumes in this wonderful series by the Paulist Press. Unlike most other volumes, there is no \`author' to highlight in a biography; while there is some virtue in not knowing the author, there has been a great deal of scholarship, both speculating on the identity of the author, and other work looking at the type of person the author would be and influences that might have impacted the author. The introduction gives some good information in this regard, not only with regard to the writer, but also to the one to whom this writing is addressed. The editors give Phyllis Hodgson's conjecture that the intended reader was not a scholar; some have believed that it was intended for a communal audience.The main point of the writing is the development of prayer and contemplation as a discipline. There are other issues, to be sure, but they always return to this. The attainment of unity with the divine will is all important to the author; one might develop the line from the Lord's Prayer - thy kingdom come, thy will be done - as a mantra for the spirit of this book. This comes through deliberate and intentional choice, and not through artificial ascetic practices (which can be as distracting as enlightening) or intellectual pursuits (which edges toward gnosticism). Part of the development of these realistic practices is the incorporation of the chief virtues of Humility and Charity - the author of the \`The Cloud' will go so far as to say that one who has these has all that is needed. Even through this, humankind cannot reach God without God's willing it to be so, and yet God has made the desire known in many ways, scripturally and traditionally, as well as in the natural world, the author of \`The Cloud' would maintain.This is an inspiring book. \`The Cloud of Unknowing' itself is a relatively short work, but not one that can be read in short order, for the depth of its meaning and insights derived from it take a long time to be properly processed. Walsh's introduction and Tugwell's preface set a good stage for working with this work, which is rather foreign to most Western readers. May it be revealing to you."},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"This was an excellent reading of this classic in Christian spirituality. The book itself is one of the foundations of contemplative prayer and was written for the more advanced. Even for us children in contemplation it is wonderful. The only problem with this tape is that it is abridged. This is such an important book it should be available in its complete state. (Publishers please read or listen to the intiial warnings of this unknown author)."},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"The Cloud of Unknowing is a mystical tract from 14th century England, probably written by a Carthusian monk for a young novice. The work is about contemplative prayer and the mystical union with God through the path of via negativa, or letting go of all concepts, images and ideas of God and creatures and approaching God's bare essence or Being which is veiled in mysterious darkness.This work is one of the finest works of mystical contemplation ever composed, and contains beautiful advice and wisdom relevant to modern contemplatives.This edition also contains a valuable introduction to the Cloud which attempts to reconcile the Cloud author's theology with that of Thomism. While the Cloud author knew Thomism, intellectual theology was not so much his concern (though he is clearly aware of it through Thomas, Richard of St Victor, and Denys the Aeropagite) but mystical union with God. This is what makes the work so powerful spiritually, as does the author's obvious deep experience of the spiritual life."},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"This is a work of immense value, and while I am sure that it is not a book for most people, and it is written only for honestly committed Christians, I do know that for some this book will mark a milestone in their journey of life, faith and love. This is also my preferred version of The Cloud because the 98 page introduction, a book in itself, sets the work within its historical/philosophical/theologica context of fourteenth century England.Long ago, when I was 15, I began to study the Zen approach to (un)reality. A friend, who himself was knowledgeable about such things, gave me his copy of The Cloud of Unknowing and said that it would change my life if I read it seriously and prayerfully, and that I shouldn't think that Christianity lacked what I was seeking in Zen. My friend was something of a mystic, at least to my adolescent mind, and I was impressed by anything he said. Growing up Lutheran, and being a teenager, I was not at all exposed to monasticism or the concept of contemplation. I wasn't sure what reading a book prayerfully even meant, and I had no clue what contemplation meant, but I was trying to live a life of love and prayer, and I was filled with an intense longing for I did not know what, so I gave it a shot. In short, it did change my life. For the first time I began to think of God as not something to be thought about and defined, but to be loved. Later I would learn this to be what the Greek Fathers call apophaticism, or what the Latin Fathers call the via negativa; that sometimes we can say more about something by saying what it is not, to say negative things to a positive effect. Lutherans place a high value on defining everything, which certainly has its positives. But it doesn't often leave room for mystery, which means it doesn't correspond to reality. I know LCMS pastors and seminary grads will rightfully disagree with my description as too simplistic, but on the lay level this holds water. So the change and challenge was liberating. I began to understand that it isn't all about understanding, if that makes sense. For the first time I began to see that God is God, and not my idea of God. And that to draw near to God is not something that I can will to happen as if God is at my beck and call. This all calls to mind Evagrius of Pontus' line, \\"God cannot be grasped by the mind. If he could be grasped, he would not be God.\\"This releasing of our images of God has a great deal to do with the current trends in pop-spirituality and even Eastern/Asian spirituality of the traditional sort, methods and goals that want to disassociate adherents from thoughts and definitions and creeds. But Christianity is not a theology or philosophy of nihilism or reductionism or monism. All is not one and persons actually do exist and love really does unite us to God, Who made matter because matter is a good thing. God reveals Himself in Jesus Christ (John 1:18). He is the Word, the Logos Who reveals the Father (John 10:30). One of the messages of The Cloud, then, is that God reveals God's self to us, and He is not understood through our mental efforts and images. And God even reveals Himself to us as unknowable. This is the opposite of the intellect's inability to conceive of God as God is. That sort of natural apophaticism is a logical deduction as found in Neo-Platonism, Hinduism or Buddhism, but not a divine revelation of the apophaticism of Person (just as our calling God \`Father' by our adoption in Christ is a revealed Name, and not a logical leap, as in Galatians 4:6 and Romans 8:1,5).This is all to say that The Cloud reminds us that our heart's deepest longing is God, and it is put there by God, and that we don't have to and cannot intellectualize our way to God, but to rather allow God's life, by loving our neighbor and bathing in the Word and sacrament (in Greek the word would be translated as \\"mysteries\\"), to draw us into God. Of course this does not force God's hand, but it is what God has Himself said to do, in the same way that a clean mirror reflects the light. The mirror doesn't own the light, but it most a mirror when it is reflecting light. Illumination is neither random nor accidental. There is a condition that is more apt to be illumined than others.Other works of interest, which reinforce the author's point (which actually is about not doing more reading!) would include: Revelations of Divine Love, Dark Night of the Soul (Dover Thrift Editions), The Imitation of Christ (Dover Thrift Editions), The Practice of the Presence of God The Best Rule of Holy Life, New Seeds of Contemplation, Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander, The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality, Dionysius the Areopagite: On the Divine Names and the Mystical Theology, The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church and Encountering the Depths: Prayer, Solitude, and Contemplation.What is a little ironic is that this book has so much to do with apophaticism and just now, as I finish this review, my young son asked me, \\"Why do you want to understand so much about God?\\" Hmmm..."},{"Title":"The Cloud of Unknowing (The Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"This is a great book which has helped me deepen my prayers.

He is writing for those who find themselves no longer satisfied with the 'practices' of Christian piety; they are drawn by some mysterious further desire and must try to discover whether this desire is a genuine attraction to contemplation... or whether it is simply an affectation or mere intellectual curiosity.\\"He wrote, \\"For when you first begin to undertake it, all that you find is a darkness, a sort of cloud of unknowing: you cannot tell what it is, except that you experience in your will a simple reaching out to God. This darkness and cloud is always between you and your God, no matter what you do, and it prevents you from seeing him clearly by the light of understanding in your reason, and from experiencing him in sweetness of love in your affection.\\" (Pg. 120-121)He elaborates, \\"When I say 'darkness,' I mean a privation of knowing, just as whatever you do not know or have forgotten is dark to you, because you do not see it with your spiritual eyes.

For a book of this size (600 pages) and modest price, it is an excellent starting point for the traveler. To include everything else (maps, prices for accommodations, etc.) the book would have to be several times its size and price."},{"Title":"Uncle Sam's Guide to the Great Outdoors","review":"Uncle Sam's Guide to the Great Outdoors is a curious compilation of odds and ends about National Parks, Monuments and Forests. I purchased it in anticipation of an April trip to the Great Smokey Mountain National Park as well as an aid for a June drive from Texas to California. I was looking forward to having e-mail addresses and descriptions of park features in a single compendium rather than scattered through various guide books. My first reaction to the book was dismay that the pages were so barren. There is an astonishing percentage of white space: fonts are large; line and paragraph spacing are loose; and paragraphs are so far from the right margin that my reading lamp glares off the whiteness. If this book were done in the same style as Fodor's, it's total length would decrease by about 70%. My second reaction, based on reading the chapters on Tennessee, Utah, Arizona and California, is who is the audience? If it's intended for people who don't spend much time in national parks, these descriptions won't draw much enthusiasm for visiting. If it's intended for relatively knowledgable hikers, the critical information is scant. There are any number of regional guidebooks that give detailed, highly glowing accounts of National Parks within their area. What I had hoped for was something that exceeded those guides. Instead, there's not enough information to entice the neophyte to a new area, nor is there much help, for example, on whether Zion National Park contains cabins for rent that are in my budget. What would be really useful would be a synopsis of camping and cabin rental availability with price quotes, average monthly high and low temperatures, detailed descriptions of hikes and other activities, maps of the Park, Monument or Forest, maps at the start of each section that locate the sites discussed, statistics on the average numbers of visitors in each month (how crowded is the park?), etc. Most of this information is presented skimpily or not at all in Uncle Sam's. The e-mail addresses will ! very likely be useful, but beyond these items, there is little in this book to recommend it."},{"Title":"Using HTML and XHTML (Special Edition)","review":"If, as I recently did, you were to buy Molly Holzschlag's outstanding &quot;Special Edition Using HTML and XHTML&quot; and &quot;Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design,&quot; you might wonder if you had awoken on some strange planet in which pricey web books were actually worth the money, and tech authors wrote at a level that both challenged, elucidated, and entertained.Molly Holzschlag's book, simply put, succeeds on every possible level. The style is clear and personable and the information is cogently and logically presented. As a web standards &quot;insider,&quot; she gives you the history behind the development of markup languages rather than just throwing out the standard grid of what breaks in which browsers -- because, as this book so clearly demonstrates, the &quot;why&quot; matters a great deal, and you can't really get your mind around that without a few little history lessons along the way.But it is not just a collection of dry facts and background info; the book is hands-on all the way, and constantly uses work-along examples to teach how to use XHTML to author web pages.As Holzschlag states in the intro, the perfect reader for this book is the intermediate user -- someone who has used HTML before, and is quite familiar with web authoring, but maybe wishes to finally learn to do things the &quot;right way,&quot; now that the W3C has made some headway with specifications. The book hits its intended audience mark dead on. The info is not dumbed down, yet important concepts are explained in detail. If you encounter a concept that is over your head, chances are there will be a sidebar link to the W3C website for additional information you need to catch up. This seems to me a very good compromise between leaving seasoned professionals bored, and lower-level intermediates in the dust.There are several excellent reference charts (such as for ASCII symbols, character sets), and a comprehensive XHTML tag reference, making this a perfect all-around desk reference as well as a tool for getting up to speed on XHTML.I believe this book would be particularly useful for the web designer wishing to move towards using XHTML for content and CSS for style and layout. In that case, I suggest &quot;Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design&quot; as a companion volume to round out the CSS side of things (Actually, Holzschlag herself references Meyer's book several times).If you really want to make the switch to cleaner markup, and prepare yourself for what's coming on the web (and if you don't think you want to, this book might also convince you why you *should* want to...) you could hardly do better than this book."},{"Title":"Using HTML and XHTML (Special Edition)","review":"This book, like most other primers on XHTML, tries to take the minor differences between standard HTML and XHTML, and turn it into a full blown manuscript. The truth is, if you already know HTML, then you already know most of what you need for XHTML.XHTML differs little from HTML, except for the following points (I'm using brackets here on purpose so as not to mark up this review) :- XHTML is case sensitive, e.g. the tags [h1] and [H1] are not equivalent.- tags must be nested properly, e.g. [b][i]your text here[/b][/i] is incorrect in a \\"well formed\\" document.- certain tags that take no attributes must be terminated with a slash, e.g. [br /]- XHTML can use \\"modules\\" (and good luck trying to understand that chapter in the book).That's about all you need to know about XHTML. Throw in a DTD definition and you're done. But the book does a poor job of explaining just what a DTD is and why you need one, other than the XML gods just saying you need one.Much of the book is also C.I.P.U. to HTML users. CSS is given two short chapters with little explanation of why you need CSS and how it can help you manage your web pages. And then it's onto XML, with the same lack of explanation. But, as with most CSS and XML primers, this is typically the case. Everybody is touting the value of XML, but almost nobody can tell you why or how to use this new technology. And this book is no different.I gave the book two stars because of its one outstanding feature, the references in Appendix C & D. The book is worth having around just for those two sections. In that sense you might want to pick up a used copy for much less than a new one."},{"Title":"Using HTML and XHTML (Special Edition)","review":"This book did a great job describing xhtml,and like most special edition books I really liked. It was easy to understand. However, they didn't do the best describing modularization. I understood it more when I read it on w3.org. It also should've gone a bit further. I was especially disappointed it didn't say anything about xforms which was like the coolest part of xhtml. That doesn't this book isn't worth the money though. Its a great reference, but if you're looking to harness the full potential of xhtml and its newer features go elsewhere."},{"Title":"Using HTML and XHTML (Special Edition)","review":"This book takes a detailed look at HTML and XHTML and all the various topics that relate to these markup languages. Even at the book's start, it discusses specifications and Document Type Definitions (DTD). In the book's second part, it talks about lists, links, tables, framesets, and forms, some of the \\"easier\\" things you can do with HTML and XHTML. Part three gets into adding images and multimedia, and what to watch out for when adding these items. Cascading Style Sheets get a thorough lookover in the book's fourth part, from using them with HTML & XHTML to adding style and positioning.

It is far from the best of in its field, because it is given to restating the vocabulary rather than giving meaning, as in this description of milk thistle:Hepaptoprotective; reduces serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and transaminases (ALT, AST), reduces triglyceride in serum; reduces malondialdehyde...This is simply the ploy used by herbalists with a more limited grasp of technical terminology. One herbalist might say, &quot;flushes the liver,&quot; which is meaningless, while these herbalists say, &quot;reduces serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase,&quot; which is meaningless to most readers and of very limited clinical value to practitioners. Reduces GGT how? Through action on hepatocytes? By maintaining plasticity? By introducing variation in laboratory measurements without beneficials changes to tissue? Can we assume our patients are better if their GGT titers are reduced?Dr. Blumenthal obviously reads and writes. He sees a scientific fact, rephrases it, and adds a citation. This may be impressive, but it isn't useful. And the focus is exclusively herbal. Physicians would be much better served to read Murray &amp; Pizzorno's textbooks on naturopathy than this long vocabulary exercise."},{"Title":"The ABC Clinical Guide to Herbs [with supplement]","review":"This book should be on every pharmacy reference shelf whether it is in the corner drugstore or the hospital pharmacy.

Contraindications, adverse effects, and drug interactions are there also for each herb and there is just enough botany and chemistry to keep an academic interested.

This is a claim many have made about the American Botanical Council's earlier encyclopedic guides to the clinical use of herbs, but there is a reason to buy this book even if you have The Complete German Commission E Monographs or the The Expanded German Commission E Monographs. Mark Blumentha, Tara Hall, Alicia Goldberg, Tanja Kunz, Kara Dinda, Josef Brinckmann, and Dr. Bernd Wollschlaeger have gone beyond the herbs considered by German science to the herbs North Americans use. There are, quite simply, more herbs in this book, more of the herbs people use every day.One might ask why these herbs weren't considered in earlier volumes, but the simple fact is, the depth of documentation in any book authored by Mark Blumenthal takes years of study, consultation, and practice. While many say it more eloquently--I hope the authors put up their back cover on this website--I'll say it, too, anyone who cares about and wants to know more about the medicinal use of herbs simply has to have this book.

With an entire chapter on slime eels--aka hagfish--which burrow into dead fish and consume them from the inside out? You bet. As the author points out, the above-named creatures are but a few of the species that belong to the group of animals known as invertebrates, which not only lack a backbone, but also, pound for pound, far outweigh any other form of life on earth. &quot;There are only 4,500 or so mammal species on the planet. There are, however, between ten million and thirty million invertebrate species. They represent more than 99.5 percent of all animal species. A spaceship visiting the blue planet would take them, not us, as the typical earthlings.&quot;And invertebrates are often far more interesting than us boring old mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. Take a fire ant queen, for example, who reproduces so wholeheartedly that her human equivalent would be a 120-pound woman giving birth to 500,000 babies each year. Or how about the mysterious giant squid--at sixty feet long and with eyes the size of headlights, the largest invertebrate alive--who lives five hundred fathoms beneath the ocean waves. (Nobody has ever seen one in its natural habitat.)So who's the audience? Any adult with a taste for the more slithery residents of earth--or any parents who want to wow their own offspring with bizarre true-life tales of the scaly and slimy.

This book is a must read for anyone who really wants to learn more about some of the most misunderstood and hated creatures on our planet. Easy to read, entertaining and educational, Richard Conniff spins tales guaranteed to shed new light on the invertebrate world and can be read and appreciated by young and old alike.Recently I was fortunate enough to spend some time interviewing this talented author and was fascinated with his insight and true depth of feeling for the planet. It is a shame that the media suffers from tunnel vision when it comes to teaching the public about animals. Over and over we are presented with the same information about the same animals which limits our understanding of the importance of bio-diversity. Richard Conniff has worked for both the Discovery Channel and National Geographic and has travelled extensively, and with &quot;Spineless Wonders&quot; and his latest work &quot;Every Creeping Thing&quot; he has achieved what many strive for but very few accomplish.Hats off to Mr. Conniff and if those talk shows had any sense they would book you immediately and discover what I already have, that you are an incredible resource for information about the relationships between humans and other species"},{"Title":"Spineless Wonders: Strange Tales from the Invertebrate World","review":"Richard Conniff's writing style is fun and easy to read. And although some of the facts he pours into the book may be gross, it's so interesting you are riveted. I think everyone-science lover or no-needs to read this book. I couldn't put the book down until I was done. Just to give you some extra info on what's in the book-he discusses many invertebrates such as flies, hagfish, moths and tarantulas, devoting a chapter to each invertebrate. He includes his adventures with these creatures along with it. Even the hardened scientist will find something new in this book!"},{"Title":"Spineless Wonders: Strange Tales from the Invertebrate World","review":"There is more to the world of nature than cuddly koalas, magnificent whales, and beautifully singing birds. Most of the animal kingdom, and much of the biomass on the planet, are invertebrates! Insects, spiders, centipedes, molluscs, crustaceans, echnioderms, worms, all greatly outnumber vertebrates and are absolutely vital to continued life on earth, and all are greatly unappreciated by the average person.Richard Conniff takes us on a representative tour of several members of the invertebrate world. Though he only scratches the surface, he shows us some of the most fascinating of the &quot;creepy crawlies,&quot; creatures that often have few admirers in the media or popular culture. From the fascinating world of flies to the invaluable leech to the hated fire ant to beetles, fleas, and giant squid and beyond, Conniff shows us the astounding world of invertebrates.Strictly speaking, Conniff includes one vertebrate in the mix, the lowly but extremely unusual hagfish, so it is not only invertebrates. Having said that though this was an excellent book, one well worth reading. Popular science writing at its best."},{"Title":"Spineless Wonders: Strange Tales from the Invertebrate World","review":"If Steven King can become so popular writing books that totally freak people out by being gross, weird and scary, then Richard Conniff should be a household name by now.

You don't have to be a true bug-lover or bug-hater to enjoy this book. From mosquitoes to fleas to giant squid, this book visits some of the incredible invertebrates on Earth. This easy and fun to read set of essays might leave you unsure if you still want to interact with the world around you, but will not fail to intrigue you, amaze you, and sometimes maybe gross you out.

His subject: invertebrates, with about ten different chapters on different creatures, such as leeches, dragonflies, tarantulas, etc. NOT ALL POPULAR INVERTEBRATES ARE COVERED IN THIS BOOK. In fact, if there is not a chapter devoted to your favorite invertebrate, there will be little or no information on that beast. There are many examples. Jellyfish, starfish, bees, crabs, clams, octopuses and lobsters are but a few that Conniff chose not to cover.If you need detailed information about an invertebrate not covered in this book, or if you need more detail, I advise you to seek out a book on that specific beast. Also, you can look into Robert Barnes' book _Invertebrate Zoology_, but that book...is best used at a public or college library.On the plus side: there aren't many good books on invertebrates for a general audience, and _Spineless Wonders_ is one of them. Most folks, while they might be able to stomach ten or twenty pages on leeches, don't want an entire book on leeches. In fact, most full length books on leeches, dragonflies, etc. are indeed academic tracts targeted at serious collectors or graduate students and professors.Conniff's writing is usually lucid and entertaining. He held my attention until the end of each chapter... almost. Still, there isn't much popular writing on invertebrates in general, so _Spineless Wonders_ is well worth a look.ken32"},{"Title":"Spineless Wonders: Strange Tales from the Invertebrate World","review":"Richard Conniff's subjects in his other works are often scientists and explorers of the natural world, and in this text he reviews the subjects of his subjects, much like the often-quoted description of the meat-packing company, Armour, wryly credited with using every part if the hog except the smell.

Conniff's goal is to show that invertebrates are as amazing than most of the charismatic megafauna we all know and love. In fact, many of these bugs are even more incredible, with complex chemical tricks and the ability to undertake great physical leaps and bounds (relative to their size of course). Conniff's writing style is very easy to read and the book is intended for a wider audience (I suspect it might bore more initiated readers). I was disappointed that a few major bugs were not included in the book, particularly Scorpions, but I guess the book had to cut something out.

It is a great way to introduce a way to relaxation at an early age."},{"Title":"A Boy and a Turtle: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"Great relaxation she enjoys all 4 storys and uses them on her own for a sleep aid if she cannot fall asleep for naps or bedtime."},{"Title":"A Boy and a Turtle: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"We all very much enjoyed this book. Our 10 year old son benefited from focusing on the colors described in the book and just tune out the daily noise whenever he wanted. It was also a great introduction into meditation with chakra colors, which was another purpose to our enjoying this book. Thanks!"},{"Title":"A Boy and a Turtle: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It's seems more like someone's personal craft project at home, the writing was a little boring and the illustrations were so elementary. Each page on the right is a color of the rainbow with white text. When you get to the yellow page you barely can make anything of the text out because of the little contrast. I want to ask did anyone edit or review a proof of this book before it went to print. It really seemed like a happy hands at home project."},{"Title":"A Boy and a Turtle: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"This book is the perfect way to help your young one relax before bed. Teaches progressive relaxation in a child friendly way. Why didn't I give it 5 stars? I'm not sure, maybe the illustration seems a little lacking, but not really, maybe the story seems a little contrived? Of course it is. Still it's a really great bedtime book, not as much for the story, but for the calming feeling it gives. Just in reading it you'll find your own breathing will slow down. Be careful, or you might fall asleep yourself! My son and daughter (age 3 and 6) both like this book and ask for it from time to time. Sometimes, I pick it out for them, especially after Daddy's turned them into crazy giggling and squealing things and it's my job to calm them back down so they can sleep."},{"Title":"A Boy and a Turtle: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"I am so impressed with Affirmation Weaver (positive self-talk) and A Boy and a Turtle (visualizing) CD's that I can't put it into words. These CD's have helped my son overcome his anxiety of going to school when he first started kindergarten 4 years ago. We also put them on when he is having a hard time falling asleep. They are a great resource for any child to have in their room"},{"Title":"A Boy and a Turtle: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"I bought this book based upon my 7 year old son having a lot of anxiety issues with school related issues. I read this book to him the first night, and I have not been able to put it down since. EVERY night around bedtime he asks me to read him his relaxation book. He goes through the motions of closing his eyes, and really trying to relax. After about 1 week of reading it to him, he can start relaxing on his own."},{"Title":"A Boy and a Turtle: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"I am not particularly fond of this book right now, though I purchased it to give to my 3 and 1/2 year old grandson, along with a cute stuffed turtle I purchased for him, thinking it would be a great book to accompany the toy. Since my grandson is not in need of \\"relaxation\\" any more than the average 3 and 1/2 year old child, I found the book to be too therapeutic-sounding and am not giving it to him as planned. I will keep it, though, just in case.... and who knows? In this crazy world of ours, he may just need this book in his future. Glad that others found it good for their kids. I hadn't realized how many troubled children there are out there at such tender ages."},{"Title":"A Boy and a Turtle: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"All 3 of my children grew up with this book by their beds. Now I have the pleasure of revisiting it with my nephew. Colors influence our moods, our emotions, and even our health. This simple mind, body connection allows children to access the power of color, emotionally & physically in a fun simple story. My nephew now knows how to use colors to calm himself and help himself to fall asleep. Sometimes he pretends that he is the boy and sometimes he wants to be the turtle! LOL...either way he enjoys relaxing with the colors."},{"Title":"A Boy and a Turtle: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"I am a therapist for children between the ages of 4 and 20. While the book was colorful and the idea was creative, it has received a consistently poor response from children and adults alike. I like that the story is short and succinct, but it is my opinion that the potential fell far short. Upon reading, two individuals felt like the strongest message they came away with were homosexual undertones with the setting, use of the rainbow, and the connection between the turtle and the boy. Regardless, the message flopped, doesn't warrant even one star in my opinion, as a children's therapist."},{"Title":"A Boy and a Turtle: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"First I will begin by listing the programs/CD's/books that I have purchased from Lite Books. 4 books: A Boy and a Bear, The Affirmation Web, A Boy and a Turtle and The Goodnight Caterpillar plus 5 audio CDs: Indigo Dreams, Indigo Ocean Dreams, Indigo Dreams: Garden of Wellness, Indigo Teen Dreams and Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation plus: Children's Stress Awareness Curriculum Designed for Youth Education.Next I will say \\"THEY ARE ALL AMAZING!\\" For 9 years I worked as an advocate for children in a homeless shelter for women and children. I was constantly challenged with finding resources that were short, effective, and held the attention of the children. I was able to find resources but not all in one spot, I had to piece a little of this and a little of that to reach a fully rounded program that worked. The tools that Lori Lite created within each book and each CD offer short, highly effective programs that hold the attention of children. And best of all it is a package deal! You do not have to pull from any other program because the tools that she gives you are all you need. I am now an HHP and use the books and CD's when working with children of any age to simply give them powerful tools that they can use in daily life and hopefully carry into teen and adult hood. In my opinion Lite Books offer the best resources available to the health and wellness of children on the market. Within my own life I use the CD's as a nightly staple within the bedtime process of my children. They have not been able to stay awake long enough to finish even one of the stories on the CD yet. That is how relaxing the CD's are. For myself I have to stay sitting up when tucking them in and listening with them because if I get comfortable I am waking up in the middle of the night still in my kid's room! During daylight hours and when my children are well rested I have worked each session on the CD's with them from beginning to end. Now when they are feeling overwhelmed, frightened, angry etc... I will see them use the techniques they have learned through Loris programs, they move quickly from the negative feeling to a positive approach and positive result.Lite Books offers professional and friendly customer service, with great shipping time. I am so grateful to have found this amazing resource and look forward to being one of their strongest professional advocates as well as personal customers!"},{"Title":"A Boy and a Turtle: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"I am so pleased with this book and heard great things about the other books that Lori Lite has written.A Boy and a Turtle helped teach my child to visualize the things he wants to create in his life. He is very active in sports and this book has helped him develop his skills and mental game. Before each game he pictures in his mind the thing he wants to achieve during the game. He sees the success he is going to have and knows that his mind is so powerful that his body just performs the way he wants it to.Last week he hit a grand slam and told me after the game that he visualized hitting the ball over the fence.

I think the reviewer was referencing the Indigo Dreams Cd which has 4 stories on it(including this one).This book is one wonderfully relaxing story that has shown my child how to relax with the turtle by using this visualization technique. My son loves the story and asked for it whenever he is over stimulated, stressed or angry. It is easy to follow along, the illustrations are adorable and he falls asleep.

My son was very anxious to attend preschool and we would have crying sessions starting from the day before. This book helped him calm down and be more accepting of his new change of place. He makes me read it just before he leaves home and then though still a little anxious , he manages to go to class without crying.When I first read this book I did not think it would work, but he seems much more calm after reading it.The story is about a boy who sits next to a pond with a rainbow at its edge and how he imagines the rainbow colors enter him and calm him down.

Its a memorable book!"},{"Title":"A Rage of Intelligence","review":"This is a thoughtful and wryly funny little book, with a lot of breadth in terms of its perspective, flying easily from baseball through secret-agentry into the bowels of the Roman Catholic Church with ease and elan. To me, it's very evocative of 60's Richard Brautigan, without the hippy-dippy baggage. Revenge of the Lawn came strongly to mind when I first picked this title up. If I could ask anything more of the author, I would tell him to try something like Trout Fishing In America next, because some of his backgrounds make me believe he might have a knack for a little prose with his poetry. One way or the other, I expect we'll be seeing more of Paul Bussan."},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"Several times Agatha Christie accompanied her husband Max Mallowan on his archaeological expeditions to the Middle East. When friends kept on asking how she lived there, Agatha decided to write her adventures down in this book.The title, in fact, is a pun on &quot;tell,&quot; the Arabic word for hill or mound, which is used in the Middle East to describe the hill-like shapes of buried archaeological sites.This book is probably the most humorous book the detective writer has ever written. She not only puts her own fame in perspective, but also acts as a keen observer of those little things that make humans such funny creatures. Although you never lose the impression that most of the characters in this non-fiction book are caricatures of real people, it still gives you a plausible impression of how life strolled on in the Middle East at that time.Do not expect a serious treatise on archaeological excavations, because you won't find any scientific information in this book. What you can expect is a rather messy hodgepodge of all-day situations that may bring a smile on your face. And that's fine with me, because that's all Agatha intended it to be: an easily digested chronicle written with love."},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"It's great to know that this book is available again to delight new readers with Agatha's travel diary.Married to an archeologist, who worked mainly at that part of the world once known as Mesopotamia, Agatha has participated in many expeditions with her husband and team. Her book is about her day life at the camp, trying to manage the servants, struggling to develop photos of the objects in a suffocating studio, fighting her own shyness when it comes to talk to the expedition's architect. Piece by piece, she take us back to this almost mysterious past with her talent and good sense of humor.Mine is an old edition, but when I feel a little depressed or sad, I always go back to its pages. It heals my soul. Every time."},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"Agatha Christie was a prolific writer who churned out one or more books each year for decades. She was invariably on the Best Seller lists in several countries at any given moment, usually had at least one or more plays running in London and saw several films made from her novels. One would imagine her life as divided between writing her novels in some comfortable English country house or attending various events publicizing her latest work or supporting some worthy cause. Instead of this life in the public spotlight for many years she spent every winter 'season' accompanying her husband, Max Mallowan, on archaeological digs in the Middle East, usually living in primative conditions and assisting him with his work. This book is her description of that part of her life, where she was not Agatha Christie, the world famous writer but Mrs Mallowan, the boss's wife.This chronicle, written and published against her agent's and publisher's advice was written shortly before WWII broke out and describes life on archaelogical digs in the Middle East. Christie gives us descriptions of areas that figure prominently in today's news, Beruit, Basura, Afghanistan. Events that shape present day headlines are recent events at this time, the Armenian massacres for example. While Christie mentions these larger events her focus is on the day to day lives of those around her, the interactions of Europeans, Arabs, Kurds and others. She describes a time when a twenty five mile trip into the nearest town could take two or more days, and where communication was almost nonexistent. In this exotic location she relates homey little tales of village life such as Miss Marple would know (though without the murders).As another reviewer has already mentioned these memoirs are reminiscent of Elizabeth Peter's Amelia Peabody novels both in setting and wry tone. For fans of Christie it is a treat to get a glimpse into this very private woman's private life. From time to time a situation or person that has appeared in her stories can be seen here 'in real life'."},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"I'm sad to see that this book is out of print, because it's one of my favorites by Christie. Her second husband, archeologist Max Mallowan, was kind, reliable, and utterly devoted to her, by contrast with her straying ex. But accompanying Mallowan on his digs satisfied her adventurous side as well, and this period of her life was a happy and productive one. In this book, she writes humorously about their travels together, but the picture that emerges is one of great affection and mutual respect. Guaranteed to make you feel good!"},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"This book has been my companion for a few nights now, just a little amusing reading while I prepare to drop off-- if only those dogs would move over and give me some room!Christie writes of a Middle East that few now can remember, and she is writing to entertain, not inform. There's a certain careless racism that caused me a little niggle of discomfort but, fear not, the Europeans come in for their fair share of ridicule as she skewers the members of the dig and their staff.Those who enjoy Elizabeth Peters' mysteries set in Egypt (at admittedly an earlier period) might also enjoy this glimpse into what a dig in the desert could be like.Just to put things in perspective, Mallowan (Christie's archaeologist husband) had begun his career digging with Leonard Woolley and Christie is writing oh so casually about events that underpin some of what is going on in that part of the world now. The massacre of Armenians and the differences between the Kurds and the Arabs are now writ large in our news reports."},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"Agatha Christie's Autobiography gives almost no attention to what is the most exciting time in her life--to her and to anyone interested in her. It's obvious that she was much more content at this point in her life through the amount of character and excitement this book contains, though it spans a much shorter time. It is a chronicle of her time in the Middle East with her second husband Max Mallowan, and conveys a fascinating picture of archaeology and life in the desert areas in the middle of the century"},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"In the early portion of the 20th Century, wealthy leisured men not infrequently financed and supervised archeological digs (to the dismay of modern scientists). Famed mystery writer Agatha Christie's husband was such a wealthy leisured man. In Come, Tell Me How You Live, Ms. Christie depicts a several-year-long archeological expedition to the Middle East. Though clearly not nearly so interested in archeology as her husband, Agatha traveled to the Middle East with him and recorded her impressions of the people and places she visited. Writing with keen observation and more keen humor, Ms. Christie both provides a history of the dig and points out the stark differences between the Middle East and Europe in the early 20th century.Though this book is quite clearly somewhat dated and many modern readers may feel, at the very least, uncomfortable with the depictions of the local population, Ms. Christie succeeds in painting an attractive picture of a romantic bygone era. (That is not to say that Ms. Christie sugarcoats the events of the expedition - indeed, more than a few persons involved in the dig die.) She presents the British empire in its waning days, conjuring visions of proper but amused Brits struggling to maintain decorum among civilizations half a world physically and a universe culturally away from Britain. Thankfully, Ms. Christie avoids excessive romanticization and does not fail to recognize the humanity in the local populace. Though the \\"natives\\" are constant objects of confusion and humor, they are never treated as subhuman.Perhaps most surprising for me is the persona of Ms. Christie that emerges from this book. Having read more than a few of Ms. Christie's works, I was aware of her humor and, at times, ability to take on a conversational tone. Even so, I was impressed and delighted to discover an Agatha Christie that was sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, self-deprecating and empathetic. Simply for this, the book is worth reading. Though I would not attempt to claim that this book is a masterpiece of contemporary history, it does provide a pleasant-feeling remembrance of an interesting point in time and insight into the unexpected life experience of one of history's great genre authors."},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"This is the first Agatha Christie book I've read that was NOT a mystery. I was not sure if I would enjoy it but I did! One of the reviews said \\"it is impossible for Christie to write a dull book\\" and I now agree with that statement.Reading this is like entering another world. I never gave a thought to what an archaeological dig would be like, but now I have a very good idea. I'm sure that this book is dated and things have changed by now, but I really felt like I was a part of the time and place Christie and her husband occupied. I'd just love the chance to meet them now!"},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"I stayed at the Hotel Baron in Aleppo in 1990 and 1992 where, many years earlier, Agatha Christie and Max Mallowan frequently sought respite from the Syrian desert. I mentioned to the Baron's owner, Krikor Mazmoumian, that Come Tell Me How You Live was my favorite book of hers. &quot;Oh, mine too,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't like mysteries. I once threw a party here at the hotel. Agatha was in the lobby and was a bit miffed when guests didn't realize who she was. She went all silent. But when I introduced her, and others recognized who she was she perked up and had a grand time.&quot;"},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"When reality surpasses fiction: Every near-eastern archaeologist will love to read over and over again this wonderful book.

It is so different from other Agatha Christie books."},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"A nice retro insight into realities of earlier 20th-century desert expeditions in northern Mesopotamia with Christie's archaeologist-husband Max Mallowan. She walks the line of her physical and psychological limits (teetering from one side to the other), and ridicules the menagerie of backward locals, but gives credit where credit is due for remarkable physical and mental feats by the indigenes. You have to like someone who credits herself with finally closing an overpacked suitcase by dint of personal \\"avoir du pois\\", applied by sitting!"},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"Like reading an Agatha Christie mystery, this slim autobiography takes you to a different era. \\"Come, Tell Me How You Live\\" was originally published in 1946, but it covers five archaeological seasons that took place before WWII. All of the digs were in Syria, which was French-controlled at the time.This is a simply charming memoir. When Agatha accompanied her husband, archaeologist Max Mallowan, on these expeditions, she was already famous for at least 8 published mysteries starring Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. As Jacquetta Hawkes states in the book's introduction, this is not an archaeological treatise, but a light-hearted look at Christie's game embrasure of life in the field. (Hawkes was a much-published archaeologist in her own right.)The contrast between the more familiar British life and attitudes to those of the Syrians she meets, which included ex-Armenians and Kurds and many different religions, is marked. Christie is never disrepectful of these differences, and the very occasional whiff of nobless oblige is written with such comic appreciation that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had to keep in mind that this was written nearly 80 years ago, and undoubtedly, much has changed now.There's lots of gentle humor, and I had several laugh-out-loud moments while reading \\"Come, Tell Me How You Live\\". At one point, Christie expounds on the communication problem with employees, only partly explained by the language difference:\\"The servant problem on the Habur is very different from the servant problem in England. You might say that here the servants have an employer problem! Our fancies, prejudices, likes and dislikes are quite fantastic, and follow, to the native mind, no logical pattern whatever!For instance, various cloths of slightly different texture with different-coloured borders are issued, and are supposed to be used for different purposes. Why this elaboration?Why, when Mansur is using a blue-edged teacloth to wipe mud from the car's radiator, does an incensed Khatun (Christie) emerge from the house full of condemnation? The cloth has removed the mud most successfully. Again, why unmerited censure when a visit to the kitchen reveals the fact that the breakfast things after washing up are being wiped with a sheet?'But,' protests Mansur, anxious to vindicate his conduct, 'it is not a clean sheet we are using. It is a dirty sheet!' \\"I very much enjoyed this memoir. It is full of love for the strange landscape and captivating people."},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"Agatha Christie said that people often asked her \\"how they lived\\" when she and her husband, archeologist Max Mallowan went east on digs, so she decided to write about it. This book is much like a daily journal, with much left out of course, of anecdotes of life in Syria over a span of several different expeditions. It took place in the 1930's before WWII, and she remarked at the end how good it was (for others, she didn't achieve it) to be able to live apart from and untouched by war. They had a house built with a central domed room and two additional rooms on each end; this house they lived in during the expeditions and gave to the local shiek at the end of last one. Of course, there was no electricity, no electronics, no running water, no modern conveniences of any kind. They had household servants as well as approximately 250 workman who actually performed the digs on the tells. They traveled by an old sedan and transported finds and furniture in an old lorry, both of which were given to breakdowns and being stuck in rain-flooded wadis. In this short book, the author includes many anecdotes including stories of injuries and accidental death on the digs, stories of how little concerned the native people were about death, about the beautiful and lively Kurkish women. It's a fascinating glimpse into the primitive daily lives on the people in that part of the world in the early part of the last century. Agatha Christie was a matchless writer with a way with words that has never been equalled. All her books are immensely readable and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"Agatha Christie wrote this delightful book of her travels with her archaeologist husband Max Mallowan in 1946. It was an entertaining and humorous back then, it still is. I picked this book up while browsing at a Salvation Army store, where I go often, as I like getting books and things for not much money.I leafed through the book, read the introduction by David Pryce-Jones and was immediately taken with Max. Then I continued on, reading the first fifty pages in that back of that Salvation Army store, among the books. Of course I bought it, you should too, because this is a book that will drag lots of chuckles out of you, will teach you a bit about how an archaeologist worked six decades ago and to a certain extant probably still works today. Plus, above all, this is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"Come Tell Me How You Live; An Archaeological Memoir is Pure delight. Agatha Christe's second husband was Max Mallowan an archeologist. This memoir was written in the early thirties before the second world war. However not published according to Agatha during the devastating war years. It is not a mystery nor a historical memoir of this period in her life.However it records the people in the expedition, the workers, their way of life,philosophy etc. It is difficult to imagine Agatha living in primitve rat-infested tents when you think about all of her stately homes in the UK. However she admits this period of her life exploring with Max the remains of thousands of years of relics one of her happiest. In fact one of the dialogues in her novel Cat Among Pigeons is almost verbatim with an actual conversation she had with a Turkish roomate on the Orient Express. Please don't miss this memoir both funny and poignant."},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"I ordered this book and couldn't wait for it to arrive. I wasn't disappointed. This is a lovely book. An easy read where Agatha Christie will take you by hand and walk you through a period of her life. I totally fell in love with it and plan to read it again soon. As an avid Agatha Christie fan who has read her books over and over again for over 30 years, it was a breakthrough to me to be able to tie back some of her characters and plots to her real life. Right after reading this book I read her Autobiography - I ordered both books at the same time. Unfortunately, I did not care much for her autobiography but I truly loved and enjoyed this book. I hope it will turn into a movie some day. Enjoy it."},{"Title":"Come, Tell Me How You Live","review":"I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS BOOK AND WANT TO HAVE IT. HOWEVER, IT SEEMS THAT YOU ARE NOT AWARE THAT IT HAS BEEN RE-PUBLISHED AND HAS BEEN REVIEWED IN THE ATLANTIC, LATEST ISSUE, IF IT IS AVAILABLE PLEASE LET ME KNOW."},{"Title":"Insect Transgenesis: Methods and Applications","review":"This book gives a useful and fascinating overview of the status of transgenic strategies in insects as it was known in the year 2000. Written by experts in the field, it will introduce both biologists and non-biologists to many of the techniques used for the introduction of transgenes in insects. Readers are expected to have a fairly strong background in molecular genetics, but it could still be profitably read by anyone who is curious about this exciting technology. Due to space constraints, only a few of the articles will be reviewed here.The first article gives a historical introduction to gene transfer in insects. The P-Element transformation was the first transposon-based system for transforming the germline in D. melanogaster efficiently and stably. This transposon is an example of the Class II short inverted terminal repeat transposons, and its high mobility made it a successful for Drosophila transformation. The P vector however was not successful in non-drosophilid insects, and therefore other choices for vector-mediated transfer were researched. Some of these are discussed in this article, such as the hobo transposon, Hermes, Minos (first to successfully transform a non-drosophilid, the medfly), piggyBac (second successful transformation agent in medflies), and the mariner element. Approaches to creating transient systems, employing viral and symbiont vectors, are also discussed.In article 7, pantropic retroviral vectors for gene transfer in insects are discussed. These arose from the genetic modification of the Moloney murine leukemia virus in order that it contain the G envelope protein from the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). These vectors are considered to be stable once inserted into the genome and are incapable of self-propagation. Most importantly, these vectors are now extensively used for human gene therapy protocols. The somatic infection of larvae using these vectors has been accomplished in D. melanogaster, Aedes triseriatus, Culex tarsalis (the western encephalitis mosquito), Anopholes gambiae (the malaria mosquito), and Manduca sexta (the tobacco hawkmoth).Article 8 overviews densonucleosis viruses as transducing systems for insects. These viruses are linear single-stranded DNA molecules between 4000 and 6000 nucleotides in length that it seems are restricted to arthropods. The primary application of these vectors has been to deliver genes into mosquitoes for the laboratory study of gene expression. It is hoped that they will be instrumental in control programs against mosquitoes. These viruses have a limited host range however, being restricted to the Aedes, Culex, and Culiseta mosquitoes. They are also considered to be limited in scope as gene-transfer vectors due to their small genome size and due to their (icosahedral) shape.In the ninth article, RNA virus expression systems based on the Sindbis virus for efficiently transducing mosquito cells and allowing stable gene expression in various species of mosquitos, such as the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti), the eastern treehole mosquito (Aedes triseriatus), the northern house mosquito (Culex pipiens), and Anopholes gambiae, are discsussed. The Sindbis virus is an alphavirus, with a single-stranded RNA genome. The article discusses the protein expression in the saliva of Culex pipiens, in the midgut of Aedes aegypti, and the expression of antiviral RNAs in Aedes aegypti and Aedes triseriatus.In article 11, the role of polydnaviruses in insect transgenic strategies is discussed. These viruses are multisegmented DNA viruses that are found exclusively in the female reproductive tracts of some wasps. Segmentation in the polydnavirus genomes is thought to have evolved in order to increase the copy number of essential viral genes. They are known to integrate stably into the chromosomal DNA of the cell line of a gypsy moth, and to infect and integrate in lepidopteran and coleopteran cell cultures. They are apparently difficult to engineer however, and but the author of the article believes that their impact may lie in pointing the way to other methods for performing transgenesis.Article 12 discusses the Hermes vector for transforming insects other than D. melanogaster. First discovered in M. domestica (the common housefly), cell lines of Anopheles gambiae were stably transformed by Hermes, and Hermes has been transposed in the embryos of Aedes aegypti. It is described in the article as having a wide host range, with accurate transposition occurring in twelve species of insects.In article 13, the genetic engineering of insects with mariner transposons is discussed, The mariner element was first isolated from Drosophila mauritiana, and the mariner family of transposons is known to be widespread in animal genomes. This has caused some to be concerned about the risks involved for active mariners released in insect control programs could invade other genomes, such as human genomes. The article describes the evidence of recent and ancient horizontal gene transfers between animal hosts as being \\"overwhelming.\\" The authors of the article though believe that one should not be concerned about releasing transgenic insects created with mariners into the environment. They give several reasons for not being concerned, one being that when nonautonomous mariners are used using a transient transposase, the resultant transformants are stable. In addition, the timescales involved are too long for horizontal gene transfer to be a significant risk, with over 100, 000 years being quoted as the most recent event for its occurrence. Only two mariner elements have invaded the human genome in the last 100 million years.In the fourteenth article, the tagalong (TFP3) and piggyBac elements, both transposable elements of the TTAA-specific family, are reviewed in regards to their utility in the transformation of insects. The piggyBac element was first isolated from a nucleopolyhedrosis virus which infects cell cultures of the cabbage looper moth (Trichoplusia ni). The authors discusses several successful piggyBac transformations, such as in D. melanogaster, Aedes aegypti, Anopholes Gambiae, Bombyx mori (the domestic silk moth), Pectinophora gossypiella (the pink bollworm), and Tribolium castaneum (the red flour beetle). The horizontal transmission of piggyBac among species is considered to be a viable possibility for the authors, and they therefore devote a section to the safety concerns involved with the release of transgenic insects."},{"Title":"How to Stop Being Teased and Bullied Without Really Trying","review":"Book is OK but some information could be harmful to apply - especially to younger children.

After reading the first 2 chapters, I had to buy the book so I didn't start marking up the library's copy! Not only was my child's behavior very accurately described, but there are concrete ideas of what parents and teachers can do to help reach these children. Tips are highlighted for both groups. Dr. Rimm is also careful to point out that changes are not going to be easy and some of the not so obvious pitfalls one can expect. I have begun making the changes Dr. Rimm suggested including meeting with my child's teachers. The book was outstanding in helping me formulate an outline to present to my child's teachers about what could be done. It went so well that the principal (who was also invited) is now reading my book! I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who is frustrated with their child's (or student's) performance in school and are looking for ways they can help as parents or teachers."},{"Title":"Why Bright Kids Get Poor Grades: And What You Can Do About It","review":"&quot;I simply want to thank you for sharing your life's work in the area of underachievement. I stumbled upon Why Bright Kids Get Poor Grades as I was desperately trying to discover other dimensions and clues to our 11-year-old son's academic struggles. Although he was diagnosed with ADD almost three years ago and has been afforded additional adaptive learning styles and tutoring, underachievement was never mentioned. Had I not embarked on this little research project independently, I would never have discovered this important area of study. Some of your descriptions and quotations in the book gave me chills, since we had heard some of the same things from our son verbatim!! Thank you for giving me a trail to follow and the vital information needed to help him be a success. The greatest gift we can give him is self-confidence and self-reliance. Your work has helped clarify methods to use to allow him to believe in himself. Thank you again&quot; Columbus OH"},{"Title":"Why Bright Kids Get Poor Grades: And What You Can Do About It","review":"Dr. Rimm's book applies to all kinds of children -- above average, below average, and &quot;just plain normal&quot; kids -- and, while it's targeted towards parents and teachers of children who are currently underacheiving, it can actually be helpful to teachers and parents even if you don't see any major problems with your children.I was in the administration at a private school for bright and highly motivated students, and I can't tell you how many times I turned the page in this book, jerked to attention, and said, &quot;Exactly! It's the fourth grade boy whose mom...&quot; or &quot;That's the certified teacher whose M.A. in education and 18 years' classroom experience doesn't stop her from telling her own girls...&quot; or even &quot;That explains why I hated the 'fun' Gifted and Talented program in sixth grade!&quot;I found Dr. Rimm's approach straightforward and practical; no suggestion in the book is controversial or tending to the dramatic.The book is organized by personality type and age so you can customize the approach to your own situation. She has clear suggestions for enrolling staff assistance and dealing with divorced/blended family issues.Her writing is credibly reinforced by research and her own clinical practice.I was particularly impressed with her sections on &quot;Yes-No parenting&quot; and ADD/ADHD kids. If your child is a &quot;late-developing&quot; or &quot;borderline&quot; ADD student (or if you just want to keep him or her off Ritalin), then you need to read this book for the simplest, clearest explanataion of what you can do right now.However, my professional experience has taught me that a few parents (and teachers) are emotionally attached to their own, occasionally extreme &quot;philosophy&quot; about children, so let me add a few words for them:In my own office, I have seen well-educated, loving parents choose their &quot;philosophy&quot; over time-tested, research-supported, developmentally appropriate methods of dealing with children. Usually, these people are parenting out of their own emotional wounds. In my experience, their children are much more likely to develop severe emotional and attention problems.This is for these parents: The basic reality of life is that YOUR actions affect the outcome. If YOU want a DIFFERENT outcome, then YOU need to try DIFFERENT actions.If your children are underacheiving, defiant, needy, controlling, or attention-dependent, you MAY have to make a choice between keeping your philosophy and having confident, productive children.This may be a hard decision to make, especially if your philosophy is driven by still-raw wounds from your own childhood or recent traumas. And there are substantial consequences for your decision.If you're committed to your philosophy, or if you are parenting out of your emotional wounds, then you probably won't LIKE this book until you resolve your own emotional trauma.But when you're ready to try something that works, get this book -- it can help you develop a stable, happy, confident, effective child."},{"Title":"Why Bright Kids Get Poor Grades: And What You Can Do About It","review":"My daughter's first semester in high school was torture for her and for us (her parents) until I discovered this book.

She also walks you through what to do with dominant nonconforming children. She explains how they gain power (often through arguing) and gives some counter-intuitive advice on dealing with these kids.The sooner you get this book the better. There are some very simple strategies that help children succeed in school that are more effective the earlier you use them.

At the same time the authors seem to have studied the subject well. They begin by telling of the severe persecutions of Catholics in England in the reign of James I.There had been persecutions under Elizabeth I, but they were stepped up a year after James took the throne. This was partly to provide finances to the king's less wealthy friends. Putting them in charge of collecting from the Catholics gave them a nice income. They were supported by those Protestants who still harbored a grievance for the bloody reign of Mary I, even though she had been dead nearly a century. The surprising thing is not that the situation led to the Gunpowder Plot by a handful of Catholics, but that it didn't lead to outright revolt by a majority of them.The suffering of those condemned is not dealt with in the gruesome manner currently in fashion. You're told what is going down, and then left to use your imagination (or not) as to the details. Altogether, I think the book is worth a look, if only to remind us of the fact that there's a difference between disagreeing with someone's views and becoming obsessed with \\"saving\\" them from their errors. (BTW if you're wondering, no, I'm not Catholic, but I am a Christian, and I find nothing in our Lord's teachings about hating thy neighbor.)If I had teens I'd want them to read this to help them understand the history of the establishment clause in the Constitution, and to let them see where unchecked prejudice can lead."},{"Title":"Guy Fawkes, or, The gunpowder treason: A historical romance","review":"i am not reading this book because i read books that are liked by many others.... this only has 1 reveiw! i neaded a biography for ela in school but i guess that i am not doing this book for my biography in school."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have about 20 pages left and I don't want it to end so I'm procrastinating by writing this instead. This book is a series of essays about Dave's different jobs, his childhood, his family and -- the absolute best -- his stories about moving to France and trying to learn French. Maybe because I also took French and visited France with a very small grasp of the language did I find those chapters in particular quite hysterical. Also I live in NY and his stories about NY and the tourists (especially around Christmas) are quite true and very funny to me personally. This is my first Sedaris book and I fear I may run out and buy all of his books and try to read them all too quickly -- better to space them out over a few months and make them last. There are some short chapters so if you're not sure if you want to buy this read a few chapters in the bookstore and then come back and buy it on amazon for cheaper if you liked it. I read the first couple pages and decided I would like this book and I was correct. I had to leave the library today because I was the only one laughing and I looked just a teeny bit insane. Better to read in the privacy of your own home!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"In what might be the most unusual autobiography ever, David Sedaris has seamlessly melded his trademark brand of humor with the often bitter truth of reality, and in turn, presents the reader with something almost magical. Divided into two halves, the book traces his life before and after moving to France. The short, defined chapters make this book an excellent summer read, and the content is equally as engaging. His humor is able to transcend the boundaries of what we've come to know humor writing as in the 20th century, and create a new, unique style. Whereas observational humor is typically funny due to its normalcy, Sedaris makes his absurd and bizarre life a disturbingly funny reality. I highly recommend this book to anyone, and would also recommend the equally as good \\"Naked,\\" also by Sedaris."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"You don't get the same feeling when you read the lines to the Oscar Mayer song in the style of Billie Holliday.

It's been a LONG time since a book has accomplished this.No, Sedaris' family isn't really all that different from most families. A little more twisted perhaps, but not all that different. What makes this book so funny is Sedaris' way of portraying these family events. I think that like most things in life, the event is not as entertaining as the re-telling of it. I think my favorite thing in the book is his description of the French vocabulary he developed. It sounds like something I would do. Great words, but completely useless in everyday life.I will admit that I was reluctant to read this book. I don't usually go for autobiographical type work, but I kept seeing the book in magazines and newspapers and finally heard an interview with Sedaris on This American Life. That's what cinched it for me. I figured that if he was that funny and quirky on the air, the book would be as well. I wasn't disappointed."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is a comical genius! His books of essasys \`Me Talk Pretty One Day' is one of the funniest things I've ever read. And not only is it funny, but it is also very witty. His text is so good that you don't want to put it down, because you know that in the next page there will be more laughing coming for you. Moreover, his comments about life, family and being a foreigner are very pertinent and never silly.There \`characters' --real life people who are related to Sedaris-- are so good that you may believe they were made up, but on the other hand, we know that there are every kind of people around, so the people in the book they do exist. My favorites are his sister Amy, Bonnie(this woman deserves a whole book about her!!), his brother Paul, aka The Rooster (and believe me You Can't Kill the Rooster!). I believe that all these people should be flatered on being in Sedaris's book, because he writes about them with such a passion, that even when he is making fun of them it is impossible to be angry with him.It is hard to choose one favorite essay because they are all so good, but there are a couple of them that can be pointed out as even better. My favorites are \`Picka Pocketoni' (you have to read to find out what it is!), Go Carolina, The Learning Curve, The City of Light in the Dark and Jesus Shaves. But above all, the essay title Me Talk Pretty One Day is close to perfection. Anyone who has taken a single class of a foreigner language will easily identify him/herself to the story. Everything is there: the student who can understand everything but the most important word in the sentence and is afraid of having to talk, the native teacher to whom everything is obvious, the student who knows \`everything' and is only taking classes to polish his/her language --but, as a matter of fact he/she wants to snob the other ones who know less than him/her-- etc.My suggestion is: after a hard day, find a confortable armchair, open this book, and have non-stop laughs. And if you read this book and don't laugh, please, go to the doctor, you must have serious problems. Enjoy it! And Congratulations, Sedaris. I'm looking forward to reading more of his writings."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris's first books, BARREL FEVER and NAKED, brought him from cult status to national celebrity status because of his singularly hilarious vision of the world. But much of his humor in those books depended on his scruffy, outsider economic status (he made his money before he became famous cleaniong other people's houses in Manhattan) and his extremely bizarre and loveable large family from North Carolina. It was easy to love Sedaris's self-deprecating hero because he was such an underdog; you couldn't help wanting him to win.But since he's become a success his subject matter has changed while his tone has not. It's very hard to feel sorry and luagh at Sedaris's circumstances when his problems include assimilating properly into French culture (his boyfriend owns a farmhouse in Normandy) or choosing among overfancy dishes at expensive Manhattan restaurants. The best bits in this collection--the first story about his lisp correction therapy, his account of his father's peculiar eating habots, and his classic &quot;Big Boy&quot;--retain Sedaris' sense of himself as underdog, and thus are hilarious; the rest of the collection is quite disappointing for those who loved Sedaris's first two books."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My only regret is having read it so fast.

David Sedaris is at times very funny (the scene where he and his classmates attempt to explain Easter in French to a Muslim from Morocco is absolutely hilarious), but at other times it's like he's straining too hard, or maybe he just ran out of good material. In one case he LITERALLY resorts to toilet humor (his desperate efforts to flush someone else's giant turd down the drain) for a cheap laugh. Overall, if you want some really funny moments, interspersed by long stretches of -- at best -- mild amusement, then buy this book. If not, don't, and instead wait until David Sedaris &quot;write better book one day!&quot;"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I love David Sedaris but perhaps in small doses.

It was wonderful to get to read it again and have a lot of it still be new to me. It's really good in more ways than one. First, Sedaris is just a great writer. He really knows what he's doing and I really think this is one of his best. Second, it's just plain so funny to read. I was trying to skim some passages during breaks for an orchestra rehearsal and I was getting a little too much attention for laughing out loud during quiet moments.

This is a winner."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris has once again created a laugh out loud journey through his own unique life. I was really lookingforward to this bk, and once again he delivered! What's next for Sedaris? I'd love for him to take on a subject other than his own autobiog. Maybe he should write about a nonfiction subject outside his own life, where humor and fact mix together into a strange and funny and unique concoction, like typical comedy essays on various subjects as seen in books like George Carlin's BRAINDROPPINGS, Jon Stewart's NAKED PICTURES OF DEAD PEOPLE or even the one-subject history via humor of Jessica Pallingston's LIPSTICK.

Except that I must finally admit that he is consistent in his outlook. It's not always &quot;bust a gut&quot; funny. And that's fine with me. It's like getting to know and accept the best and worst things about a dear friend. Over time I've come to crave his honest and distorted outlook on life. You will laugh out loud. Not always. Not at everything, but his stories will sneak up and ambush you. What more could you want from a book? Buy it now. Especially if you are a francophile."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I had heard several of David Sedaris' hilarious NPR reports which prompted me to buy this book. David's writing is very funny, but I got tired of him pretty fast when reading this book. His self-absorbed personality can really get grating after awhile. He's like the funny guest that turns obnoxious after a couple hours and you wish would just go home...."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is a refreshing collection of poignant and hilarious stories. Sedaris' self-deprecating humor is as complex as it is universal. His stories revolve around the things we all love to make fun of most: family, friends and ourselves. He writes primarily about these subjects against the back-drops of North Carolina, France and New York City. Although the transition between locations is abrupt, the collection of stories is held together by Sedaris' quirky humor and wonderful story-telling.The reader is lead through intimate stories of Sedaris' bizarre and often painful life by his equally bizarre and candid mind. It is as if you have stolen his diary and are huddled in your closet reading it, trying desperately not to laugh. We all have funny family stories; Sedaris reminds us of them with accounts of his family. But I have to think he is being modest when he claimed in an interview that his family is not as strange as you would think. It is hard for any story about any brother to compete with You Can't Kill the Rooster in which he writes about his brother, an obscenity spewing, wanna be rapper from Raleigh. However vulgar his brother Paul is, Sedaris endearingly captures the relationship between his father and brother. Paul is described as \\"...both my father's best ally and worst nightmare. Here was a child who, by the time he had reached the second grade, spoke much like the toothless fisherman casting their nets into Albemarle Sound\\" (Sedaris 61).In Shiner Like a Diamond Sedaris writes about his sister Amy who makes her attractive features grotesque:She is by far the most attractive member of the family, yet she spends most of her time and money disguising herself beneath prosthetic humps and appliqued skin diseases. She's got more neck braces and false teeth than she knows what to do with and her drawers and closets overflow with human hair. (Sedaris 137)In the same story Amy wears a \\"fatty\\" suit home for Christmas to frighten her father who is obsessed with his daughter's appearance and has her face painted with bruises and scars for a magazine shoot. In the Sedaris style Amy is not just weird and entertaining but also very lovable.These family stories make up most of the first half of the collection. Due to his eccentricity, Sedaris' father is a favorite subject. In Giant Dreams, Midget Abilities he tries desperately to have his children form a jazz quartet. This of course results is a series of disappointments when each child eventually quits their assigned instrument. This story also includes a bit about Sedaris' dream to sing jingles in the voice of Billie Holiday which can be fully appreciated only when listening to the author read the story himself (this is an excellent book to listen to on tape). Sedaris' respect for his father comes out in Genetic Engineering, through a story about his work at IBM and his children's absolute disinterest in his job. In Twelve Moments in the Life of the Artist Sedaris' father's naive humor is a welcome addition to an otherwise long-winded story. Through all the stories, his family threads its way through bittersweet memories and ridiculous situations with Sedaris' own blend of tender sarcasm.The second half of the book is made up of stories primarily about Sedaris' experiences in France. There is virtually no transition between the stories about his childhood in North Carolina and these later stories about learning French and living in Paris with his boyfriend. However, the quality of the stories makes up for this abrupt leap of time and place. After reading other stories in this book and stories in Barrel Fever and hearing pieces on National Public Radio, it is clear that Sedaris is an excellent observer of culture. He is in fine form in Me Talk Pretty One Day.In several stories he writes about the challenge of learning French. Sedaris' observations of both French culture and language are outrageously funny and touching. In the stories Me Talk Pretty One Day and Jesus Shaves he describes his French class taught by a teacher whose \\"temperament was not based on a series of good and bad days, but, rather good and bad moments\\" (Sedaris 170). In See You Again Yesterday he writes an overview of his first six trips to France with his boyfriend Hugh. Reading it makes me marvel at the unending patience Hugh must have. As the stories develop so does Sedaris' grasp of the language; by Smart Guy Sedaris is taking an IQ test in French.In many of these stories Sedaris uses his experience in France to reflect on American culture. I Pledge Allegiance to the Bag is a dissociated view of America that most Americans fail to see. But at the same time, as in all these stories, Sedaris forces us to laugh at ourselves. In Picka Pocketoni Sedaris listens as an American couple assumes he is French (and therefore can't understand a word of English) and berates him for smelling bad and being a pick pocket. Sedaris creates a snapshot of these quintessential American tourists. I can see them with their fanny packs and cameras and Sedaris quietly hunched in the corner, waiting to write it all down.Though some of the stories are too long, namely Twelve Moments in the Life of the Artist and The Late Show, Sedaris repeatedly redeems himself. He is weird and can laugh at himself. He is sweet and sarcastic in the same breath. He is a talented story-teller. Sedaris says the things we think but tells them better than we would ever hope. Above all, he is hilarious."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"If you like Dave Barry or Carl Hiaasen's geographical outlandish humor--you'll enjoy Me Talk Pretty One Day. Pity the poor Sedaris family. The things their famous relative writes about them -- in addition to what he says as a regular contributor to National Public Radio -- must have the clan in a state of permanent cringe. That is, if the situations in the latest collection of blisteringly funny pieces (28 in all) by the 43-year-old rapscallion David Sedaris were not so hillariously exaggerated.A sun-worshipping sister is lampooned for being &quot;tanorexic,&quot; and he lists his mom's hobbies as smoking, napping and reading the works of kitsch-maestro Sidney Sheldon. Then there is Sedaris p&eacute;re, a former IBM engineer, who, says the son, hoards food so obsessively that his closet still contains expired six-packs of Sego, the chalky chocolate diet drink of the 1960s.And what are we to make of the claim that in the author's childhood North Carolina household there was an unending turnover of pets, all afflicted with a failure to thrive? As he puts it, &quot;Another day, another collar.&quot;Humor shining through a brilliantly twisted satirist."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris describes vignettes from his life in this wry-humored self-deprecating autobiography.He and I do not share the same sense of humor, so though I did find some of his stories throughout the middle of the text quite funny (particularly the way he described learning French and moving to France), I found the beginning and end of the book tedious reading. Perhaps I didn't read it in the right frame of mind. If I had approached it as a collection of short stories instead of a continuing narrative, I might have enjoyed it better, and I am willing to take the blame for that oversight, though I didn't see any reference to this book as a collection of short stories in any reviews.In the beginning, Sedaris describes himself as a vapid and shallow child, and a pretentious and annoying art student. As a reader, I simply didn't care about him.If you can stick with this novel until chapter nine, when Sedaris moves to NYC, his humor kicks into gear and the book becomes very amusing through chapter twenty-three.After that, subsequent chapters about uncomfortable self-revelations and insomniac fantasies are at times both repulsive and tedious, and divorced from any of the previous text. But then Sedaris finishes with one of the funniest chapters of the whole lot which leaves the reader laughing, but does nothing to draw the whole book together in conclusion.Many people have loved this book, but I did not find it very appealing or satisfying.C.A.Wulff - author of Born Without a Tail"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"and then when i read to her what i was laughing at, she laughed right along with me.these essays are pure genius. sedaris really knows how to put his thoughts together and not once did i say \\"what the hell is he talking about??\\"although a few of the bits might be sad to some, thankfully i have the dark sarcastic humor that sedaris requires of his readers.he is one of my idols.the essays are different yet tie in together perfectly."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I could not put this book down....This is the only book I have ever read where I found myself actually calling friends and family members to read them portions of the book. This book was laugh out loud HILLARIOUS! I am telling everyone I know to read this book so I can continue to laugh about it and so they can enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"'Wildly entertaining' is the Christian Science Monitor reviewl. I thought the first half was very entertaining though the humor began to get old after reading the same style over and over again. The second section tailed off quite a bit and got rather morose and uninteresting."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"OH MY GOD...that has to unquestionably be the most amusing book ever to be written by an actual member of our own species! How can such a man exist?! Sedaris is filled with a sense of humor and wit that cannot possibly be exaggerated. He has lived life in the most twistedly fantastic of senses and brings out the best of himself and everyone who reads this book. He understands something from each and every one of us and does not care what opinions he induces from people; he'll do his damn well best to write about those things people know about but don't sometimes say while baring his life and soul to us. This is a spectacularily unexpurgated edition of the book of not just his life, but ours, and it's wonderful.He makes his experiences on Speed one of the most splendid events I could ever imagine going through: \\"\`I'm thinking of parceling off portions of my brain,\` I once told her. \`I'm not talking about having anything surgically removed, I'd just like to divide it into lots and lease it out so that people can say \`I've got a house in Raleigh, a cottage in Myrtle Beach, and a little hideaway inside a visionary's head.\` Her bored expression suggested the questionable value of my mental real estate.\\"Sedaris is not only a master at self-deprecating humor but he manages to strip his family of their protection and cover of normalcy as well whilst successfully expressing their mutual bonds as a clearly deep and affectionate family who warms your heart: \\"My mother was, for the most part, delighted with my brother and regarded him with the bemused curiosity of a brood hen discovering she has hatched a completely different species. 'I think it was very nice of Paul to give me this vase,' she once said, arranging a bouquet of wildflowers into the skull-shaped bong my brother had left on the dining-room table. 'It's non-traditional, but that's Rooster's way. He's a free spirit, and we're lucky to have him.'\\" It's this funny, ALL THE WAY, people. Articulate, brutally honest, and blatantly hilarious, you'll find no better. The review done by Amazon.com really helps in describing what this book will give you as well. You really can't go wrong. Reap the benefits and GET IT!!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'm not going to repeat in detail what is said in the many other excellent reviews here about the hilarity contained in &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day,&quot; except to say I agree 100% with these effusive takes on David Sedaris' latest effort. One highlight: I almost drove off the road listening to the accounts of Sedaris' French class with his sadistic teacher telling him - in English &quot;I hate you. I hate every day with you. Each day with you is like giving birth by cesarean section.&quot;Now I don't know what that read like in the book, but I'm here to make a pitch for the audio casette version. Sedaris' voice, understated delivery, and hilarious imitations make the extra investment you'll need to purchase the tapes worth every cent. I'm sure 'Giants Dreams, Midget Abilities' is a hilarous read, but hearing him imitate his instructor, Mr. Mancini, will put your enjoyment of the tale on a whole different level. And there's Sedaris' Billy Holiday imation in the same tale...frankly, I had to compose myself to finish this review because I'm chuckling so hard remembering all this great stuff.Buy the tapes."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read this book right after reading Bill Bryson's I'm a Stranger Here Myself. It seems to me that there is a recent theme in new books that centers around humor at the expense of a person who is experiencing culture shock. Since this seems to be the recent theme, I suppose there's no harm in writing yet another book review with a theme of culture shock.Davis Sedaris' Me Talk Pretty One Day combines two of the world's greatest cities- New York and Paris- with humor, all in one book that is incredibly hard to put down. The book is comprised of a series of humorous personal experience pieces, the first half of which take place in Sedaris' native New York City and the second half of which take place in Paris, where he moves to temporarily with his boyfriend Hugh.The first essay in Me Talk Pretty One Day sets the fast and funny pace continued throughout the rest of the book. It also sets the theme of &quot;culture shock&quot; in one's own county, because Sedaris comments on many experiences in his youth that made him feel alienated from other people in his own environment. In it, Sedaris discusses the speech impediment (aka &quot;lisp&quot;) that he had as a child and still has to this day. The efforts of his speech teacher to correct the lisp were never successful, but Sedaris' descriptions of them are hilarious. He writes about the kids who were in his speech therapy class, saying, &quot;None of the speech therapy students were girls. They were all boys like me who kept movie star scrapbooks and made their own curtains... 'One of these days I'm going to have to hang a sign on that door,' [my speech teacher] used to say. She was probably thinking along the lines of SPEECH THERAPY LAB, though a more appropriate marker would have read FUTURE HOMOSEXUALS OF AMERICA&quot;.Even when Sedaris writes about such mundane things as restaurant menus and crossword puzzles, or such serious things as Euthanasia, he is so funny and absurd that you begin to wonder if he takes anything about life in New York City seriously. However, just as you are wondering this, he sweeps you off to Paris to read his wacky comments on life there. Sedaris never did learn French fluently, nor did he do all the touristy things such as seeing the Louvre and the Eiffel Tour. Instead, he watched American movies in English in French theatres because &quot;I've never considered myself an across-the-board apologist for the French, but there's a lot to be said for an entire population that never, under any circumstances, talks during the picture... I can't remember the last time I've enjoyed silence in an American theatre&quot;.If you have ever been to a foreign country, whether as an American who is embarrassed by the other American tourists that surround you, or as a member of a different nationality who makes fun of the American tourists, you will laugh along in complete understanding with Sedaris' comments on the two types of French that Americans speak: &quot;the Hard Kind and the Easy kind. The Hard Kind involves the conjugation of wily verbs and the science of placing them alongside various other words in order to form such sentences as 'I go him say good afternoon'... The second, less complicated form of French amounts to screaming English at the top of your lungs, much the same way you'd shout at a deaf person or the dog you thought you could train to stay off the sofa&quot;.Me Talk Pretty One Day is guaranteed to give you an insider's look at culture shock in one's own country and abroad. It will also give you an insider's look at life in New York City and Paris. But best of all, it will give you this dose of culture shock (and if you've read I'm a Stranger Here Myself, make that your second recent dose), with a strong dose of humor. And that makes everything just a little bit better."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Whenever reading Sedaris' work I always half way expect him to sneak up on me and yank the book away as if I had been reading the most personal pages of his diary. In time, however, you realize that the author not only doesn't mind sharing these sometimes painful, mostly hilarious stories. Instead, he seems to relish in sharing his unique perspective on the world. Like &quot;Naked&quot;, &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is consistently fresh and always entertaining."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is the definition of the word &quot;unique&quot;. His writing style is similar to no one else's. I won't attempt to describe it here but simply know that you will LAUGH OUT LOUD when reading this book. From his childhood in North Carolina to his adulthood in wild and crazy New York City to his current life experiement in Paris, Sedaris takes us along with him for a wonderful ride! This one is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I am a huge Sedaris fan. This is one of his best. I just couldn't help giggling and laughing out loud like a fool. People looked at me like I was nuts on the train as I read it. I didn't care, because it is so poignant and funny, so real! Even better, when I can hear his voice in my head, check out his audio books. He's perfect reading his own work."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I think a lot of people that wrote the bad reviews just din't get the humor, or were put off by him for personal reasons. He makes fun of his own way of thinking. He acknowledges how screwed up he is/was. That is what is so funny. He writes the things we have all thought at some point in our lives. He has one heck of a vivid imagination that leaves your eyebrows raised. I loved all his books, but this one is the best."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is the only author that makes me laugh until I have tears streaming down my face. Out of all his books, I enjoyed this one the most. After \\"Me Talk Pretty...\\", I had to read everything he has written, I am obsessive like that."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"If you need to get away from the insanity happening in today's world...this book is for you. It will provide a haven of humor. Found this to be so enjoyable that I caught myself laughing out loud several times. The book is composed of short vignettes that recount Mr. Sedaris's life from child to adulthood. Everyone has childhood experiences that we would like to forget, as well as relatives that make us wonder if we're really adopted. Mr. Sedaris capitalizes on the quirkiness of both realms with his unique observations and dry wit.I also read two of his other books &quot;Holidays on Ice&quot; a great book to read this time of the year with the holiday just around the corner. It was another laugh-fest; and &quot;Naked&quot; which out of three, has some good stories but isn't as good as &quot;Holidays on Ice&quot; and &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;.I hope that Mr. Sedaris keeps the books coming...am looking forward to his next one!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me talk pretty one day is one of those books everyone should have on their shelf. Sedaris tells the stories of a family of individuals who find ways to love each other despite their glaring differences. This is one of those rare books that makes you laugh each time you lose yourself among the pages. With each story told you find yourself reliving similar moments of your past and laughing. Me talk pretty is a book that you can open any time you feel down, read a few pages or plow through the whole book again, transforming the negative emotions into a happiness that seeps from your pours and coats your skin. This is a book you fall in love with from the first page and when you get to the end you find yourself turning back the pages and enjoying some of the stories again and again.The struggles of life that rub you like sandpaper, become less painful when you are wrapped in the tals of David Sadaris. If you are looking for free flowing humor Me Talk Pretty One Day is a book you should not only have your collection but keep close."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"When my friend lent me this book, I really needed some light reading. Returning from a week long trip of taking care of a terminally ill family member, getting bronchitis, and the trade center bombing, I needed some humor on my plane ride back home. Being sick, extremely tired, and nervous, I found myself laughing out loud on the plane, to the point where I thought the people around me might think I was going nuts...I finally had to confess the book was so funny.David Sedaris has a great way of picking out the small things in our lives and making them very funny. They are endearing, I very much enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Page 141-200The collections of short stories in Me Talk Pretty One Day are still similar to the stories that I summarized prior to this. Each story is about something noteworthy that has taken place. The chapter begins on page 142, where David Sedaris writes about his dislike for computers, and all modern technology. The following story tells about how he met his partner and about his new home France. After getting together with his partner Hugh, Sedaris moves to France with Hugh, who lives there most of year. Mostly everything Sedaris does revolves around France, and Hugh throughout the rest of the story. Some of these things include Sedaris trying to learn French, and Sedaris's relationship with his friends and family. The next story is titled Jesus Shaves. This deals with Sedaris's opinions on religion. He questions why things such as why a rabbit was chosen to be the symbol of Easter. The following two chapters deal with his troubles of learning to speak French. One struggle was his inability of learning the correct verb endings. When he would purchase groceries he would always buy more than necessary in order to hide his embarrassment of not being able to understand the plurals of French words. The pages of 138-200 deal with his struggles.This collection of short stories lack a transition from his childhood in North Carolina and these later stories about learning French and living in Paris with his boyfriend. Luckily, the quality, and humor in each story are so great that the lack of a transition does not matter! The story titled Jesus Shaves is a great example of the quality of humor Sedaris writes because his opinions are so diverse and different from most others. Who would have questioned why a rabbit represents Easter, especially with humor? Sedaris questions anything he can, and does it well. He writes everything with humor, which is rare for a writer to do well. This made me appreciate his stories even more! I thought it was great when he wrote about his experience of learning French. He was determined and dedicated. Teachers that hated him, and would rather have a cesarean section than be with him did not stop his quest for mastering the language. I admire him for putting up with those sorts of things. I try to relate myself to him in that way because I believe it will make me try harder at things that are not effortless. The most astonishing thing is that this book can be so great, even though he has not done anything important to write an autobiography about himself.1. Page 177, \\"He nice, the Jesus. He makes the good things, and on the Easter we be sad because somebody makes him dead today.\\" This quote symbolizes the title, Me Talk Pretty One Day. My interpretation of the title is that he believes he will not be heard until he can talk well. The quote uses bad grammar, and cannot show what the person is trying to say in the best possible way. The quote should really say something like, Jesus is superior because he makes everything good and on Easter we mourn his death. This would inform people much better because it uses better grammar."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I feel so bad for the author because there is not one thing in his life that is worth living for. He hates everything and everyone, and he makes that crystal clear with every word he set to paper. His descriptions are bad...some border on cruel and evil. His &quot;humor&quot; is directed towards 5 year olds or the brain-damaged. I don't know how this book ever got published."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Reading is my passion. This was like the worst lover ever. I didn't laugh out loud or to myself once. Not once. This book was so gratuitous and predictible, it made my want to scream. I would never have finished this book after the first ten pages, but I've committed to myself that I will finish every book that I ever start. Why was this so funny to so many people? I'm scared."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I've been so excited to get this book for a fun summer read, but I am disappointed that I don't have it in my hands yet! Very frustrated! It's been WEEKS since my order was placed."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was so funny I laughed so hard I cried.Forget about it reading it around other people at home, inrestaurants, on a plane....they'll think you're crazy as you break out in laughter. Thank you David for a very funny book!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the first review that I've ever written. However, I am so distrubed about the content of this book, I am compelled to respond. There is nothing humorous about this book. I find it rather distrubing and disgusting. Sick might be a better discription. It is a biographical story, fictious or other, of a very disfunctional individual. If you desire to go into the bowels of the . . . . go ahead. I ain't gonna go there ever again."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is clearly not my type of humor. I thought it was sad and pathetic. Hated it!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Someone at the book store suggested this book to me as a Christmas present for my teenage boys. I gave it to them, but just after the holidays I picked it up to read it first. By page ten it is very clear to me that this book is not appropriate reading for my teen boys. Flipping further into the book only confirmed my opinion. It is going into the trash."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Read the reviews. Bought a copy. What a stupid book. Terribly disappointing. I don't agree that Sedaris's humor is &quot;dark.&quot; It's nonexistent. Clever? Witty? Nah! Who in their right mind would want to read an essay about someone's disgusting trip to the bathroom? Well, I do know one fellow.."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Let me tell you the story of the actual physical copy of this book I borrowed from my stepmom, as it is actually quite a metaphor for how I feel about the content inside. I was bored one day so I asked my stepmom if she had any good books I could read (this, perhaps, was my first mistake). \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" was one of the several books she offered. From the reviews on the cover, Me Talk Pretty One Day seemed \\"wildly entertaining\\" and funny. I brought the book to work to read on my downtime, but wound up (before I had a chance to start it) lending it to a coworker who needed it more than I did. (My coworker had even more downtime.) She got about fifty pages in, thought it was alright, but opted at that point to play Slingo on her phone. She put Me Talk Pretty One Day in her purse where, later on, a bottle of water mysteriously opened up and poured onto the book, soaking it through. Other more important and expensive items were in her purse and got ruined but she felt particularly bad about this book because it was not hers. She thought it was mine. She said she was sorry; told me she would replace it, but I told her not to worry, the book was actually not even mine but rather my stepmom's and I didn't really care.I'm sure this only made her feel worse.I told her we would see how the book dried, then determine whether or not a new copy was needed. It dried in time with the aid of a space heater and, as it turned out, only the pages were slightly wrinkled and warped. The text was okay so I figured the book was okay and my coworker needn't worry about replacing it. It was at this point that I resumed possession and began to read it. I too thought the book was alright- moderately entertaining and humorous- but ultimately pointless. By the time I got to disliking it, my reason being the book is what I titled this review, I felt I had invested too much time to just stop and not complete the book. So I kept reading, hoped the next story/essay would be better than the last (they weren't), until the end.When I finished, I brought the book outside, placed it into a used aluminum cooking tray, and lit it on fire. The pages were too badly water-damaged to return to my stepmom anyway."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I had heard Sedaris on public radio &amp; seeing this in a bookstore in Napa, I bought it. I read it on public transortation &amp; that was a mistake. I laughted out loud and I missed &amp; nearly missed several stops. It's a very engaging book of autobiographical stories. Sedaris lived for a while in France and the title story is a self-deprecating look at his efforts to learn French. I highly recommend this. It's delightful."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I consider myself a VERY tough cookie to crack when it comes to making me laugh via literature...but I must say, Sedaris had a walk in the park with me. I just didn't know what hit me! The prose was exquisite, the timing was precise, and the rythm was nothing short of perfect. Sedaris has brought to the concept of short story/essay writing what ketchup/mustard/chopped-onions did for the hot-dog.Sedaris has set the standard for the new generation of narrative in the English language."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"humorous, disrespectful, politically incorrect, joyously cynical, and insightful into the psychopathologies of everyday existence.In other words, my kind of book! Highly recommended for a raucous good time."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"According to almost all of the other reviews, here and elsewhere, this entire book is screaming/rolling on the floor/laughing out loud funny. I did NOT find this to be so, and it's not like I'm one of those people who never laughs out loud; I laugh all the time. So, expecting to be disturbing friends and strangers by laughing in public places for no apparent reason, I was a little bit disappointed when ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY turned out to be much more subtle and profound than uproariously funny.I'm still not over that disappointment, but I found myself through the book in two short afternoon sittings, thoroughly enjoying the ride and a little [angry] when it ended so abruptly. Sedaris writes about anything and everything with consistent humor -- something few writers can really pull off -- that had me more or less constantly smiling. (And then occasionally a real laugh -- the kind that ends with gasping and tears in your eyes -- would escape me, most memorably during the three page \\"Big Boy.\\") He's a little bit cynical and a little bit insecure and at the same time totally unapologetic, and the mix works very well. Disappointments aside, I'd buy another of his books any day.(Side note to those who are looking for constant, crazy laughter of the kind descibed above: read anything -- ANYTHING -- by Bill Bryson.)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I really didn't think I would enjoy reading this book. I'm a married, 30-year-old mother from the midwest, so I didn't think I could really relate to the life of a middle-aged gay man living in France. However, I thought it was really good for the most part. Not all the essays were funny, but most were, and I laughed my butt off at \\"Jesus Shaves,\\" particularly about the Easter bell. I found his honesty about his own shortcomings particularly refreshing."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is a often hilarious book of collections of essays written by the author. It is beautifully written and captivating. The book is somewhat of a tragic comedy, beginning with his inability to pronounce the letter \`s' due to a lisp. Going from that, the audience peers into his off center life. Strong descriptions and a real looks on life pulls the reader into the book until the last page."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Painfully funny. This was my first Sedaris exposure, and not my last. The stories, the way he turns very sad moments in his life into wry, sarcastic learning experiences. The way he takes very funny moments in his life and seeks out the melancholy lessons... and his reading style makes this all the better."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"It is interesting to note that some readers do not find Sedaris' work interesting. Of course, we all have bad days, months, years, and we'll pick up a book that does not engage our minds with it's humorous intent. Not so for me with Sedaris' \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\". Essays on his family, to his days in New York until his current residency in Paris are such rip roaring fun - that he tore me away from the deep freeze of the winter blues into a rapturous high from which I have yet to come down. He makes you laugh and cry ... Nay - naysayers everywhere. This man has a mind that, as a writer wanna-be, made me envious of how he can take his life and describe it with words that create humor and texture so wonderful I felt like I've just had a fabulous meal at Nobu (NY Sushi restaurant). Damn Sedaris! I missed sitcoms, dinner, local meetings at the gym because each page kept me prisoner to his tales. I couldn't put this down. When I hit the last page - I was hungry for more. Needless to say - I now own all of Sedaris' work. Not everyone will love this as much as I. But, I can tell you, he does have a following - and I have joyously entered his clan. Get this book!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is a quick and easy read that is best taken in small bites. Sedaris' style lends itself to quick reading, but that doesn't mean you should necessarily read the entire book in one sitting. The best short bites the book has to offer are the first essay about Sedaris' speech impediment and the essays in the back which deal with his adjustment to France and his attempt to learn French. Feel free to skip the essays about his brief life as an artist and as a teacher. They are both unsettling in that they make one pity the author, and they are not as entertaining as they could be."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is a collection of essays regarding the life of David Sedaris. Some are hilarious, others are more mundane, and some just leave you wondering why they're included in the book. All of them, however, contain a slightly slanted viewpoint about everyday occurences in the life of the author. I enjoyed most of the essays, but some include some rather crude language.This book was great for my busy schedule. I could pick it up and read an essay or two, put it down for a few days, and then pick it up again without losing any continuity. Great reading for relaxation and enjoyment."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was a great book, but I've been looking for something that stacks up to Burrough's Dry. I loved this collection of essays that took on a biography like feel. He left me hanging on to my seat wanting more, but kept me interested all-the-while. I would recommend this book, but the library may be the best place to get this one because you will be done with it in a couple of hours. Having been my first Sedaris book, I look forward to a couple more."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"only a quarter the way through it but so far its a hit and right on."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was great from start to finish--I don't usually find myself \\"laughing out loud\\" when I'm reading, but this book had me pretty close. David Sedaris continues to write with the same brutal honesty and dry wit that made \\"Naked\\" such a good read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys satire and doesn't get easily offended."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I really enjoy listening to David Sedaris and consequently I really enjoy this book-on-CD, however, I find that the collection of stories -- while varied -- are not as uniformly funny as found in DRESS YOUR FAMILY IN CORDUROY AND DENIM, which I find much more uniformly funny. That said, there's quite a few gems on ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY! A must for any Sedaris fan."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Loved this! Absolutely hilarious. My favorite story is the one about taking French classes in France and the Easter Bell. Not for the faint of heart - very irreverent!(We have seen him live too, if you like his books, you should definitely go see him live!)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I found that the book, Me Talk Pretty One Day, By David Sedaris was an amusing autobiography. It captured my attention and forced me to want to continue reading. I thought that Sedaris descriptively explained the details of his life. Sedaris made his personal life story hilarious, dramatic, and quite dirty.The book was comical and kept me laughing a majority of the time. Sedaris has a very random sense of humor and that compelled me to read more. I also found some of his life tragedies were really stirring, keeping me on my toes as I read along. At a lot of times, Sedaris would speak in an exceeding indecent way. It was still very humorous, but if you don't prefer books that have a crude sense of humor, I would advise that this is not the book for you. This book most certainly had aspects that make it a really appealing book to read.I definitely enjoyed this book and it was extremely interesting to read. This book is a great book for people who are seeking a droll book about a man's struggles in life. Me Talk Pretty One Day is a great book and I loved reading it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The stories of his life are so bizarre and dysfunctional without being appologetic or critical of anyone. He uses excellent word choice to paint a hilarious and vivid picture of his family and childhood."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book had me laughing out loud more than anything I've read in a long time. What I liked best about the collection, however, is that each essay carries its own weight. There is a purpose to each story and I never questioned how long it took me to get from start to finish. I was too busy laughing. Sedaris taps into his entire being, putting his heart and soul into his work. No one is safe--especially his colorful family and outrageous friends. Some might find his work offensive, but he makes no excuses. You get what you get with this collection . . . originality, great writing, irreverence, wit."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read this book at the prompt of my English instructor after he read one of my own essays, he told me to read David Sedaris' books to get some tips and ideas.The first book I picked up was this one after searching through the library for him.I read the first story to my mother, who even though she is rather homophobic found it hilarious.The book was so funny that it made me literally laugh out loud (which can draw strange looks if you are in a restaurant).It is one of my most favorite books. Ever!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is not your run-of-the-mill memoir or collection of short stories. Not by a long shot. David Sedaris' biting wit will have you laughing out loud by page one. Whether it's the struggles of a boy with a lisp in speech therapy class, the absurdity of a college instructor assigning soap operas for homework or the irreverent descriptions of an uncooperative bowel movement, Sedaris' caustic prose leaves you with painfully-aching sides. Don't read this book in public if you're afraid to be seen--and heard--cracking up. And don't be surprised if between laughs you find yourself learning about life and appreciating the author's insights.Salmon Run"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is funny and awesome; An easy read. My personal favorite was the story about one Penny Midland."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"People have been telling me for years it seems like that I should give this a read. Finally I did and I had no idea what I was missing all these years. What a wonderful writer!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"While \\"Me Talk...\\" is no \\"Naked\\", it still hits a solid home run in the humor department. You won't find yourself rolling on the ground with laughter like you did with \\"Naked\\", but you'll certainly turn many heads with your belly laughs while reading this book in public. If you're looking for another funny read by Mr. Sedaris, pick up this book and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is a true gem. Started reading again thanks to him. The CD's of his work are truly fantastic."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Another great book from Mr. Sedaris. All I can do to communicate his appeal is to quote him directly. From the essay \\"Smart Guy,\\" in which he takes an IQ test:\\"It turns out that I'm really stupid, practically an idiot. There are cats that weigh more than my IQ score. Were my number translated into dollars, it would buy you about three buckets of fried chicken....When I became upset over my test score, Hugh explained that everybody thinks differently--I just happen to do it less than the average adult.'Think donkey,' he said. 'Then take it down a few notches....Don't let it get to you. There are plenty of things you're good at.'When asked for some examples, he listed vacuuming and naming stuffed animals.\\""},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Haven't finished the book yet, but sedaris shows a great sense of humor in his writing. Got the book in about a week."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Honesty. Pure, unrivaled honesty. Even Augusten Burroughs' tales of family crazies cannot touch the honesty of David Sedaris's written word, and Me Talk Pretty One Day is no exception. He is brutally honest when describing his father's obsession with saving and eating food long past its expiration date. He is painfully honest when he discloses his drug abuse while feigning artistic inclinations. I think it is this honesty that makes me love Sedaris. I am truly jealous of the candor with which he can tell any story, no matter how embarrassing or slandering it might be. It amazes me that his honesty can literally make me sob but a few pages later can make me laugh until I cry.The dramatic, emotional swings are paralleled in the bi-continental setting of the short stories in Me Talk Pretty One Day. Sedaris explores the entire spectrum of his life from the time he is his South Carolina grade school taking speech lessons to lessen his lisp to his forays into learning French while living in France, the short story providing the title line. The book is full of binaries: self-conscious pre-teen to self-accepting fifty-something, despising his family to accepting the quirks of his parents and five siblings, and drug addicted to stone sober.These binaries are not special to Me Talk Pretty One Day, however. Naked, When You Are Engulfed in Flames, and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Blue Jeans all exemplify Sedaris's honest look at the changes one takes in life. He is able to poignantly address crazy neighbors and Christmas whores but also look at the funny side of death and addiction. Perhaps the thing that makes Me Talk special is that Sedaris deftly balances the bittersweet with absurd in a way that, at the end of the book, makes you feel like you've just walked away from one really great therapy session where you realized that a) you can deal with your problems and b) at least you don't have it as bad as this Sedaris guy.And it is so funny. I laughed until I snorted. This is not to say that Sedaris's other books are not funny because they are very much so, but Me Talk just has something special about it that makes it unique. Again, Sedaris's honest look at himself is what makes it so personal and like a close best friend. He is able to find the humor in the fact that he is not as smart as his partner and his partner makes him feel better about this fact by stating that he is good at things like \\"vacuuming and naming stuffed animals.\\" My favorite part of the book occurs in the short story with the same title as the book, in which Sedaris takes us through his evolution from speaking one French word at a time (\\"ashtray\\" and \\"bottleneck\\") to speaking French phrases: \\"'Is them the thoughts of cows?' I'd ask the butcher, pointing to the calves displayed in the front window. \`I want me some lamb chop with handles on \`em.'\\" I can open to the page this quote appears on and laugh out loud like I had never read it before.This book is so worth the money and time. If you've not read Sedaris before, this is a great place to start. If you are a longtime fan of Sedaris, you will appreciate his ability to make you think deeply about hilarious instances and to make you laugh at things you probably shouldn't laugh at."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I purchased this book after seeing David Sedaris speak. This book is hilarious!!! I find my self reading it out loud to any one that is around. Reading the book you feel like you are in a conversation with your best friend. Read this is you want to laugh at someone else's life. The book always leave me in good sprits when I finish a chapter :)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is my first encounter with David Sedaris. He has a marvelous dry sense of humor and is an enjoyable read. Although we are using this as a text and it is required reading, there is little or no effort to read his essays. EXCELLENT book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was my first David Sedaris book, and after reading it, I cannot wait to get my hands on all his others. The short stories that fill this book are hilarious. David Sedaris has a quarky sense of humor that I find refreshing. I found myself laughing out load again and again. I could really identify with some of the thoughts he expresses in the text and that is rare, and a little scary.I could have flown through this book, but my preference was to savor it for all it's worth. I highly recommend this book, and I will be sure to review his others, as I read them."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was surprised that this book wasn't as funny as I'd hoped/thought/expected it to be. I often find myself laughing hysterically to Sedaris' NPR stints, so I found it odd that I found the book more &quot;odd&quot; than funny. I do have to give credit to one chapter in particular though...&quot;Jesus Shaves.&quot; This is one of the funniest chapters I've EVER read. I'm sure the folks around me on the subway thought I was possessed as I was shaking, trying to control the tears and laughter. If only the rest of the book was as sharp...."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Gets quite a chuckle out of me - occasionally I come across a paragraph in his book that I don't expect, and just tears me up laughing!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The first half of the book is good reading if you appreciate the absurdities of life. If you struggled to fit in (or struggled keep from it), you will appreciate his scenarios.The second half is brilliantly funny. His experiences with the French language had me in tears and gasping for breath.Even as a straight, married, parent of two young children, I can identify with (and laugh at) what the author goes through."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Enlightened people know that David Sedaris is quite possibly the funniest person on the planet. I bought this book at a book signing (and enlightened people also know that even better than reading Sedaris' work is hearing Sedaris read Sedaris' work -- so you might want to look for the audio). He read several excerpts and I was laughing so hard during &quot;Jesus Shaves&quot; I thought I'd have a heart attack and they'd have to cart me out of there. In dark times, books like this keep you alive."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Okay, so I am on a fairly-long airplane ride, reading the 2nd half of this book. I was laughing out-loud, to the point that when we landed, two women in the next two rows turned around and said, &quot;I'm sorry, but I just HAVE to know what you were reading....&quot; The funny thing was, I didn't even realize I was laughing.This book, and others by David Sedaris, are wonderful and hilarious and SO readable, all at once. I strongly recommend anything that Sedaris has written, particularly this one, to anyone who needs to have one of those &quot;few and far between&quot; side-splitting laughs."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A word of caution: Do not, as I did, give this book as a gift to someone who has just had major abdominal surgery--They may have to be re-stitched.I'm a Sedaris radio fan, and his essays are always insightful, clever and hysterically funny. The French lessons were hilarious, and glimpses into his family were also a scream. Sedaris can take the most mundane incident and spin it into a highly entertaining tale.He also has a very humble, humane side that is really likable and sweet. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who needs cheering up."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I saw this book at a glance and picked it up cause i like the cover. I thought it was one of those inspirational kinda thing but the first few pages were totally different. Definitely funny, especially the part where in they were trying to cure his speech and the idiocracies of his dad. Recomended it to my friends and they found it amusing too. A little judgmental at times."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This collection of humorous essays is a bit more uneven than David Sedaris's previous ones (Naked, Barrel Fever), and that's why it merits just 3 stars. Sedaris is at his best here when he recalls his experiences as an American living in Paris. Skip right to part &quot;deux,&quot; if you want, and let the hilarity begin."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was one of the best collections of short stories I have ever read. Sedaris writes with a wit that I have rarely seen and brings incredible self-depricating humor to this book. His attempts to learn French are hysterical as are the reported quirks of his family members. In their quirks, and his as well, one is really reminded of the insanity that even seemily normal people take part in. I laughed outloud constantly and found this a very touching and funny book. For those of you who want a comparison to his earlier book Naked, I find it was consistently better. Naked had just a few duds in it, but Me Talk Pretty was consistent story by story. Simply excellent!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I frequently had to put this book down to clear the tears in my eyes from laughter! Beside those moments, I put aside all else to read this book. David Sedaris's whimsical look at his own quirky life draws you into his world. I've gained a few good one liners from this book that I try to work into conversation as frequently as possible, like &quot;I know cats who way more than his IQ&quot; or &quot;her rear is so large you could land a chopper on it&quot;. Nothing vulgar or offensive; just a joyous look at life through David Sedaris's eyes. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I first heard David Sedaris on public radio and found his essays to be extremely funny and insightful. This book continues that tradition very well.Sedaris is an autobiographer, a social satirist and a wit. In some ways, however, he reminds me of the Jerry character on Seinfeld: He is funny on his own, but is funniest when he is the straight man for the genuinely eccentric people in his life. His family--from his beautiful sister who makes herself ugly to his foul-mouthed redneck brother to his sly, understated mother and his father, a screamingly funny IBM engineer with the strangest eating habits -- are the real stars here. Even his partner, who gets relatively little play in this book, is great fun.Each essay has something to recommend it. While I thought the essays from France were more insightful and less humorous than the essays about his growing up, they all worked. And several were so funny I was unable to read them to my wife because I was laughing too hard to get the words out.Read this book for the humor and you will happily reflect later on some keen social commentary.(Note to earlier reviewer: Sedaris is much funnier than Bryson, and for much longer stretches.)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"At first I was wary of a book containing the chapter heading \\"Jesus Shaves,\\" but I loved it-- especially that story, in which Sedaris takes a French as a Second Language class in Paris, and the students use their fractured French to try to explain Easter to a fellow student. I did snarf while reading that chapter. On a plane. It was gross.His best writing comes when he is describing life with those he loves-- his parents, his sister, his boyfriend. It is that hint of, uh, domesticity which allows most of us a connection to his life, enough at least to laugh at what would be funny if we were there, too.We just couldn't tell the story as well."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Although I will say right away that Sedaris's humor is probably not for everyone, if you like his brand of sarcasm, this is the book for you. &quot;Jesus Shaves&quot; had me and my husband snorting with laughter as we tried to tell each other our favorite lines from the chapter. And Sedaris's stint as an inept writing instructor will be appreciated by anyone who has sat through a writing workshop and wondered about the person teaching it. Wonderful, hilarious, intelligent. Can't wait to read his other stuff."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Although I found moments in Sedaris' book laugh-out-loud funny and appreciated some of his more trenchant observations, I felt the book lost its momentum halfway through. From that point on, it seemed contrived, overextended and (in terms of humor) sophomoric.In the end, this didn't turn out to be a book I would recommend."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My opinion is biased but also legitimate, because Sedaris is my favorite writer. I am an American who has lived in France, and so I have identified utterly and completely with his hilarious descriptions of learning French, putting it to use, and realizing the different planet that is France. But no matter what he is describing, Sedaris is hilarious. His word choice and the rhythm of his sentances propel the reader head first into laughing out loud. I cannot read Sedaris in public, because I collapse with giggles. Of all of his books, this is by far my favorite. Not only because of the French aspect, but because Sedaris has grown as an author with each book, and this one, being the latest, is the best. (The exception to this would be Barrel Fever, which I did not like...) So if you want your day to be brightened by undiluted hilarity, read this book. Or, even better, get the books on tape, where Sedaris' admittedly nasal voice adds another funny element."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I feel jilted coming into this book, finding out he has written other books. I missed so much. I laughed out loud, and annoyed everyone around me by doing so! I have read other books that are said to be funny, this one left my sides spitting and my cheeks sore. Open minded and slightly twisted? This is a roar!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is a terrific book of essays and observations by an NPR regular. He is quite revealing about his upbringing, and his lifestyle, but the real fun is his sketches of life in North Carolina, New York City and Paris.His stories on learning French were unique and spot-on to me. He also skewers &quot;Americans abroad&quot;, and French culture. If you like to smile and laugh while reading, this is your book. (I won't be forgeting his brother &quot;The Rooster&quot;, or his &quot;fat&quot; sister, Amy, anytime soon.)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I enjoyed this book very much and (after hearing excerps) my 15 year old son was chomping at the bit to have it. It is a very funny book. And I am not one of those people who think everything is funny. I am quite picky. The author lets you know that he is gay in the most natural way and that was nice, too. I loved the endearing way that he wrote about his quirky family. (By the way, my 15 year old loved it, too.)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"If you've never read David Sedaris, or heard his radio pieces (often featured on National Public Radio) then start now. A friend of mine recommended him to me and he is one of the funniest authors I have ever read. He views the world from a perspective that not only have most people never heard, they've never even conceived of it. To some, he might seem crude or offensive, but he is also sharp, witty and unique. He writes about topics that one would never expect to find an essay on, but he always hits the nail on the head. I recommend him to everyone, no matter what you like to read, because there has to be an essay in here that speaks to you."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I wouldn't have believed that David Sedaris could get any funnier, but he has. With \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day,\\" Sedaris strolls down something of an autobiographical lane. The title story refers to his efforts to learn French in a language class in France (he has inconveniently neglected to learn French before having moved to France with his lover). From his beginnings as a performance artist (one of his friends specialized in a performance piece that involved the artist being shot in the shoulder with a rifle), Sedaris moves on to moving (see the scathing summations of all the folks he's ever had the bad luck to move, including the woman who had not bothered to pack up a single item before the movers arrived) and other things. Sometimes he takes a side trip, as when he goes home to visit his father and his sister Amy happens to be there as well. Amy, who hasn't been home in some time, decides to wear a fat suit the entire weekend. The effect of the fat suit on Mr. Sedaris is mind-bogglingly funny--he spends the entire weekend trying subtly to get her to eat less, to go out for a quick run--anything to get her to lose weight. But the best thing by far has to be the classroom full of sundry nationalities, all trying in their crippled French to explain to a Moroccan student what Easter is:\\"It would seem that despite having grown up in a Muslim country, she would have heard it mentioned once or twice, but no. 'I mean it,' she said. 'I have no idea what you people are talking about.' The teacher called upon the rest of us to explain. The Poles led the charge to the best of their ability. 'It is,' said one, 'a party for the little boy of God who call his self Jesus and . . . oh, s--t.' She faltered and her fellow countryman came to her aid. 'He call his self Jesus and then he be die one day on two . . . morsels of . . . lumber.' The rest of the class jumped in, offering bits of information that would have given the pope an aneurysm. 'He die one day and then he go above of my head to live with your father.' 'He weared of himself the long hair and after he die, the first day he come back here for to say hello to the peoples.' 'He nice, the Jesus.' 'He makes the good things, and on the Easter we be sad because somebody makes him dead today.' Part of the problem had to do with vocabulary. Simple nouns such as 'cross' and 'resurrection' were beyond our grasp, let alone such complicated reflexive phrases as 'to give of yourself your only begotten son.' \\" Humor writing doesn't get any better than this."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The sooner I stopped thinking I had a idea of where the author was going, the better. It's so enjoyable being hit with all the unexpected laughs."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I love the way he writes! I couldn't put the book down. So glad my professor recommended that I read his work."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"First, I must state that I rarely have the time for reading. However, after reading this book, I made the time to read more David Sedaris books. This book is hilarious."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I loved reading more about his childhood and his sister! I like his perspective and twisted humor too! It kept me laughing!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I love this book, so funny! It's good to read a book like this before bedtime. And it's a good book to pass time too! Looking forward to more of David Sedaris's book!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris knows how to spin his yarns into a tapestry of pragmatic realism embellished with colorful threads of exaggeration and humor. His word images evoke spontaneous laughter - from tiny titters to gargantuan guffaws. My only objection was the chapter involving his drug use. However, in his defense, that chapter was almost necessary to understand allusions in other of his stories. Yes, I confess, I have become a Sedaris junkie."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"If you have enjoyed anything written by David Sedaris then this book most certainly will not disappoint! It's the first book I read by him, and it's still my favorite. I've read it three times now. If you're offended by crude humor, cursing, or gay people, it's not for you."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was my first exposure to his writing. It took me a few chapters to warmup to his humor and not feel guilty for laughing at some of his painful experiences. I went back and re-read those first few chapters after I completed the book and it was much funnier to me the second time."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I enjoy David Sedaris' writing, and he hasn't done me wrong yet. But the first book of his that I read, \\"Naked\\", I found to be funnier. This is having its moments where I crack up, but overall, it's just a good thing to read while on public transport. It puts me in a good mood, I like his descriptions of different incidents in his life. It makes me wish I were a friend of his."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Dayby David Sedaris is a collection of his personal essays and my first experience with this genre or type of work. I found them, in general, to be thoroughly enjoyable. The author's style conjures a comfortable and friendly tone that is flavored with a sly wit which is sure to put a slim grin on the reader's face. Passages about his childhood and family are entirely relatable, often hilarious, and Sedaris' discourse on the state of the Cineplex and movie watching in America makes me long for the more intimate experiences of the movie houses that he describes. Not the most cohesive of collections, as his topics are wide-ranging, but the essay \\"Youth In Asia\\" still makes me laugh every time I think about it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A colleague loaned me &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day,&quot; thinking I would enjoy the description of his encounter with a speech therapist, being that I *am* a speech therapist. She was right; I laughed my way through his observations of his abduction and his efforts to be cured by never using words containing the offending sound. I have had any number of students who would bond immediately with Mr. Sedaris!The rest of his personal narratives kept me at least, if not more, entertained than this first one, however. His self-deprecating voice casts the reader in his corner, even when he is describing the vices of his misspent youth in performance art, his efforts to find value in Paris by going to American movies, or his total boredom with his father's enthusiasm for music.Underneath the humor, though, I sensed a searching for meaning or connection when at times he could find neither. Most readers have had experiences in which they felt completely out of place, or feeling that their lives were at a standstill, and his humorous yet sensitive musings on such themes add a depth to these very funny stories that move them beyond simple comedy."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The one and only real measure of success for a book like Me Talk Pretty One Day is whether or not it makes me laugh. And this book made me laugh.The tales are autobiographical and many are so outlandish that you wonder how much artistic license Sedaris takes in his tales of family life. But the result is consistently on-target, in a strange random kind of way. I found myself zipping through the lines of text eagerly awaiting the next irreverent insight that would crack me up.Among my favorite characters: the abusive French teacher (who comments \\"every day spent with you is like having a caesarian section\\") and Sedaris' foul mouthed rap music loving brother who calls himself \\"the Rooster\\" (many funny Rooster quotes, but none suitable to post in a this review.)There are few books that I've read that have truly made me laugh out loud, and this one ranks among the top. There is a bit of filler, but overall I was amazed that Sedaris was able to keep it up for the book's 270 page length. A very funny book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"After the somewhat somber tone of his last book, &quot;Naked&quot; I'm glad to say David Sedaris is back with a hilarious vengeance. To pinpoint one story over another would be unfair since they all have their individual charm and merit, but to hear him talk about his sister Amy, (of Comedy Central's &quot;Strangers With Candy),I almost needed a Depends undergarment! Another treat is to hear the books on tape since he reads most of his own material, and his voice is...unique."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS GUY. WHAT A TWISTED, HYSTERICAL TAKE HE HAS ON EVERYDAY OCCURENCES. I HAVE ENJOYED ALL HIS BOOK AND Me Talk Pretty One Day LIVED UP TO MY GREAT EXPECTATIONS.

THE EXAMPLES GIVEN FOR A PEOPLE MAGAZINE CROSSWORD PUZZLE...HIS PATRIOTIC PRIDE IN EXPLAINING JODY FOSTER'S &quot;PACKAGE&quot;......IN THE WORDS OF MRS. SEINFELD: HOW COULD ANYONE NOT LIKE HIM? WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"&quot;Laugh out loud funny&quot; seems to be a recurring description of this book, and for good reason. I tried to stretch out the book by only reading a few chapters every night in bed, but the laughs I tried to stifle turned into snorts and kept waking my partner. I then tried reading parts to him, but had trouble getting the words out without cracking up. I finished the book a few days ago and he is trying to read it now, but I keep stealing it from him to re-read my favorite parts (which include most of the book). I will never look at some of David Sedaris' topics (speech therapy, learning French, American tourists) again without thinking about his astute and/or warped comments. Buy it and enjoy."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I became a Sedaris fan after reading the first two pages of HOLIDAY'S ON ICE in the bookstore two years ago. If someone can make me laugh outloud in a public place, he truly has a talent. Sedaris' wit is only surpassed by the way he records it in words. When I purchased ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY on tape for a road trip to Kentucky, I wasn't sure what to expect, but after 2 minutes into the first story I knew I was in for &quot;one hell of a ride&quot;. To hear him read these stories is like reading the book all over again. His timing is impeccable and his impersonation of Billie Holiday singing TV jingles is worth the price of the collection alone. Give your eyes a break and let your ears do the reading for a while."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I hope David Sedaris lives, and writes, for a long, long time. Unfortunately for him, this may require that he give up smoking."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Will make you say \\"this guy is weird\\", but not before a few good laughs. Read when you require some smiles and frowns."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Excellent. Truly a &#34;laugh out loud while you're reading&#34; type of book. One of David Sedaris' best, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris can be heard on NPR pretty often. It's not necessary to hear him in order to enjoy his books. But if you do hear him, you can read his stuff with the sound of his delivery echoing inside your head and laugh even more. A little 'rude' for sensitive folks, but certainly he is one of the best resources of humor in the last century--at least."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Great opening chapter to what is an awesome story all the way to the end. This is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. The odd characters made it all the more funny. Being the first Sedaris book I have read, I am up and ready for more of his stories. He is a witty and humorous writer and reminds me of the funny book The Usurper and Other Stories.The story flows smoothly, backed by a rich choice of words, deep knowledge and excellent descriptions. I am glad I read this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was histarical! I loved his stories. It was easy to follow, since each section was its own story, so you wouldn't have to have listened to one story for the other to make sense, yet it all flowed nicely. It was one of those books that I was actually really sad when it ended and almost wanted to read it again."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"To reiterate the other reviews, this not a novel but a collection of fictional stories. With that said, this is a very easy and enjoyable read. You can pick this book up whenever and wherever and enjoy a few good laughs and interesting perspectives. There were definitely some standout chapters and the remaining chapters were 'pretty' good in the book. One down point was Mr. Sedaris focused a little too much on the whole French/American relationship and living in France experience. Not a five star book but nonetheless worth reading."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"It's as simple as this: if you are going to purchase one David Sedaris book (I would highly recommend more than one), this is the one to get. I laughed more at Me Talk Pretty One Day than any other book I've read. Ever. My wife highly recommended it to me and I'm glad she did. I read a fair amount, but rarely humor; in print, it just doesn't translate well for me usually. However, MTPOD had me laughing constantly, as hard as any live stand-up comedian, comedy (movie or play, audio recording, joke at the office, etc. might induce. This is a book to read regardless what you usually read. It's top shelf regardless of your preferences. Just buy it. You're wasting time.- Charles"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One DayBy David SedarisThis book is about a gay boy and his experiences through life. It follows the hilarious memories and horrible times in his life. I chose to read this book because my sister recommended it. She said she really enjoyed it and that it was funny and well written. David Sedaris' memoir, Me Talk Pretty One Day, is an outrageously funny account of his life from childhood, through adolescence, and up to adulthood.In his elementary school days, David Sedaris had a speech impediment and had to take speech therapy. He hated his speech therapy lessons and decided to avoid saying \`S's for the rest of the year. He bought himself a pocket dictionary. At the end of the year the speech therapy teacher tried to trick him into saying an \`S'. With many failures the speech therapy teacher decided to tell him a very sad story of her life. After the story, David Sedaris said, \\"Hey, look. I'm thorry.\\" \\"Ha, Ha\\", she said, \\"I got you.\\" [pg. 15]. This was a memorable time in David Sedaris' life because he became more self conscious of himself because of the speech therapy and the teacher drawing attention to it.Also, in his elementary years, his father enjoyed jazz so much and was convinced all of his kids were very talented in music and that he wanted to start a family jazz band. He enrolled David and two of his sisters into music courses with David playing the guitar. David tried to play the guitar but ended up with much failure. Finally, he had enough. He came home one day and heard his sister, Lisa, playing her flute from the living room \\"it sounded not unlike the wind whipping through an empty Pepsi can.\\" [pg 24] He also heard his other sister, Gretchen, down in the basement. She was either practicing the piano or \\"the cat was chasing a moth across the keys.\\" [pg. 24] Finally, the not so talented \\"Sedaris trio had officially disbanded\\". From this experience David learned that his talent was not in music and that in order to find his true talent he would have to search through many things such as art and play writing.Another interesting episode in David Sedaris' life is when he tried to learn French. He took classes with a very strict teacher and other people from all around the world. In this chapter, everything said in French is translated literally into English. For example, \\"I know the thing that you speak exact now. Talk me more, you, plus, please, plus.\\" [pg. 173]. During this chapter he and the other students start to feel self conscious of whatever they say in French because of this teacher's strict rules so they learn to barely talk at all. The reason the book is called, Me Talk Pretty One Day, is because it is a literal translation from French. This part of the story is very important to him because in these classes he learns what people think of the United States, and he realizes how he is labeled by other nations.The book also describes David Sedaris' drug experience, his time living in New York, his homosexuality, and his relationship with his family. David Sedaris does not learn a whole lot from his odd experiences. It is basically just what he has been through. But in the last chapter he explains what he has truly learned from his entire life: that he's no good and will never be anything big."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"As a fan of the author, I'm going to write a glowing review of his work regaurdless of content. I followed his example, writing stories about my family and turned them into somewhat tall tales. But David Sedaris absolutely, poisitively rocks.While here we take another look at his ever evolving path in life as he teaches French classes and eventually moves to France with his boyfriend Hugh, the stories about his personal experiences and his family are the true gems. We can all relate to his stories as a child, in his case being picked on and forced to undergo the humiliation of speech therapy in school. That was a good point, if they singled out the future homosexuals through this process then what did they do for the future drunks or wife beaters? And what's so hilarious is that when I look back on the kids I went to grade school with I see signs of that behavior in the adults they became. But who knew then?I roared with laugher about his family pets and how Lou and Sharon loved their Great Dane, Molina, more than their own children. Now that my sister and I are out of the house, my parents did the same thing (only they have cats). 12 Moments In The Life of an Artist was wonderful as it preys on every pretentious artist I've ever encountered. \\"It's all about my art! You just don't understand! I'm too creative to lead a 9 to 5 type life!\\" Yeah, they're too creative to lead a mundane life and they're always broke, but they have plenty of money to buy drugs and are creative enough to make messes rather than a living all in the name of art. His father made one story by shouting \\"Hey there, sport!\\" during one of his preformance art presentations, and the whole audience thought it was brilliant and revolutionary. HA!And how can we ignore the baby of the family, his brother Paul, a.k.a. The Rooster? You could write a book about that nutcase! His hillbilly, obnoxious, crass brother getting into fist fights and floor sanding for a living whose speech is a complex hybrid of rap music, New Yorkese and a South Carolina drawl. You couldn't make that up!A hilarious, yet serious look at life. A must have for any writer for wonderful inspiration and a zest for life."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I really enjoyed this audio experience. David Sedaris' memoirs of family, America, and life in France frequently brought giggles to my matutinal commute. Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris's books are absolutely an enormous amount of fun. I can't believe that there are readers out there who haven't enjoyed his works yet. I think he's a comedic genius, with a sardonic, self-deprecating sense of humor that will put tears in your eyes. Sedaris's books even are better listened to than read, as you'll get the full effect of the author's intent."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris makes me laugh out loud with stories you have to share with anyone who will listen. I've read all of his books (except Hercules) and this one and Naked are hilarious!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My freshman year of college I had a roommate who raved about David Sedaris. Considering how I loathed her and everything she enjoyed, I avoided her advice for a couple of years. What a mistake. \\"Me Talk...\\" is the first Sedaris book I've picked up but it certainly won't be the last.This book is a collection of humorous, autobiographical short stories or ancedotes that chronicle Sedaris' life from an effeminate lisping boy, to college drop out, to a hack college professor lecturing on soap operas at the Art Institute of Chicago, and finally the guy who moves to France to live with his boyfriend and simply cannot learn French. Yet, in my opinion the book isn't even really about Sedaris, but instead his hilarious observations about friends, family, Americans in general and seemingly mundance aspects of life.I know it's trite and it's been said before, but this book did literally have me laughing out loud. Not all the time, but more often than not. Some of my personal favorites include \\"Jesus Shaves,\\" \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster,\\" and \\"Pick a Pocketoni.\\""},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is extremely funny. It is easy to read in short intervals because it is composed of stories that can stand on their own. The treatment of his experiences while learning French allows the reader to see that although cultures can seem different we all share a great deal in the realm of human nature. Sedaris really sees the irony in life. He presents even sad and twisted subjects in a humorous manner. I am reading all his books this summer."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The first book I stumbled upon by David Sedaris was \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\". I found it laying on a table of Barnes & Noble, so I picked up and started reading the first page (I was interested because of the title). And instantly after the first paragraph, I was hooked and I knew this writer is one the funniest and wittiest writer today. I was literally rolling on the table every couple of minutes and it was getting embrassing reading the book front of other unknown people.David Sedaris's \\"Naked\\" and \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is his autobiography but he writes them in an unusual method: he writes them as essays and there not accounts of his life in a linear path, rather one piece from his childhood, then his life in Paris, France, or his addiction problems, etc. He could be writing about one of the saddest moment of his life and still put some smart-ass comment that makes one cringe with laughter. Highly recommeded to anyone who wants to really experience 'laugh-out-loud' from a book and also have a sense-of-humor."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I've read everything David Sedaris has put into book form, and this, by far, is his best work. This book finds Sedaris in his prime. He wasn't the uber-star author he is now while writing this, so it feels humble and honest. He has really found his voice with this book. \\"Naked\\" was good, but \\"Me Talk...\\" is fantastic. I laughed out loud many, many times. \\"Dress Your Family...\\" was a bit of a letdown for me after this. \\"Dress\\" is still a great book, he just seems to be more aware of himself as an accomplished writer, and it gets in the way a bit. That doesn't happen with \\"Me Talk...\\" It doesn't feel over-written or self-conscious, it just seems to flow out of him. His readers are lucky to be witnesses to his hilarious and sometimes painful life.Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Not many books that I have read make me laugh really hard. I have to say that the second half of this book was so funny that I read it three times and laughed over and over again. It made me asthmatic. I am an American living in Belgium and have struggled day-to-day with the culture and the language issues. I tried to explain how funny the book was to my French teacher. But, of course, I was trying to do it in French. This, of course, made it even funnier to me even though my teacher did not find it funny at all. And what the hell with that bell from Italy anyway?"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is close to a masterpiece. David Sedaris convinced me that I don't have to be an important or exciting person to be a good writer. He finds material and humor in the most unlikely yet obvious places, places I never thought of looking. He creates vivid pictures of his family,most of all of his father. Sedaris describes his father's obsession with saving everything in a colorful and entertaining manner. \\"He hid pastries in the toolshed and the laundry room and then he wondered where all the ants were coming from...he hides these things...until they are rotten. Ant ehn he eats them.\\" What I found truly amuzing was the chapter entitled \\"Jesus Shaves\\" and how translating sayings or titles in other languages makes them awkward and confusing. When trying to explain the significance of Easter to a Moroccan student in French class all the student got was something about \\"A dead man with long hair supposedly living with her father, a leg of lamb served with palm fronds and chocolate.\\" I read this book in one day and it's definetely a page-turner. The pages are filled with emotion, ranging from the pain of losing a pet to the feeling of surrender and \\"all-mightiness\\" of being on speed. Sedaris does a great job of molding his life from little anecdotes. He not only exposes his life to the reader, he also adds in smart reflections on life and people's actions and behaviors."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I got this book after hearing Sedaris on 'This American Life.' I would laugh out loud at the radio. Sedaris delivers his sarcasm in such a way that reading it one might miss it. However, I still enjoyed the book, perhaps because I could hear his voice in my head.Sedaris shows how a simple story can be turned into a beautiful form as he explores the tiny moments many of us just ignore in search of excitement. He takes a reader from absurdly silly to poignantly melancholy.Dry sarcasm is his main staple. If you don't like your humor as dry as a three-day-old martini this isn't for you."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris has done it again with a delightful look into his childhood, in the first half, and a sidesplitting recount of his French adventures in the second half of this book.From learning of his early stuggles with his lisp (thus having difficulty with his own last name), to his description of \\"the rooster\\", his brother, a man's man whose speach is peppered with four letter words, Sedaris kept me laughing.Those who have ever studied French will find his musing particularly wonderful when he ponders the masculine and feminine assigned to all objects: \\"I wonder whose job it was to assign these sexes in the first place. Did he do his work right there in the sanitarium or did they rent him a little office where he could get away from all the noise?\\"I recommend this book one hundred percent. It is good for a laugh and also makes a great gift."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is, without a doubt, my favorite humorist alive. His writings are at once funny and poignant. To be able to touch and move readers in the way that Sedaris does is truly a gift, and one that should be treasured while he's still around treating society to more of his wonderful work.&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is at least as funny as &quot;Naked&quot;, and some of Sedaris's stories about living as an ignorant American in France were truly unforgettable. A highly recommended read to take on vacation. It's quick, absorbing and very rewarding."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read this on two plane rides to a conference and could not help but to laugh out loud. I'm sure the other passengers thought I was absolutely nuts. I didn't care.Sedaris' style is easy and funny to read, but harder to explain. If you haven't read some of the stories, it's extremely difficult to relay them in any decent manner. Though too many to point out here - two that spring to mind are the ones having to do w/his sister Amy (on the Chicago L and at a photo shoot) and the explanation of Easter during a French class.It's a quicker read that will make you smile (and laugh out loud) the entire way through."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"With so many people glorifying the chapter in this book about Sedaris' brother, nicknamed The Rooster, I had to add my own opinion. I hated that chapter. I found his protrayal of his brother annoying, offensive, and totally unlikeable. By saying this, I am not saying I didn't enjoy the book. I did. Sedaris is a very funny writer, though I more enjoy hearing him read his essays on the radio. But please, no more praise for the profanity spewing Rooster, who comes across as nothing more than a ignorant jerk."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I am a Hard core Sedaris Fan. I have the books, the books read by author on tape and if the man is in New England, we travel to see him.Like many others, NPR and Ira Glass were my first conduit into the world of Sedaris. My personal treat about this book is that I was able to see the Author doing a Public Radio support tour, where he was reading many stories from this still to be published at the time book. He tried out some different versions of these edited stories and made no bones about the fact that he was trying these out on us to gauge their effect.His writing style is at times a bit uneven, but much more personal in this book than in the previous books. I did not find every story &quot;Laugh out loud&quot; funny, but I don't think that Sedaris has ever framed himself as a comedian.He's just a guy who fights Obsessive Compulsive disorder who grew up in an odd American Family - likes bizarre knick knacks and happens to be a gay man, with a tremedous talent for crafting words and phrases.Plus, once you hear his voice, you will never again read anything of his without hearing that reedy, oddly pitched voice humming away."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I adored this book! Had fallen in love with his now deceased mother from his first book &quot;Naked&quot;. At one point I had to put the book down to wipe my eyes and control my laughter.Picked it up and started laughing all over again. With all the hilarity there is a poignant under tone that makes one sometimes feel his puzzled alienation."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Ever notice that most of the books we elect to read are tied to that notion that we need to constantly be aware that we are bettering ourselves? You know, keep up with the new novelists, pace yourself with philosophy, social comment, heavy thesaurus-impacted stories, somehow neglecting that tiny inner voice that says &quot;Entertain me!&quot; Well, here is the antidote: another skyride with David Sedaris whose Mark Twain style surfaces shared foibles and makes them hilarious instead of embarassing moments. I didn't find myself laughing out loud the way all the promo for this little tome guarantees, but I sure stayed with it, big grin spreading across my face, even giving up an invitation for a night out at an escapist triller movie in favor of finishing this little piece of joy. David Sedaris is funny and tender and unafraid to talk about his thinking patterns, +/- autobiographical history, and his incidental sexuality like most folks ramble on about the weather.Puts things into perspective.........and boy do we need that!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My reactions to David Sedaris's new book ranged from a slight smile, to such hysterical laughter that I was asked to leave the ICU of a hospital where I was visiting a relative.The book is split into two parts. The first is made up of stories about his family, including his foul-mouthed but tender brother, and his father, who apparently will eat no food before its time.The second half concerns his life in France, especially his attempts to learn the language. A million writers have used this theme before, but I've never read anyone who does it so well. The short dialogue of cowed language students trying to comfort each other before their teacher attacks again is worth the price of the book.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I used to recommend Mr. Sedaris's books to my friends with a promise that they wouldl laugh out loud, but I also felt compelled to offer a disclaimer that some stories wore funnier than others. &quot;He's not consistent, but when he hits it, you will bust a gut.&quot; And that's still true for this latest collection of his essays. Except that I must finally admit that he is consistent in his outlook. It's not always &quot;bust a gut&quot; funny. And that's fine with me. It's like getting to know and accept the best and worst things about a dear friend. Over time I've come to crave his honest and distorted outlook on life. You will laugh out loud. Not always. Not at everything, but his stories will sneak up and ambush you. What more could you want from a book? Buy it now. Especially if you are a francophile."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Honestly, I blew my favorite Fume' Blanc through my nose! I've never laughed harder, nor related more to anything I've ever read. I called friends and family to read them entire chapters at the time in order to share and relive the hysteria!David Sedaris covers everything from the exotic quirks of our parents (though most of us may never repeat them,) to the bizarre fears, desperate attempts to conform and be excepted by the masses that none of us &quot;really&quot; identify with anyway, though we pretend.My most favorite thing about David Sedaris can only be appreciated if you've ever heard him talk. Reading this, I could hear the rhythm with which he speaks, with the enticing nasally pauses that kept me swinging impatiently from word to word, bracing for my next laugh!I could relate page to page and no one could have told it better!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"\\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is a series of short stories about David Sedaris. His childhood, his different jobs, his family and - my favorite- when he moved to France, and tried to learn French.I love the story of his childhood, how he due to his lisp becomes a kid with an outstanding vocabulary (to avoid words starting with \\"s\\"), the story of his artistic career, and also his brother - \\"The rooster\\". But his story about moving to France and trying to learn French is amongst the absolute best.I can perfectly well relate to his frustration trying to learn another language. I have done something quite similar, I went to Ecuador to study Spanish with only 7 words in my vocabulary (the numbers 1-4, thank you, please and Merry Christmas) so I found those chapters absolute hilarious. My favourite is when he is having trouble with singular/plural and to circumvent this he always buys more than one, no matter what it is. His boyfriend is getting upset about this and I love Sedaris' comment \\"Just wait until he sees the *CD-players* I have bought for his birthday\\"...I have not read many books that have made me laugh as much as this one has. To my surprise, Sedaris and his story kept me completely hooked for the 270 pages.This book makes you laugh - laugh out loud!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I normally don't make snap judgements or broad statements. Normally, I am a \\"live and let live\\" kind of person, able to understand and consider vast differences of opinion. That being said, in this case, anyone who didn't almost wet themselves laughing at this book is either dumb, or completely lacking a sense of humor. I've never laughed so hard at anything in my life. I lent a copy to someone at work, and never got it back. Usually, when that happens with a book or a CD, I let it go. Not this time. I went right out and bought another copy. This is a Desert Island book, as in \\"pick three things to have with you on a Desert Island, and only three things.\\"I can't understand anyone who doesn't think this book is genius. You might as well speak another language."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"After a 3 year wait since Naked, it's a bit of a letdown that this book is made largely of material that has been printed elsewhere. After being such a fan I suppose it's my own fault for having sought out his various articles in anticipation of a new book. But so much recycled material is disappointing, better for a paperback perhaps. There are some very good laughs and expected Sedaris worldview, but the tone is disjointed, rushed- it's magazine writing on deadline basically. Descriptions of life in Paris and 22 -city book tours (like a rock star) are also not likely to appeal to readers who enjoyed his hilarious depictions of life in the working classes. He seems to be above it all, moved on from crude America, and the work is far less engaging for it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Listening to David Sedaris read Me Talk Pretty One Day made my hour long commute seem like 20 mins.The book is brilliant !"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I would have given his book \\"Naked\\" four stars, because the stories were well written and funny. This collection, however, left a lot to be desired. Attempts to attain a level of profundity fell far short, and I think the author realized this because he threw in a fart joke (or something of the like) every time in a shameless attempt to distract the reader from the mediocrity. It is a tragedy that many good writers have to self publish their work and struggle to get it read by a handful of people while works like this win awards. I give it two stars because of the story of the American in France who listens to a group of people talk about him in French while he sits and understands every word. That scene was handled with grace...then came the fart joke."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sidaris' \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is the literary equivalent of Wonder Bread: fluffy, popular, palatable perhaps, but in the end unfulfilling. Without question, Sedaris has a curious family and background; his sense of humor (such as it is) is understandable both as to its origins and its indispensability. What is surprising is that this persona , sounding so much like the voice of a bright freshman who's found his way into a narrative lit class, is actually coming from a middle-aged boomer. A literary guise? Some irony-building device? Well, having seen the author on late night recently, I think not. This is the man, a timid milquetoast befuddled by much of the adult world. Paging Walter Mitty....This book is a mildly amusing diversion of a man whose stunted vision shrinks before large ideas, diverse cultures, and experiences beyond his own deafening self-absorption. I was expecting much more."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is a humorist who writes essays on the human condition - his specifically and in general. He strikes me as a curmudgeon-in-training, who, after further aging, will qualify for the closing act on a very popular and long running TV newsmagazine broadcast on Sunday evenings.ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY is a series of 28 essays spanning the author's childhood to the present. The book's title is also that of one of the chapters, in which he relates the experience of learning French in Paris under the tutelage of a xenophobic Frenchwoman whose style relies heavily on the liberal application of humiliation and abuse. Most of the essays succeeded at making me laugh - certainly not in guffaws, but at least amused snorts. A few didn't. The subjects of some of the more successful included: being mistaken for a local pickpocket on the Paris M&eacute;tro by two American tourists, describing American idiosyncrasies as perceived by foreigners, doing New York Times crossword puzzles, describing the concept of Easter to a Muslim, and showing two friends from North Carolina around New York City. For me, the funniest selection was \\"Big Boy\\", which, unfortunately, was pure bathroom humor that can't be described here. (Hey, I never claimed to have elevated tastes!)David's brand of raillery won't appeal to everyone. While always perceptive, it often is, like Mark Twain's, tongue-in-cheek. The following three examples will serve to illustrate. They concern, respectively: American nouveau cuisine, speaking \\"French\\" in France, and politically correct water conservation.\\"The patty melt has been pushed aside in favor of the herb-encrusted medallions of baby artichoke hearts, which never leave me thinking, Oh, right, those! I wonder if they're as good as the ones my mom used to make.\\"\\"The second, less complicated form of French amounts to screaming English at the top of your lungs, much the same way you'd shout at a deaf person or the dog you thought you could train to stay off the sofa... Easy French is rooted in the premise that, if properly packed, the rest of the world could fit within the confines of Reno, Nevada.\\"\\"The card (in the hotel bathroom) reported the amount of water used every year in hotel laundry rooms and suggested that, in having my sheets and towels changed on a daily basis, I was taking this precious water directly from the cupped hands of a dehydrated child.

I liked &quot;Holidays on Ice&quot; and &quot;Naked&quot; so much, I couldnt' wait for this one. Well, I should have probably stopped and read some Spalding Gray or something first. Cuz I have to admit, I got a little tired of it all. After so many adventures with the guy, his come-what-may narration and constant striving for failure, well, you start to agree with him.

If you can say that a book about a man obsessed with dermatological ailments and a very healthy fantasy life is 'fun'. It's sick, silly, twisted and charming.

It's a delightful, though slim, read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A #1 national bestseller, I was drawn to this book by word of mouth, but was convinced to buy it thanks to the well put-together David Sedaris table found at Barnes & Noble. You know how busy I have been, so it took me a while to get to this book in my very large pile. I've had it since December and I feel very accomplished to have it completed.David Sedaris is a man who grew up in South Carolina before moving around the United States to San Francisco, Chicago and New York before ending up in Paris, France. Me Talk Pretty One Day is his memoir of trying to grow up and find his place as an individual. Dreaming of hitting it big and becoming famous, Sedaris has it rough as a child already recognizing himself as a homosexual at the age of eleven. Sent to speech pathology for a lisp, and suspecting that others like him are also being sent to kick out more than just the lisp, Sedaris searches for a way to become comfortable with himself. It is hard when even his guitar instructor turned him away for singing showtunes, but he eventually made some type of progress, if you can call it that. Constantly moving from city to city, job to job, Sedaris has been a personal assistant for a woman obsessed with catching a lost cockatoo for a reward and has moved the boxes of enough variable people to get a better understanding of the confusing human race. Leading to a life in Paris with his boyfriend Hugh, Sedaris finds some sense of security.I found this memoir to be enjoyable to read, but I was hoping that it would be more like a novel. Especially in Part One (Sedaris's portion devoted to living in the United States), the author jumps around between both random topics and time periods. It seemed as if he was jumping to the places that would give him the appearance of a misunderstood artist sitting in a nest of human hair or a troubled young adult with a flair for drug use. I wasn't hip to the \\"edge\\" Sedaris was trying to portray because it just left the tale jagged and rough. I was hoping for more of something like his first chapter in speech class but was left disappointed until Part Deux. Part Deux (you guessed it, Sedaris's portion devoted to living in France) is a much more enjoyable, less edgy storyline that flows much better than the jumpy Part One. Finally returning to anything relating to his title (Me Talk Pretty One Day) since the first chapter, Sedaris talks about his adventures in France learning the language and trying to communicate and exist in a foreign country. He finds himself defending the United States at dinner parties, being the scapegoat for America-hating Europeans, and fascinated by American tourists who speak negatively about him in English without knowing he can understand everything they are saying. This is a much better section of the memoir, so please make sure you plow through Part One to get to it. I was disappointed, though, on the seemingly lack of a general ending. Unless you count the fact that some of his family who could afford the trip came to France to celebrate Christmas as an ending, it is hard to find when the last chapter is really devoted to Sedaris's father's quirk of buying and hiding fruit past its expiration date.I found this book enjoyable and it was nice to have to pass the time. I have said that Part Deux was exponentially better than Part One for storyline and chronological factors, but let me continue to say that I would only read this for bare entertainment. I can only see reading this to pass the time. It did and I had fun, but I cannot see reading this for any higher purpose because it seems that by the last page of this novel, the author is still searching for any shred of purpose and therefore has nothing to offer the reader besides his version of daydreams he has while staying awake after switching to caffinated tea instead of drugs. It's fun as long as you just stay on the surface, as the author seems to do. Success for its wit, comedy and point of view, I can understand the limited crowd it has drawn while still making the work a national bestseller.\\"The worth of a book is to be measured by what you can carry away from it.\\"-James Bryce"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is some sort of nut, like Shakespeare was in his time. To grab the attention of a reader the way David Sedaris does in his writing is a particular skill enjoyed by very few writers. \\" Is thems the thoughts of cows ?\\" , has gone into google-speak as a stand-alone expression worthy of such an accolade. I would never say that I could identify with his life experiences or his family but after riding along on his journey with him, I do feel that have stayed the weekend in his mind.

It is the story of a mostly dysfunctional person and his family: his overbearing father, cigarette smoking and alcoholic mother, and talented but uninterested siblings. Some parts are just pathetic as when Sedaris uses drugs. My suggestion is to read a library copy first and then buy his books if you find them worth the money."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"THE BOOK ARRIVED PROMPTLY, IN GOOD CONDITION AND I WILL PURCHASE FROM THE SELLER IN THE FUTURE."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The sales of this book are impressive. That is one criterion of book success. And considering the lugubrious books on various best seller lists, some comic relief might be in order. Does it make this reviewer laugh? Parts of it he finds amusing. Other parts,- to take the name of the Lord and to mix it with the vain language of the current time is a part of the book that was not amusing."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I decided to order this book after hearing the author read two of the chapters on national Public Radio (NPR). Both chapters covered his life in France. It seemed quite a novel idea; an American sharing his experiences on life in France, unsuccessfully trying to come to grips with the vagaries of the French language. On each occasion, the stories were very witty, and delivered superbly. On this basis, and on the understanding that the book would be &quot;more of the same&quot;, I decided to order it without delay. Unfortunately, I found the book very disappointing. Why? First, the number of words per dollar is very low. Okay. Never mind. What else? Second, only 2-3 chapters (toward the end of the book) are devoted to the challenges of life in France. The rest covers the authors' earlier years in the USA, and is not in the same league as what I heard on NPR. Overall, the book cannot be described as &quot;funny&quot;. The chapters are generally unrelated to each other, merely representing a relatively disjointed collection of anecdotes lacking a true punchline or meaning. It took me approximately three hours to read the book, and I felt no enlightenment or fulfillment afterwards. Repeatedly, I gained the impression that the author is trying to emulate Bill Bryson. The problem is that he does this very unsuccessfully. Perhaps I should just blame NPR for giving an entirely false impression of the book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'd never heard of David Sedaris when I recently picked up this book in a sale at my local bookstore -- skimming the first couple pages and reading the backcover blurbs made it seem worth the discounted price.Overall, my opinion of the book strongly concurs with that of Jeannette C. (October 18, 2005), the book wasn't bad in any way, or even dull or tedious. It just was a book to read, a way to pass some time.The first story was probably the most amusing, certainly the most engaging. Some of the others seemed to be a pointless meander down memory lane, in particular 'The Rooster'. These remembrances could be funny in the right context, with some background, but within the confines of the book they were nothing more than words on a page.The second half, dealing with the author's soujourn in France, was slightly more entertaining, though a bit heavy on the bitter self-deprecation.I can't say I was sorry when I got to the last page though.For me, the \\"funniest person writing today\\" is, without question, Terry Pratchett of Discworld fame."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This new collection of real-life accounts of the life and times of David Sedaris was an amazing bore. If there ever was an example of the Emperor's New Clothes, me talk pretty, tops the list, evidenced by the heights it has scaled on the best-seller list. Clearly a book need not have any true quality to achieve best-seller status but just clever marketing and previous reputation. Unlike the wacky but fascinating, self-depricating Naked, me talk pretty is a collection of stories one might over hear and tune out during a morning commute. If I were Mr.Sedaris, and thank goodness I am not, I'd be more than embarassed. In fact, me talk pretty is the kind of book that, in better circumstances, Sedaris himself would have used his sharp wit to make fun of."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I bought this book when multiple people in a pseudo-book-club I was in remarked that it was \\"the funniest thing they'd ever read.\\" I have loved humorous books in the past, ranging from political Al-Franken-type books to goofy sci-fi Douglas-Adams-type books. I did not love this book. It simply was not that funny. Sedaris is not that witty or clever, and he's a pretty sub-par writer. I have no interest in reading his other books, but I suppose he could care less, since he's already sold bajillions."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"...Funny? When did cynicism and ...arrogance displace wit and insight in American comedy? If you think insulting anyone around is a sign of wit you have found your bible. A weak author, without charm or grasp of the language.If airing the intimacies of family and friends in an insulting and exploitative way is your description of charm then get ready to be smitten. It'll make a good read in between episodes of Temptation Island and American Idol..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A hard-to-put-down hilarious book. I've read it a few times. A fun book to pass around groups, and then talk about favorite parts."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I realize that David Sedaris books are supposed to be \`really' funny, and I consider myself to have a great sense of humor, but overall I found \`Me Talk Pretty One Day' amusing at best. In this best selling book, the reader is exposed to a collection of short stories that take on a humorous spin of mundane topics, or everyday subjects that the Sedaris family has placed their own \`unique and warped' spin on.Though most stories were entertaining, I often asked that though many of these snippets of Mr. Sedaris's life were plausible, some seem to be somewhat exaggerated or embellished. Perhaps that is the authors attempt to really try to make something funny, which ordinarily isn't. Now, don't get me wrong, there are some funny stories. The book is worth it's price in three or four of these snapshots: \\"I'll eat what he's wearing\\", \\"Big Boy\\", and the one that had me rolling on the floor crying to catch my breath \\"You can't kill the Rooster.\\" This last story about his younger brother is movie material!The collection overall covers a wide variety of subjects, however, there seem to be two recurring theme's that I observed. First, a decent portion of the book is devoted to his experiences living in France. Though one can make the argument that this book is about his life and it's funny moments, and he did actually live in France; for someone who has never been there to identify French absurdity I found myself saying \\"Oh, another story France, again\\". The redeeming aspect for me here was the story about learning French with a bunch of students (characters in their own right), taught by a dictatorial and stereotypical rude French teacher.Secondly, the author seems to have what I would consider some issues of reservation of his life and choices. Autobiographical in nature, the stories often reflect the author's acknowledgement of his low self-worth. He often talks about how many deplorable jobs he has had, how cheap his father is, how smart he isn't, his life with an alcoholic mother, how he got mixed up into drugs and just shuffled through life. However, he takes these normally depressing attributes and attempts to shroud them in humor, hoping that the reader can look past these events on the surface and praise Mr. Sedaris for his wit. Though this does work at times, I wasn't sure whether to laugh or feel sorry for him at times.I hope I am not giving an impression that this is a bad book. It is not. It is funny and an easy read. But it was more \`amusing' than \`hilarious' in which most people would expect."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read this book based on the recommendation of a friend and enjoyed it tremendously. What an admirable trait it is to be able to laugh at one's self. Sedaris even managed to shed some worldly insight with this autobiographical piece. Very well written and funny. I particularly enjoyed his experience with the Americans and the train ride in Paris. I had a similar experience and reading about it was brought back great memories and laughter. This is my first read by Sedaris but I'm sure it won't be the last. Relax and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"After finishing David Sedaris' latest, I found myself missing him in the same way tend to miss Holden Caufield. A true and funny friend gone away. Like most most gay guys I find Sedaris endlessly endearing while endless annoying. I wish he would write a novel but he's probably too lazy. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Very very funny ,i tell everyone to buy this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I did not receive the books I ordered, but I did get a full refund."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I purchased this book because I am a fan of Christopher Moore (Fluke, Lamb, Practical Demonkeeping, etc.) and a friend who also enjoys CM recommended David Sedaris. Well, the Me Talk Pretty One Day is adequately entertaining, but nothing spectacular. If you are a fan of light humor, or are interested in reading from the perspective of a gay man who doesn't make his homosexuality the focus of every short story, you might enjoy Me Talk Pretty One Day."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I never thought, in a million years, that I would encounter a story about a man feverishly trying to flush someone else's monstrous turd down the toilet. David Sedaris is absolutely hysterical; I'm addicted."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'm a Flight Attendant who is also an author and one day I want to write as funny as David Sedaris. As for now, I have this fantasy that David Sedaris will be on my airline one day. When we are both going to Paris. He'll be a passenger in first class and I'll be the Flight Attendant. And he won't be able to sleep because he can't smoke on the flight - and we'll have this very witty chat and he'll become my new best friend. Ok, so maybe it won't happen, until then I'll just read his essay's outloud and laugh at them, with my husband."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Yes, this book is undeniably funny. However, it's the literary equivalent of Doritos (ie: Pretty good, but lacking substance. And too much will make you feel vaguely ill.) Borrow it and bust a gut laughing for an afternoon. But don't spend your own money on it, because the vignettes become increasingly less humorous with successive re-readings."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book cracked me up. I bought it for a few of my friends... He is very synical, but VERY funny! I would read it again..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris's earlier works are well-written and consistantly hilarious. In his most recent collection of essays, the author focuses more on autobiography. I find the new essays somewhat limiting in their depth, detail, and, most importantly, humor. Most of the essays seem like summaries of events that the author wants to and seems capable of describing in greater detail. The fictional essays in his earlier work are often more descriptive of Sedaris's life, not only because of the allusion to actual personal history, but the essence of the author in all of the fictional characters. In Me Talk Pretty, Sedaris is but one man, and he doesn't jump enough into his life to make it totally compelling. Worth a read, however."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the first David Sedaris book I've read, and I will definitely be reading more! I laughed out loud in every chapter, but his satire is not overbearing. His way with words and his quirky way of thinking about ordinary life situations borders on genius (despite the results of his IQ test!) Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was a selection by our local Book Club. I hated it in the beginning, but liked it better toward the end. Others loved the beginning and didn't like the end. It's not a \\"book\\", it's a series of essays written at different stages of the author's life. They're not connected, they have no continuity (except for being written by the same man)so it's a little like reading \\"Reader's Digest\\" with different short stories.I feel led to say that some in our group absolutely LOVE David Sedaris. I doubt if I would buy another of his books but reserve the right to change my mind (which I'm sure he would endorse in his warped, strange sense of humor.)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I loved this book so much I paid to see/hear the author when he came thru town on a tour. He is able to tell a story like no other. Highly recommend all of his books...all of them have made me laugh. :)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"If I had to give it a star rating, I think I'd make it 3 1/2 on one level and 4 on another. I think that's mostly because the book is so unexpectedly dark. Sedaris is very funny and has a unique way of viewing the world but when he describes his years of drug abuse and his experiences in the \\"art\\" world, the writing was not so funny. (well, how could it be considering the subject matter!) Until reading this book, I had no idea Sedaris had such a past. It is to his credit, however, that he was able to come out of that part of his life and make such a success!The title of his book refers to his living in France and trying to learn the language. Having taken French in school myself and trying to use my \\"knowledge\\" in Paris and Quebec, I related to his experiences - and was just as embarrassed! His description of Americans he met in his travels who did not realize he was an American, too, made me embarrassed for my fellow countrymen.If you go into the reading of this book and expect it to be similar to previous works, you will be a bit disappointed (3.5 stars) but if you read the book and marvel at Sedaris' exposure of his lowest moments, you will not be disappointed (4 stars)."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"\\"Me Talk Pretty...\\" is yet another reason why it's a really bad idea to have inflated expectations about a work of fiction.Well, bad idea for me, anyway.I picked Sedaris shortly after having read an Augusten Burroughs. That was 4 years ago (I think). Back then, I was optimistic in the hopes of finding another author with that knack for self-mockery coupled with acerbic wit and a distinct lack of care about giving a fig on what others thought. Plus...not coming on as someone who tries to be funny, but...is...just...*is*.Indeed, he doesn't even have to be gay. (I didn't want to think that only gay men can have the monopoly on dysfunctional prose - where would that leave the rest of us poor sods?)Seriously - I thought those expectations of mine were pretty shallow. Bordering on predictable if not totally taken for granted.And so, 4 years (or so) ago, I opened \\"Me Talk Pretty...\\" and braced myself to be swept away by the comic stylings of yet another funny author.Two chapters later and I slammed the book shut. I can't believe it. I was bored.A few years on and it remained shut. And I began to feel miffed with the idea that I may be cheating myself. Who knows? Sedaris' sensibilities may be different from Burroughs'. But that doesn't automatically mean it's bad.So I reread those first 2 chapters, armed with an admittedly sketchy vow to soldier on. No matter what happens. My criteria were still the same. But I held onto them with a markedly less white-gripped tenacity.Sure enough, there were funny moments in this book. 'Jesus Shaves' and 'Picka Pocketoni' I liked. Really liked. There are a few things I love more than indulging in a fantasy wherein other people are as discomfited, neurotic, and hassled as I've been when I was among people who spoke a different tongue.Otherwise, Sedaris' chronicles of his crystal meth days, his stint as a glorified furniture mover and assistant to a volatile South American, and forays into being an inglorious college professor were somewhat negligible. Oftentimes, it felt as if the humor was being forced.There's a sense of affectation particularly when he was in his 'artist' phase - and no amount of excuse as being a drug addict back then may be enough to compensate for the odd behavior expected of someone under the influence. Because, yes, he was odd during his days as a user, but the accompanying exploits were hardly...uhmm...funny.Hence, the 3 stars. Good thing this was bought from a secondhand bookshop. Else I'd be really really depressed. Maybe I'd need another 4 years (or so) before I could give another Sedaris book a try..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The book was in great condition, thank you for you acuracy in that relm. It took so long to get to me! I had ordered something else that day in a state farther away and got it in 5 days this book took more than two weeks. I needed it for a book club meeting and the transit time put me in bind and put a damper on my reading experience."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was absolutely entertaining! Sedaris has a knack for off the cuff ranting. Worth a read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I think David and Tom Elsa are my new favorite authors! There books are hilarious."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I keep this book on my nightstand at all times. Every essay in here is a true gem, a work of art. This collection is testament enough that David Sedaris is a true genius of American literature. Even if he's living in France. Not that he's an \\"ex-pat\\" or anything."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I recieved this book as a gift from my husban who hates to read yet loves NPR. This is the first Sedaris book I've read. I'm a fan! I plan on purchasing more of his books. I'm very busy and I find that books of essays are better because I can read one essay at a time. I enjoyed reading about sedaris' French teacher and how to explain Easter in a second language."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I really did not like this book. As a matter of fact, I couldn't finish reading it. I tried more than once, thinking I would begin to enjoy it but I just couldn't read it to the end. Sorry for the poor report. It certainly was not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I received this book and, given all the positive publicity, was anxious and excited to read it. However, I put it down after struggling through half of it, vowing not to finish it. Why? Because hidden beneath Sedaris' sarcastic, cynical approach to humor appears to be a bitterness against people, the world - life in general. Sure, if you like laughing at others, I suppose you would enjoy this book. He reminds me of a cynical, sarcastic Woody Allen. Using humor to basically say &quot;See how smart I am? I'm making fun of YOU, the AVERAGE person, and you don't even know it!&quot;. Bitterness is not funny - it's just plain ugly."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Two scenarios:1. I'm a friend of yours. One day I call you on the phone and tell you about something really funny that happened to me yesterday. Its one of the funniest stories you've ever heard. You totally crack up.2. I'm a friend of yours. One day I call you on the phone and tell you about something really funny that happened to me yesterday. Its one of the funniest stories you've ever heard. You totally crack up. Then I tell you that I made about half of it up. Just to make it funnier.Scenario 1= pretty good friend.Scenario 2= slightly desperate and pathetic attempt at humor. Comes off a bit needy."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was disappointed and embarassed. I had given this book as a Christmas present last year to a member of my family because I read so many glowing reviews about it being funny and that the author is a modern-day Mark Twain. But I hadn't yet read it. Yesterday I saw it in the airport bookstore and bought my own copy, anticipating a fun read for the next seven hours. It wasn't fun and it isn't funny. It's like eating chewing gum off the sidewalk -- something novel, but not something you want to have inside your body. I'm embarassed that I gave it as a gift and I am writing an apology letter; they must think I regard them as boorish, gross, and unfunnily sarcastic people. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book has been described as acerbic, witty, and funny. I beg to differ. While parts of the book certainly live up to this billing, almost every anecdote is marred by something jarringly crude or gross. Perhaps is helps make the point? But it really ruined the book for me. For example the image of a nude man being painfully stomped by a woman(?) in spike heals is about as funny as school shootings or people being dragged to death."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"There was nothing to laugh about in this book. The author made it clear he had a terrible life, that he hated everything and everyone, and that he has felt unloved throughout his life. I found the book to be depressing, irritating and frustrating."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris is going to crash and burn when he runs out of the same repetitive boring simpleton (enough adjectives?) stories about his inane family and romps in the world. This book should be called Barrel Fever 2 or Naked 2 - the sequel. I'm going to hurl if I read about Amy Sedaris' shenanegans and the simple humor that the world has embraced. You're better off watching the Brady Bunch for the same kind of knee-slapping humor. Yawn."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I heard an interview with David Sedaris' sister. She talked a lot about David and this book. It sounded great, so I picked it up that day. I anticipated a raw and witty story revealing the oddness of family life. However, what I got was a rant.I can accept that it is not a novel, but a bunch of random thoughts. Still, I like to be compelled to at least read the next word. But, I found my self predicting the next line and trudging through the pages.Whatever happened to character building? Who cares about these people? Lots of us have stories like these tucked away in our families (what not you?). Anyway, my point is that David Sedaris attempts ONLY to talk pretty. I can just picture him throwing words together and then sitting back with a grin saying, &quot;Oh yeah, I'm a laugh riot.&quot;Don't waste your precious time."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Dont see what the big deal is. This guy is only moderately funny at best. There were two chapters that even elicited a chuckle. His sister Amy is much funnier. Dont waste your time with David."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"As I purchased this book simply because it appears on so many Francophile Amazon.com listamania lists, I prepared myself for a throughly enjoyable and hysterically humorous read based on the 400+ reviews that pumped up the pleasure factor of this book to the almost unrealistic level of master satirist Mark Twain. While the book is funny, I was disappointed to discover that it really was not about France or the French---the essay entitled \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", indeed narrates the author's amusing and insightful struggle with learning the French language while at a language school in Paris, but it is only one out of perhaps four or five essays about France, the majority of the book deals with Sedaris' issues with himself and his colorful family back in the US. (Now, please, just because I am warning those Amazon customers who wish to purchase a book about France and the French and were directed to this book by listamania listings, don't immediately click the \\"no\\" button as if the rest of my review isn't worth reading. Alas, I was sadly misdirected as most likely others are, too and should not be penalized for telling the truth as I see it. Nor should anyone rate anyone's review negatively simply because it expresses an alternative opinion.) Because of this misdirection, I read the first half of this book--which has nothing to do with France--with anticipation of when France and the French were going to pop up in the author's humorous anecdotes and musings regarding this understanding of life. By the time I got to the second part, where Sedaris travels to Paris with his boyfriend, I had already realized that this book of essays was just that: a book of essays containing only a few essays about France. I confess to skimming through the contents of each essay before deeming it worthy of my time--sorry to those of you who simply love everything Sedaris--and I will say that the French essays in the book are well worth the read---I just wish there had been a whole book dedicated to just this topic.Therefore, if like myself, you have happened upon this page simply to read a book about France, save your money and either read the few French themed essays in the library or bookstore. Buy instead \\"On Rue Tatin\\"--the telling of an American woman and her husband who buy an old convent north of Paris or any of the Provence books by UK author Mayle. These books are not meant to be funny in a satirical manner, but instead convey an idea of the French and their country from alien prospectives."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Well, for me it wasn't funny at all( maybe because I'm from a foreing country and I don't get American humor all the time) and most of the topics are basic and some of the stories a little annoying. Just an OK book!."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"After listening to everyone raving about this book for years, I finally broke down and bought myself a copy. It's entertaining but after all the reviews of everyone saying how hilarious this book is, I expected to be rolling on the floor laughing with tears in my eyes from the hilarity. For a book that starts off with 5 pages of glowing reviews of how ridiculously funny this book is, I was expecting more than an occasional snicker. There were lots of parts where you might say to yourself, \\"Oh, thats funny\\", but you don't actually laugh out loud. Not a terrible read, but not exactly what I'd call a side splitter. But, thats just me."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Let's start out with the good things about this book. Each chapter can be a story unto itself, so its an easy book to pick up for a few minutes and put down again when you get busy. You don't feel like you're stopping in the middle of the good part. David is a great writer. He's not the most eloquent or original writer on the planet, but he's not a big idiot either. The book is a personal account, so the reader really feels like she gets a personal experience. The parts that are funny, are really funny, especially if you are a fan of sarcasm, which I am.The bad part, however, is bad enough to be a big disappointment. For those of you who don't know already, the author is gay. Big deal - no one cares. Just like no one cares that I'm straight. As long as its well written and entertaining, I could care less. But when the author makes it a point to remind us of his sexual orientation in every chapter, it makes the book difficult to relate to unless you're gay or maybe grew up with a gay sibling. Since neither of those scenarios pertain to me personally, it was difficult for me to really get into the stories in this book with constant references to the author's sexuality - just like I imagine he would get bored reading a story sprinkled with references to my sexuality. Sexual orientation wasn't supposed to be the point of the book, but I think it turned out to be a strong theme throughout.I wish the editor would have told David that he is funny enough, his stories are original enough and his writing is entertaining enough that he didn't need to make darn sure the reader was clear on the author's sexuality. I think if the homosexual references were fewer, I would have been much happier with this piece of work."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"After all the amazing reviews I heard about this book, I maybe laughed out loud twice. I didn't find anything cutting edge about his humor, it was predictable and often downright boring."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A collection of autobiographical essays by Sedaris which appeared in different magazines before being collected here. Neither funny, nor witty, this makes for very light and insipid reading. I'd rather read Donald E. Westlake or Dave Barry for my humour supply."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is one of the funniest books I have ever read in my life. I am a huge Sedaris fan anyway, but I had to make sure I was in a place that wasn't too quiet when I was reading this, because I found myself often laughing out loud. So please, don't take this book to church, class, or...the library???My favorite chapter is \\"Shiner Like a Diamond\\", which is all about David's sister, Amy.Buy this book NOW!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"There were a lot of moments in this book where I'd burst out laughing, but also a lot of moments where I was like \\"whoa\\". It's probably just slightly too dark for me, but I still really recommend it and I absolutely loved his description of his messed up French speaking skills."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was on a train from Paris to the South of France while reading this book. I laughed like like a lunatic, tears streaming down my cheeks. He is so right on in his observations about the french laguage and culture. I love it!!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I laughed until I cried with this tape set!I mistakenly listened (at bedtime) to David Sedaris read his own material. I stayed up half the night - unable to turn it off.Mr. Sedaris is dry, witty, and has a unique approach to making the \\"everyday\\" into something special.I won't give away any of the content, but this one is worthy of a listen."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris has a biting, morose writing style. He's fascinated with the macabre. He is gay. Although he grew up in North Carolina, he's spent a good deal of time living in France and New York City. He has a wonderful, inventive vocabulary. Taken together, these qualities make for hiliarious story-telling. His accounts of learning French while living overseas are particularly funny. (Note: do not drink milk while reading these sections. It will spew.) And because the book is essays, most of them 5 or so pages long, you can put it down and pick it back up at any time. (Although you will have a hard time putting it down. I read most of it in a day.)Sedaris just has a funny, refreshing voice. Read this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book every night when I went to bed. Great writing, love the sarcastic humor, unique observations on life - just a lot of fun."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have always heard my friends talk about David Sedaris, but since I am not a fan of reading, I never bothered to pick up one of his books. However, recently on a business trip, I bought &quot;Me talk pretty one day&quot; and I tell you, it was such an enjoy and easy read that I recent purchased, the rest of his books to enjoy while I travel and at home! Intelligent and hilarious!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I like the fact that this book was a fast read, and easy to pick up if you stop reading it for one reason or another."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This has got to be one of the funniest books I've ever read. David Sedaris's essays are full of insight and wit. His comic timing is precise when he describes his childhood, his family and his eccentric friends. I have been told that the audio version of this book intensifies the humor and that I ought to give it a whirl. If the audiocassette is as funny as the book, then I look forward to listening to it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Bottom line: This book will make it difficult to catch your breath regardless of your current lung capacity.I first heard Sedaris on NPR one morning and found myself choking on my toothpaste from laughter. Months later I saw this title while perusing a local bookstore. I picked it up to have some fluffy reading on the beach not realizing I'd tear through it before I ever reached my vacation spot. My husband thought I was mildly deranged from all the hooting and giggling on that road trip.Since then, I've consumed the rest of Sedaris' work with breathless enthusiasm while impatiently waiting to attend his local appearance this coming April. I purchased several of his books for folks on my holiday shopping list to share his gift for distilling the utterly hilarious from the painful and/or embarrassing moments of life. Four days after Christmas and I'm already receiving thank-you notes about it.David Sedaris is a comic treasure. And who couldn't use a little levity after spending the holidays with dysfunctional relatives? Order this book now and request express shipping! Just remember to breathe every page or so."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is one of the few books I've read that actually had me laughing out loud. His trouble with the gender of french words is classic, anyone who has learned a new language will relate. Not surprisingly my favorite chapter is about his brother, The Rooster. A North Carolina bred man who clings on to his Gangsta Rap roots with every word he utters...sheer brilliance. Rivaling in hilarity is his tour of Paris listening to an Audio book translating french medical terms. A fine way to unassumingly listen to a walkman for some, a great way to crack me up on the subway."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Don't read this book in public or people will think you're crazy. I laughed so hard when I read &quot;Jesus Shaves&quot; (the story of Easter told by beginning French students) that I almost went into spasms. The entire book is ragingly funny, but the best parts are about how to get along in France when you don't speak French. Read Naked first, then this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I laughed out loud on almost every page of his book. By far the funniest novel I have ever read. The stories were touching and heartfelt and I cannot wait to read every thing else he has ever written."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I am a huge fan of David Sedaris on public radio and when I saw his book, I knew I had to read it. I found myself bursting into laughter and having to read entire chapters out loud to my husband. Definitely a great book that makes you look for the hilarious moments in your own family."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Wow, this book was really funny! I start laughing in a public place and peaple look at me strange. I've never had a book this funny before. I've lent it to about 9 friends."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is a very humorous book about the author's different encounters, from growing up, to well..thinking he's grown up. It's a journey through his brain, and you dont have to read it all at once, it's the kind of book you can skip chapters and still understand it. A couple of the chapters are a little boring, but most of them are very funny."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have recently discovered David Sedaris and he is now among my favorite authors. Congratulations, David!! I love his sarcastic humor and the way he tells about his life in a way that makes me laugh out loud. This is a great sort of autobiography/novel meshed together in a way that I can not explain. Just read the book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Absolutely hilarious! I can't wait to read another one of Mr. Sedaris' books. The way he looks at the quirkiness of life, that we can all relate to, makes you SO GLAD that life can be so quirky! This guy has a fabulous sense of humor. Guaranteed enjoyment and laughs out loud. More! More! More!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I had listened to a PBS radio interview of David and became interested when the interviewer had David read a couple of excerpts from &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;. It sounded very funny. I too know that our everyday lives are the best fodder for humor, but wit, oh wit has to be earned. So while waiting for my plane to depart recently, I saw the book and decided to give it a read. I nearly missed my plane. David's humor had me laughing and smiling, to the annoyance of my fellow travelers. Never before had an author so easily drawn me into his world and entertained me so completely. I hadn't even known of David prior to the interview and reading this book. Now, I must read all his works and can only hope life continues to FORCE him to write and share his view of this really silly world."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"It's been awhile since a book made me laugh out loud, and I try to read funny books often. This book definitely accomplished that and much more. I enjoyed how the book was written in episodes as opposed to a continuous storyline. Unlike many other books like that, it was easy to follow and fun to read. I recommend this book to anyone looking for laughter with a heart. I have just picked up &quot;Naked&quot; by Sedaris and am looking forward to another fufilling experience."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I picked this book up, not even knowing who David Sedaris was. I saw on the leaflet, that one of the stories was about living in France and the various comical misunderstandings which arise when trying to communicate in a language other than your mother tongue. I'm a Francophile, and it looked like it might be amusing... Well, it may well be the funniest book I've ever read. I was crying, indeed shreiking with laughter as Mr. Sedaris led me deeper and deeper into absurdly hilarious,and yet often very familiar situations. France was only one of his mileiu of varied venues. I cannot remember laughing so hard about anything in a very long time. I quickly purchased another to give to a relative who is going through Chemo, and another for a friend who also needed cheering up, and then I bought another as a gift for a perfectly healthy friend, and so on... To be sure, my own copy is and will remain on my shelf reserved for cherished books. It will take on the hue and texture of an often read and greatly enjoyed book. Laughter is indeed a powerful medicine and &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; will make anyone feel giddy to be alive."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was a great read. I sat reading laughing out loud enough to annoy my TV watching family."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is so funny! I almost wet myself! He is also the most adorable author living today. I want to have his babies. Armistead Maupin says of this book &quot;achingly funny&quot; on the dustjacket, which is quite a compliment in itself. READ IT NOW then Buy it for a depressed friend ! You owe it to your inner Vachette."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is just plain silly and that's the beauty of him. I just know if I was at a dinner party and he was seated next to me, I'd have a great evening. His essay on Big John, the leftover in the bathroom, had me in stitches. This is a very funny book and I will make it a point to read everything he's written. What a gas!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris' wit ranks with any other writers, reminding me mostly of David Barry, and his series of personal essays left no doubt as to his writing ability. This one has made most bestseller lists by now, so if you haven't read it, pick it up. A great way to finish off the summer!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I've read a few of David Sedaris' books and enjoyed them all but this one is by far my favorite. I've kept finding myself laughing out loud."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have read a few of David Sedaris' other books and thought they were simply hysterical. However, \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is not like those other books. Although some lines were worthy of a small smile, I thought the book failed to entertain. Overall, I was disappointed with the purchase. Next time, I will just borrow the book from a friend before I waste more of my money."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is not a typical read for me. I'm reading this for my book club. I'm 30% thru don't know if I make the end. This book was a read for my book club. Think it should be a mans read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was the third book authored by Sedaris that I have read. They are all higly enjoyable. Very few authors can make me laugh out loud while I am reading. He is certainly one of them. As soon as I finished this book I ordered another one for my kindle."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the second David Sedaris book I've read, afterNaked. Like that book, this one is full of classic Sedaris stories - funny, touching, and always self-deprecating. We follow Sedaris through all types of adventures - how does he get himself into these situations? Overall, a great beach read for anyone looking for a light and fun read.For Sedaris fans, I highly recommend Wade Rouse'sIt's All Relative: Two Families, Three Dogs, 34 Holidays, and 50 Boxes of Wine (A Memoir). The similarities in their writing are many, as both are unabashedly gay humorists / memoirists."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the type of autobiography I can read. It wasn't a self absorbed tale of angst and hatred over childhood misfortunes. It didn't blame anyone for the author's limited life successes. It was simply a well worded comical account of a man's life from childhood to present day. It was genuinely laugh out loud funny if you have any sense of humor at all and he never omitted himself as the butt of most of his jokes. If you read one book a year it should be this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was purchased for my son as required reading for his AP English class. I don't have a review of the content of the book itself but rather the vendor. This book arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent condition. I would definitely purchase from this vendor again."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty vaguely takes the form of a non-chronological autobiography so I'll call it a memoir. This book is meant for fun and laughs, and if there is a deeper level it is in getting to know David Sedaris as a person. This isn't quite so easy because of the ways Sedaris recounts some stages of his life. The grim ones in particular, like his time as a tweaker, takes the idea of show not tell a little too far. Sedaris never mentions his feelings about important and grave events, but of light ones. He escaped all his perils and aimless stages in life to finally be a successful author - but he writes as if somewhere deep down, he always saw this future coming - he was always in on the joke, and was living a crazy life for a while in order to have plenty of stories to tell. This kept Sedaris at a distance from me. Certainly its his choice to do so, but this is the first memoir I've read that wants it to be this way."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Its pretty legit, I like it. Its a good transition from Augusten Burroughs since I already read all of his."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Hands down - one of the funniest things ever written. Do yourself the favor, you're worth it. If purchased new, this could be the best ten dollars that you have ever spent."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I haven't read many books that make me laugh out loud, but this one did. I frequently had to stop and giggle over the way that the author managed to captured something completely ridiculous and believable at the same time. The stories are relatable, but still remarkably funny and memorable."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Very funny, and entertaining, and easy readin'! [...] If you want to continue the laughter, and great originality, get yourself a copy of Howie Weener Unclogged: A colonic noir musical memoir! Funny funny funny stuff..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is one of my favorite authors, so i was disappointed in myself that i did not buy this book sooner. A great read, good condition."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was the first time I have ever bought a book on CD. I usually just check them out from the library. The CD's look brand new but the story skips quite a bit. I will not buy a book on CD again. I will buy the regular book because I heard the book itself was fantastic."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I've heard David Sedaris on Public Radio and enjoy his stories. The book is good to have around when you need a smile."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"to my library - inexpensive and a hardback, too - look forward to reading more of the stories - cupcake"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I couldn't get past the first few pages. Will pick it up at a later date and see if I like it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The first chapters were hilarious! The book quickly became annoying after that... The author teeters between self pity and self indulgence to the point where it's just sickening. I found myself reading more in hopes that it would pick up and become cute and funny again like the beginning of the book was... But I'm over half way through now and I'm bored and have no interest in finishing it. I'm disappointed."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Its great to listen to him when I want to instead catching the too infrequent radio programmes we have here. Love him. My family say I dont have a sense of humour- David makes me laugh out loud."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is a hilarious book. I've never read a funny novel before because I never thought humor could be as good in a book as in a movie. I won't say I liked all his essays. There were one or two i didn't care much for, but the rest were so much fun!I will buy more of his books!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"There isn't much more I can say about this book that hasn't already been said but I will try anyway. I read this quite a few years ago on a friend's recommendation. And OH MY GOODNESS! My words do not do this book justice!! Sedaris' take on life and his way of telling stories is unlike anything I have ever read or heard. This book was so laugh-out-loud funny that at any given moment while reading this book I could be found spitting coffee out of my mouth, bending over in laughter and yes maybe even wetting my pants!! (okay, so the last one never happened but this book is just that funny!!)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I love this book. My copy is completely worn out - I rarely re-read a book, but I did this one. I forced it on all my friends. Very sick and hilarious!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris would admit he's had trouble getting his message across.As a youth at his dad's insistence, he tried communicating through music, from a guitar teacher more interested in bedroom swingin' than guitar slingin'. As he got older, he attempted it through performance art, only to push museum audiences' patience in his performances (and his life to its edge through substance abuse) before his family humorously intervened. He's avoided pronouncing s's so not to lisp as a youth, and ordered groceries in French plurals not to be misunderstood as an adult.Be thankful he chose the written word, even chipped away from his manual typewriter. To be sure, his masterful \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" addresses Sedaris' failures to communicate with family: foul-mouthed little brother Paul, dangerous, stunningly beautiful sister (actress/writer Amy Sedaris), their redneck-resisting, jazz-loving dad Lou, and boyfriend Hugh (who share a home and their own communication breakdowns living in France as Americans.) But in honest moments, Sedaris lets us laugh often at his and our fear of ostracism.He revisits this point consistently through his stories, each easily read independently and none more than 10 pages. He casually mocks his family's resistance to assimilate into North Carolina culture, a family friend's spending (almost) every minute in New York City afraid of would be shysters, and an American couple's fearing Sedaris as a French pickpocket while the husband shows his wife \\"my Paris.\\" The need to fit even permeates the book's wilder stories: Sedaris' daydreams in his next-to-last chapter, his borrowed tall tales from Hugh's childhood and from walking a French county fair, even the literally side-splitting \\"Big Boy\\" (which broke my children up when yours truly read it aloud on a recent cross-state road trip.)But \\"Me Talk Pretty\\" is most enjoyable when Sedaris' shows his love and respect for the family and friends he gently skewers. His sister wears a fat suit to enrage her weight-concious father, who eats spoiled food rather than waste it. Sedaris shares the funny, heartbreaking story of how family dogs helped his parents worked through their kids' leaving home, his mother's passing, and even the death of their beloved Great Dane, Melina. For all Sedaris' stories at their expense, you realize by book's end his home (with family and with his boyfriend) was the only place his and his family's witty iconoclasm could rest its pen and sword.Book promotion compared Sedaris' style with Dorothy Parker and James Thurber, but he lacks Parker's bitter venom (if also her stiletto-sharp wordplay). But \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" borrows as easily from Erma Bombeck's sense of family detail and your favorite travelogues to effectively show how good it feels to belong and the joy of expressing it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I enjoyed the audio version during a recent long road trip. David's narration and wit were a great companion. His are mature reflections and writings -- not for teenagers."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I've read all of Sedaris's works and \\"Me Talk Pretty\\" is by far his best. David Sedaris can write a story about himself like no one else can. He combines different essays explaining hilarious mishaps he has endured and the telling alone would be enough to give this five stars, but oh, the humor! Sedaris's conflicts are hilarious and his take on them only makes them more so. From his childhood in North Carolina, to his trip to France, he explains all kinds of mishaps he has been in and works them in a whole-book. If you enjoyed J.T.Mccraes_Katzenjammer_book with its hilarity and off-the-wall humor, then \\"Me Talk Pretty\\" is one for you as well."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have never read a book like this before in my life. A few years ago, a friend and I spotted 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' in a local bookstore. It looked interesting, so we both picked it up, opened it to any page, read only one paragraph. We both hurled laughter across the entire store at the same time. I always wondered if the entire book was that funny. My question was answered in 2006. I decided to use this week of Sring Break to read it and I am so glad I did. I have never experienced a book bringing on this kind of laughter. I would assume that I should not be reading it in public, as I've had some stares from people due to my fits of uncontrollable laughter. But who's concerned about that? This book is the absolute best laugh I've had in years. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is in usual form in this great collection of short stories that loosely assembled tell the tale of his life from adolesence to adulthood. \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster\\" hit so close to home, I couldn't decide if I was more shocked or amused by his rendition. Sedaris' self-deprecating writing style is so sardonic, yet so amusing; it's almost scary to think of someone with that low-self esteem level might be capable of if he used his power for evil instead channeling it all into a creative writing outlet. At any rate, he is capable of spinning an entertaining tale - even in situations where most of us would not see the humor."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I won't give away any of the stories (although you can surely find summaries here) I won't beat around the bush- simply put , this book is 'whack'!!! I mean funny! part of the book seems to be written under the influence of something because its just too funny...whatever the case... crack... or hopefully, be it divine inspiration from God... these short essays are hilarious. Mr.David Sedaris' writings still stick w/ me and moments later I am found laughing about them and a buddy thinks what is wrong with you (you have one of those halcion smiles like a plastic person) or why I won't let them in on my cosmic joke."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris writes satirically about his life, all stories are true and unexaggerated. He uses many different aspects of sarcasm in order to get the reader to laugh. Also he will use techniques that get the reader to think the same way he is thinking. Sedaris is very good at making his view or take on situations is the right one, and makes an extremely great argument for himself, whether or not he is actually right. Irony is also used to make the story funnier. He says he was offered the position as a teacher, when the preceding professor found a better job delivering pizza. A pizza delivery boy is certainly not what would be considered a high-paying job, and therefore it is ironically funny that Sedaris is getting paid less than he would be for delivering pizzas.Sedaris will also describe many times the way he planned, or saw himself completing a task: always in a very distinguished manner. But, then when he describes the way he actually accomplished the task, he is able to make fun of his awkward and uneasy ways of doing things. People are able to easily relate themselves to the same types of awkward situations Sedaris describes. As you read the book you might say, \\"I have totally felt that way before,\\" or \\"I never thought anyone would actually ever admit that.\\" By stating the obvious, untold truth, David Sedaris is able to have a very unique humorous effect on his audience.Many of the things Sedaris has done are almost entirely unbelievable to people, which adds to the comedic style. Another aspect of Sedaris' writing that makes it so funny is that at the time he did all of these strange things, he was being totally serious, and now, as he looks back to write, it is entirely funny and he can make fun of himself. Many people are able to relate this same type of thing to them. Most times, people do something stupid, and in the long run can look back and see the laughter in it. That is exactly what Sedaris does."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"No kidding. My first Sedaris book and it surely won't be my last. I promise!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"There are great stories in all his books and this is another collection filled with great observations of human nature. I think poignant is a good description... the ability to turn disappointment into humor. Sedaris is a master of it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Ever notice that most of the books we elect to read are tied to that notion that we need to constantly be aware that we are bettering ourselves? You know, keep up with the new novelists, pace yourself with philosophy, social comment, heavy thesaurus impacted stories, somehow neglecting that tiny voice that says &quot;Entertain me!&quot;. Well, here is the antidote, another skyride with David Sedaris whose Mark Twain style surfaces shared foibles and makes them hilarious instead of embarassing moments. I didn't find myself laughing out loud the way all the promo for this little tome guarantees, but I sure stayed with it, big grin spreading across my face, even giving up an invitation for a night out at an escapist thriller movie in favor of finishing this little piece of joy. This man is funny and tender and unafraid to talk about his thinking patterns,his +/- autobiographical history, and his incidental sexuality like most folks ramble on about the weather. Puts things into perspective...........and boy do we need that!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was laughing out loud as I listened to the audio version of Me Talk Pretty One Day. Mr. Sedaris' narration adds a vital dimension to this wry, insightful, sarcastic set of stories. I particularly loved hearing his Billie Holliday impression in the story about his guitar lessons. His direct translations of dialogue from French into English were also truly entertaining. I highly recommend this book on tape, especially for any long road-trips. Just remember to pull off the road if you start laughing too much."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is a really funny book, written by a really funny guy, who makes a lot of really funny observations. Really. Funny. Ok, I'm not getting far with this. Sometimes I find it hard to review funny books that are successful in, well, being funny. If someone sets out to write a funny book, and succeeds, then the result is, well, funny. David Sedaris is that. He's funny. Ok, I won't use that word anymore.As a person who reads about a book a week, I find it more and more rare the instance when I actually laugh out loud, or LOL as the people who like to use consecutive uppercase letters refer to it these days. This book made such an occurrence commonplace in the mere 270 pages of text offered here. Every page seemed to contain an L, many of them of the OL variety. Those fortunate enough to sit next to me on the train likely thought I was crazy. Serves them right.This is not a cover-to-cover book, but a collection of essays presumably written by Sedaris over some set of years. While I generally tend to avoid essay collaborations due to their non-linear nature and the about face you need to perform in ending one and picking up the next, Sedaris pulls it off by being so entertaining. Each story occupies 5-15 pages of text, often times packed with pearls and/or nuggets of entertaining wordplay. The only downside is that, again, there is no groove. If you know, going into it, this is the way the book is going to read, you can better approach it by reading it in 5-15 minute intervals.Overall, that's about it. Sedaris is a gay man with a low IQ (his words) who writes hilarious stories about living in New York or living in France or trying to learn French. These sardonic slices of life, rife with peculiar observations Sedaris crafts with interesting word choices, keep you interested page after page. While probably a little bit over the top at times - possibly intentional, you can get away with it when you're this ffffff...no, I promised not to say it anymore.Overall, this is a book many people (who aren't homophobic) should enjoy. Some of the stories will be more pertinent to those familiar with New York, but it can be enjoyed by just about anyone. I highly recommend the read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the funniest book I have ever read! Its almost as much fun to watch other people read it because everyone (with a sense of humor) laughs out loud! He is a GREAT writer. I read most of his other books and this one was the best! People who didn't like this book have NO SENSE OF HUMOR! David Sedaris is hillarious! My favorite part was when he was a student being pulled out of class for speech therapy, and all the clever ways he found to avoid saying words with the letter s. Hysterical! EVERY teacher, especially speech therapists, must read it! 10 STARS!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"As usual, David Sedaris has written a collection of personal essays that are downright hilarious. I read this book cover to cover last night and am still laughing the next day any time I think about it. The first part of the book features essays dealing with his childhood experiences and his colorful, occasionally dysfunctional family (if you haven't, also read Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim for more on the Sedaris family--especially his gruff, often belligerent and always foulmouthed brother). The second part covers the author's early visits to and life in France--his borderline sadistic French teacher, the joy of watching American movies in Paris, and (the best essay in the book) riding the metro with American tourists.All in all, this is a great book that will put you in a good mood and keep you laughing."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was recommended by a friend who reads absolutely everything and he said it was the funniest collection of stories he has ever read. NO KIDDING. I'm still laughing especially about the tale of the turd in the toilet at a fancy garden party.David Sedaris deserves all the praise he's been given. He's a brilliant writer and I can't recommend his work highly enough. Can't wait to read the rest of them."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris has a real gift for language. Although according to the book, that langauge is decidedly not french.The tales that comprise the first half of the book relate his childhood and family - they're the sort of absurd family everyone has but never really talks about. They're an odd bunch, and Sedaris truly manages to make them seem larger-than-life even though you know deep-down they're no stranger than anyone else's clan. Particularly howl-inducing is the story of his youngest brother, who has mystifyingly deisgnated himself &quot;the Rooster&quot; and is about as far at-odds with the rest of the family as could possibly be. And yet, between the Rooster's foul language and rough manners, the sense of kinship between him and the clan's detatched patriarch si definitley conveyed in a heartfelt and stupifyingly funny manner.Also notable is the vignette &quot;12 Moments in the Life of the Artist&quot; which self-deprecatingly plays on Sedaris's own artistic pretension and relates his daliances with art school, sculpting, methamphetamines and most terrifyingly conceptual and performance art. An absolutely brilliant piece, he manages to skewer the whole performance art movement as well as his own silly notions of the artist lifestyle in one fell swoop.The second half of the book details his life in France and his struggles with the language. While slightly less emotionally attached than the first half of the book, it is often even funnier, with the ridiculous mangling of the french langauge, the odd things he learns to say (he studies medical french for fun), the aggressive and verbally abusive french teacher, and the difficulties with noun gender.I've read this book a dozen times already and never does it fail to send me into fits. Definitely one of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A friend recently lent me this book. I was delighted that he did so. I've heard of Mr. Sedaris, but, for some reason, never seemed to get around to reading his book. Having read the works of his contemporaries such as Michael Thomas Ford, Joel Perry and Bob Smith. Only Joel Perry rates as being funnier, but David Sedaris has certainly led a more interesting life.I don't know if the title stems from his attempts to overcome a childhood lisp, or his attempts to learn French, either of which are pretty funny. Mr. Sedaris' string of unusual jobs, performance art pieces, drug experiences and time in France with his boyfriend are all priceless and unique stories. Listening to an international French class attempting to explain Easter to a Muslim student is priceless, and leads to a flashback to his Greek Orthodox upbringing and memories of holidays falling later than their Catholic equivelent. Something that had frustrated me throughout my childhood.Unlike the other authors mentioned above, very little of the book is actually gay. It just goes to show you gay men can have a life outside their sexuality."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I am in highschool, and after an essay I wrote a teacher said i had the same writing style as David Sedaris. After browsing for hours in a bookstore(like I do every weekend), I came across the book. The title page was enough to bring me in. I had no idea what the book would be about, but i absolutly had to read it.I was suprised at how funny it was. I started passing around the book showing my friends. Some of his characters even reminded me of my friends. I think overall the favorite chapter was, \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster\\". The way he portrays his brother is hilarious.Dont be suprised if your absolutly drawn in by this book. Highschoolers love it, my teacher recommends it, and even my parents got laughs out of it. The book is so painstakingly true to life, anyone can relate.I think my teacher gave me the best compliment anyone ever could. David Sedaris is one of the best writers out there. We read a couple chapters over lunch- I wouldnt advise that unless you have got some napkins handy."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'll make it very short and sweet.This is his best book so far. If you never read his work start with this one (Although 'santaland diaries' from Barrel Fever is one of the funniest thing I've read)."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"By far the funniest novel I have ever enjoyed. Sedaris turns our everyday occurrences into side-splitting laughter. I remember reading this book in a quiet setting and by time I was a chapter in people around me were staring because I could not contain myself. Sedaris delivers comedy in a simplistic style. Buy this book! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was hilarious---It's one of the first books that made me laugh out loud...at times crying from laughing so hard.This guy is hilarious--it made me go out and buy all of his books, I told everyone I know to get this book--it's a great book for a crummy day too!!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read so many great reviews for this book, and I love his sister, Amy Sedaris, so I thought... why not? I'll try it. I am usually one to love autobiographical stories, but I was slightly surprised when I read this book. I will say I enjoyed reading through it, but there were certain situations he was in (a story about public transportation in France where an American couple is making fun of David and his boyfriend... thinking that because they are in France, they are the only ones who speak English... I loved the scenario, but I was rooting for David to make a witty comeback to the couple... and he never did. Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed.) My favorite stories are about him teaching an English class and requiring students to watch soap operas... oh! and also the few that are about David learning French-hilarious!This book is very quirky. I liked it, I wish I loved it because the writing is very fun to read, but some of the short stories needed a little \\"umph\\" to 'em. If you enjoy reading short vignettes that are sometimes excruciating awkward... this is definitely the book for you. I would not say it was \\"laugh out loud\\" funny (and there are many books that are just that), but it was worth the time reading."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"When David Sedaris is in top form, there is nobody funnier. I think this is his best collection of all - hardly a dud story in the bunch. The \\"rabbit of easter\\" story, detailing hilarious misunderstandings in his French class, can make me howl just remembering it.A very funny writer, at the top of his game. The only thing funnier than reading this book is to hear Sedaris read the stories on tape."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Hearing Sedaris read his own work-Me Talk Pretty One Day-has caused me to appear like a laughing lunatic in my car, alone, as I drive to work. While I understand why his extremely dry and sarcastic take on the world might not appeal to everyone, if you find every day life a great combination of unbelievable, tragic and really funny, you will love this guy. Although I read this book several years ago and loved it, someone suggested I listen to the CD as it features Sedaris reading his own work, with the emphasis and pauses where he meant them to be. His voice itself is funny, too. If you aren't sure about buying the CD (or book) I suggest going to the website for NPR, (National Public Radio), searching the archives for him and listening to one or two pieces for free. You will be hooked. I love, love, love the pieces where he is in France with his lover Hugh, because he is very honest about being an outsider. The stuff about his family-well, if it is half-true, I'm glad he can earn a living after that crazy upbringing. There are some bonus pieces he reads to a live audience that aren't in the book, I think. I am a huge fan, and as a New York City resident, may appreciate some of his city-based stories about him starting out here more than others. Sedaris' voice creates an intimacy with the listener. I am buying this for a really sick relative who has a wicked sense of humor, because it is so funny that it could serve as medicine."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I loved this book. It was funny, smart, interesting and easy to read. This guy's mind is twisted in all kinds of weird ways, but it makes for entertaining reading. The book slows down a bit when he describes his French lessons, he goes into too much detail, but the details are funny so it's not too bad.I definitely recommend the book - it's fabulous!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"2 coworkers recommended this book to me. and i just passed it to another coworker after finishing it. This man is hysterical. I read this book every day on the train and laughed out loud. I've never laughed from reading before. People looked at me funny lol. I loved it and getting more books by him. He talks about everything from growing up with his crazy family, to having funny pet stories, to school experiences, riding the subway, and of course a turd story."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I discovered this book over someone's shoulder on the subway, and after just a few pages I knew I had to buy it. It's clever and witty, but there's enough substance to each anecdote that you don't suffocate from laughter."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I bought this book several years ago on a whim. I was about to board an international flight and was at the airport bookstore with limited time. The title looked interesting, so I tried it. I have since read it two more times. It makes me laugh out loud every time! The Rooster story made me double over with laughter. I can hear his brother's voice in my head. My husband kept looking at me during our flight like I was nuts. I also enjoyed the language breakdowns in his french class. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The public was duped into thinking that this would be a book that someone would like to read. NOT SO! Yes, it was on the best-seller list, so we bought it. Bad idea. Two people in our household attempted to understand this tripe without success. The book is now resting where it belongs--in the recycle pile headed to the county dump. The number 1 rating is much too high."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"It's simply a long-haul airplane book. I quite did not understand the eulogies from other readers."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I found this book a struggle to get through. It had nothing substantial in it to hold one's interest. I wish I had been warned before commiting myself to reading it. Torture......Boring......I'm glad its over.......Never Again!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Like most Amazon reviews this will say more about me than the book, so it goes.As a certified bibliophile, regularly trading volumes in at the local used store, I was surprised to find myself dropping this one right into the trash. My usual reverence for books melted under the withering contempt expressed by David Sedaris for himself and many others who grace the pages of the book.Presenting itself as a funny honest book about life, it manages to tell an impressive number of lies about the lives of artists and especially gays. Do not presume I am unaware of the first-hand experience of Mr. Sedaris in these matters, but this only makes his sloppy handling the more shameful.The family stories are sometimes mildly amusing, but more often cruel and saddening without any special redeeming qualities. For this reader, he fails to establish any sort of sympathy for the narrator. As a result, his tales of errors upon errors merely serve to more firmly root him in the cateogory of total loser. The kind you want to avoid lest it rub off.The nonlinear and jumpy nature of the book, serves only to increase the perceived disinterest in the people and situations discussed.In short, equal parts fluff, cruelty, and misinformation deflate any possible laughter I might have otherwise experienced, and cause me to file this book in the trash, lest someone else suffer the injury of its prose."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Based on the reviews of this book, and reviews I have read on other books recommending this particular book, I was really expecting it to be incredibly funny. There wasn't a single thing I found funny in this book. Not even a chuckle. I kept reading expecting for it to possibly pick up, after 100+ pages I realized no such luck. I began to just skim the book, because after all I paid for it. This book had NO point at all. It just sort of rambled on about nothing. Sedaris is SO not funny. The writing is flat. I would not recommend this book to anyone and if I could give it 0 stars, I would. Its not worth the paper its printed on. I am still annoyed I spent money on this, everyone that bought it deserves a refund."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was ready to buy this until I saw that the Kindle edition was $9.99 while the paperback copy was $8.02. No sale."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Too sarcastic for me! Hearing him read it was worse. He does sound like a little whimpy girl. Some parts were hillarious, but overall I didn't like it and wouldn't recommend it as a book club discussion book, or for the squeamish."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'm a fairly tolerant reader, but I threw this book into the trash after finishing 2/3rds. Truly awful--sophomoric, dull, and pretentious...My book club selected it based on one member's recommendation--the others hated it so much that we only talked about the book for three minutes--that was as long as we could be polite."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I had this recommended to me as laugh out loud funny. However I only got a few smiles throughout. It just wasn't that funny. The stories had a lot of potential, but the writing wasn't that good, and didn't make the most of potentially funny material. Skip this one."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Having enjoyed the humor of Molly Ivins, P J O'Rourke, Dan Jenkins, and Larry McMurtry.... not to mention George Carlin and Steve Wright.... I kept waiting for the laughs to begin. Imagine my surprize when the book ended (thank God) without as much as a chuckle. Oh well..... can't win them all. Anyone need a slightly used book..... can't pass it along to my friends either."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Great book...read it on a vacation, and it had me laughing out loud (very, very loud) on the airplane both ways. Definitely worth picking up!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is awesome! I can't wait to read the rest of David Sedaris's books."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I've read all of Sedaris's books now, and this is by far his best effort to date! Well worth the money!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Well, this was just great! Each one of these essays was fabulous -- funny, witty, wry, and quirky. Sedaris's perspective is unique, and he has a way of taking the most mundane events (going out to dinner with his father, say) and making them seem like epic stories full of meaning and insights into the plight of humanity, and yet taking the most seemingly romantic situations (like moving to Paris) and grounding them satisfyingly in the mundane.Plus he's freakin' hilarious.I think my favorite essays were the ones in part two that dealt with his attempts to learn French. He turns culture clash into comedy gold! (&quot;'I hate you,' [the French teacher] said to me one afternoon. Her English was flawless. 'I really, really hate you.' Call me sensitive, but I couldn't help but take it personally.&quot;) Hee! How can you not love this guy?"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"By far the funniest book I've ever come across, although Naked is pretty hysterical also. No, &quot;Me Talk&quot; is not some great piece of literature, but it's worth every cent and then some. The comic scenes and Sedaris's telling of them is masterful and genius. Without a doubt this is one book everyone should read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the first David Sedaris book I've read, and now I plan to read them all! There were a few stories that made me laugh out loud like &quot;You Can't Kil te Rooster&quot; and &quot;A Shiner Like a Diamond&quot;. The other stories were very entertaining and witty. It's an excellent light read, and I highly recommend it!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is hilarious. All of his essays made me laugh out loud, getting a few strange looks from my family. From lisp problems, to learning french, and being thought of as a pick pocketer, you will love this book!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"After reading this novel, I now wonder what Sedaris has left to write about. He has covered his family - through funny quips, anecdotes, and sidebars, throughout the rest of his novels, and continues on in this book. Although it was the typical amusing/fast read of a Sedaris, I perhaps was looking for something new or more by this point in his career. On the other hand, I couldn't rate it lower than 4 stars, being after all the amusing/fast read that I wanted/expected in the first place."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris does it again. From tales of learning French to some surprisingly poignant pieces, Sedaris's newest book is filled with the same funny, often venomous assaults on the masses. It's not as good as Barrel Fever, but it's still funnier than anything else out there."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I love David Sedaris's writing and performances, So I couldn't wait to read this book. And I wasn't disappointed -- it's laugh-out-loud funny. But I *was* puzzled. The first half and the second half are two entirely different books. I found myself wondering if Sedaris had simply glued together two unrelated pieces so he could make deadline, or capitalize on his success, or just get the book done already. Hmmm. Well, both halves are fun and funny, so the book as a whole is a good read. But I wish Sedaris had taken his time and fleshed out both essays so we could have two books instead of one."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"best comedic book ever written. Sedaris has the way with words. a total laugh out loud, wipe tears from your eyes memoir. a definite worth of $10 or however much you pay.a MUST BUY!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This isn't a book about a murdered museum curator-- but then again it never claims to be. I borrowed this book from a friend before he had a chance to read it, and he asked me to let him know how it was. I told him the book got a B+, because while it virtually has no plot, Sedaris is witty enough just recalling details of his life to make me laugh out loud.I read this not knowing anything about the author or the book, and only realized it was auto-biographical after I started reading it. He has basically constructed a novel out of different themed chapters, all focusing on some odd perspective about a different time in his life. My favorite was when he talked about his sister Amy, that chapter made me giggle to myself for the rest of the day.I found that this book was the *perfect* book to take to the gym and read during my cardio workout. 1) It has no complex, deeply woven plot that you have to concentrate intently on, so you can cruise along reading while running in place 2) It is written well enough to hold your attention and 3) It is funny enough to make you concentrate on that instead of running in place.If that is a good analogy for how you like your books, then here ya go."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"What makes the work itself so intriguing is its affinity for authenticity. His first essay details the ridiculous obsessions of his father with hiding and eating rotted food as if it were his life treasure. In all of his essays, there remains something original or personal from the author's life and it is far from boring or long, but simply witty and astounding.David Sedaris, the character, is the focus of the book - as he explains in great detail the most memorable episodes of his life, whether it is embarrassing, funny, absurd, or deeply personal. It remains clear throughout the entire book Sedaris examines moments, events, and language as though he was a shrink. A lot of writers fail due to their inability to recognize their own bias, but where other writers fail - Sedaris is successful. He recognizes his personal bias in numerous stories, and surprisingly makes a mockery, or perhaps a joke, out of it. Take for instance, his seemingly shrewd personal indictment of the ever-growing technological era of computers. \\"I hate computers for any number of reasons, but I despise them most for what they've done to my friend the typewriter. In a democratic country you'd think there would be room for both of them, but computers won't rest until I'm making my ribbons from torn shirts and brewing Wite-Out in my bathtub. Their goal is to place the IBM Selectric II beside the feather quill and chisel in the museum of antiquated writing implements. They're power hungry, and someone needs to stop them.\\" The reason why David Sedaris, the character, works so well in the book is because of his flat-out honesty on any number of subjects and issues. He also has an extraordinary sense of self-awareness most do not possess, or at least are less than eager to broadcast it.He weaves in and out of his own personal life, writing about the misfortunate (and comical) habits of his sister, Amy, who has always took a liking to \`fatty suits' and mind-games. She has had a field day masterminding such stunts as disguising herself as a victim of physical abuse, masking her identity to flirt with her father, and stealing money from an unguarded till at a grocery story and then simply explaining that \\"she wasn't stealing, she was simply pretending to be a thief. \`And thieves steal,' she said. \`So that's what I was doing.' It all made perfect sense to her.\\" Amy appears in several of the essays, each time with an unusual story and same role.Comedic short-story essay books are generally at a great disadvantage because they lack what non-fiction books have to offer - which is an education. They are at another disadvantage because they lack what fiction has to offer - a world filled with what the author desires, whether it is a representation of reality, fantasy, horror, or a mixture of everything in between. Instead, David Sedaris has defied the expectations and proved that essays can be as equally effective and compelling as historical accounts of world or national events.David Sedaris writes hilariously of being offered a position as a college professor: \\"The position was offered at the last minute, when the scheduled professor found a better-paying job delivering pizza. ...In a voice reflecting doubt, fear, and an unmistakable desire to be loved, I sounded not like a thoughtful college professor but, rather, like a high-strung twelve-year old girl; someone named Brittany. My first semester I had only nine students. Hoping they might view me as professional and well prepared, I arrived bearing name tags fashioned in the shape of maple leaves. I'd cut them myself out of orange construction paper and handed them out along with a box of straight pins. My fourth-grade teacher had done the same thing, explaining that we were to take only one pin per person. This being college rather than elementary school, I encouraged my students to take as many pins as they liked. They wrote their names upon their leaves, fastened them to their breast pockets, and bellied up to the long oak table that served as our communal desk.\\" He then talks about his empty brief case and fantasizes about a class full of enthusiastic students, struggling to maintain order while students simultaneously shouted to be heard. This is only a small glimpse into Sedaris' larger insights and analysis of the human condition.Sedaris has managed to convert ordinary happenings from one's life to incredibly comical vignettes worth discussing. His linguistic tongue most closely resembles a sharp and oddball Woody Allen for his clever ability to make situations funnier than they normally would be and his over-the-top affair with words. In creating something more valuable than a simple comedic story-telling book, he has both educated and entertained us with his personal experiences and observations of the world. Hats off to David Sedaris, whose contribution to the literary world make us all the more grateful for his endless campaign to keep us thinking, and reading."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"If you have never read David Sedaris or heard him read portions of his books on David Letterman then you need to pick up one of his books and treat yourself. I have not read one of his books and not laughed hysterically. I also recommend any book by his sister, Amy Sedaris (I constantly wonder what Thanksgiving dinner is like at their house!)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is David Sedaris' very funny look at himself through both his family and his time in France. The good news that his sister's comedy, Strangers with Candy, is coming out on DVD made me pick this book up again and remember all over what a truly Talented Family this is (and Amy's appearances in David's essays are amongst the funniest sections, outside of the David learning French, of course). These essays seem fresh on second and third helpings. Since the first time I read this I have finally heard many of them on NPR and now can read them with the author's rather distinctive voice in my head. Now my brain is, sadly, changing all commerical jingles into rather nasally, high-pitched Billie Holliday-emoting songs. That may not be a blessing but this book is and will always be."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have lived in France, struggled with the language, and had about David's luck learning it. I was in intense pain from laughing SO hard during the stories on being in France, especially the part where the French students with limited vocabularies attempt to explain Easter. I had to put it down pretty much every paragraph to recover physically.Yes, buy it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is a terrifically funny collection of stories. David Sedaris is an amazing writer. I can't wait for another book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I honestly thought this was the funniest book that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris is a master of the short story / essay. Get everything he writes."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Love David Sedaris, but this effort isn't as consistently funny as his previous pieces. At times he tends to go off on these self-indulgent tangents that I found pretty boring. Overall I still think he's genius."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I loved it! It was impossible to put down. I laughed until I cried."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'd heard a lot of good things about Sedaris. As a humor columnist myself, I thought I could learn a thing or two from the guy. And I did, but only by learning from his mistakes. I'm sure it was funny to a lot of people, but as a straight male, I had a hard time relating to his experiences. There were definitely moments where I laughed, but his attempts at being personal were lost on me."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris is a talented writer; he has good sentence structure and uses creative analogies to bring across his humor. Although I am impressed by his ability to be funny in writing, I wasn't at all tempted to laugh out loud (as other review writer have said). It's not THAT funny.What I find disappointing about the book is not the writing itself, but the writer and the content. His life is not all that different from the average American. Yes, his experiences in France are beyond that of what most of us accomplish in our lives, but then just write about France and leave out the whole childhood bit; it's no more interesting than anyone else's."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"To say I was horribly dissappointed would be an understatement. I bought this book because I am interested in moving to France to study. That and it came REALLY highly recommended.I honestly don't know what other reviewers are talking about. See, I think this is like 2 books in one.In the first part he talks about his family and his childhood. Really I think this book should give some sort of warning. Something like...............warning: extreme use of offensive language. This guy swore all over the place. It really didn't contribute all that much -- it just felt like sweraring for the sake of swearing. I didn't find the first part funny AT ALL I felt sorry for him and his family. It was terrible.The second part of the book was MUCH better. I would give that 2.5 stars. This is the part where he talks about moving to France. Although, even then I will admit that certain chapters could be boring as well -- like the one where he talks about going to see movies in Paris.Point is I really didn't enjoy this book. If you are looking book full of funny anecdotes about France -- buy A YEAR IN PROVENCE. Save your money and spend it elsewhere!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is a compilation of about 200 Andy Rooney-esque 60 Minutes essays, just that Andy Rooney is funnier and more interesting.There is no story here, just the author ranting and raving about his life, which to me, doesn't make a book interesting or enjoyable. I didn't know this book would be like this going into it.I can complain about my own life. Why should we care about Sedarris complaining about his? Amusing, but once you are done, it will leave you mind forever.Everyone else loved it, just not me."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read this book for my local bookclub, and I must say that if I had never read it in my lifetime, I don't think I ever would have missed it. However, the essays were written well and most were funny. I would be interested in reading a full-fledged novel if David Sedaris ever chose to write one.Me Talk Pretty One Day is a book of autobiographical essays that tell the story of the author's childhood and the strange behavior of his parents in relation to jazz, food, dogs and so on. Other essays talk about the many jobs taken on by Sedaris, the move to Paris with his boyfriend, Hugh, and his life living in a foreign country. I laughed most of the time; however, the mediocre essays far outweighed the fabulous ones. My favorites are Go Carolina, You Can't Kill the Rooster, The Youth in Asia, Big Boy, The Last Show, and I'll Eat What He's Wearing. All the others had humor in them, but fell short of my own knee-slapping expectations.Of course, this is just one opinion and mine may not be of the popular variety. I am just the type of reader that enjoys novels more than short stories (or essays) and therefore did not find Me Talk Pretty One Day to be particularly fascinating. I don't regret reading it, but the hype was too much for me. Mr. Sedaris, call me when you have a novel out -- I'll be the first in line."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The book is compromised of a series of essays about his life but I didn't think David Sedaris got his point across in this book. Or if he did, it flew right over my head. The stories were cute and funny but not at all moving like I was told they would be. A book that would be enjoyed by those that enjoy a book filled with short stories/essays."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read this book because it was our book club pick. Memoirs (or \\"me-mores\\") are not my genre choice, but I went into it with an open mind. I found Sedaris to be a skilled writer, but I think he told us more than we wanted to know about his sexual proclivities and drug use. I think it takes some courage to subject one's life and one's dysfunctional family to readers' scrutiny, but I very soon tired of his repetitive antecdotes. The members of our book club who had seen him in person or heard him on NPR were much more enthralled than those of us who \\"got to know him\\" through his writing. After reading the book, I would never see him in person and certainly wouldn't read another book by him. There are too many good books to waste my time with this author."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I ordered this book, as well as &quot;Naked&quot; because they were recommended for people who enjoyed David Egger's &quot;Heartbreaking work of Staggering Genius.&quot; I am not sure who decides on those recommendations, but boy were they wrong. I was unable to finish either Sedaris book, as they were boring, bland and just plain unfunny. Egger's book was introspective, fresh, and drew the reader in and made you care about what happened next, not to mention hilariously funny at times. Both of Sedaris' books do little to make you interested in the characters at all and the humor they try to employ wasn't funny when the same jokes were made ten times before Sedaris made them. If you enjoy comedy like recent years of SNL, then maybe you'll like this book. But if you find that kind of humor boring and redundant, then don't waste your money (like I did)."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My book club chose this book for our upcoming selection. A friend in the club and I have come to the same conclusion: we cannot finish this book. We have both read chapter after chapter, waiting for the book to be other than mildly amusing and somewhat boring, but we never got to any part that hooked us into the book. The author seems to think he is hilarious, in a rather self-consious manner, and his whole tone seems to proclaim, &quot;aren't I just so clever&quot;; apparently many people agree with him. I seemed to miss everyone's boat here, because I found the book so boring that I could not go on anymore."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is a funny man. But he's not the &quot;funniest man in America&quot; as he has often been billed during his recent speaking tour.&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is humorous, but not &quot;laugh-out-loud funny.&quot;The majority of problems are with the stories dealing with his family. His family members are indeed quirky, but the stories he tells are you-had-to-be-there stories. I think my siblings and parents are hilarious too, but I'm humble enough to realize that anyone who didn't grow up in our household does not find our childhood anecdotes nearly as amusing as those of us who were there.This book improves during part &quot;deux,&quot; wherein Sedaris sticks for the most part to describing his experiences as an American living in France. It is in these stories/essays that Sedaris's true gift shines through: he has quite a talent for pointing out the absurd in society. Yet, entertaining as they were, not even these stories are ones I would consider &quot;laugh-out-loud funny.&quot; I suppose I would have liked this book better had the blurbs from reviews featured on the cover not oversold Sedaris's comedic talents.All in all, this book is entertaining when Sedaris is shining a light on society's foibles. When he turns that light on himself and his own neuroses, things begin to wear thin; and when he begins to speak of his family, the book is unremarkable at best, and, more often than not, completely unentertaining.Again, I probably would have liked it better had my expectations not been set so high.&quot;River Teeth&quot; by David James Duncan is in this same vein, but much, much better.If you just want to laugh, anything by Dave Barry is sure to hit the spot."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Firstly, let me state that I did NOT finish this book. The reason being is that after reading all the hype surrounding this book, I had high expectations of the humour and writing.....and after trying to read around 4-5 chapters, I found myself not agreeing with the hype. Maybe if all the chapters had flowed as one continuous story it may have held my attention more. I just couldn't get into the whole story despite desperately wanting to enjoy this. And I didn't find it as funny as everyone else had spoken about, so this compounded my exasperation with this book. Maybe I will come back to it another time, when really desperate."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"If you enjoy quirky, crazy humor, David Sedaris is the master. Be careful about reading his books in public, though -- people will look at you funny when you are sitting alone and laughing!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Buy this book. David Sadaris is incredible! This book is really a collection of anecdotes written by a man who is tentaively going to say what he thinks. And he does so in such a hilarious way that you will quake with laughter. The best part of the book is when he talks about his experiences in Paris. It is really funny. And Sadaris has the uncanny ability to make you feel what he is going through. Another highlight of this book is that he gives a totally new view of things. He attackscomputers and modern life. But in a way that we can all understand with total sympathy. This is really a great book. Buy it as soon as possible and enjoy."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"First let me say that the first chapter was hilarious. AFter that, it slows down rapidly. I think the reason is that the author is so obsessed with his own homosexuality and he loses a large base of his audience, at least me.When he speaks of his childhood and his famly, he's hilarious. His dad is a wonderful, colorful character that David completely doesn't understand. His mom, a foul mouth, but nothing compared to his brother. But in the midst of it, you could hear Sedaris saying,\\"Oh, by the way, I'm a homosexual.\\"\\"Did I tell you yet, that I'm a homosexual?\\"\\"Don't forget, I am a homosexual.\\"\\"I have a boyfriend. Because I'm a homosexual.\\"\\"This is life through the lens of homosexuality.\\"\\"It's been a while so let me remind you...\\"And I couldn't help saying, \\"Yes David, I know what you are.\\" After he moves with his boyfriend to Paris, I gave up and skipped until I found chapters about dad again. The senior Sedaris is the breakout star of this book, followed by his great dane.But next time you're at the library, read the first chapter, because it is hilarious, and then... maybe find something else to read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Perhaps I bought this book at the wrong time or at least with the wrong impression; while this collection of essays did leave several smirks, there wasn't much in the way of the howlingly funny, gutbusting hilarity, wacky hi-jinks that people keep reviewing about.While it was interesting to divide the book in half according to setting/stage of his life, the material rages back and forth without much in the way of structure to keep the reader interested. Self-deprecating? You betcha. Motivated? Oh mais oui. Entertaining? Sure, but what's the purpose?The family portraits he presents only confuse me. Are we to be sympathetic to David because his foul-mouthed brother shares a dialouge with his father that he himself could not have? Are we supposed to feel smug and superior for David because of this? Why is a sister who wants to constantly disguise herself in the name of subversive humour be portrayed in a &quot;Gosh, that nutty sister. What will she think of next to challenge the boundaries of physical comedy?&quot; manner.Too many passages seem to relate a story whereby David suffers a character assassination from someone he doesn't even know, yet instead of defending himself, he presents himself as someone who shouldn't even bother.Why is it that Sedaris damns the local hick culture yet talks for three pages in disgusting detail about a bowel movement he finds in a toilet? Sure, the social taboos we hold in place are then brought to the front to be examined, but by the end, I wish he hadn't even bothered.Overall the book leaves me not with a better understanding of the author, but rather a feeling like not wanting to spend too much time trapped in a crowded subway train with him. I know this sounds like a huge personal criticism of Sedaris, yet its not intended to be. Rather the book just confuses more than it entertains. I can relate to feeling disjointed in school but otherwise there are just too many loose ends in the book for my taste.Perhaps I need to read more of his work to get a better grounding of his style and mannerisms, but for the most part, I'm more content to think about my own farcical attempts at the French language than hear about his."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This just isn't my preferred reading. I read alot of genres this just doesn't float my boat. I couldn't get past chapter 4. I never put down books always finish, however, this would have been pointless to finish as there was no ending."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"As someone who experienced big belly laughs with Naked and Barrel Fever, I anxiously awaited the release of MTPOD.Outrageously insane insights and POV. Interesting characters. The problem with MTPOD...the stories are simply not that funny. A handful of laughs, one or two chuckles.My recommendation...reread Naked."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I don't know what it was, but through the whole book I couldn't shake the feeling that David Sedaris has no soul. Perhaps that is unfair; but it is not unfair to say his book is a soulless, vapid, trite, tired collection of essays with lame titles like \\"The Youth in Asia.\\" Har har. I feel like every decent joke was something I'd heard or read somewhere else. No one's suing Sedaris for plagiarism? Where's the justice? I gave this three stars mostly because it was such a quick read that there wasn't enough time for me to get annoyed with it. I think I laughed a couple times. Not terrible for 272 pages."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This has five stars on the list of books not to read... While most reviews I read said this book would be funny and interesting, I rarely laughed. I would not have finished this book had it not been a school read. I was planning on reading a clean novel, but I instead received a book full of sexual references and substance abuse. Along with the crude language, I felt like it was a waste of my time and money."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Wonderful! So funny. I was laughing out loud at so many of his stories, and a lot of them reminded me of people I knew or had seen before. It was a great book"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris is hilarious, and this is his best book. The \\"Rooster\\" chapter is so funny that I couldn't read it out loud to my husband because I was almost choking from laughing so hard."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I loved this book... it got me started reading david sedaris and amy sedaris. I even saw him at a live reading and it was fantastic!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A wonderful collection of short stories from the author's life told in a way that is almost magical. If a reader is framiliar with the authors public radio appearances and/or his sister Amy's work (Strangers With Candy, Late Night and Late Show guest, ...) this book will be even more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris has a voice like no other. His observations seem random but somehow produce compelling autobiography on its own idiosyncratic terms, even if it isn't a straight-through chronology of his life. This book moves quickly through signposts in his life, as he evolves from an effeminate boy with a lisp...to a guitar-strumming college dropout...to an aimless writing teacher in Chicago...to a self-proclaimed no-talent performance artist...to an American living abroad with his partner Hugh in France. What ties these different stages together is his constant sense of the absurd and an acute ability to include himself in that world, not as an observer but as someone who creates an existence that is simultaneously at odds with yet strangely compatible with the world around him. Sedaris seems as much an eccentric as everyone else in the book, especially compared to his family, even compared to his deliciously wacky sister Amy, but he still stands out as a character without alienating the reader, no mean feat. Sedaris does not use cheap sentiment, and I like how he takes me on his journeys no matter how bumpy.The second half of this book focuses on his adventures settling into the Gallic world, where his boyfriend owns an 18th century house in the French countryside. Sedaris does not take the easy way out by ridiculing the French but hilariously describes the quixotic nature of language barriers. The chapter, \\"Jesus Saves\\", is a great illustration of how he captures the quirkiness that befalls all sorts of international students trying to make sense of the French language on their terms by having everyone explain what Easter is.But I have to say my favorite section is earlier on when he discusses his succession of pets and the sadness he felt when someone brought up \\"euthanasia\\" for his aged cat Neil, in the aptly named chapter, \\"The Youth in Asia\\". Sedaris brings up a cherished memory for me by remembering \\"Fatty and Skinny\\", the Japanese movie that showed up periodically on Saturday mornings with Kukla, Fran and Ollie in the sixties. His vivid recollection of this movie completely embraces me, as his memories match mine completely, especially when Fatty climbs the pole to the cruel taunts of his schoolmates and then cries out his friend's name for forgiveness of his failure, \\"Komatsuuuuuuuuuu!\\". I had the privilege of meeting David Sedaris at a book signing this past summer where I could share this with him, and so in my copy of this book, he signed.... \\"Komatsuuuuuuuuuu!\\" How funny and dear this man is, and what a wonderful read this book is."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I saw Sedaris speak once at a college auditorium in my hometown. A hilarious afternoon of storytelling, for sure. Afterwards, he signed books. I bought a copy of &quot;Me Talk Pretty&quot; at the merchandise counter and got in line. When I finally stood face-to-face with the author, he asked me my name. He signed something in my book and I walked on. When I got outside, I opened the cover and read: &quot;To Jeff, with a $incere feeling&quot;. Awesome. Few writers can deliver prose that packs lol humor and biting drama. If you haven't read Sedaris, do so at once. If you have but haven't read &quot;Me Talk Pretty&quot; (his Parisian storybook), be sure to add it to your collection.Also, if you dig Sedaris, there's a new writer you should check out: Greg Ippolito. His new novel, &quot;Zero Station,&quot; is absolutely terrific, and an excerpt is available for FREE. He's still a relative unknown (a friend turned me onto his work)...but this is a must-read. You can check him out and read the excerpt at: www.ZERO-STATION.net. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was one of the funniest books that I have read in a very long time. Rarely does a book have me laughing outloud as this one did."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"If you think the written words of Mr. Sedaris are entertaing then invest in the audio version."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is so offbeat and funny.After purchasing this book, I read it cover to cover in one day. Refreshing change from the norm."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Crazy friends, nutty family... and a way of talking about them that will leave you laughing. The stories regarding French language lessons in France are especially funny. Even the Big Boy (turd) piece is a riot, though a bit gross. Not for everyone, but definitely for those whose sense of humor is a bit tweeked. Reminds me of two other books with a somewhat twisted sense of humor - \\"No One's Even Bleeding\\" and \\"Delano\\"."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I listened to this book on tape, read by the author. I really enjoyed his humor. Sedaris makes observations about his life and laughs at himself and his family. He doesn't take anything too seriously and is usually the subject of his own jokes.It was a treat listening to him, because he does accents and imitations quite well, but I think this book would be just as funny if I had read it.A good portion of the book focuses on his time in France. His tales of trying to learn and speak French are too funny.It is hard to explain why this book is so funny, but it definitely is."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Are you ready to read a book that is written as relaxed as you are reading it? David Sedaris's Me Talk Pretty One Day is one of the funniest true to life books I have ever read. This book takes you through David's dysfunctional childhood all the way up to his life in the present. The situations he encounters in life are written so beautifully that you feel like he is sitting next to you at a party and everyone is laughing around him. I started reading the first chapter, which is written about his eccentric father who loves his family but has problems expressing support for his weird children, next thing I know I'm on page 112 and hanging on his every word like it's juicy high school gossip. Reading further in the book you come to know that David Sedaris's inner thoughts remind you of the thoughts you giggle about to only to yourself. The life of David Sedaris you would think would be filled with happy childhood memories surrounded by scholarly achievements and lots of money. After putting the book down I forget sometimes this guy is the author of a National Best Seller and not a buddy of mine. You can find truth and humor in every one of his chapters as well as a story you can relate to. Using humor and a great writing technique Sedaris takes you to Paris where he has moved without knowing anything about the French language. He enrolls in a French class where he is instructed by a professor who takes her language a little too seriously. This chapter starts his many triumphs to win over the life of Parisian in a country that hates him. With his adventures changing in every chapter you never become bored with each insight he pulls you closer. Sedaris's descriptive storytelling style is the greatest I ever read and I'm not surprised I haven't heard of him sooner. When you think your life is crazy read a couple chapters and you can put that same funny twist on life and survive anything with a good sense of humor. The last chapter like the first is about his father, there you see his father may be strange but the respect he has for the man that wanted David to be happy and supported no matter what crazy dream he would follow. Finishing the book I reflected on the many different struggles David Sedaris lived through the most was drugs and the influence it had over his art and what he did to overcome his addiction. The end result impresses me the most; he has taken a troubled life and made it a funny learning experience that all can relate too.-Lee from Louisville"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read his books while on the treadmill at the gym .. and it can be dangerous! Laughing so hard I lose my balance! The funniest story is the one about his brother and language."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Funny, charming, and heartwarming. I laughed. I cried. It was better than Cats. Sedaris has been around and these stories are testament to the freakish family members and miserable jobs that are part of his life. I was cautioned by one trustworthy book-loaning friend of mine, &quot;It's just not that funny. He's not the same in print as on NPR.&quot; Well I say, &quot;To hell with that.&quot; The stories aren't all pee-in-your-pants-laugh-till-you-cry funny, but they do make me smile.Furthermore, Sedaris has a knack for setting a mood, even though it's mostly his own mood that we share. Buy it. Read it. I told you so."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I knew nothing of Sedaris when I picked this one up, it justlooked interesting. I laughed out loud from cover to cover.The New York stories nearly killed me, and the tangents hisimagination rides off on are scarily familiar and hilarious.One of the best books I've read in a long time. Sherman Alexie's work got me interested in the short story arena, and Sedaris showed me another side of it that was equally enticing.I promptly went out and read his other works and am looking forward to more."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is one of the funniest writers I've read in a long time. This was a great treat. The part about learning French had me rolling on the floor. This summer has been fun reading books like this. I also recommend &quot;Delano&quot; by John Orozco and &quot;Stupid White Men,&quot; by Michael Moore."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is deeply funny. You laugh loudly (nay! guffaw--with unappealing horse-like overtones if you're like me) when you read it, sure.But you laugh months or even years later because it was just so true and dead-on and so exquisitely phrased and also pleasantly perverse that you just can't forget it.His humor burrows its way (pardon the vaguely disturbing rodent metaphor here) into your psyche and you're funnier just for having read it. AT least, I think I am...."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I usually read about history or political science, but needing a break from it all I picked up Me Talk Pretty One Day. Anyway, it's a sure thing. Very witty and very funny."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"What a funny book! Sedaris has a way to entice the reader and hold their attention. He speaks of his childhood anf family life, joking about how disfunctional they were. Each chapter is another story from Sedaris's life from childhood to living in Paris. I laughed out loud the whole time. I would recommmend reading Naked. It's just as good."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read this book while I was stuck in my hotel room with a bad head cold and a baby with same while on a family ski trip. Although I missed the slopes, I had a great time! I could not put this book down. As the highschool reviewer wrote, the chapter about the Rooster is the best! In fact, it reminded me so much of my highschool days 20 years ago that I was in tears with laughter. David Sedaris is a brilliant writer with an amazing ability to communicate - you feel like you've met his parents, family, bosses....experienced his life from his eyes. Can't wait to get my hands on another of his books."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Last Christmas I was given, at my request, the David Sedaris boxed set. Eleven months later, I still listen to at least four stories a week. I adore him! He's wondrously, riotously funny, but he's more than that.Part of what makes him so attractive to me is that I too am from a Northern family that moved South when I was a kid, and like Sedaris I moved to France because of a relationship and without knowing more than a few words of the language. But Sedaris is so engaging a narrator that his readers can identify with even his more bizarre experiences/tendencies (e.g., cleaning the apartment of a sadomasochist, his inglorious career as a performance artist, his wish to buy a two-headed calf's skull for &quot;the price of a single-seater&quot;). His vision of the world is ultimately quite tender--this comes out especially in his stories about his mother--and he never laughs at anyone more than he laughs at himself.&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is a great introduction to his work, and I especially recommend the spoken version--his reading of his stories adds quite a lot to them. If the France thing particularly interests you, begin with &quot;See You Again Yesterday&quot; (live), &quot;Jesus Shaves&quot; (EXCELLENT closing line!), or &quot;Picka Pocketoni&quot; (every time I hear it I can't help but wonder if Martin from California realizes how his boneheadedness has been immortalized)."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"(...) I rarely buy a book when I do not know what it's about...but this was an impulse buy. I have never been so entertained with a book in my life!!!! Absolutely hilarious and intelligently sarcastic...my type of book! I now have tickets to hear him lecture and have already bought his other books, which i'm sure will be equally entertaining."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I can't add much that previous reviewers haven't already mentioned. I can say that this is a very funny and memorable read. Rarely do I laugh out loud at things I read but this one had me roaring. Especially \\"You Can't Kill The Rooster\\" - hilarious stuff. I'm withholding one star because the collection seems a bit uneven. It starts out strong but levels out towards the middle, eventually picking up some steam towards the end. The pieces become less slapstick and more speculative, concentrating on life abroad in the last section of the book. That's not a bad thing - it just makes the collection seem uneven.Everyone needs a good laugh, especially now. Read this. Soon."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'm not gay, and have never been to New York city, have only briefly visited France, never done speed. Despite the differences between my life and Sedaris's, I found so much to relate to in this book! The stupid things we do to fit in, the absurdity of our families, aggravation with ignorant or rude people... these are things all people can relate to. And Sedaris has a way of telling stories that just make you laugh out loud. I agree with the people that say you must hear him speak to fully appreciate it, though. Being able to put that effeminate, sarcastic, weary voice, and the phrasing and emphasis that Sedaris uses with these words definitely enhances the experience. Recommended to any and all!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Verry funny! I bought this book at the Seatac airport on my way to NYC...My first trip there since 'the disaster.' This book had me chuckling like a crazy women for 1000's of miles, taking the nervous edge off of my cross country flight (although i am not so sure how comforting this was for the stranger sitting next to me). I am now reading it a 2nd time, ordered 2 copies from Amazon for friends and the audio version for myself...I've also purchased all Sedaris' other books. So far this one is the funniest, but i adore them all. This guy is a hoot and he is smart. Highly recommend. ciao, Laurie in Alaska"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was my introduction to Sedaris' wry sense of humor, and I was not disappointed. I had never heard of David Sedaris before picking up this book. No radio shows, no earlier works, nothing. I found myself laughing aloud at the descriptions of family life, world travel, and especially, the essay about crossword puzzles.In spite of this, I give it four stars because I felt the subject matter was more suited to a narrative than a series of essays. There are essays in this book that are out-of-place, and this tends to alter the tempo of the book.Still, I highly recommend this book to fans and newbies alike."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"CAUTION: \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is one of the FUNNIEST books you'll EVER read. You'll laugh out loud until you're embarrassed. You'll roar at wisecracks so biting and mean that you'll feel guilty. And if you read a certain (in)famous chapter you'll howl with laughter, pretend you shouldn't have read it -- and read it again...and howl.. again.The acid-pen Sedaris shot to fame reading his humorous stories over National Public Radio (and he still insisted on cleaning houses for money). The book's first half has stories on various subjects (family, art class, teaching writing, working for tough bosses etc.). The second deals with his experiences in moving to France with his lover.Sedaris spares no one -- not his father, sister, teachers, artists or himself -- from his scapel-sharp, insight-filled humor. Some wisecracks are instant classics. When he tries tobecome an artist, dabbling in questionable performance art, he writes of artists: \\"Their artworks were known as \`pieces,' a phrase I enthusiastically embraced. \`Nice piece,' I'dsay. In my eagerness to please, I accidentally complimented chipped baseboards and sacks of laundry waiting to be taken to the cleaners. Anything might be a piece if you looked atit hard enough.\\"When a museum wants him to do some performance art it seemed \\"as though I should play hard to get, but after a moment or two of awkward silence, I agreed to do it for what I called \`political reasons.' I needed the money for drugs.\\"In a chapter detailing the lives and deaths of his various pets: \\"When my mother died and was cremated herself we worried that, acting on instinct, our father might run out andimmediately replace her.\\" When he's invited to teach: \\"I was clearly unqualified yet I accepted the job without hesitation, as it would allow me to wear a tie and go by the nameMr. Sedaris.\\" And what a sadistic French teach told him:\\"Every day spent with you is like having a cesarean section.\\"In his most innovative \\"piece,\\" a chapter called Big Boy, he describes his battle with (ahem) something he sees in a toilet. You'll roar while you read this short three page storyand hate yourself for reading it...and read it again. The book contains some adult language and adult situations. DESERVES MORE THAN FIVE STARS!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is simply the funniest book I have ever read. This auto-biographical look into the ironic and vigorously funny anecdotes of Sedaris's life offer the reader a bizzare sense of hope, and an invitation to take life less seriously. These are stories that make you cry with laughter and beg to be read aloud to friends. I can't imagine that David Sedaris is for everyone, however. This is not a book that I would gift to my grandparents or in-laws, but for an adventurous fun person with a decent sense of humor, &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; will certainly become a favorite."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A review in less than 1000 words... FANTASTIC!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I love David Sedaris on &quot;This American Life,&quot; but this book doesn't come up to quite the same standard. Sedaris's skewed version of deadpan is incredibly funny in small doses, but ironic self-involvement can wear a little thin over the length of a book. Also, the stories lose something on the page, compared to the radio. When you're listening to Sedaris's voice, the whole experience seems more intimate, as if you were listening to a friend. You lose that sense when you simply read his words, and sometimes you end up feeling, &quot;Why is this guy telling me all this?&quot;"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me talk pretty one day is one of those books everyone should have on their shelf. Sedaris tells the stories of a family of individuals who find ways to love each other despite their glaring differences. This is one of those rare books that makes you laugh each time you lose yourself among the pages. With each story told you find yourself reliving similar moments of your past and laughing. Me talk pretty is a book that you can open any time you feel down, read a few pages or plow through the whole book again, transforming the negative emotions into a happiness that seeps from your pours and coats your skin. This is a book you fall in love with from the first page and when you get to the end you find yourself turning back the pages and enjoying some of the stories again and again.The struggles of life that rub you like sandpaper, become less painful when you are wrapped in the tals of David Sadaris. If you are looking for free flowing humor Me Talk Pretty One Day is a book you should not only have your collection but keep close."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"When my friend lent me this book, I really needed some light reading. Returning from a week long trip of taking care of a terminally ill family member, getting bronchitis, and the trade center bombing, I needed some humor on my plane ride back home. Being sick, extremely tired, and nervous, I found myself laughing out loud on the plane, to the point where I thought the people around me might think I was going nuts...I finally had to confess the book was so funny.David Sedaris has a great way of picking out the small things in our lives and making them very funny. They are endearing, I very much enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is a wildly funny account of David Sedaris's life. The essays contained in the book recount different events - growing up in North Carolina, attempting to be an artist, struggling to find work, and eventually moving to Paris with his partner.In one of the funniest chapters, Sedaris writes about his first visit to France. Expecting exciting sites and fun shopping, he is taken to Normandy, where everyone stares at the odd Americans. Knowing only the word for &quot;bottleneck,&quot; he travels the countryside reciting the word.The beauty of this book is that experiences that could have been painful and heartwrenching are portrayed in such a humorous fashion. Not only can the reader get enjoyment in the book, but it encourages us to see the lighter side of the world around us. Very strongly recommended!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris' stories frequently are so funny that I laugh out loud, making those around to grow a little concerned. The author relates a story concerning speach therapy in school where he is &quot;treated&quot; for a lisp. Instead of being guided as intended, he uses a thesauris to find alternate words and resorts to stilted language to avoid the use of the letter &quot;S,&quot; (such as &quot;the pet of the teacher&quot;). Another hilarious story involves traveling on a Paris train along with American tourists who believe that no one on the train could possibly speak English. The tourists make derogatory comments about him and he mentally cuts them down. This book will certainly brighten your day and leave you hungry for other stories by Sedaris. I wish him a long life and many years of creativity ahead."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Really rare to read a book where you are constantly giggling out loud. I would read this book in public and draw stares because I couldnt stop myself from laughing out loud. Sedaris has an incredible Oscar Wilde wit only matched by his insight into the hilarity of our everyday lives. It is a fast read( in fact, I had to force myself to stop reading it, so I wouldnt finish it too quickly), and worth it! I am going to go back and read his other books now.."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I am a huge fan of David Sedaris and I loved this book. The essays in this collection are divided into two parts: One and Deux, covering the author's life in the U.S. and in France. Anybody who has studied a foreign language, at home or abroad will recognize some of Sedaris' struggles. One of my favorite essays is called &quot;Jesus Shaves&quot;, which describes an attempt by fellow foreign language students to describe Easter to a another student in French. Using their limited vocabulary, they manage: &quot;It is...a party for the little boy of God who call his self Jesus and...&quot; &quot;He call his self Jesus and then he be die one day on two...morsels of...lumber&quot;. Very enjoyable essays. They will cheer you up!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Good short stories from a talented writer. Only a few stories in the book were true page turners. I enjoyed the book for what it was but wouldn't read another book from Sedaris. He may be a best-seller but for me he doesn't quite fit."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Delightfully twisted collection of Sedaris' off-beat tales and observations. As most other reviewers have noted, you will laugh out loud again and again. The stories are quite brief though. I adored 'Barrel Fever' and 'Naked.' I was left somewhat disappointed only because I wanted more! (I highly recommend all three books, but BF is the best of the lot.) David Sedaris has a way of presenting the absurd much like his sister Amy, of 'Strangers with Candy' fame. Sedaris is like early John Waters - either you love it fanatically (as I do) or you don't get it at all.A word of caution...if you are sensitive to political correctness, are easily offended by left-leaning irreverence or scatological humor, or vote Republican, then this book is definitely not for you!FYI: You will NEVER think of Jodie Foster quite the same way again."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My sister recommended this book to me, after she warned me, \\"It's a bit warped, because I dropped it in the bathtub when I was laughing so hard\\"! ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY is a collection of David Sedaris' autobiographical short stories, which describe his childhood speech problems, his father's obsession with forming a jazz band with his progeny, his move to Paris with his boyfriend, and his attempts to master the art of speaking French while living in France.I've been looking for years for an heir to James Thurber -- someone whose mastery of observation excels at describing everyday incidents without stripping away their intrinsically bizarre nature. I'm pleased to find this heir in David Sedaris, whose short stories are nakedly honest and touchingly fresh. Sedaris shares things which most of us would not even write in our own private diaries, such as, \\"Because I am both a glutton and a masochist, my standard complaint, 'That was so bad,' is always followed by 'And there was so little of it!'\\"My favorite stories were \\"Jesus Shaves\\", in which Sedaris attempts to explain American Easter holiday traditions in broken French to many foreign students (and one sadistic teacher) in his French class, and \\"Giant Dreams, Midget Abilities\\", in which Sedaris takes guitar lessons from a midget as part of his father's dream of creating a family jazz band.If you love humor that's as sublime as it is surreal, you'll love ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY. Sedaris and his book may be \\"a bit warped,\\" but it just doesn't get any better than this!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The title of this book had me thinking &quot;What could this be?&quot; Having missed Naked and Sedaris' NPR stints, I had no idea what was in store for me. What a treat this book was - many times, I laughed so hard that tears came streaming down my face. &quot;Can't Kill the Rooster&quot;, and &quot;Jesus Shaves&quot; were the two chapters that had me gasping for air. Sedaris' wit is genius - and this sick, wonderful look at life through the eyes of one bizarre guy is near perfect. Only problem was - it was so deliciously funny that I read it way too fast.Reminded me just a little of Bridget Jones. If you have an open mind and a slightly warped sense of humor, get this one. Just don't read it on a train!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I commute 2.5 hours on a regular basis, and buy books on tape to keep myself awake and amused. David Sedaris' book was one of the best I've ever listened to. The book is recorded by Sedaris, and his voice is perfect for the readings. (As it should be, but authors are not always the best readers). As other reviewers have noted, this book is hilarious, as well as occasionally touching and sad. (Really). If you have a reason to listen to audio tapes, get this one. And if you don't, make a reason."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"i started listening to sedaris on NPR and have followed his publishing career with glee, from BARREL FEVER to NAKED and then HOLIDAY ON ICE. he has done it again with this book -- I especially relished the second half of the book, but the entire work resonates with his rapier wit and unque styling. for another even more raucous read, try SELLEVISION by augusten burroughs...."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The best of all of his books, by far! If you've ever lived (not just visited) in a country where you were still learning the language or ever tried to learn French, you will thoroughly relate to Mr. Sedaris and his trials in France! It's absolutely hysterical!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; was my first introduction to the warped mind of David Sedaris. I don't intend for this to be my last introduction. I laughed out loud at some of the hilarious tales Sedaris tells, which sometimes are so outlandish, they can only be true. (Hording spoiled fruit? A brother who talks to his dad like he would his bar buddy? Performance art with sock puppets? No one can make up this stuff!) His essays on the more mundane, like the challenge of New York Times crossword puzzles and the idiosyncracies of Americans in Paris, are also funny. It might take a certain sense of humor to get some of this, though. I read a few stories out loud to my husband, and he didn't laugh at all of them. Must have something to do with my husband's IQ... (But that is another Sedaris story!)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have always been an avid reader of David Sedaris since I first went to a live reading of his at my University auditorium. His true-to-life stories always make me chuckle; his poignant and descriptive narrative is very relative to what my peers and I experienced growing up in the 80's. I highly recommend the text to any new reader of Sedaris' work. The chapters are short and always keep your attention. Enjoy! and T'amuse bien! (have fun!)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I can't remember laughing outloud so much while reading. Proves that truth is funnier than fiction. Sedaris has a unique ability to poke fun at himself and his family, and it was fun going on this ride with him. This was a selection in a book club I'm in, and all of us got a kick out of it. Favorite chapter - The Rooster - totally killing me!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I can't remember laughing outloud so much while reading. Proves that truth is funnier than fiction.

Favorite chapter - The Rooster - totally killing me!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I think David Sedaris and Henry Alford are the two funniest people writing right now. Sedaris's new book is perhaps more commercial than his other ones--some of the topics are a little more obvious than ones he's tackled before--but it is no less funny. Can we blame him if he wants to laugh about foreigners making funny lingual mistakes, or waiters in pretentious restaurants? Granted, these topics are sort of like shooting fish in a barrel. But they're no less funny for being obvious."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"You know how somethings strike you as SO funny that you laugh so hard your eyes sqeeze shut, you cry and you cannot breathe? That's what this book is doing to me every time I sit down to read some more!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY is second only to NAKED. It's a very funny read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Horrid just about covers it - not funny, very much a waste of time. I think the title is a good clue as to the content - complete drivel. I've given a couple of his other books a glance - everyone deserves a second chance, no? Unfortunately I have found the others similarly disappointing. His little stitched-together anecdotes are weak attempts at humor that don't come off funny and only make him seem more pathetic in the telling."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to get an overview of contemporary Paris and the title came up when I searched for something on that subject. Reading this to learn about Paris is like reading War and Peace to learn about military uniforms. There isn't much and what there is is trivial at best. Beyond that, Sedaris is a Dave Barry wannabe with anecdotes that may stimulate laughter in conversation but usually &quot;clunk&quot; in writing. His chapter about his brother &quot;Rooster&quot; who has a twenty word vocabulary, almost entirely profane, is painful, even to this six year army veteran from a &quot;line&quot; company."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book isn't funny. Talking about taking drugs, your horrible careers, dead pets and making fun of children is not funny.The writing is not very juicy either. Any one of you reading this could write a better book.The good part is, the writer seemed to have trouble meeting the minimal word limit so the reader can finish reading the book rather quickly because there is not much to it.The reviews on the cover must be for marketing purposes. If you really are curious about reading it, barrow the book from a friend or buy it when it gets to the Dollar Store.It's horrible!!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the first book I've read from David Sedaris. Sedaris tells some interesting stories, but be warned that they are all a little weird for a small town girl. His family seems to enjoy making each other crazy and/or grossing each other out far too much. Some of his essays are enjoyable reads, but the chapter on his brother was made up entirely up the 'f' word in all it's gloified variations. This is good writing? And, by the way, while some of Me Talk Pretty is good, none of it is laugh-out-loud funny as the jacket describes."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Some authors are able to write humorous 'autobiographical' novels that really capture the attention. David Sedaris does NOT fall into that category. Me Talk Pretty One Day is more like the inane ramblings of a 12 year old than the work of a supposed comic genius.The first half of the book seems utterly pointless, badly thought through and amateurishly written - there is probably good material here, although Sedanis falls victim of his own misplaced self-belief that he is a writer, with purile observations that are badly structured and poorly conveyed.Interestingly, the second half of the book improves immeasurably, written far more wittily and in a much more mature and thougtfully amusing style ... although he's still not a &quot;comic genius&quot; as the back cover would lead us to believe."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I picked this book up at the airport, seeing as my only other alternatives were One Minute Millionare and the Da Vinci Code. 10 minutes into the book, I wished I had opted for one of the other two, as they may have brought me *some* satisfaction, however brief. Sedaris' book is neither: a) funny; b) irreverent or penetrating, as the heavy marketing of both his books implies; nor c) well-written. Its rather disconcerting that the book is full of such rave reviews from established publications. The guy at the Wall Street Journal who said it was the funniest thing he ever read seriously needs to get out (and read) more."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sorry, but I had high hopes after reading all the positive reviews for this book. My boyfriend and I bought the audio and played it on a recent trip. I remember giggling once, sort of. What's the deal -- hilarious? What am I missing? It's not that it was horrible, it's just that it was flat -- purported to be funny, but to me a real disappointment. Maybe it picked up after the first two tapes, but we couldn't sit through any more than that."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"You may like Sedaris only if you watch network television sitcoms religiously.Needless to say---------This book is a complete waste of money.The myopic and tired humor is great only for a specific audience, the male homosexual drug having lived in France. If you fit this demographpic, perhaps you will feel some bonding that may get you through the bad writing, though it may still be a battle.There is not a shred of true wit in this book. It is simply cheap poor lifts from the Hunter Thomas genre and perhaps preening gay dialogue found in a gay TV sitcoms( if they existed.)This book simply does not appeal to a general readership. Literacy seems to have not yet reached bottom yet in the United States.A total waste of time.I hope your bookstore will allow you to exchange the book so you do not take the hit from paid promoters here and from the advertising/marketing machine."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I admit that some chapters of this book made me laugh,...BR>In this book, he simply describes openly all the disgustingdetails which probably anybody can find in his life if he/shesearches hard enough.Disgusting details of certain events with peoplewho keep animals do not suddenly become less disgusting justbecause you describe them in writing.Foul language like the author's brother seems to speak it(Sedaris quotes him at length and with delight) does not becomemore fit to print by actually printing it.The fact that this book is so popular in the US is somewhatfrightening. ...Does entertainment have tobe either violent or vulgar or both in order to sell on theUS market?"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I know Sedaris from his work at NPR. On radio he can be funny, but reading about his empty and sad life was depressing.Sedaris'claim that meth harms no one was offensive and flat out wrong. Meth has absolutely devastated many individuals, families, and small towns in the Western USA. Meth labs are also an environmental disaster with toxic chemicals being dumped into landfills all over the West."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is indeed a force to reckon with in this literary genre...short story or whatever it is. He knows how to hold you in the story as he twists and turns and punishes you with a gut wrenching laugh that is painful and sweet all at once. I guess it is that rare talent that comes with left-handed people and the queer types."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Before I read this book, I read \\"Naked\\" and \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,\\" also by David Sedaris. I liked those much better.\\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" often seems forced, with situations that fall flat on their face - Sedaris watching young men get injured by angry cows, Sedaris watching a girl almost fall off a halted amusement park ride, Sedaris flubbing an IQ test in French, etc. The opening essay, about seeing a speech therapist in high school and Sedaris's ability to avoid the letter s (which would reveal his lisp), isn't very funny.Also, oddly, the book reads as a tribute to Sedaris's father, which is strange considering Sedaris's light mockery of him in other books. \\"Naked\\" is more of a tribute to Sedaris's mother, and that felt more natural somehow. I know from his other books that there was a lot of tension between Sedaris and his father on account of Sedaris's sexuality, and that tension seemed to be missing between Sedaris and his mother.The book also suffers from a dearth of Paul, Sedaris's funniest sibling in my opinion. \\"Corduroy and Denim\\" features lots of Paul and is all the better for it.Probably the best essay in the book is the one based on the title, which documents Sedaris's struggle to learn French. He can't keep track of which nouns are masculine and which are feminine, and he recounts the butchered language in which he and his classmates comfort each other. Touching and funny at the same time. An essay about his sister Amy and how she wears the lower half of a \\"fat suit\\" home for the holidays is also very funny."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Looking for an edge away from the \\"same ol' same ol'\\", I picked up this book on a recommendation by a friend. In reading the first chapter, I was extremely delighted in this non-timeconsuming and simplistically funny book. However, the further I got into the book, the more abstract the humor was and the harder it was for me to believe the outlandish situations that David Sedaris claims to have experienced. Though this was not true for every chapter, I found that the far-fetched chapters that slightly pinched a nerve had then made many of the other chapters unbelievable, thus ruining the chance of finding ANY meaning in this book and, instead, making it a book purely for entertainment. The chapters don't even run together in any plausible and linear format, and instead seem to be formed in the succession of a scattered memory.Though I have nothing against books meant for entertainment purposes only, I do not wish to spend much of my time reading them. Luckily, each chapter contains a short story in itself that could be picked up at any moment I desired. So, despite my criticism, I did enjoy the book...but only sparingly.In conclusion, this book is innovative in the way it is written and in it's contents. However, if you are a fan of philosophy fiction and stories with hidden meanings, I would recommend this book only if you're the type that needs a complete break once and a while. Though the book is funny, I would only fully recommend it to those who don't mind spending hours reading scattered stories with no meaning for the lone purpose of being mindlessly entertained."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Dave Sedaris is a consistently funny writer and this book is about his really wierd misadventures. His dry wit seems to make even the most mundane stuff exciting. If you like audiobooks, get that instead of the paperback because its read by the author and his dismal voice makes it more personal."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This lay around my house in college and I assumed, from the cover and the title, that it was some textbook for my roommate's special education coursework. I had no interest in it as a result. How wrong I was! I read the first chapter and it was so hilarious that I stole the book from her to finish in as few sittings as possible.Sedaris has a unique talent for taking the mundane, the average, even the tragic and twisting it up in his special way to make the reader laugh out loud. I've given this book as a gift to many people, and they all have loved it and looked into Sedaris's other works."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I couldn't dislike this book if I tried. Upon completion, I find myself flipping back through essays, re-reading over and over again finding little details that I missed before and laughing out lout in inappropriate situations. Sedaris is so likeable and undeniably funny that it might take a while before you start questioning how this dry, often pestamistic passive observer became the protagonist of his stories for no obvious reasons and became your personal hero. He's not really criticizing human behavior, he's just admitting that no one is above it and for being a writer with such wit and charm stripped down to confessionals, you can't help but love him for writing the words that never left your mouth with such cleverness and fluency. \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is the collected writings of David Sedaris' experiences in France and that general era of his life, but instead of being filled with the hopelessness and drama he was searching for, he manages to find whimsical humor everywhere he goes, never failing to display his own pretentions and akward mannerisms to which I relate and praise him for. Even though I have yet to meet an eccentric bipolar french-teacher who constantly throws objects and asks questions purely for the intent of criticizing thier answers, a father who refuses to not eat appaulingly old food and forces his children to appreciate jazz, or a speech therapist who seems to interrigate her child patients determined to find flaws in thier speech, I'll never lose my appreciation for those great story tellers who'm I've never had the privelege to be. Sedaris and his world full of eccentric characters, never fail to entertain."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Finally I jumped on the David Sedaris bandwagon, this being the first book by him I've read. It truly is pretty funny. It's a series of essays about his wacky family, living in France, and being on the subversive side of a very straight-laced U.S.The book cover blurbs oversold it. I read reviewers say they \\"screamed with laughter\\" or found it \\"sidesplitting\\" or \\"wildly entertaining.\\" It's mildly entertaining. Don't expect to scream with laughter.You also have to suspend your belief to some degree. Exaggeration is okay but it's probably a major part of this autobiographical book. The first half is about growing up and adult life, and the second half is about life in France. There's not a lot of continuity here: it's truly a random collection of essays.I don't want to leave a totally negative impression. Let me tell you two of my favorite lines from the book:\\"...my childhood was unspeakably dull. When I was seven years old, my family moved to North Carolina. When he was seven years old, Hugh's family moved to the Congo. We had a collie and a house cat. They had a monkey and two horses named Charlie Brown and Satan.\\"Another, about a speech therapy class for boys with lisps: \\"When asked what we wanted to be when we grew up, we hid the truth and listed who we wanted to sleep with when we grew up: \`A policeman or a fireman or one of those guys who works with high-tension wires.'\\""},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was my first encounter with David Sedaris, and I am now a fan for life. His absolutely hilarious look into his childhood and family had me in stitches. Do not hesitate to buy this book unless you are easily offended. He can be crude at times, but it is just part of his writing....get over it!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Many will know Sedaris from his hilarious autobiographical commentaries on NPR, especially during his time spent living in Paris. His books are equally funny with such a quiet, sneaky sort of humor and self-referential sarcasm that you can't help but like the guy. From his childhood lisp to being an American in Paris, the anecdotes of his life will literally have you in stitches. One of the funniest people alive. An easy read presented in episodes, good for traveling or the beach."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Listening to David Sedaris's voice narrating 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' is a danger if you are behind the wheel! In his voice you can hear the tough (yet funny) times at school &amp; the Speech Pathologist, with his dad and the Music Teacher. Sometimes it's almost too much to listen to!Sedaris's voice is very similar to his sister Amy Sedaris who was Jerry Blank in the cult show 'Strangers with Candy.' They share the same brand of humor: dry, cynical, witty.This is one you certainly don't want to miss and I would suggest the audio version for more personalization (and laughs)."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have to admit I was a bit hesitant to read this book. My feeling was that this was just a cheap attempt to capitalize on the success of &quot;Naked&quot;, and to write a book that was essentially exactly the same. I'm happy to report that my fears were unfounded.Sedaris again proves he is perhaps the funniest writer in America. The best pieces in here are funny to the point that I almost needed an oxygen tank to restore normal breathing after laughing so hard for so long. In fact, the funniest pieces are so good that when you get to a story that merely makes you chuckle softly to yourself, it seems like a let-down.The most consistently hilarious stories in &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; are the ones dealing with the odd idiosyncrosies of Sedaris' father. However, by far the funniest story of the bunch had to be &quot;You Can't Kill the Rooster&quot;, about Sedaris' foul-mouthed, white trash younger brother.Admittedly, I started to get somewhat disappointed about halfway through the book, as that is where a few stories that can be best described as &quot;filler&quot; seemed to seep in. But I am happy to report that at that point the book quickly moves to the stories detailing Sedaris' experience of living in France, and the hilarity starts all over again. Recommending this is simple...if you like to laugh, read it, if you hate laughing, don't read it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"In &quot;Barrel Fever&quot; and &quot;Naked,&quot; David Sedaris let his imagination run wild in fictional stories. &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; differs from his previous collections in that he confined these writings to autobiography. Fortunately, his essays based on truth are as hilarious (though perhaps not as wildly farfetched) as those he makes up entirely. Coming from a family that includes a &quot;tanorexic,&quot; the Rooster (the name that DS's brother calls himself), a sister that wears fat suits and cosmetic bruises, a father that hordes spoiled fruit, and a mother who fills Easter baskets with cartons of cigarettes, he has an unusually rich background to draw from. The second half of the book deals with his life as an American living in Paris. In addition to the charming misanthropy that is his trademark, these essays provide some dead-on observations of Americans by an American.One warning: avoid reading this collection in public if laughing so hard you soak yourself is something you might find at all embarrassing. David Sedaris is simply the funniest person writing today."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Ok. If an author can make you laugh about a drug addicted infant being murdered in a washing machine (check out **Barrel Fever**), he's either the funniest thing going...or you're just a sick so and so...Hmmmm. kinda makes you wonder....Anyway, This is another hell-larious collection of stories by one of the funniest authors to grip a pen. The first half of this great book kinda extends on the Sedaris family lore that was touched upon in Barrel Fever and Naked. We learn about David's mom who perks up the Easter baskets with tobacco products, his dad who has an unusual warmth for rotting fruit, his brother The Rooster (not to be confused with the family pet) and his wickedly funny sister (amy sedaris from the comedy central show 'strangers with candy').The second half of this riotously funny book is a string of tales of Davids (mis)adventures as a misanthropic American in Paris. Gene Kelly he is not...but that's what makes it so smashingly silly...I really dig this book because it has that rare abiltiy to make you laugh out loud. And that's priceless in itself. I also really dig this book because while reading this, part of you will be thinking 'this boy really has problems...what a screwy family...' and the other part of you will be thinking 'Oh, my gosh...that reminds me of my sister...that reminds me of my crazy father...'. Which ever camp you're sitting in, this book will charm you right out of your seat... David Sedaris may talk pretty someday, but he writes amazingly right now.... xo"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My cousin, Lisa, and I share many satisfying and hilarous experiences (college roommates being just one), and for whatever reason, we are David Sedaris soulmates. After she read my review of &quot;Naked&quot; [...] she has been a fan. This year for my birthday, she paid me back ten-fold with &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day,&quot; the best Sedaris yet. Most of Sedaris' work is what you might call &quot;sort of&quot; autobiographical. I say, &quot;sort of&quot; because it is a little hard for me to believe all of what he writes is true - embellished truths? Absolutely. From his childhood in North Carolina (filled with wise-cracking, drinking, smoking mother, psycho younger brother (The &quot;Rooster&quot;) and odd-ball father (to whom he dedicates the book), we read these funny short pieces about his speech therapist (a speech 'nazi'), his midget guitar teacher (his father had dreams of the kids being a famous musical group), his drug abuse experiences, and finally, a number of pieces about learning French and living in France, where he finds himself having followed his partner. I ended up reading pieces of this book (while on vacation) to whichever member of my family I could capture, and the two of us were generally reduced to tears. Believe it or not, the drug use pieces were a scream - incredibly pathetic but hysterical. The best was toward the end when Sedaris describes being in a French subway (obviously looking very French) and listening to a loud American man warn his wife that she should watch her pocketbook because this shifty-looking French guy (Sedaris!) behind her was likely to snatch her purse. All in all, like much of what I've read of Sedaris, any author who can reduce me to tears is a god-send. The best physical therapy in the world is to weep with laughter."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day was my initiation into the quirky and warped world of David Sedaris, and after the first few pages I knew I would like it there. This was a guy who tried to construct a vocabulary without using the letter &quot;s&quot; so that he could mask his lisp. As a child, he hilariously tells us, his midget guitar teacher had a voice like a recording played back too fast and he taught his students to love their guitars by suggesting they imagine them as a &quot;stacked&quot; woman. And that's just in the first two (short) chapters.But suddenly, the same sharp commentary that had me laughing out loud in public a few chapters earlier started to seem predictable, and the sarcastic wit I identified with early on had somehow eroded into a grating kind of pessimism.Fortunately, I put the book aside and read something else for a few days. When I picked it up again, it again seemed fresh and bitingly comical. And then I realized what I now think is essential to enjoying Mr. Sedaris' work: it needs to small bites in order to be digested correctly.So I end up with three stars -- an average between the two stars I would give it had I read the book straight through and the four I think it deserves when it comes in drips and drabs. I can't agree with my fellow reviewers who consider Mr. Sedaris a modern day Mark Twain or P.G. Wodehouse, but he is pretty damn funny. Just remember, like most things, the key is moderation."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Don't ask me why, but I read a few of the stories from this book in the bathroom at work. Which wouldn't have been a problem had I not had to worry about others who were also using the bathroom at the same time. I know that had it been me that walked into a bathroom and heard muffled laughing coming from a closed stall, I'd have been pretty concerned for its occupant. To which I say to anyone who might have been there, or could imagine being there, I dare you to read any three of Sedaris' latest stories and not laugh outloud. Embarrasingly loud. Let he who is without a sense of humor cast the first stone.Like Naked, Holidays on Ice and Barrel Fever, MTPOD is riotous fun with a good bit of scathing social commentary thrown in for good measure. Almost every story is a classic in its own way, from the bathroom humor of Big Boy, to the foul-mouthed sentimentality of You Can't Kill the Rooster. The second half of the book, mostly stories of Sedaris' move to France, is a change of pace from the remembrances of his North Carolina upbringing which make up most of the first half, but doesn't disappoint at all. Picka-Pocketoni, Jesus Shaves and the title story are wonderfully drawn and Sedaris writes comically without being a comedian.I read this book to my in-laws on vacation recently. Every night, before we'd go to bed, I'd read a couple stories to put a humorous ending on another day at the beach. I like to think that they just like to hear me read, but I know the real reason everyone gathered every night was the feeling a Sedaris story leaves you with. Is there a more sure way to go to bed with a smile on your face. I'm not sure there is. I can't give a book of humor five stars, but I can highly recommend this offering by David Sedaris. Just don't read it in the bathroom at work."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My mom bought this book for me, and after I told her it was one of the funniest things I've ever read, she decided she'd better read it, too. I'm writing this because, while she was reading the chapter on Easter, I could hear strange hiccuping giggles comming from her room, and I decided I'd better investigate. I looked in, and my mom was beet-red from laughing too hard and mopping at her eyes with tissues. Apparently, she laughed so hard that her eye cream melted into her eyes, and although it hurt, she just couldn't stop laughing. Eventually, my whole family came in and just gathered around watching her laugh herself stupid.So yes, it's very very funny, but make sure you have an open mind towards drugs and sexuality before you read it. He never comes right out and says that he's gay or anything like that, but if you're gonna have a problem with gay relationships, don't buy this book. Because then you'd come onto Amazon and give it a bad review, and none of us want that for this extremely funny and well written book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"In his previous collections, Barrel Fever, Holidays on Ice, and Naked, Sedaris' works have been sometimes hilarious, sometimes disturbing and grim, and sometimes all three. His best works, though, were always the funny essays based on his own life. (Fortunately, he's weird enough that this works.) And in Me Talk Pretty One Day, he shows that he's realized where his strength lies.The first portion of Me Talk Pretty, prosaically named One, contains more of his reminisces about his family. These stories are often funny, usually with an underlying tension, and their conclusions are usually wry or bittersweet. &quot;Go Carolina&quot; is a perfect example of these, talking about Sedaris' years in speech therapy as a child, and suggesting that perhaps his parents, teachers, and therapists were trying to fix something other than just a speech impediment.Deux, the other half of the book, concerns Sedaris' life in France, especially his attempts to learn French. Most of the essays in Deux are truly hysterical. They're the kind of thing where, after a few minutes of reading, your eyes are tearing up from lack of oxygen and your loved one has awoken from a sound sleep (probably because the bed was vibrating with your laughter) and is threatening to call an ambulance or suffocate you with a pillow.Deux has attractions in addition to the humor in the stories. It's nice to see that Sedaris can write - and write well - about something other than his screwy childhood and screwed-up history. Sooner or later Sedaris is bound to run out of humorous anecdotes about his past, and Me Talk Pretty is an indication that when he does, he'll still have good stuff to write about - his present. In fact, if this book is anything to go by, Sedaris' works will only improve on that day - in the distant future, of course - when he puts the past in, well, the past.(Caveat: do not read this book in public places unless you enjoy looking like someone with a major nervous system disorder and a bronchial problem. Books like this are best enjoyed either by yourself or in the company of people who have to love you, no matter how strange you look.)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I agree with most of the enthusiastic comments below -- the pieces, especially the ones on living in France, are hilarious. I found myself guffawing loudly, despite my best efforts, while reading this book in a &quot;quiet&quot; academic study space. The glares were worth it. Still, it seems here that Sedaris is repeating himself. The material on his father is more than reminiscent of the stuff in _Naked_ (a wonderful boook), and, more seriously, it seems at times that Sedaris is looking for quirky situations to write about, and stretching them out to make an interesting tale. The stretchmarks are evident, and the result is an unfortunate sense of contrivance. This peeks in at the ends of several stories (his wrap-ups here are substandard), and it is most clear in the piece about the woman trapped in the amusement park ride. This problem emerged only briefly at the end of _Naked_, in the nudist camp sequence, which felt to me like a mission in search of weirdness without enough self-reflection about Sedaris's own position. I'd like to see Sedaris break out into a longer form, either in fiction or non-fiction, something more sustained and requiring a more concentrated effort of his brilliant comedic talent. This is, overall, deeply pleasureful to read: it would make a fine Father's Day gift for an open-minded dad."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is a master storyteller. I'm still in awe of how tight and well-written Me Talk Pretty One Day is. It is one of those rare, deceptively simple books that you can read in a couple of days, and then find yourself thinking in detail about the anecdotes contained therein. There is so much more going on here than what you get on the surface. In one chapter, Sedaris spins a funny tale, and you're still howling with laughter as you turn the page and are immediately confronted with a poignant story about the pain of losing a pet.This is a book that definitely deserves a second read so you can laugh and cry your head off first, and then the second time around, pay attention to the way Sedaris composes the vignettes of his story, why he includes what he includes. There's nothing accidental in the telling here. Everything's there for a reason."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My husband usually goes to sleep before me. After prepping for bed, I look forward to slipping quietly into the bed beside him and reading until I fall asleep. My favorite memory of reading this book is laughing (silently) so hard that our bed shaking. He wakes up and starts yelling \\"STOP. LAUGHING. I'M TRY-YING TO SLEEEEP.\\" Eventually he storms off to the couch. He's threatening to get his own bed.Not that I mind."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is the 6th book of collected essays by David Sedaris. In part one, Sedaris touches on speech therapy for his lisp at school, guitar lessons from a midget, inherited traits, artistic talent, sibling swearing, family pets, working as a teacher, toilet legacies, odd jobs, eating out in NYC, visitors to NYC, outward appearances, and technophobia. Part two focuses mainly on his life with his partner Hugh in France and explores travelling to France, taking French language lessons, feast days, the sex of words, Hugh's childhood in Africa, word puzzles, movie subtitles, the behaviour of vacationing Americans, epic daydreams, food economy and IQ tests. My favourite chapter was Jesus Shaves. I tried to read this to friends but dissolved into laughter every time. Sedaris has the reader constantly smiling, chuckling, giggling and often laughing out loud. Sedaris is witty and clever and reading his work is an unalloyed pleasure."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I made the mistake of reading this book on an intercontinental flight to Malaysia...nobody around me slept...I was laughing all the way to Kuala Lumpur :-D"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris doesn't need one more review from one more fan, but for anyone who has ever felt impatient with an immigrant struggling with the English language, please read this book! Instead of yelling over the phone, \\"Learn to speak English!\\" at the poor slob trying to tell you why your credit card was declined, you might feel just a touch of sympathy for the linguistically-challenged miscreant. Sedaris's \\"Jesus Shaves\\" reveals not just the linguistic barriers, but the cultural ones. Hilarious. Makes me cry real tears. Now go read it, and unlearn some of your prejudices!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The series of short stories left me never truly invested in the main character (which i understand is the author). I heard so many great things, and while I found myself laughing out loud on a few occasions, I think it was overhyped before I even read it, so my expectations were most likely unrealistic. He is a great writer, using interesting examples to illustrate this stories, but because I never felt invested in the character, I struggled to have any reason to keep reading. If any of his other books are not written in short story format i'd like to give that a try."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I had high expectations for this book since it has recieved good ratings, and also reccomended by A. Burroughs fans, but I wasn't impressed with it. I found some partsboring, and even annoying. I did laugh out loud a few times too, but the overall feel of the book was not realistic to me, and that's what I expected."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have read 6 of David Sedaris's books and this one is my favourite!! Of course I'm a huge fan but this really is a must read!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was the first book by David Sedaris that I read, and unfortunately, it now has become the book by which all of his other works are judged. I agree with the majority of the reviews that this is probably his best work. Each essay is funnier than the previous and it's easy to fly through half of this book in one sitting because you don't want to stop.It seems that most people either love Sedaris or don't get his style of humor. The punchlines aren't 'in-your-face' and require a bit of thought in order to appreciate. Put yourself in his shoes and you'll enjoy the essays even more. If you can handle the subjects and language, then essays like You Can't Kill the Rooster, The Youth in Asia, and I'll Eat What He's Wearing will leave you laughing and gasping for air... unless of course, you don't have the awesome sense of humor that you think you do... in which case, you probably won't be able to finish this book.Several months after reading this, I had the desire to re-read it, but instead bought the audio book, which is read by the author. It's a completely different experience, but hilarious to hear the stories straight from David's mouth. Whether you're reading it or listening to it, there's no wrong way to consume Me Talk Pretty One Day.If this is your first Sedaris experience, as it was for me, and you're hungry for more, I recommend Holidays on Ice as the follow up."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I listened to David Sedaris' When You are Engulfed in Flames as an audio-book (read by the author) and enjoyed it so much that I special-ordered Me Talk Pretty One Day into my library as an audio-book. Reading is good, but when it comes to material like this, audio is the way to go.Sedaris' deadpan delivery is priceless. Seven of the stories in this collection are recorded live. These stories are among the best in the collection, and they are enhanced further by the live audience (those pregnant pauses, the anticipation, and the delirious laughter that follows each punch-line).Sedaris' stories (or essays, as they are often referred to) are amusing, real-life, anecdotes about the mundane. These are the stories told by the funniest guy at a dinner party.As with any collection of essays, some are better than others. This collection gets off to a strong start with Go Carolina. Many of the standout stories are the ones that were recorded live, in particular The Youth in Asia, I'll Eat What He's Wearing, and See You Again Yesterday. Other stand-outs include: Shiner Like a Diamond and Learning Curve.In Canada we have a popular story-teller named Stuart McLean who is probably unknown outside the Great White North (we also like hockey and drink coffee at a place called Tim Horton's). David Sedaris is similar to McLean in that he tells amusing anecdotes'; however there is a distinct difference. McLean is strictly G rated entertainment; sentimental and charming. Sedaris, while not R rated, is delivering PG material. Readers and listeners should be prepared for coarse language, sexual content, and references to recreational drug use. He speaks openly about his drug abuse and his homosexuality, which may be off-putting to some. And his humor is extremely caustic - and that may not appeal to everyone. (I on the otherhand, appreciate caustic humor)All in all, this is a highly entertaining collection of stories. Overall, I found the variety and quality of stories told in When You Are Engulfed in Flames to be a little better, but Me Talk Pretty One Day makes for enjoyable reading and/or listening. There are moments that are almost certain to have you laughing out loud."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the first Sedaris book I've read and I want to read all his others ASAP. I literally laughed out loud through many of the autobiographical essays. While reading at a hotel pool on vacation, I had to get up and move away from all the other people, so I wouldn't disturb them with my uncontrollable laughter. Sedaris' \\"worldview\\" is quirky but accurate. His life experiences are often eccentric. This book is a masterpiece of its genre, whatever genre that might be. Maybe Sedaris has invented a new genre --humor/philosophy/autobiography/eccentricity."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I bought this book because it is supposed to be really funny. I did find a few portions of the book humorous (although, it wasn't exactly sidesplitting laughter) I found myself a little disappointed. I thought the book was interesting because it kept my attention, and I can't really say it was dull, just not as spectacular as some of the reviewers have said. I do however, think that humor is very subjective, some people will love this book, and others will not be very impressed. It's going to come down to what tickles your funny bone, and unfortunately, this book didn't tickle mine."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"With his latest book I got the distinct impression that David Sedaris had run out of amusing episodes in his own past to write about other than a few things that were clearly from the bottom of the barrel. So a lot of the book is written about experiences he has had since becoming a well known writer and there is a &quot;gosh aren't I unique in my way of life and attitude&quot; aspect to these that just isn't endearing in the way that his self view from Naked and Barrel Fever were. A good part of the attempted humor is his restructuring into English of conversations he and others had in the process of learning French. Funny for the first paragraph, but gets old quickly because it is such a blatantly manipulative humorous device.Coming to this book alone I would have given it 3 stars, but having enjoyed Naked and Barrel Fever so much, points off for disappointment in light of high expectations. . ."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is one-third amusing, one-third funny and one third absolutely laugh out loud hilarious. Whether retelling a story about his cussing brother, his experience with a speech therapist or a class of non-native speakers of French trying to explain Easter to a classmate, David Sedaris knows exactly what to focus on to hit a person right in the funny bone. Although two of his previous novels, Barrel Fever and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, contain stories with similar themes, they are not nearly as funny, maybe due to their tendency toward more restricted/adult themes. Those who plan to give David Sedaris' humor a try should choose this one."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"His \\"tanorexic\\" sister, his tribulations in Paris, his stint as a professor- this book is so funny.Of course, some essays were just so-so (as in, didn't make me cry laughing), but it's only because he sets the bar so high for himself with his scathing wit."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This guy is truly a genius of perspective on the loser, the nerd who will triumph in an unexpected and questionable way in the end."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris is absolutely hilarious with this comedic view of his family life. Although a few essays strayed from the general flow, this collection reads as a novel. For a good laugh and a quick weekend read, I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The hype has been huge for this book and all I have been hearing lately is how wonderfully funny Sedaris's book is. One or two people even told me it was better than Augusten Burroughs' stuff. This of course, got me very interested and I hurried out to buy the book.As much as I was desperate to love it, I was unfortunately disappointed. Don't get me wrong. There are some funny stories, and there is no doubt that Sedaris is witty and comically twisted, but he doesn't hold a candle to Burroughs...not even close. In honesty, I am not sure why so many people compare the two.The truth is, Sedaris is just a little too mild for me. I would never dissuade anyone from reading his material, I would simply say that for those who like dark and twisted humor, Augusten Burroughs is your man. Sedaris is the appetizer."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I got \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" after being bombarded by mainstream and gay press as this being the new wonder boy in story telling. I expected fiction but instead got Mr. Sedaris's life rehashed with little anecdotes and humor interjected in between. Most of the stories will make you chuckle here and there, some real writing talent, but they don't even begin to touch real stories that you'll remember and reflect upon. It's just like he's sitting in a coffee shop recalling stories from his life and throwing some humor in there. Kinda pulp I'd say. One important note though: If you've never heard David Sedaris talk you've got to find some NPR interviews or something. He has a high pitched, feminine voice, that at first had me thinking he was a 70 year old Billy Corgan. Once you've heard his voice it actually makes reading the stories much more entertaining; because you've got him narrating them in your head! Decent stories, great writing style, but not much thought in there."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Anyone who enjoys one hearty belly laugh after another will absolutely love this book! I read it on an airplane and laughed out loud so many times, it was distracting to other passengers! David Sadaris' untamed, sardonic wit brings an indescribable sense of humor to stories of his childhood, family, sexuality and travels. What a talent this man possesses for storytelling! A great gift for anyone who feels their life is hum-drum, and a book one could read over and over, and never get tired of!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Something must have been in the drinking water at the Sedaris' home some years ago. Although we all have family/life stories to share, most of ours are nothing like David's. His comic bathroom struggle to dispose of an un-claimed... out of fear that the next in line will believe it to be his, is hi-LAR-ious! I like the way that David views life."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"True to his other works, 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' is a collection of short stories chronicling various moments in his life. However unlike his other books, most of 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' does not involve members of his family but rather focuses on his life in France. Yes, the author struggles somewhat with the French people and, especially, the French language. But unfortunately these stories, while not exactly boring, are too predictable to be really funny. Somehow Dave Sedaris battling Dave Sedaris in France is not as interesting as adolescent Dave Sedaris fighting adolescence and his delightfully dysfunctional family. And so I hope the author recalls or invents more stories involving his family, or I suggest he retire young and keep studying French.Bottom line: David Sedaris deviates from his proven theme, must to the disappointment of this reader. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is one of the funniest things I've ever read. His perspective on being an outsider in France is fascinating and hilarious. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A collection of autobiographic stories of a funny David Sedaris. I like the short shorty format because it allowed me my \\"small dose\\" of humour whenever I could sneak away. Always a laugh to be had."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The comparison one reviewer makes on the back cover of this book between David Sedaris and Mark Twain is not overblown. Every page of this book will have you laughing out loud. David Sedaris has an eye for the humor in the absurd situations he and his kooky family find themselves in. It's no wonder both he and his sister are famous comedians: There is enough comedy material in his immediate family alone that it sounds like David could write another twenty books just telling stories about them."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This guy is unbelievably funny. I have read some of these shorts 5 or 6 times and they keep getting funnier."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I first read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" in a writing class. I must admit that I was skeptical, especially with such an odd sounding title. I got much more than I bargained for by reading Mr. Sedaris' work. I was transported to France where I felt like I was struggling like David Sedaris was to learn the language. I really felt like I was at the amusement park with him when he \\"almost saw this girl get killed\\". His work is shocking at times, almost always tear inducing funny, and very true to life. The only thing better than reading his stories, is getting to hear him read the stories. With his soft spoken voice with a hint of a lisp, you really feel like you are him. If you get the chance to hear him live, DO SO! Also, if you are short on time, or do not have the patience level for long novels, this is a good book. It does not have to be read in order. It is one of those books that you can pick up read a story,and put it down."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My favorite David Sedaris book. He is hilarious, but you have to have a bit of a quirky sense of humor to understand him!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was first introduced to the writing of David Sedaris in a Literary Nonfiction class. The excerpt we read was the one from which the title of this book is taken, \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\\" I thought it was pretty funny and bought the book. Well, it is a lot funnier than that. The funniest parts of this book deal with his various looney family members, and Sedaris' deadpan style reminds me of Dave Barry with an edge. I took this book to read in the doctor's office while my husband had his colonoscopy and I think the people in the waiting room thought I was certifiable...Several times I had to wipe the tears from my eyes. Highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great comic read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"many times i laughed out loud, would reread the same passage and laugh out loud again"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Splendid, silly and sensitive. I really enjoyed the wit and melodious nature of this one. Sedaris at perhaps his finest - at least for my book shelf. The themes he creates are always carried out very easily from essay to essay, chapter to chapter. His words lift off of the page in such description in this book that really set the quickly-changing scenes and acheive bursts of laughter with continuous humor. His best work in my eyes so far."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"As usual, David Sedaris has assembled a hilarious collection of essays spanning his entire life, from the boisterous North Carolina childhood with his numerous sisters to his many (often slightly odd) jobs to his difficulties adjusting to life in France after moving abroad with his partner. Whether he's recalling his obsession with avoiding the usage of certain words in front of his fifth-grade speech therapist (dubbed a \\"secret agent\\" by his ten-year-old mind) or marveling at the difficulty faced by his adult French language classmates in explaining the meaning of Easter to a Muslim woman, Sedaris is guaranteed to make readers laugh, as well as ponder the oddities of the everyday world that most of us never really stop to think about."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"It's difficult to critiqueMe Talk Pretty One Dayhaving just readWhen You Are Engulfed in Flames. No doubt, most who like one Sedaris work will also enjoy the other. In a series of short essays, the author recalls humorous people and situations from earlier in his life. Both start in childhood, which of course has the ripest material, including some gems on speech therapy and his father. That nothing is entirely autobiographical is evident from Sedaris contradicting himself from one story to the next. Did he go to college on the East coast or the Midwest? Did he graduate or not? These are not important questions. Plot serves only as a means to get the reader to laugh. Like the show Seinfeld,Me Talk Pretty One Dayis also about nothing.There was the occasional dud, for me the chapter titled \\"I almost saw a girl get killed\\" fell flat. But much more often the reader is entreated to a genuinely funny, oft-entertaining book that can be read over a month just as easily as in a day. Although I prefer his more recent work, the author continues to show that a masterful interplay of wit and style need not concern itself with run-of-the-mill content."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Quality writing and quality wit.Part memoir and part education.The kind of book you can take you time and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is an absolutely hysterical writer and this book does not disappoint. His stories are always quirky but yet truthful and make me laugh out loud. The only thing better than reading a story he has written is listening to the audio version of it b.c there is just something about his slightly annoying voice that makes the stories sing."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris' descriptions of those talking in a foreign language are dead-on. I'm reading it for the third time and still laughing out loud at something on every page."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris will make you laugh, as he makes fun of himself, and the people he meets along the way. This is especially great to listen to on long road trips when you need more than music to get you through the drive."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Mr Sedaris Writes really funny stories and a lot of them reveal something about being human. I often identify with these insights and feel less alone."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Again, David rocks. I can go on and on about his witty observations and uniqueness and what-have-you, but I shan't. All I know is that the book makes me laugh and I really find many things that are meant to make me laugh to be unfunny. I accidentally left this book at a deli and the staff was sad when I came to retrieve it. It was living behind the bar and the employees were grabbing quick reads between shifts. It probably is now filled with innumerable germs and food borne bacteria but I love it and will not part with it and still reread it when I need a lift--which is quite often.I like to retell Sedaris stories. My favorite from Me Talk Pretty is the one where David compares his boyhood experience watching a Herbie;the talking car movie in the States with that of his boyfriend Hugh who watched it in an African country. Hugh's father, a diplomate, was late picking him up from the theater so he had to wait outside while a dead man hung from a post, swinging in the breeze.I never tire of hearing about my husband's crazy and fascinating foreign childhood.Our Lives Have Gone To The Dogs"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was enjoying the book in the beginning, when David was dealing with his lisp and all. Sedaris is a very witty writer and I appreciate that. However, by the middle of the book I was losing interest. The character became less witty and more irritating as he progressed through adulthood in Paris. He led a life so sad, even Sedaris failed at putting an interesting spin on it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Yes, yes, yes! By far my favorite of his books. It follows a clear path of his life and is generally a great read. If I ever want someone to read a David Sedaris book I start them here. It shows off his unique writing style and his wild stories perfectly. I had some issues with a few of his books being hard to follow because his stories constantly jump, but this one follows perfectly and is easy to follow. The stories are laugh out loud funny. Would recommend anyone read this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have found a new favorite author! Although I have never read any of his other books, I will be sure to now. Where do you start with a book that is funny all over!Starting out at a young boy with a series of speech classes, to the unique and crazy family life, you will be giggling not only to yourself but loud enough for all around you to see and hear. If you are easily embarrassed in public...I would advise only reading this book at alone. You can not hold the laughter in. Moving on in the book it takes you through his college years and odd jobs...up to his move with his significant other to France.Most favorite chapters would be \\"Big Boy\\", which is solely dedicated to a turd! Other chapters that were among my top picks were all the chapters regarding the move to France. David tries so hard to learn the language and battles with the sexes of all nouns.David Sedaris is a brilliant author! I found myself reading bits and pieces of this book to friends and family...encouraging them to buy the book. I even bought the audio book as a xmas present for my mom."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This could be one of the funniest collection of stories I have ever read. This is this first (of a few) Sedaris books I've read, and a great introduction to himself, family and his unique humor that kept me engrossed in every word and page, and forced me to laugh outloud while reading.While Sedaris' book pokes fun of family, the workplace and American culture, he simutaneously is warm and tender about certain subjects as well -- mixing the totally obsurd, while spilling his guts about a very personal section.I personally, loved the section on his language lessons in France. I couldn't stop laughing. And as a New Yorker, his essay on riding the Paris, Metro was priceless."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This collection of essays is hysterical-truly laugh-out-loud material. I sat in an airport waiting area reading the piece titled, \\"Big Boy\\" and didn't realize people were staring at me until the man next to me finally said, \\"what on earth are you reading that's so damn funny?\\" The stories are simple, well crafted and worth every minute.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Can't say enough; laughed until I peed, and tears were streaming down my face. There are no words for the brilliance that is David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"It is often hard for authors to keep the reader focused when writing a book full of essays. They can drag on, and may not interest the reader. &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is just the opposite. It is a very well written book of novels that I could not put down. Sedaris possesses a unique writing style that will keep the reader reading for hours at a time and laughing out loud. His peculiar life situations are what kept me focused, entertained, and amused. David Sedaris has a laid-back writing style and a carefree way of living. This showed me that life does not always have to be taken too seriously. His nonchalant attitude is admirable. I strongly recommend this book to mature readers that crave a good laugh."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"this was recommended to me by a friend and it was my first exposure to david sedaris. if you've never heard of david, you may have heard of his sister amy who plays &quot;jerry blank&quot; on the comedy central show, &quot;strangers with candy.&quot; if you like her humor, you'll definitly love davids books.i never laughed outloud so much from reading. his stories are, for the most part, nonfictional tales of his off-beat life. scattered and out of order, each chapter is an adventure in and of itself.if you're thinking of buying this book, do yourself a favor and order the other 3 as well. &quot;holidays on ice,&quot; &quot;barrel fever,&quot; and &quot;naked&quot; are just as crazy and entertaining."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was laughing out loud so much that I couldn't read it on my way to work because other people on the train would give strange looks, it is THAT funny! He is hilarious and it helps if you've ever heard one of Mr. Sedaris' readings on NPR. It's a lot better to read this book with his voice in your head, with his intonations and sarcasms."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Funny stuff from Sedaris, a guy who's qualified to write funny stories because he's lived them, one way or another. I have no doubt that Sedaris stretches the truth in many of his anecdotes, but that's a sign of a good storyteller (after all, anyone could be passive witness to a great many funny incidents, but that doesn't mean we'll necessarily laugh with just anybody). When you have this much amusing material, it's no coincidence - it's skill.What I loved best was Sedaris's ability to tell ordinary yet quirky stories involving everyday yet hilarious people. He does this without talking down, settling for empty sarcasm, or self-pity. Here is an observant narrator both full of wit and imagination and free of cumbersome pretension. From his blunt mom and deluded dad, to his innocently cruel but deliciously virulent sister, the supporting players (the subjects, even) are likeable and familiar."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I bought this book in a frantic moment. As a big reader, I was faced with an entire night of basketball on TV with nothing to read. I had to leave the room because my husband couldn't hear the game over my laughter. I moved all the way to the bedroom and shut the door. He could still hear me laughing! I have honestly NEVER laughed out loud at a book. I couldn't even re-read favorite essays out loud because I was laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes. Mr. Sedaris is adept at showing us his family and life, with all of it's oddities and making us laugh and think at the same time. I have since read all of his other books and purchased some on audio tape, but nothing will ever make me laugh as hard as the Christians trying to explain Easter in French to the Muslim girl."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have never in my entire life laughed more from a book. I would be sitting in a park in between classes and just cracking up!! I got more than a few strange looks in my direction, to say the least.David Sedaris has become one of my favorite people. I love him. I want to meet him and become one of his best friends and invite him over for BBQ's. I want to be able to brag that David and I are good friends. I don't think I'm alone in this yearning. His writing seems to have that effect on people.After reading this, I immediately went out and bought Naked, which I am in the process of reading. So far, it has only heightened my desire of him.Read this book. You will laugh so hard people will think there is something wrong with you. And you will wonder why all the mundane events that happen in your life are not half as entertaining as when they happen to David."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the first book by David Sedaris I've read and I have to say it certainly is among the funniest. The brilliance of his wit lies within his ability to find the humor in everyday situations and people, whether it be the humiliation of a young boy having to attend speech therapy class for his lisp or the awkward embarrassment of screwing up French translations in a language class run by a teacher who would have been more suitably employed as a Gestapo agent, Sedaris finds the ridiculous in the everyday.One minor criticism, I found the book peters out towards the end. The last two or three stories aren't nearly as interesting or humorous as what comes before them.But gay or straight, there's something for everyone in this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is really, honestly not as funny as the reviews make it sound. It an ok read, not boring by any means but definitely not great either... i was disappointed after the bookstore helper raved about it. just an fyi."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the first audiobook I've ever listened to that seems as if it were meant to be an audiobook to begin with. This is likely due in large part to the memoir format of the book, and being read by the author. Sedaris does an incredible/hilarious Billie Holiday impersonation.Well done, an interesting and hilarious life, with the most vivid pictures of how Americans behave in France that I've ever heard. It sounds like his sister Amy is pretty hilarious too. She's next on my agenda."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris present short stories with a dark and dry sense of humor. These have you sometimes laughing hysterically and other times wondering where the heck he comes up this stuff. Not recommended for anyone younger than 18. Entertaining read, but crass at times."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"ABSOLUTELY funny book, first book I have read from David and guess what, i'm looking at the st of your writing....Thank you for a new escape to laughter lane:)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I remember first seeing the book Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris resting on a coffee table in my old residence at the Tung Fa Noodle Factory in Brooklyn. If I remember correctly, my roommate Felicia was reading it and suggested I do the same. This was in 2001; five years later I finally read it. As the saying goes, better late then never.Me Talk Pretty One Day was one of the few books that have made me laugh out loud. Whether taking guitar lessons with a midget, creating performance art while high on drugs, or coping with his odd family life, the main character's reflections on his childhood in North Carolina are brilliantly written and visually captivating. As the character floats through life without much ambition or self-direction, the reader is often left wondering what weird situation he is going to stumble upon next.In the second half of the book, the character and his boyfriend move to France where his struggle to identify with being American turns out to be as difficult a challenge in a foreign land as back in his own country. Sedaris' talents as a writer shine as he cleverly demonstrates the absurdity of a language lost in translation. His word play, best exemplified in a chapter in which the main character is taking French lessons, adds poetry to humor.I think the unique craft of the book stems from Sedaris' witty use of language in combination with his ability to take a familiar experience and turn it into something extraordinary. Like Sedaris, when growing up in the suburbs, I would go to the shopping mall to take guitar lessons from some slightly \\"outlandish\\" music teacher. While I could have tried to write about my experiences taking guitar lessons, it takes someone like Sedaris to able to observe, remember, and articulate life's little absurdities into one tale. Although in his childhood Sedaris might not have dreamed of talking pretty, this book certainly does that and much more."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Like Garrison Keillor, Sedaris can take mundane events and tease insights out of them in a funny way. He doesn't always like the other characters in his life, however, which sometimes come across as mean - - I find myself wondering how his family reacts when they read these essays. Of course, he doesn't always like himself much either, which makes some of the stories poignant and some just plain sad behind the laughs.Just about essay works well standing alone. My only complaint is that they don't work so well taken as a collection. Several of them concern his experiences living in France but many of them address other topics, such as growing up in North Carolina, lisping, trying to succeed as a performance artist, teaching in an art institute (unsuccessfully), or dealing with the quirks of his family.The title of the book is one of the sentences that he \\"successfully\\" produced in a French language course. The book as a whole would be much stronger if it were built around a single theme, such as the experiences of an American living in France. The other essays could get bumped into a different collection about his family, or whatever."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book hooked me on David Sedaris. I was howling from page one! After finishing this book, I went on to read three more books by him. Thus far, this book has been the one I've enjoyed the most. Maybe it just set the standard too high?(However, I must admit that my husband read the first two pages and never even broke a smile.)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I actually listened to this book on tape/MP3 and have to say that I did thoroughly enjoy it. It was something I would not have normally read, but I figured it was time to read something that was not in my \\"norm\\". I didn't realize that the author was gay until the 2nd or 3rd chapter. That did challenge my pursuit of completing the book, but I realized that I'd be quite prejudiced if I quit listening for that reason alone. For me, the book gave me a better perspective on a lifestyle that has been labeled as \\"just not right\\". Although I don't personally agree with that lifestyle, that doesn't mean I shun it by any means. The book really just described a man who has daily challenges just like any other person. Only difference is sexual preference. I found the work extremely funny in some parts. I really have to recommend this work to anyone who has never taken the time out to learn about a different person. I think we should all do that honestly. Else, how can we truly tout that we appreciate diversity and practice tolerance? We can all stand to step out of our box and learn a little more."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Annotation: A humorous autobiographic novel by David Sedaris outlining random events in his life. His unusual life stories tell of his childhood lisp troubles and speech therapy classes, his guitar lessons taught by a midget, his struggle to become an artist and trying to learn and survive the French culture and language.Author bio: David Sedaris was born in New York and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina. He's openly and happily gay. He lives in Paris with his boyfriend Hugh Hamrick. He has worked as a housecleaner and, as a part-time elf for Macy's. Many of his plays have been produced, and his essays are featured regularly in The New Yorker, Harpers, and Esquire.Evaluation: This was a very very good book. My sister had read it and recommended it to me. This was the first book I had picked up in a long time and was pulled into it by Sedaris' humor. At times, especially during class, I would find myself trying to hold in my laughter as to not make a scene. I usually have a hard time getting into a book when I first start reading, but this book started out with an interesting and of course humorous tale of Sedaris' speech therapy classes. I finished this book in about a week because every time I picked it up, I didn't want to stop reading it. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who needs a good dose of laughter."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Mostly a collection of short stories that build upon one another, David Sedaris' Me Talk Pretty One Day is a refreshing break from the novel format. I took this in with me to the gym to keep me company as I worked out on the treadmill and found myself laughing out loud. It only took me a few work outs to finish, and made the time pass easily.Sedaris truly has a caustic wit. The rest of his books are next on my list."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris has compiled a bunch of wonderful essays. Some definitely aren't as funny as others, but I got a good laugh out of \\"Picka Pocketoni\\". By being able to laugh at himself Sedaris has made it easy for us to laugh at him. I enjoyed his style of writing very much. Although there is no real plot to the book each essay is its own interesting story.Even though I found this book very funny, it is easy to see that not every one would agree with me. I would definitely advise that you read the first chapter before you buy. The funny stories were great, but some you just read because they were there. I give this book four stars because it has good and not so good parts, and it would be easy to have a opposite opinion from me."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I imagine that, in person, David Sedaris is an absolute crackerjack storyteller. He has a gift for nuance and detail; unfortunately, in written form his stories seem to lack backbone. Throughout the entire book, I kept feeling as though a dimension was missing -- that the essays needed some animated hand gestures or verbal emphasis, to complete them.&quot;The Youth in Asia&quot;, a long drawn-out paean to his family's pets, is not nearly as interesting as he thinks it is, and &quot;I Almost Saw this Girl Get Killed&quot; is almost interesting... but not quite. The other essays were better, but only the first one, &quot;Go Carolina&quot; was laugh-out-loud funny."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris has proven himself a very talented writer. His insights into French life, speech impediments, and even eating ones hat are among the funniest I've ever read. ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY is a must read for fans of satire, France, and anyone who wants to laugh uproariously.Sedaris tells many stories on varied topics. Whether he is discussing his speech impediment i.e. a lisp or Americans on a Paris subway, he does so wonderfully. Sedaris crafts his words magically to compose a hilarious story each time around. Few writers can do as he has done. Anyone who appreciates humour and writing as an art form will love this book.If you disapprove of foul language, sensitive topics such as AIDS, or mockeries of the French language, this book is not for you. Including these things is a must in the overall craft and perfection of Sedaris' work. It is advisable to merely overlook these things if they bother you. If you cannot overlook such things, you deprive yourself of a wonderful reading experience.This book is utterly delightful. Nearly every one of the pages has something to make the reader cry from laughter. One can only hope that Sedaris will publish more books of this magnitude. For if he does not, he will rob the world of 'pretty' funny stories. Buy ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY and be prepared to laugh often."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I've never reviewed a book I haven't finished before, but I'm only on page 77 of Me Talk Pretty One Day and I had to take a break; I couldn't breathe from laughing so hard. As soon as I would recover I'd read another sentence, or even another phrase, and off I'd go again. It got so bad that the tears of laughter splashed onto the lenses of my glasses. I was actually crying from laughing; I had to blow my nose and everything.OK, I think I'm nearly ready to go back in. I suggest you join me."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is so funny! Many times I laughed until I cried and had to put the book down because my sides were splitting!His writing is amazing and the way he tells stories is even better than that.A must-read for everyone!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"After breaking three ribs on a vacation boating accident, I was layed up at home for a few days. I had picked up &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; a few weeks prior after recognizing the name Sedaris as being the brother of Amy Sedaris. I was skeptical at first, as I am not a big fan of short stories or &quot;essays&quot;.How wrong I was! After reading the first few chapters of this book, I realized that I had to wait awhile before I could continue! Every page I read had me laughing so hard it hurt too much to read on! It was literally side splitting!Now that I'm feeling a bit better and have finished &quot;Me Talk Pretty&quot;, I've just purchased &quot;Barrel Fever&quot; and ordered &quot;Holidays On Ice&quot;. All I can hope for is that Mr. Sedaris is busy on his next book because I'm almost healed and ready for more!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I bought this for a beach vacation where I wanted to relax and enjoy my day. This book was perfect! It was a no-brainer book that made me smile. Since I'd never read a Sedaris book before, I didn't know what to expect. The book was filled with many stories starting while he was a child and funny things that happens with children and their families (well maybe not most families), and then moved into his college and adult life. I particularly enjoyed the stories he wrote about speaking French... the shopping experiences in France while trying to figure out an objects gender was too funny. I must say this book was a pleasant surprise."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I get the majority of my reading done at the gym, and ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY took my cardio to a whole other level: breathless choking! Now I know the literal meaning of the saying &quot;I almost died laughing!&quot;"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris is a must (i'd underline must, but I can't so let's just pretend it is underlined) for anyone with an ironic sense of humor. He tells stories involving the period he spent in France with his boyfriend, and clearly outlines all the guidelines for choosing a boyfriend, all the while pointing out the stupity of situations in his own sarcastic way. The story involving his younger sister, and her flair for disguises, is worth the price of admission alone. Whether you are gay, straight, greek or polish, if you enjoy dysfunctional fun, Me Talk Pretty One Day is the book for you."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I bought this for my Kindle because I had lent my paper copy and never saw it again.

I don't read a lot of books, but this had me acting a fool as I laughed out loud to myself while turning the pages."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is so funny you are compelled to read it out loud. And it is so good that it is still hilarious and your audience (ie husband) is also helpless with laughter. Just wish it was longer. Now I will have to buy all his other books."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I've read several of Sedaris' books and find \\"Me Talk Pretty\\" to be the funniest and most fleshed out. From a (painfully) awkward childhood comes a plethora of hilarious recollections and musings. I was reading this at the Dr's office waiting for biopsy results (seriously), but people probably thought I was losing my mind, as I was guffawing like a moron.Sedaris' has a very unique voice and he turns the most banal life situations into one roller coaster ride of hilarity. He also perfectly balances \\"telling\\" a story and personal reflection. The pace and timing are always right on. Some authors get caught up in over analyzing their own motivations, or get too bogged down in certain details, but not Sedaris.I blog and see many who try to emulate Sedaris' style, but there's only one David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Oh lovely David Sedaris. You had me laughing out loud on an 18 hour road and plane trip. Your wit is pinpoint accurate and just on the right side of over-the-top. Fantastic. I will be buying all of your books."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Ok, to be fair, it really is a matter of just \\"I can't relate to this material\\". The book is written as a series of autobiographical stories are disjointed and largely interesting. I read the reviews about \\"laugh out loud\\" - I may have snickered in five places, but I didn't find anything that was worthy of laughing. All I kept thinking is that I have waaaay better material for this kind of a memoir; but really, maybe he's funny to some. Me...not so much."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"One of my all time favorite books! Had it in hardcover and now put it on my Kindle, I have read it several times, and laugh out loud each and every time I read it!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"How I wish I really knew David Sedaris. After reading this book in little more than an afternoon, I'm convinced he's the most lovable, most interesting, most entertaining companion you could hope for. The book is a collection of essays, reminiscences of his life here and there and then and now. He describes a family of eccentrics, and as different as David is from most of us, he is far from being the most eccentric. Odd folks, but people who love each other. David also treats us to uncommonly honest self-appraisals without weighing it down with justification or motivation or judgment. And, oh yes, it's funny! Not every page, though every page is interesting, but lots of pages are laugh out loud hilarious. I suspect not everyone would find it so, maybe only those of us who think we're more sophisticated and subtle than everyone else. But those who enjoy a good snicker and the occasional guffaw will love this book.From Gretchen Craig, author ofCrimson Sky, which is wonderful, but really not funny."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Given that Amazon includes a track list for CDs, it seems odd that the same information isn't available for audiobooks. This audio version of Sedaris' book is apparently \\"abridged\\" -- it would be nice to know what's been left out."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is like one of those comedians you see on TV that you think is funny enough to channel squat around, but you don't remember a single joke s/he told in a week. The routine is publishable, doesn't stick in the mind, and would be 'meh' if you saw it a second time. That's how I feel about this book. It's amusing, but ultimately lacking substance.I thought the funniest parts were about Dave's sister Amy and not about Dave. Dave comes on strong with opinions, though they are couched in wit, and I didn't always agree. Maybe I saw the cynicism behind the humor? This soured the good mood the book creates.This is a great book to borrow from a library, but not a good book to own unless you find it hilarious. For me, it's not a re-reader, thus three stars. I enjoyed it while reading, but I would not enjoy reading it again."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I found this is another laugh out loud book with appeal to a wide range of readers ranging from my super cool inner city hipster relatives to my fellow senior citizens. As a failed student of beginner Spanish and ex-teacher the descriptions of attempting to learn another language particularly hilarious."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Its funny and not anything that I would expect. I found his storylines had many undertones and it was hilarious and heartbreaking at times. A wonderfully entertaining book based on David Sedaris' life."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"We picked the book for our December book club since we tend to have our holiday pot luck then. We like light reads in December. Came with very high reviews, but many in the group did not find it funny. I found it entertaining and funny at times. One book member thought it was quite funny, but most were luke warm. Funniest if read over time and not in one sitting, I think. It's a short, easy read at any rate."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"i bought this book years ago and i enjoyed the read so much that i decided to purchase it myself"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris delivers once again. His take on life and the every day happenings in his familyare so wildly absurd, yet somehow believable, that you never want his books to end."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY, I litterally laughed out loud uncontrollable, throughout the book.

Repeatedly!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This condition of this book was 'not as advertised', however, it gets a pass because it is so funny. I so enjoyed it that I ordered a couple more of his books; none of which can 'hold a candle' to this one. Of course, my sense of humor may very well be some else's horror story. So, who's to say?"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was sooo funny and honest. I love David's stories and read all his books after starting with this. The others were mostly good as well (save Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk), but this was probably my favorite."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"After years of thinking of reading Sedaris, a friend strongly recommended this book to me, and I'm delighted he did.

Any book that causes you to lose composure is a good one.David Sedaris lets you in on his life experiences with wit, self-depracation and humor.Do kids with lisps automatically end up gay? How do you let your music teacher know that you don't want to name your guitar after a woman? How stupid do Americans really look to Europeans?The books feels like you're drinking one-too-many with a new friend, and getting lost in their unique family stories. He has an awesome abilty of writing in a voice that's at once easy to read, and equally as easy to see played out internally. You'll have trouble putting it down!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"yOU know if you do care about what others would think of you, just do yourslef a favor and read this book when you are home. After reading the first story, I thought I could manage holding my laughs so I went out in public and start getting into it. Boy, I had to leave the cafe' soon cuz nobody in that place had any doubts that I am either lack some manners or crazy. The book is full of provoking jokes..But if you think of it, you just cant help but grining. From batteling with the letter \\"s\\" and all those trying hard to fix his flaws to putting up with his father saving up till starvation, Mr sedaris was helarious in dealing with every shot in his life..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I really liked this book,for a few reasons. One It was written really well. And two it was hilarously funny. His discription was also very good. I usually read fanasty and I thought this would be some stupid book that every one was telling me to read. But i was proved wrong by the fist chapter. My favorite chapter was \\"You can't kill the Rooster\\". The way his brother acts, I thought that it was really funny.I was wondering throughout the book whether the book is true or he just used his name for the main character. I would recomend this book to any one who likes to laugh...a lot"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The rooster is what I call myself whenput in a threatening situation. David Sedaris has tried to kill the rooster. Twice. One time, I was in the Seattle Airport eating some recommended by Oprah fried chicken,and I waslaughing so hard at Barrel Fever that I actually choked on Oprah's chicken and had to pull a bone out of my throat. The rooster choked on chicken. ........Well, the second time Sedaris almost killed me was last week when I was reading the story \\"You Can't kill The Rooster\\". This is a story about his brother who is so very different from the rest of his family. This is a masterwork in storytelling and and character. I was laughing so hard that I nearly died.....People argue that Sedaris is inconsistent. I certainly didn't laugh out loud at all the pieces but I did at least thirty percent of them. I really can't think of a time I have laughed at thirty percent of anything........In this world of guarded storytelling, Sedaris is not afraid to show his warts, his families blemishes, and the world's scabs. Whether it be teaching,tourism,fancy restaurants, Easter(Jesus Shaves in another hilarious piece)or living in a foreign country,Sedaris consistently translates the plight of the odd man out in such a way that you laugh until you choke on a chicken bone, but you can't help but think about the pieces for a while after. ...This is a highly hilarious and recommendable work."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My dad was the one who told me I should read this book. I wasn't convinced it would be good, because I usually hate nonfiction. It took me 3 months to finally pick up the book, and I'm glad I did! David Sedaris tells stories about his life with such wit you'll wonder why he was such a bad English teacher when he made the students watch soap operas!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The book Me Talk Pretty One Day, by David Sedaris, is an absolutely hilarious book. The whole time that I read it, I laughed. This book is a collection of humorous essays by Sedaris, based on episodes of his lifetime, which he took upon himself to embellish and make funnier.My favorite parts of the book were his French speaking efforts. Teachers who hate him and would rather have a cesarean section than be with him and his problems learning the language make these sections funnier than most. Another good essay is \`The Fatty Suit,' in which his sister Amy wears a fat suit to make their father, who is obsessed with being in shape, upset.Need a good laugh? Read this book. It is roll on the floor laugh your bum off funny."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I hate short stories. They leave me wondering why the author didn't think the character or the plot significant enough to explore in the greater detail of a novel. That said, I really enjoyed Sedaris's &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;. The first half of the book, &quot;One&quot;, was filled with stories about Sedaris's family. Stories of the sort that every family retells around the kitchen table when gathered together again as 'grown-ups' (Remember the time Amy came home in the fat suit and dad thought she'd REALLY gained all that weight?!? Mom and Dad love that new dog more than they EVER loved us kids when we lived at home!). Amusing and fun to read. &quot;Deux (Two)&quot; recounts Sedaris's time as an &quot;ex-pat&quot; in France. Having struggled through French, German and Spanish myself and watching my own ESL students learn to untangle reflexives made this half of the book particularly amusing. Fun, witty, loony and irresistibly funny: just like the reviews say."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"About a year ago, my brother, while visting, accidently left his copy of Naked behind. I read it, and i got hooked. I waited forMe Talk Pretty One Dayto come out for so long, and i was not dissapointed. It is...hilarious. Other reviewers of this book have spoken their dissapointment because the book is not continuosly sidespliting. It doesn't need to be. Sedaris has the remarkable talent for bringing the humourous out of the ordinary. He writes casualy, as if his readers already know him. His caustic and biting writing style and pleasing and more often than not, just funny. He pokes at everyone, his family and himself. His stories are believable, but only just, which makes them all the more interesting. He writes like a normal, everyday person, expressing normal everday occurences and thoughts. His work can be sad and extremley funny at the same time. He hit the nail right on the head in most of the stories, after reading the book, i realized that i agreed with him on most everything he wrote. This man is amazingly persuasive and exceptionally funny. I reccomend this book to anyone looking for a good read!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is a review of the CD audio book version of ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY. I want to say from the start that if you have the choice of reading the printed book or listening to a recording of it, I would strongly recommend the audio book version. I know hundreds of thousands of people have listened to books on tape or CD, but this was a first for me. And I can't imagine a better book to start off with. While I enjoy reading Sedaris on page, he is the perfect reader of his own stories. I wouldn't want to listen to him read Jane Austen or Tolstoy, but I also wouldn't want to hear anyone else read these stories.Sound wise, the recordings are overall good. Several of the recordings are of live performances in front of crowds, and in many ways, these are the more enjoyable. I found myself getting more involved in the stories as the crowds did. However, in reading live, Sedaris sometimes sounds a bit strained and thin in his voice. Several of the stories were recorded in studios, and while his voice is much lower and less strained, the performances don't have quite the same degree of vitality as the live performances. I also found the music that accompanied some of the studio recordings to be a bit distracting.As far as the stories themselves go, while a few of the stories come from the periods of his life that his readers have come to know from previous books, most of them come from adulthood, and even from his period of success as an author. Probably half of the stories come from the time he has spent living in France, apparently struggling against the limits of his own French (the title comes from a literal English translation of a statement he makes in a French class about his goals with that language). Whether one prefers this book to NAKED hangs upon nothing but one's own personality. I prefer NAKED, but prefer hearing Sedaris reading his work to reading it myself. I think the main thing is that the work is consistently good through all the books.So, whether you read this yourself or listen to David read it to you, I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was so hilarious I listened to it twice, bought a tape for my parents and sister to listen to, then gave my copy to a friend to enjoy. There were times I laughed so hard that I was as close to crying as I could get...actually, I WAS crying and I think I looked hysterical with grief while listening in my car! I will DEFINITELY order and listen to other books by Mr. Sedaris!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"While all of his books are hilarious, this book in particular ranks as my personal favorite. It was difficult NOT to laugh out loud."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is one of those books where you have to finish reading the chapter before judging it. At first, what David talks about seems judgmental - ie talking about the teacher that he didn't think of as human, or the midget teacher; however once you get to the end, he ties everything together very well and in a way make the reader feel guilty about all of the times we've judged someone and found out they were just like us.Becoming one of my favorite Authors."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Absolutely loved this book. It's easily my favorite Sedaris book. Just readThe Cost of Livingand it totally reminded me of \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", so much so I had to re-read it again."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris has the uncanny ability to remember every weird, funny thing that ever happened to him, then the wonderful talent to put it all into words. All of his books are laugh out loud must reads! I would not advise reading David Sedaris on public transportation unless you don't mind strangers asking \\"what's so funny\\"? My daughter told me about this wonderful book, then I had to get all the others, this purchased hard cover is for my Mom. Mr. Sedaris' humor reaches every generation."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This collection of anecdotes left me feeling slightly empty. I didn't know if I should feel good about what author David Sedaris has accomplished or feel bad for what appears to be a slightly unfortunate life. Although the stories didn't contain tragedy they also weren't uplifting. I certainly didn't laugh out loud at any of them but I did smile at a couple. Sedaris is an excellent writer in terms of style and clarity and his pacing was perfect. My time reading this book just flew by. This is the first book by Sedaris that I have read but I am not sure that I would read another. I have read some books by Bill Bryson and have preferred those."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Item was shipped and received promptly and in the condition described. I'm happy with the product and the vendor and would use them again."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Parts of this book are interesting, others not so much. The book begins when David Sedaris finds he must go for speech therapy because he lisps. The speech therapist says he has a lazy tongue. However, his sister has a lazy leg, his other two sisters have lazy eyes. Lazy body parts seem to run in his family. All this speech therapy gives this book its' name.David's father loves jazz and hopes his kids will be musicians. He signs up David and his two sisters for music lessons. David is to play guitar. His teacher is a tiny little man, a midget and a fantastic dresser. This little man, who was so much shorter than David, loves good, expensive clothes. To end this chapter, the three kids quit their lessons to their father's chagrin. Pop wants musicians. As for the kids, back to watching television with mom.Another chapter begins with Sister Gretchen's beautiful art work. Her art is presented in schools, then in shows. David decides to become an artist also. He tries and tries, but no talent. But he does work hard at trying. And finally he does have shows. He pokes fun at some art. And he writes about the time he tried to become an artist.David tells about Brother Paul's colorful language. Mr Sedaris writes abut his animal friends, his cat Neil that loved to mouse. Neil was unhappy when she wasn't hunting. She felt useless. The parent Sedaris had a huge dog named Melina. Malina was more of his parent's child than their own six kids. The older couple had more pictures of that dog than they had of their kids.Mr Sedaris moves to Chicago from eastern North Carolina. He then moves to New York City. He gets a job with a wealthy woman who likes to pretend she is very poor. Beside this, the lady is excentric and quite laughable with her strange ways and ideas as David tells the readers. She throws tantrums like a two year old. David's next job is with a communist who employs many strange people. This employer is in the moving business.Davud's family is different. Papa Lou worries about his four daughters. They are getting too fat. Daughter Amy does everything to frustrate her father. She wears strange clothes, eats fattening food, all this to aggravate her father. Father likes his fruit overly ripe plus he has other strange ways of eating. Mr Sedaris attracts odd people, both family, friends and all those he comes into contact with.This book contains essays about how David deals with life. There is the old adage \\"life happens to you when you're making other plans.\\"Then David meets his true love and moves to France. Hugh wants to live in France though David is somewhat afraid of the move. Hugh has led an exciting life with much travel, different adventures which makes David's life in North Carolina seem boring. David is envious. The section of the book where David moves to France is comical. He goes to French language school and meets more quirky people. The French teacher is quite mean and makes fun of her students. She is quite good about humiliating them. Living in France is hysterical especially as he tells about foreign students trying to learn to speak French.The second part of the book is funnier, but the first part is funny.I liked this book better the second time I read it. David Sedaris is quite a satirist and a humorist."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Per my review at [...]David Sedaris has become one of our era's most beloved essayists since the publication of his first collection, Barrel Fever, in 1994. His books are no strangers on the bestseller lists and many of his essays have become staples in writing classes. In short, Sedaris' humor and wit have epitomized what modern short works require to appeal to the masses. And yet, Sedaris would probably be the last to say he's a literary genius and the first to question the sanity of his cult following. Sedaris's secret weapon is his penchant for self-deprecation, which creates a bond absent in the works of preachy, overconfident writers.Me Talk Pretty One Day was Sedaris's first true break into the writing world back in 2000. In this collection of short stories about his childhood and his years living in France, Sedaris addresses such topics as speech therapy, modern \\"art\\", pets, foreign languages, and technology. The most impressive part of the collection is Sedaris's ability to put himself in his childhood mindset as well as tap into his thoughts as an adult without disrupting the flow of the narratives. The essays all come together to create one book with a cohesive voice. From \\"Giant Dreams, Midget Abilities\\" (in which a young David is forced to take guitar lessons from a midget when all he really wants to do is sing jingles) to \\"Picka Pocketoni\\" (in which an adult Sedaris muses over an American couple who assume he is French and thus hold nothing back as they talk about him in English), readers are guaranteed a healthy dose of laughs and \\"I know what you mean\\" moments.Take the essay \\"Today's Special.\\" Sedaris laments the loss of simplicity in America's favorite past time: eating. Anyone who has ever looked at a menu and wondered whether it is in a foreign language or not will empathize with Sedaris and his wish that restaurants would Keep It Simple, Stupid. \\"I'd order the skirt steak with a medley of suffocated peaches,\\" Sedaris writes, \\"but I'm put off by the aspirin sauce. The sea scallops look good until I'm told they're served in a broth of malt liquor and mummified litchi nuts.\\" He ends the piece by praising the hot dog - \\"so simple and timeless, I can recognize it, immediately, as food.\\"\\"Twelve Moments in the Life of an Artist\\" is a perfect example of Sedaris's willingness to make fun of himself and also make a point. Sedaris gives readers a timeline of his dabbles in the art world (and the drug world) while questioning what some people call \\"art\\" today. \\"This was the art world I'd been dreaming of, where God-given talent was considered an unfair advantage and a cold-blooded stare merited more praise than the ability to render human flesh,\\" Sedaris muses.Me Talk Pretty One Day is funny and thought-provoking from beginning to end. If you're in search of a good laugh or an interesting perspective on the little things in life, Sedaris can offer you both and more."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is exciting, funny and a great read.

It's especially funny because I lived in France and studied French so I can identify with quite a bit of what he says. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I just heard David Sedaris read from this book on the David Letterman Show, and if the rest of the book is as funny as this it will be a good book! I alomst fell out of my chair laughing!! Oh my gosh i'm buying the book right now!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"After breezing through Sedaris' previous three books -- all of which had me laughing out loud -- I found this fourth entry in his collection to be a bit of a non-starter. The second half of his essays, in which he details his experience as an ex-pat living with his boyfriend in France, whizzes by with typically sardonic Sedaris wit. But the first half felt stunted, tired, and a bit...dare I say it? Unfunny. I guess I expected a bit more. The droll humor didn't quite do it for me."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book cracked me up. I bought it for a few of my friends... He is very synical, but VERY funny! I would read it again..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This latest book by David Sedaris is a scream. One of the wittiest &amp; humorous writers of our time. A must read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This latest book by David Sedaris is a scream. One of the wittiest &amp; humorous writers of our time. A must read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Between him and his sister Amy, this has to be one of the funniest families ever. Part of the reason I bought the book was in the hopes to discover what their parents did to make them so funny. But it seems after reading it that it has to do more with Genetic luck than any environmental circumstances. Oh well.My parental hopes aside, this is so funny. I couldn't read it at night because I would wake my wife up with my laughter. The essay on his brother is worth the price of the book alone. People here seem to have a higher opinion of Naked, so if it's better than this, which would suprise me, I can't wait to read it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is hilarious. I love the way Sedaris' views the world. I couldn't figure out how he was able to afford all that he did (live in Paris, travel around everywhere) being a cleaning person and on drugs though. I don't recommend this to conservative people. His observations are Seinfeldish and a step beyond, making them even better than Seinfeld."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Great reading! Many of the people he writes about seem all too familiar (fortunately or unfortunately). I was laughing so hard my neighbors think I was hitting the nitrous oxide a little too hard! From the Carolinas to Normandy, he just points out how funny we humans really are and can be!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is a wonderful observer of his world, and has a delightful way of reporting his observations with humor and quality writing. In \`Me Talk Pretty, ' Sedaris takes us on an autobiographical tour of his early years and his time in Paris. The writing is deliciously fresh with sentences that paint vivid word pictures and make you laugh out loud.I think what makes this book a real gift is that Sedaris looks at the foibles in his life. There are real encounters that we all experience, but Sedaris has the courage to report his with honesty and humor. Don't miss reading this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Can you laugh any harder?!? From the beginning to the end, he does it again with great stories...some of which hits too close to home! Many of the people, fortunately or unfortunately, sounds all too familiar! Laughed all through &quot;2&quot;! (My neighbors think I ve gone mad!) Great writing, must read a second or third time to catch it all!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Because of its dry wit and insights into people from all walks of life, this is one of the funniest books I've read in a long time--laugh out loud uncontrolably kind of funny. Being an American living in France, I can totally identify with his take on both cultures and thoroughly enjoyed his writing style."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read this back in 2000 and am reading it again now because it's darn funny! If you want funny, read this. You can tell Sedaris is a smart guy who'd probably get along with Bob Dylan."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was introduced to David Sedaris by a friend who read aloud one of the stories in this book. I laughed so hard I almost peed in my pants. I immediately ordered the book and read it in a couple of days. The book is really funny, you'll find yourself laugh out loud all the time. Everything about his stories are great, he is honest about his less that completely normal life and family.Naturally some of the stories are better than others, some just get an occasional smile, but some will have your sides hurting. I'd recommend this book to anybody"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"i have really come to appreciate the type of humor i find in david sedaris books. he really has a way of saying a phrase that is completely hilarious but if he said it in a conversation it would really sound matter of fact. i love the way that he puts his thoughts down on paper it almost resembles a stream of consciousness type of style. i also admire the way he sees people, and i think that i relate well to the writing because i often see people in the same way he does. i dont feel like it is a dislike for all people, but rather a questioning of how do some of the people of this world continue living from day to day. the writing style is excellent and very readable. his stories are all humorous and it is quite interesting to view his world for a while because there are some people that could only dream to live a life as interesting as his. like always there is the same interesting mix of characters, and by characters i mean his family. the last story of the book about his father and the rotten food is quite amusing. the second to the last story is also very funny but with an underlying serious tone to it. the seriousness involves the task of kicking destructive habits and the funny part is how sedaris pretends to be other people with grand accomplishments. finally, the funniest story i found was the first in the book, it deals with his childhood problem of a lisp and his multiple trials with his speech therapist. the links he went to in order to avoid the letter s are very inventive and amusing. this is a very solid book and worth the read as is all of his other works. always approach these books with an open mind in order to really enjoy and when you do you are sure to have a good time."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Few books can make me laugh out loud (WARNING: do NOT read this in the library's \\"Quiet Room\\"; you will not be able to hold it back and may burst at the seams), but this one succeeded. The only thing better than reading this book is listening to it on CD as Sedaris himself reads from the pages. His comical high pitched voice and impeccable sense of comedic timing works on so many levels, you gotta hear him deliver the lines himself. I would give the audio version 5 stars because it is funnier to hear it rather than read it but still this book delivers! Read it and laugh (...)!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Hilarious. I see people reading this on the subway, and I watch for the smile. It always comes. Laugh-out-loud essays on everything from speaking German to turds. A little crass at times, but that never bothered me much. Maybe the funniest book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I had never been able to laugh out loud in a book until I discovered David Sedaris. I am happy to say that I think this is the best book of his that I have read and on many occassions I was in hysterics.He has such a way of relaying what everyone else thinks.Read this book!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"It's been a while, but David Sedaris' essay in this book about his inability to remember the difference between the masculine and feminine endings of French nouns still makes me chuckle from time to time. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was just introduced to Me Talk Pretty One Day by a friend last month, since then I have read 3 books by Sedaris. I find his writing extremely entertaining. While I am reading his books and laughing to myself my 4 year old son keeps asking \\"what is so funny?\\"."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read this book straight through as I waited to be called for jury duty and laughed harder than I can ever remember. Caution: this book may offend more sensitive readers -- I probably wouldn't recommend it to my mother -- but this book is so unforgettably funny that I might even show her some of the stories -- such as the title story, where a class of students try to explain the death of Jesus to each other in broken French. Just thinking about it makes me want to read the book again."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"this is a great book to read while working out. It will keep you laughing and unaware of the pain you may be in. I can't wait for David's next book!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My brother recommended this book. I took it on a flight from Atlanta to Barcelona and laughed out loud the whole way. If you enjoy intelligent humor you'll get a kick out of the stories in this book. Lots of fun."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"which will leave your stomach feeling happy and your face muscles loose...laughing at its best!! =)Well, what can I say about David Sedaris..hmmm...he is by far the most sardonic author I have stumbled upon!! =) I have also caught him on NPR a few times on the show \\"This American Life!!!\\" He keeps you interested at the same time laughing out loud at his carefully written stories with language detail!! =)He discusses speech impediment,homosexuality, friends, relatives (Rooster...the funny rebel bro...=), etc... This book is all about life and its various facets that one can on occassion overlook...the little things that he describes make the most hilarious settings!!! =) Happy Reading!!! =)His book \\"NAKED\\" is on my list next... =)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Well, I can't certify to some readers' comments that this book is laugh-out-loud funny. I find it humorous and poignant through out. Some essays I laughed, some I pondered, and some made me think. However, I like this book a lot, especially the tapes read by the author himself."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris delivers a delightful array of autobiographical moments in &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; The author not only forces the reader to laugh out loud, but beneath the mirth are serious and thoughtful moments. The poignancy and humor are a delightful mix.The first chapter sets the stage as Sedaris describes his speech therapy in a Carolina grade school. The school is trying to correct his lisp. In reality they are concerned about his potential homosexuality. Sedaris has fun describing the scene. Beneath the surface you feel his anguish.The rest of the book is a colorful blur of stories about his family, early jobs and other facets of his life. Two highlighted phases is an early addiction to speed and a later residency in Paris. In each incident Sedaris is a clown when it comes to self-depreciation, but his smiles lightly cloaks some more serious themes.I recommend &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; because of the diverse perspective it delivers. At minimum you will be entertained. At the same time David Sedaris introduces real social and cultural issues without sermonizing."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"In this book, the reader can empathize with the difficulties children and adults have, while learning to speak correctly. Mr. Sedaris starts with \\"s\\" difficulties, and after conquering that, continues on with his life to encounter drug problems and the French language.The humor Mr. Sedaris displays while painting vivid pictures of his father, who has unique shopping and eating habits, and his boyfriend, who grew up in Africa, are very entertaining. I especially like the descriptions of Africa that he tells, making them sound as if they were his own memories, rather than his boyfriend's.Overall, I found the book to be very good, but enjoyed some parts more than others."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"There are moments in this book where you'll have to stop and catch your breath. If I felt the need to read aloud from the book I found myself giving pause to gather the strength needed to continue on. The stories in this book are, in my opinion, lighter than those one would find in &quot;Naked&quot;. The style is the same but the laughs come much more often."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was my first Sedaris book. Needless to say, it won't be my last. While there were a few stories that left me searching for the punchline, the majority of them were hilarious! I haven't laughed this much since reading \\"Without Feathers\\" by Woody Allen. I also enjoyed the diversity of the stories presented; it wasn't uncommon for a story about social inequality to be followed by one rife with toilet humor. My advice--read this book!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"In this book, David Sedaris gives us a comical look into his life, starting with when he was pulled out of classes in 5th grade for Speech Therapy, and continuing through his French lessons in Paris. The strange events that he recounts give the reader vivid details about his unique history of growing up with a father that had strange shopping and eating habbits, and his own wildly liberal college education.I especially liked the chapter where he was recounting his boyfriend's childhood in Africa, as if he had been there himself. His details make it possible to imagine that you were actually there, too."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"One day I happened to walk into an overcrowded bookstore where some unknown-to-me author was doing a signing. &quot;What's all the fuss,&quot; I asked my daughter and with my interest aroused I listened to this quirky little man doing some readings. Soon I was screaming with laughter along with the crowd and my now favorite author had been discovered. His outlook on life and stories about friends and family (especially zany sister Amy - one of David Letterman's best continuously returning guests) just holds the readers' interest until forced to put down the book. I was recently in an airport and noticed a lady reading &quot;Me Talk...&quot;, and everytime she laughed I did also trying to picture where she might be. The only problem with David is: he hasn't written enough material. I can't wait for the next release."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Maybe I'm too straight laced. Just didn't think all of this was &quot;laugh out loud funny.&quot;"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Yuck! Someone said it was funny but I thought it was boring. I like his NPR show better."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David had a brilliantly funny one with Naked, I laughed, I loved. But I was disappointed with Me Talk Pretty One Day, the reviews hyped it up to be this extraordinary passage of life abroad, but it took forever to get abroad. It was not as funny as Naked and I expected way too much."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'd heard great things about this book, especially how hysterically funny the author is. I suppose his humor just isn't my style. Many of the stories were mean and made his family out to be grotesque beyond belief. Perhaps David Sedaris' family is accurately portrayed here, but I find that hard to swallow.My major problem with this book was the tone of the narration; Sedaris seems so self-satisfied, and in my opinion he thinks he is much wittier than he really is. This attitude came through in his stories and was a real turnoff to me.However, some of the things he wrote did make me laugh and won me over to some degree. I don't find Sedaris a brilliant comic writer, but I don't feel my time reading his book was completely wasted."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I must admit, while I found some of his stories interesting and things I could relate to, and very easy to read, I don't understand all of the raves about him - the funniest writer around, side-splittingly funny, etc. A friend who has read other things by him thought that it might just be an acquired taste, as she has found each of his works progressively funnier. Sorry, but I really didn't like reading it, kept waiting for it to be over, and would have put it down if I wasn't reading it for a book club. Just being honest."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"As David Sedaris relishes reminding the reader on every page, he may be a homosexual, but he is certainly not gay. In fact, much of Mr. Sedaris's book seems to reflect a determination to destroy every stereotype, every prejudice, that the biased reader may carry about his demographic. If such a reader picks up this book assuming that he will be reading of a sunny fellow, respectful of the arts, of learning, of variety, of new experiences, that assumption won't last for long. The author is grouchy about pretty much everything, and the more something is alien to his personal customs, the less he likes it.You might think that I disliked this book because I dislike the curmudgeonly style of humor; but you'd be wrong. I quite enjoy a good curmudgeon, the operative word being \\"good\\". An Edward Abbey or a Bill James or a Mark Twain can be quite caustic, but with a difference. These other curmudegeons are judgmental of the rest of humanity mainly because they possess a particular vision of how the world should be, and humanity isn't holding up its end of the bargain. But Sedaris doesn't really seem to know what he wants; one detects no alternative vision. The reader only knows that pretty much everything irritates him.Between the covers of this book, the author derides every subject under the sun: performance art, teachers, students, well-meaning but misguided fathers (well, one anyway, the author's own, whom I pitied), computers, boorish tourists in New York City and in Paris, and haute cuisine, among others.What he actually likes is less clear. At one point he contrasts the old typewriters favorably with today's computers, and not very convincingly. If computers didn't exist, one suspects that Sedaris would be writing pieces complaining about stuck keys, papers dislodged from the roller, or typos created just as he was completing a page.He also seems to like his siblings somewhat, but only because they join in tormenting his beleaguered father, with their profanity and their dress.All of which would be forgiven if Sedaris were really that funny. But he isn't. He rather reminds me of that girl who sat in the back of one's middle school class, rolling her eyes, making fun of everyone and everything. A few other kids think her act is amusing, but for the rest of us, it wears thin quickly. Usually that girl didn't have much to offer on her own, it was her way of fighting her own demons. Which seems to be the case here. Ridicule and wit are two different things.Not that it's all bad. The chapter wherein Sedaris confronts a, uh, well, shall we say, a \\"deposit\\" left behind by the last user of the bathroom is pretty funny. And there's an occasional, very occasional, wry phrase along the way.But most of the pieces are rather mean-spirited diatribes. You can almost sense him lying in wait to lampoon the visitor from the hustings to New York City, dissecting her every word and move so that he can project superiority. So too with the boorish Americans he meets in Paris. If neither existed, he would have invented them, and for all we know, he might have.Sedaris might seem to have some standing to be judgmental of others if he himself didn't come off as so closed-minded. The chapter on food is classic; he spends the whole piece complaining about how there are too many novel ingredients, piled too high on his plate. Memo to David Sedaris: New York City does serve Big Macs for those who want them.I rate this a 2 rather than a 1 because it's an easy, light read. I did smile once or twice.But mostly I wanted to finish the book, take a shower, clear my mind of it, and then to read something more uplifting. You know that girl I mentioned in the back of your middle school class? You hang around with her too long, and pretty much you're rolling your eyes, too, and mocking everyone and everything you come across. This book made me want to get away from Mr. Sedaris and to hang out with someone I liked a lot more."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I can't deny that this book is really funny, I got hooked from the first page reading about his speech problem but after several chapters, I lost interest, it is really hilarious to read about his family, but then the comic mood didn't satisfy me as a reader wanting more essence to his novel. It became a narration of a gay 40 something male and his wretched life, from drugs, failure in school, living in Paris with his boyfriend and really nothing substantial. Even when he talks about his family and how weird they are, you laugh hard, but then he leaves it as an open window for you to comment. You wonder what made him lead such a life, his parents? the way he grew up?The writing is easy and smooth. You feel sometimes as if he is actually talking to you which makes it a fun read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read this book because an acquaintance claimed it was one of the funniest books he'd ever read. The stories are neat and well-written, but not unusually funny. The comedy is mainstream and fairly common, meaning that it can very easily be duplicated. Most readers could themselves come up with stories about their own lives that are equally funny. Mild humor, I laughed out loud only once. This book is highly overrated. If you're interested in the true comedy, read PG Wodehouse."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was recommended by some friends who were commenting about \\"the Rooster\\", which I did find funny. The book is simply that, superficial funny anecdotes. A guy rambling and humorizing about some of what were probably embarrassing and difficult periods of his life.... at his own expense. Directionless and pointless but funny."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is one of my favorites of all time! David Sedaris will not disappoint any readers. It is entertaining on so many levels. His clever storytelling and witty commentary will have you laughing out loud as you read! All of his books are hilarious and clever, but this one tops the list. I recommend this book to everyone with an appreciation for good humor."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I am in a creative writing class taught by an author. She heard my short story and told me to pick up this book and read it to see how to link \\"events\\" and \\"stories\\". UGH. I am slogging through this book. The language is awful. I didn't laugh to myself or outloud. I didn't read anything in this other than stories from life. Why not just write a memoire?The events are not in chronilogical order. I did not find the stories about drug use funny. The sarcastic stories about his siblings came off as mean and disconnected. I feel obligated to finish this book because my writing teacher wanted me to read it, but I am so not looking forward to it. I wish I could ask my teacher to reimburse me the $10.00 I spent on the book for my kindle."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I picked this book up expecting a good read based on it's best seller status, I was mistaken. This entire book is nothing more then the stupid ramblings of an Idiot. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was looking for a good laugh, and many reviews led me to believe that Sedaris would come through, but this book is a disaster. I got a minor chuckle at best, and a great put-me-to-sleep at worst. If you're hoping for humor, go elsewhere."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Maybe I'm missing something but this book isn't funny, in fact, it's unreadable. I heard so much about this author I had to read something from him, and I couldn't get past a few chapters. Maybe his sister, Amy, got all the humor genes in their family."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I found this book exceptionally unexceptional. The author's greatest talent seems to be at surrounding himself with interesting people who are themselves funny and noteworthy. It's a good, light read but nothing that hasn't been done (in fiction and non-fiction) for years by the likes of Woody Allen, Philip Roth, Henry Rollins..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I just bought this book as an e-book. I feel that I wasted my money and my time so far. I'm to page 53 and haven't found anything funny in the book yet. I'm not sure I'll be able to finish it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Everybody is entitled to their own opinions...i just feel I was duped into reading this by all of the positive reviews I read on Amazon and all over the back page. About 100 pages into this thing I couldn't go on anymore, it's just a waste of time. I didn't understand that point of the book...it wasn't funny....wasn't interesting....no points....I can go on and on.That being said, it is definitely down there but it is not the most-overrated \\"comedy\\" I have read, that would go to \\"Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself\\" by Alan Alda. If you want to read a funny book go for J. Maarten Troost's \\"Getting Stoned With Savages\\" or \\"The Sex Lives of Cannibals\\" but not his 3rd book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Not worth my time especially for a book club..i had to read it and forced myself to read each page"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I picked up this book after seeing David Sedaris on a late night talk show. He seemed hilarious, almost like a younger, bemused Woodie Allen type.While the book is well written, his views on life are very disappointing to me. In his previous professions/stages of life, he was a ne'er-do-well, a loafer, well, basically a bum. Many of his stories are made up of snide commentaries on others around him who were progressing through their lives. These folks were getting in the way of David's quest of just figuring out how to get the next hit of recreational drugs.He can become the poet laureaute for the younger generations whom life is never easy enough and can't put enough blame on those around them."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'm withholding a five star rating because of the typo on page 269: \\"We used to returned home for Christmas every year . . . \\" Is there no one at Little, Brown and Company whose responsibility it is to make sure errors such as the above don't ruin the reading experience? I feel cheated."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I rather liked this book, though the humor wasn't consistent throughout. Several chapters were laugh out loud funny (for instance, the descriptions of David's french lessons) but large sections of the book in between were only moderately amusing. He certainly has lead an interesting life."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is a delight. I was so happy when the latest book of his was delivered. And I was not disappointed in the least. I howled when I was ALONE and reading it, something I seldom do. Things usually seem funnier when people are around."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I would have given this book 1 star but I added a '1 Star Credit' because at least I could finish it. This was my first Sedaris book. I read it because a friend recommended it. I had no idea it was supposed to be funny... even at the end of the book. I feel sort of bad to say I didn't like it because I can tell he is a good writer. But I just didn't enjoy this. It took me forever to finish the book and at the end all I could think was \\"Thank goodness that is OVER\\"."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read it hoping to find a glowing essay to be uplifted by or tolaugh out loud . But I failed to find one .The story about his Dad and the food he buys and hoards and eats much much to much later was just too weird and grosse!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sederis' latest collection of essays are definitely hit-or-miss. When he attempts to illustrate his theme, communication, through the repetition of key details about his life he is often merely repetitious. Yes, David, you were a rascal to take so many drugs. Now get over yourself. Still, when he choses to move beyond his own behaviors to observe others he is both scathingly funny and offers real insight into the complexity of human interactions. Overall, the book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I saw this book listed on a bunch of people's \\"funniest books I've ever read\\" lists. I didn't enjoy it at all. The stories were boring and uneventful. I only finished it because I felt obligated after spending $10 on it for my kindle."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Maybe, being a 60 plus, I simply do not understand Sedaris' humor, but this book is the biggest disappointment I have read in a long time. Moderately entertaining, perhaps, but funny, no! If you want laugh-out-loud funny, read any of the Stephanie Plum mysteries by Janet Evanovich; or Edward Abbey's \\"Monkey Wrench Gang\\" or anything by Dana Stabenow, funniest being \\"Breakup\\"; or anything by Carl Hiassen or Dave Barry. Mark Twain is funny and smart. Sedaris is pathetic."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Simply the funiest man alive!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I didn't enjoy the book. Wasn't funny like the reviews on the back of the book read. Some may have found it funny, but to me it was a pointless list of uneventful life stories..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I thought this book would get better as I read on, when in fact it got worse. Wouldn't recommend it at all."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I bought this book a few weeks ago and my only regret is that I immediately lent it to my brother, who still has it, and I'm already wanting to read it again. I fell for David Sedaris when I saw the hilarious \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" in Denver (Gary Culig's performance was no less than brilliant). I really needed a good laugh again, so I looked up Sedaris [...] and shazam! this book delivered. But Me Talk Pretty is more than a good snort, it's refreshingly well written. Sedaris has mastered the personal essay format. In an age when the Self is overglorified and boring as hell, he leaves out all extraneous ramblings. His sense of humor is like a heat-seeking missile and I, for one, am grateful."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris makes me laugh. I first heard him reading &quot;The Santaland Diaries&quot; on my local NPR radio station and I was hooked.This book is another one that you can dip into now and again and sample the varying products of Sedaris' offbeat sense of humor.Here he talks about the rigors of learning French (in France), and my favorite story is his description of trying to explain Easter customs in the US (in French) to people from other countries who are also learning French. A classic!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"As with almost everything Sedaris writes, each of the autobiographical stories in One Day Me Talk Pretty will cause you to laugh out loud, but one story in particular will cause you to go from laughter to tears. &quot;The Youth in Asia&quot; is one of the most touching stories I have read in years. Sedaris writes about his family's pets -- how attached they got to them, how they treated them like humans and how sad they were to see them go. Sedaris uses delightful descriptions of the cats and dogs who shared his family life to capture the subject matter perfectly. As I began reading this story, enjoying Sedaris' usual humor, I was not prepared for how this story would affect me for some time after I read it. I highly recommend this book. Read &quot;The Youth in Asia&quot; first!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"As I mentioned, I haven't finished the book yet!! I don't need to, to write a review!! this book is hilarious!! I was recommended David Sedaris by a friend who was reading Naked, and we have taken turns reading chapters out loud to each other. I would be at work reading to myself, and my boss had to ask me what was making me crack up so much!!! I don't normally laugh out loud when reading a book, but he is great!! not only is he funny, he writes the words in a way that you can hear his voice (even if you have never heard him speak before) .. my favorite so far is the essay about his french class! I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"As a close follower of David's work, I was thrilled to hear he had another tape out. I have listened to all of his others and never tire of his humor. This tape is centered more around David and his partner, Hugh, and their lives in New York and Paris. I prefer the stories about his family, but these are satisfying as well. Highly recommend...."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Laughed outloud. This book is hilarious, sometimes a little twisted, every story a page turner!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Anyone who read Naked would be wise to read this latest collection--Me Talk Pretty One Day is a suitable encore to Sedaris' previous book; it is full of residual laughter that may feel like it comes more from one's familiarity with his world view than these actual pages but is hilarious nonetheless. MTP1D doesn't hang together the way the brilliant Naked did but it's well worth the purchase (especially at this price) because it will have you quivering with laughter, countless times."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I've read all of Sedaris' books, and this is the best one yet. Practically every selection caused me to laugh out loud. His pieces on learning French are particularly good."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book details experiences that David Sedaris has when he spends time in France with his significant other. Anyone who's ever tried to learn French will be able to relate to his frustration."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"After hearing much raving about Sedaris I looked forward to reading this book. The first chapter made me laugh out loud but it was downhill from there. I found it disjointed, rude and often crude and had to work hard to finish the book. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read this book a month ago, but I've been sitting on the review for some time because I'm not certain exactly what to say about it. The writing itself is brilliantly done - Sedaris has a unique style of humor that is refreshingly funny. My favorite stories were about the time he spent in France (especially his struggles learning the language), as well as his description of his brief career as a performance artist.But between the time I finished the book and the time I went to write this, I found an article from The New Republic titled \\"This American Lie\\", in which a reporter goes through some of David's more outrageous (and verifiable) stories. The verdict: Sedaris most certainly fabricated details of his supposed non-fiction book(s)... not just mere comedic exaggeration, but creating entire people/events/conversations out of his imagination. I give him some leeway because the purpose of his storytelling is obviously for entertainment only. But it's marked as non-fiction all the same, so there's supposed to be deference to the truth.I know he's a great storyteller and an excellent author with heaps of life experience. So I don't see why he would feel the need to make things up to write about. The dishonesty ends up ruining the stories for me, not enhancing them. I got some laughs at the time. Now I just feel cheated."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A highly enjoyable read. The early chapters were particularly hysterical, causing me to laugh out loud numerous times as Sedaris described growing up as an effeminate boy with a frustrating lisp. I'm not a big memoir reader, particularly those of people who are most famous for writing a memoir, but word of mouth led me to give this one a shot and I'm glad it did. I didn't find the entire book quite as hysterical as the first few chapters but it did make for a pleasant read and I continue to get a kick out of the catchy title."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The first chapter of this book is very good.The later chapters like the vicars egg are good in parts .I must admitt I laughed out loud at times but as the book went on I found it less and less likely to be accurate . Having learnt various foreign languages in difficult circumstances I found this chapter particularly unlikely .I finished the book as it is on my book club list but I was sorely tempted to give up two thirds of the way through . I will sadly not be reading any more books by this author ."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"With sardonic wit and an eye for the absurd, David Sedaris gives hyperbolic treatment and philosophical consideration to what would otherwise be a mundane life. And just when it seems that his aresenal of experiences is depleted, he invites us to witness from the perspective of his unfettered imagnination. We oblige, of course, because by now this neurotic maladroit is our friend, his fantasies of being a celebrated and sought-after hero are our own, and we are more like him than we ever dared to admit."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"One mark of a great book is when you laugh out loud alone. This book accomplishes the feat, and my main complaint is that it didn't last longer. Sedaris is an engaging presenter live, and I'd suggest watching or listening to him speak before reading the book. You'll understand the comic timing and the absurdity of some of the stories more. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is Sedaris' best collection of short stories/memoirs/autobiographies. His writing is wonderful, in part because it's hard to separate fact from fiction. He has a true gift for writing. My favorite story is the title one but all are great. These stories are great to read all at once or one at a time!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"When I opened this book I had limited time so I decided to look for the shortest essay in the book so I could sneak in a quick read. I selected \\"Big Boy\\" which started on page 97 and ended before the next essay that started on page 100. By the end of the first paragraph I was already laughing and saying, aloud, \\"oh geeze\\". I laughed through all three pages and found myself incredibly impressed with his writing, his insightful observations, and how he captures (through nothing but words) an experience worth sharing with the reader.When my husband came home from work, I placed the \\"Big Boy\\" essage in front of him and said, \\"you have to read this\\". Same thing happened. By the end of the first paragraph he had a huge smile and was snickering quietly.I will never look at a burrito the same way.This book is a keeper."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I think I have now read or listened to all of David Sedaris' books or audiobooks. I prefer the audiobooks as he tells it the way he writes it. Just sit back and enjoy. No one tells a story like David Sedaris. You'll laugh til you cry."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Before reading this book, I very much thought from the title (and because at the time I did not know who David Sedaris is)that it would be a \\"heart wrenching tale\\" about some child who is physically unable to speak or doesn't have access to a decent education. It was one of those books I meant to get to someday, but probably never would. Finally someone clued me in. I read it in a day.Sedaris's short stories are the funniest I've ever read. He draws on recollections of his own family to give us realistic visions of family and personal life in all their \\"rolling on the floor laughing\\" complexity. If I were ever to write a book, this is exactly like what I hope I would write."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I bought this book for one of my Writing Arts classes and I had never heard of David Sedaris. I thought the book was awesome, very funny, and worth the money. I would definitely recommend it to others!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Arguably the most famous work in the canon of David Sedaris, Me Talk Pretty One Day has the kind of stories Sedaris fans will love, and Sedaris-virgins will love to discover. Since reading Naked and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, I've been amazed by Sedaris's talent for turning mundane life into fascinating explorations of the human experience, and have made it a passive goal of mine to read all his six books. With stories centering around family members or childhood figures (each with the kind of clear, constant voice you can effortlessly hear inside your head as you read), Sedaris must have an incredible memory, detailed diary, or convincing imagination. While those expecting to hear heartthrob stories of excitement and adventure will be disappointed by the National Public Radio-ready prose of Sedaris's books, everyone will be able to appreciate the mastery of his writing and brevity.Some of the stories contained in Me Talk Pretty will be familiar to listeners of NPR's This American Life, which I believe speaks more to their strength than their redundancy. The book contains quite a bit on his experiences in France (touched upon in other works), and has a bit too much Andy Rooney-esque nostalgia at times, but Me Talk Pretty is Sedaris at his best.Continued at: [...]"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I really liked this for a long road trip I went on. The stories are short, about 10 mins each, so you can listen to one really quick, listen to a few at a time, switch back and forth between stories and music/radio, etc. Sedaris is hilarious."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Bought for pennies, delivered immeaditly, in great shape, like new!! I don't know why everyone doesn't buy books thru amazon!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A friend recommended the works of David Sedaris as wonderful pieces of comic relief. She insisted upon Me Talk Pretty One Day as an introduction to his style and I'm so very glad I followed my friend's advice. I found David's writing to be very conversational and easy to comprehend, and therefore fully appreciate his brand of humor. The ability to laugh at the foibles of self and loved ones is such a gift, and David shared it beautifully. I found myself giggling out loud and wanting to share particularly funny passages with perfect strangers. I'll definitely buy additional Sedaris books."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"On the recommendation of a co-worker, I picked up a copy Me Talk Pretty One Day and I was pleasantly surprised to discover a very hilarious and entertaining book. Author David Sedaris is so full of intelligent humor and sharp wit.Through a series of essays, Me Talk Pretty One Day painted a vivid and insightful snapshot of the author's family dynamic, his struggle back with drug abuse and personal redemption. There were so many laugh-out loud moments in the book, especially stories involving Sedaris' brother Paul and some of my favorite chapters were the author's time living in France.Sedaris is a wonderful contemporary storyteller, especially when he is describing everyday interactions with other people. The stories of his personal development were quite hilarious, sometimes painful but always interesting to read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"this book is pee in your pants funny!!!! my husband and i loved it. we couldn't stop laughing. i want to meet \\" the rooster\\". he has advise to live by."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris has the incredible ability to make every day, mundane events funny. \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is a fantastically funny account of the Sedaris family, a delightfully dysfunctional family I greatly enjoyed reading about."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is my third book I have read by Sedaris, and they only get better. He is continuously funny, time after time, I find myself laughing through his books. I just purchased his new book and cannot wait to begin reading it. This book is a must. It does have some crude humor as do most of his books, so keep it away from kids under 16."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"After years and years of dumbfounded stares when I mention I haven't read Sedaris, I decided I'd better give him a chance. I think I steered myself awy from Sedaris because I'm typically not a fan of funny books (if only because I rarely find them funny). Sedaris has proved an exception, and I kept thinking about Twain as chuckled my way to the finish. There is a similarity, at least insofar as Sedaris has a similar biting wit that may prove to transcend generations like Twain -- although I don't feel as though Sedaris is as good a writer.But yeah, lots of good stuff. Stuff I could relate to. Stuff that makes me want to see Sedaris on another one of his book tours. He's got a new book out. Something about chipmunks. I'll have to check it out."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris has put together many short stories and essays. Some not laugh out loud but defintely brings a smirk at times, amusing and entertaiing at other times. I found my ratings from each of the stories went from a 6 star, to a 1 star to a 4 star to a 3,4,6,4,6,5,1,2,3, and so on.You will understand if all the brilliant stories were in one book yes it would deserve a 5 star, but sadly they are scattered through some very average ones. My overall rating on this book is a 3.5 star. Definately worth a listen. Maybe try one of his other ones first."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I loved this book. I don't read very many \\"fun\\" books, with having to read for school and all... But this book was hilarious and I finished it in an afternoon."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Very well written, a great read. Many of my friends seem to think this is the best book ever written, which I think is a little over the top. Nevertheless, it is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Where other Sedaris books fell short, was the fact that each of the essays stood on their own, but altogether the book seemed to have a bit of randomness to it. Although I loved that aspect as well, when I read Me Talk Pretty One Day, where the stories were all relevent and flowed together nicely, I saw another side to the book. Ultimately I feel it's that very side that has kept it near my bedside, or in my bag for a read every now and again, it's jaw-ache funny, but at the same time shows a vulnerability in Sedaris."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read one of Sedaris' short stories in my freshman english class and I couldnt wait to read the rest of the book, but I didnt get to it until two years later and I think that turned out to be a good thing. Sedaris' type of humor is one that takes a certain amount of maturity and wit to understand. \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" was the best story to me just because I could completely relate to his experiences in his French class. For a book to make me laugh out loud in a public place is enough for me to recommend it to everyone. Not all of the stories were as funny as others but I still appreciated them."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My favorite author is Tom Robbins and now I have a new favorite who writes at the opposite end of the spectrum. With Robbins, we get heady, complicated extraordinary characters. With Sedaris and \\"Talk Pretty,\\" it's a vignette of that day in his life and it's terribly real, believable and every night in bed as I read, I was promised a laugh. Twice I had to quit reading because I was laughing out-of-control and my tummy hurt. What a superb writer - [he] can drift through his day, his family, his work, his travels and just rock your socks with humor. The narrator does not seem \\"straight\\" if I'm now using the word to describe sexuality. What is pleasant, that's not the crux or heartbreak of his book. Gender preference is just that, a small aspect of his family life, which is how it should be in societies. And as I have struggled all my life trying to learn other langugages, I marveled at how well he did with French. This man has a following in many areas. Buy the book, you won't regret."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris is such a master storyteller with his amazing ability to have the reader weeping and laughing from one sentence to the next sometimes. His stories relating his childhood are on one hand painfully real and hilarious. He spares no embarassment for the sake of the story, thank goodness. ;o)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The parts about his troubles growing up with imperfect speech and other difficulties were touching and illuminating, but, unlike \\"Holidays of Ice\\" and readings I'd heard on \\"The Late Show with David Letterman,\\" the only times I really laughed while reading this book were during the anecdotes about his sister Amy. So I read \\"Wigfield\\" next."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris has emerged as one of the funniest and wisest voices of the last decade. He has the endearing ability to mine his painful childhood and his unsuccessful early adulthood, emerging with nuggets of wit and rich humor. He also has the dreadful power to translate uncomfortable experiences into discomforting reading. I can't think of another writer whose pain and humiliations are so literally gut-wrenching.\\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is a compilation of stories having language as their theme, centering on Sedaris's own pathetic attempts to learn French. His classics include \\"Jesus Shaves\\" -- a hilarious vignette of beginner French students trying to explain Easter to a Muslim student; \\"Go Carolina\\" -- a bittersweet memory of being singled out to correct a speech \\"impediment\\" common with unpopular kids; \\"12 Moments In The Life Of The Artist\\" -- a skewering of the pretensions of performance art; \\"I'll Eat What He's Wearing\\" -- Sedaris describing his father's peculiar eating habits. Sedaris's sense of the absurd is almost superfluous; all he needs to do is describe the weird people he encounters (attracts?) In any event, Sedaris draws the listener eagerly back for more of his tales of the bizarre and the all-too-recognizable.I highly recommend the audio CD, voiced by Sedaris himself. His tinny and timid voice is a perfect cover for his ironic barbs. Several of his stories were recorded before live audiences. These are actually less successful than his straight readings, transforming Sedaris's understated humor into a string of guffaw lines. It was somewhat like trying to enjoy the subtleties of a fine wine when at every sip, the folks at the neighboring table boorishly sing its praises. Nevertheless, it's heartening that this son of failure has found his muse and ridden to fame."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I bought this book awhile ago,and I've been meaning to read it for a whole year! I finally read it, and it had me in stictches! Sooo funny! Sedaris has mastered the art of comically but sympathically portraying teh America Family!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is a great writer. This autobiographical look at his life makes one take a look at the humor in their own life. We all have idiosyncracies and personal issues and Sedaris brings them all to the surface in an enjoyable and amusing manner. I cannot wait to read more!!!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Maybe it's just because I think too much like David Sedaris, but I didn't find his stories humorous. I saw the punchlines coming.It could be my internal tendencies towards homosexuality which I vehemently deny, especially to my girlfriend. It could be that I'm a southern libertarian yearning for the simpler days like those found in &quot;Run with the Horseman&quot; which had me rolling (and alternately crying), though I'm not political.If you want twists, read some of Roald Dahl's short stories. If you want funny morals, read Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, or even better the Memoirs of Casanova). If you want contemporary intellectual humor, read David Foster Wallace (I haven't finished Infinite Jest because I have yet to find it minimally giggly (too tongue in cheek, ala Catch-22) but it is intellectual and it's supposed to be funny.Sure, I chuckled a few times here and there but nothing caused me to lose my composure and laugh loud enough to embarass myself in public. The text was too big, the book was too short, and the writing too simple. If you are determined to read this, save your cash and check it out of the library."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"It truly takes a lot to make me laugh, but I learned not to read anything by David Sedaris in public. His skewed inside viewpoints of life are hilariously offbeat and ring true. So true, that you will be laughing out loud. Whether describing his amphetamine induced college &quot;performance art&quot; shenanigans or his childhood abuse by a speech therapist bent on taking glee in his curiously high-pitched lisp, Sedaris knocks you over with a literary feather laced with lead. Commentaries on New Yorkers, southerners or any other ethnic or regional folk are side-splittingly accurate. Always self-depracating, Sedaris is kind enough to include everyone in his hit-list of ridiculous human behavior. As a reference, David Sedaris' wack-job of a sister is also highlighted. It is no surprise that she went on to be a major contributor to Comedy Central's &quot;Strangers With Candy&quot;. Don't be surprised however, if everyone you tell this book about has already read it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the first book by David Sedaris that I have read and, for the most part, it was very funny. During certain portions (I am ashamed to include one short scatological piece among them) I was laughing out loud. Others were very funny in a more &quot;dry&quot; sense.The first portion of the book is Sedaris' autobiography of growing up in a quirky family, dealing with a not-too-successful speech therapist, and working (?) as an artist and in other trades. Next, he describes his stays in France at his friend's house in the country and in Paris. Anyone who has spent time in France, and struggled with the French language, will be able to relate to the humourous situations.This is definitely a good book if you need some chuckles and some loud laughs!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A friend recommended this book to me, saying that it is &quot;hilarious&quot;. While I didn't find it rolling-on-the-floor funny, it does have its smile-inducing moments. Basically a series of personal essays about the author's life in North Carolina, New York, and ultimately France, it is filled with amusing bits that can be appreciated by the resident of a country town or an urban dweller.I, for one, could really relate to his dislike of computers and his appreciation for the typewriter. His takes on our fascination with technology, youth, and intelligence are on the mark.The book takes flight in part &quot;Deux&quot; where the humorist relates much about life in France. When he discusses the American couple mistaking him as a Parisian pickpocket, I couldn't stop laughing at these dim-witted &quot;ugly Americans.&quot; His revelation of French customs will be beneficial to anyone planning a trip to that much-visited country.I thank my friend for this introduction. I will be reading more by this author."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I love David Sedaris, but I did not find this book very amusing at all. I actually can barely get through it. I started it a few months ago. He is much funnier in person and I will never buy one of his books again."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the funniest book I've ever read. I dare anyone to read it and not laugh out loud. The first chapter starts off slow so please keep reading it only gets better and better."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is a great book.1. It can be read in a few hours.2. It can be read out of order (all the chapters are a number of self-contained vignettes).3. The writer is genuinely funny. This book actually came up based on a recommendation from other books that I had purchased off of Amazon.com (\\"I Was Told There'd Be Cake\\" and \\"I Don't Care About Your Band\\"), both of which were categorically NOT funny. This book was a rare success.4. There was a lot of good insight into the characters. For example: He talked about working for a Communist (a genuine Working Communist), but then made a very relevant comparison to Idiot Communists At University (who seem to think that \\"after the revolution comes they will be the ones holding the clipboards\\").5. The author has a great way with words (in spite of his claiming to have an IQ that, if it were translated into dollars, would \\"be enough to buy a few buckets of fried chicken\\") that draw ones interest and form great visual images.There are lots of copies of the book available, but even in there weren't this book would be worth buying new.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Noooooooo! I love this book! It's histerically funny and I can't believe anyone would give it one star. Buy it, try it, don't listen to the haters!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I got \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" with different expectations that I probably should have had. I was expecting a novel, but I got a bunch of short stories. I HATE short stories, but that's my own fault for not researching more before I picked it up, right?So, I grin and bear it for a few stories, but then feel like maybe I'm reading an Augusten Burroughs novel instead? I know technically \\"Me Talk...\\" came out at the same time as \\"Running With Scissors\\", both originally released in 2001, but the stories are so similar to Augusten's that I had to go back and check the covers. Yup. Sedaris. Okay... moving on.Yeah, he's funny. Sure he has some great moments. But, is he really as funny as HE thinks HE is?If I had read this book BEFORE reading Augusten Burroughs's books... maybe I would have loved it a little more. I honestly DID love \\"Naked\\" by Sedaris- laugh out loud funny.But \\"Me Talk...\\" just wasn't... good."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Good book. Not laugh-out-loud funny, but it is full of the kind of humor you would expect from Sedaris. Well worth the price and effort."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I hesitated writing an on-line review, because I wasn't sure I could possibly share how excited I was about this book and about David Sedaris. Here's a go at it though: It was hillarious, catching me off guard every other sentence. It was smart and charming, real and personal. As soon as I finished the last page, I packaged it up and sent it to my best friend in France who I know would appreciate it (a good deal of the book deals with David's adventures in France and with that language). The book gives a great introduction to this wonderful writer and wonderful person/soul. It was also great to read about his sister Amy (Jerri Blank of &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot;), and see how she got started. I've just finished &quot;Naked,&quot; and am about to dive into &quot;Barrel Fever,&quot; and &quot;Holidays On Ice&quot;. Read this book...it subtlely reaffirms how fun humanity is!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris's new collection, Me Talk Pretty One Day, tells a most unconventional life story. It begins with a North Carolina childhood filled with speech-therapy classes (&quot;There was the lisp, of course, but more troubling than that was my voice itself with its excitable tone and high, girlish pitch&quot;) and unwanted guitar lessons taught by a midget. From budding performance artist (&quot;The only crimp in my plan was that I seemed to have no talent whatsoever&quot;) to &quot;clearly unqualified&quot; writing teacher in Chicago, Sedaris's career leads him to New York (the sky's-the-limit field of furniture moving) and eventually, of all places, France.I recommend it to all!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is a compliation of short stories, and memories written by David Sedaris. Beginning at the age of 5, the book follow's his life up until the present. Written with sarcastically dry humor and wit, every chapter is more riduclous and hilarious than the last. I had been imatiantly awaiting a follow-up on &quot;Naked,&quot; which consisits of the same ideas and memories as this book. I didn't think anything could top &quot;Naked,&quot; but this one is way up there.The first chapter is about Sedaris' speach impetiments when he was a child, and his first cruel, cruel, speech therapist, who, in his own words &quot; Would be much happier giving random root canals to the school girls in Africa than actually doing her job.&quot; Such topics are the basis of every chapter; they range from his crazy parents and siblings to the midget guitar teacher his father hired for him when he was 12.Though there are several reasons why I enjoyed this book, the main one would have to be Sedaris' &quot;real life&quot; writing style. His childhood growing up sounded like hell; his mother was an alchoholic, he didn't have any friends and what not, but somhow, his writing style and techniques make it all hilarious. I think if anyone else wrote about this life, it would have sounded depressing and scary.So, if you're feeling sorry for yourself, dealing with a mid-life crisis, or just bored, you should definatly read this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"If you want stories about funny pets or kids saying the darndest things, this is not the place. If you want stories about former glue sniffers, painfully mediocre performance artists, and the universal shame that is the language class, you will find yourself crying the best possible tears. I wasn't expecting to like this one since I'm skeptical of \\"funny\\" books, but I couldn't control myself during the title essay. \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster\\" is also a popular favorite describing Sedaris' irrepressible brother (and the origins of the \\"f****-it bucket\\").This is very, very highly recommended. You'll be readier to laugh at yourself afterwards, which is never a bad thing."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Hysterical is the best word to describe this book. If you know anything about elementary school or speech class do yourself a favor and read the first story, \\"Go Carolina\\"....you'll be hooked. Humor is difficult to write and Sedaris is a master. Loved the midget guitar teacher and the IQ equivalent to the weight of an average housecat.....haha. Every ESL teacher ought to have \\"Make That A Double\\" and \\"The City of Light in the Dark\\" as required reading. Anyone who has learned a new language and had the frustrating experience of being adequate, semi-intelligent, in their native language, while sounding like a three year old in the new language, will enjoy Sedaris's descriptions of learning French. I did have to close the book when my husband fell asleep because I could not contain my laughter."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"if you are a fan of this writer, and i officially am, this is one novel that will not disappoint. He is brash, he is amusing, he is self-centered (not so much this time out), he is very unorthodox. Nothing he writes will set the world on fire, but he's clearly not trying to do that. All he is trying to do is have a good time, his way, the only way he really seems to know how.Sedaris strikes me as one of those reclusive writers, the ones who really don't want to be around too many people who know their faces, but have no problem expressing themselves through the written word, speaking to us, baring his soul, without ever having to look into our eyes. He strikes me as that kind of character, really. Just look at his photo on back. A picture of someone who is totally uncomfortable posing for the camera, insisting on a natural action shot. Never speaking to us directly.Sure, sure, he has his public radio work, he does his appearances, fine. But those are contributions rather than fame. Sedaris doesn't seem to adhere to the social understanding that he has \\"made it.\\" and he doesn't care. he just wants someone to talk to. without actually talking to anyone.great scam he has though, i admit. little essays about this and that. nothing major, nothing really minor. just having a conversation. telling a story to an audience held captive by their own devices. what a fine read this book is! my favorite stories involve his times in paris trying to understand the language, a little piece about taking responsibility for a turd in a friends toilet and a rather long dissertation concerning a family dog. one story really bothered me. it was about his riding a train in france with his partner and a married american couple are badmouthing him to each other, thinking him french and not able to understand their words. he lets it all fall off his back with no redemption. I WOULD HAVE LET THEM HAVE IT! and it bothered me that he would let himself get so beaten up by these ignorant steers!but there it is. he had successfully drawn me into his story to the point where i not only identified with the character, but i sympathized. and that's all i ask. but when he moves me to higher levels, goes above and beyond the call of duty, showing me ingenius creativity and flare that just knocks me for a loop...he'll get 4 stars."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris hits the mark with this collection of essays on his eccentric childhood and even more eccentric adult life. He is openly gay and his style could be offensive to some people -- he is very up-front about sex, swearing, drug use and so on -- but he doesn't set out to shock. These are simply the facts of his life and he is happy to share them with you. The stories about his drug use are very matter-of-fact about the real ups and downs of drug addiction. He admits all of his own faults and almost dares you to disagree with his conclusions about his uselessness....and does it in prose so lyrical, so sweetly amusing, that you feel the world would indeed be a worse place without his skewed perspective. Anyone who can read this book without howls of laughter is devoid of a sense of humor. Highly recommended -- even if you are, as I am, a dyed-in-the-wool conservative. I gave four stars instead of five only because I don't think I could re-read it repeatedly and still find it as funny."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Although I struggled through the first few pages, I soon found myself laughing, crying and ROFL (rolling on the floor laughing) during Sedaris' descriptions of his life, his family and his travels (in France). HIGH MARKS to this one. Recommended for anyone who enjoys an irreverant journey through one man's life experience."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I don't care one whit for any intellectual or comparative examination of the content of this book, all I know is that I was laughing and shaking my head at the joy and discovery of what he can say and how he says it. Amazingly, he does it out of nothing: his subjects include elementary school, living in New York, family (whose banality he venerates), bad jobs, learning French, all commonplace but he re-visits them from a wonderfully skewed perspective and makes everything we've got in common seem funny, fantastic and sometimes deeply touching.The person who can write a book that makes the reader laugh out loud and feel that he/she has lived, or could have lived, the same experience is very special indeed. David Sedaris is a real star. Just like certain stage actors in their prime, his charisma and talent draw the participant into feeling a deep relationship with him. I finished this book feeling a lot of humanity and other corny stuff too simple and sweet to spoil by giving them names."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY is another collection featuring David Sedaris' especially mordant and hilarious sense of humor. He muses on the most ordinary events, but gives us a unique perspective.My two favorite stories concern his childhood guitar lessons and his sojourn with his French boyfriend renovating a house in the French countryside.While reading David Sedaris is entertaining in itself, nothing compares to HEARING him tell his stories on audiotape or CD. His humor comes through so much more vividly through his voice and not the printed word. Do yourself a favor and pick up an audio copy even if you've read the book. The experience is greatly enhanced. I know because I first encountered his work from listening to the audio version of NAKED, which is to this day my absolute Sedaris favorite!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the first book by David Sedaris I have ever read and it will likely be the last. He writes well. The problem is I didn't find a lot of his writing particularly funny. Perhaps my expectations were set a little too high by the glowing reviews I had read, but I kept expecting to find myself rolling on the floor with laughter. That just didn't happen.I sensed the author often thought he was writing something funny, but that only made it worse. Oh sure, Sedaris got a chuckle out of me here and there - as I said, he writes well. But the peals of laughter never came. And what was with the homosexual references, interludes, and otherwise failed humor? At times it seemed like Sedaris was trying to laugh at himself, at other times it seemed like he expected everybody to see the humor inherent in his sexual preferences. In most cases, I found the display to be out of place. That is, Sedaris' perverse sexuality usually fit into his narrative like a road kill fits on a stretch of two-lane blacktop. Sure, you expect to find one now and then, but it doesn't make the trip any more pleasant.This isn't autobiographical humor along the lines of Mark Twain, or Jean Shepherd, or Patrick F. McManus. It just doesn't work the same way as any of the examples I've just given. In fact, as I see it, Sedaris' humor usually doesn't work - not for me, at least."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I did not laugh. The guy is not interesting. The writing is amateurish dime store bookish. The humor is high school level.I really liked the title. Thats all."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Let me start by saying I am a bibliophile and will sometimes buy a book just for the look of it. I ended up throwing the book away rather than offer it to any one else. If I could have given this book something less than one star I would have given it a negative fifteen (-15). I found this book gross, crass and inappropriate. I've read books with strong language in them, but never like this one that has filthy language just for the sake of using filthy language. I wouldn't have this book in my home and am sorry that I read the whole thing, but it was a private book club choice. As it turned out no one else finished reading it. DON'T BUY, READ or OWN THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Read three fourths of book and chunked it. I would be embaressed to give it away. Maybe 5 funny pages."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A big zero rating. I don't want to give it a star but you require the field to be put in! If you want the f word and the mf word popping up and hitting you in the face unexpectedly, and totally unnecessary,then you should buy this book. I don't enjoy it and won't finish reading it!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I crankily believe that 90% of modern American pop culture is generated by the same six people. Davis Sedaris is not, thankfully, one of those people. His book is so weird and unpredictable that I found myself alternately gasping and giggling throughout the short time in which I devoured it.I too spent my childhood in NC and had that delicious, goofy &quot;HEY! I'VE BEEN THERE!&quot; reaction when he mentioned places like Greensboro and the Raleigh Art Museum, and when he commented that his speech teacher thought &quot;pen&quot; was a two-syllable word. I am also a former student of French, a sometime participant in odd theater pieces, and blessed(?) with a remarkably peculiar family. Therefore my laughs were that much louder because of the classic &quot;It's funny because it's true!&quot; principle of comedy.In the Seinfeld era of mass-produced catchphrases, I appreciate Sedaris' dry and inventive manipulation of language. Several of his turns of phrase have already wormed their way in to my daily conversation. I have begun to nurture my inner vachette. I would like to personally thank the author for writing the phrase &quot;I was sitting at home, braiding the bristles on my whisk broom&quot; because it is the most inexplicably hilarious image I've encountered in a long time. It's funny because it's true. Most of us are really that weird."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Although &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is an excellent collection of stories, it is not Sedaris's best work. However when it's &quot;Holidays on Ice&quot; you're comparing it to, how can it live up to expectation? Though it does have some truly hilarious stories, check out &quot;You Can't Kill the Rooster&quot; and &quot;A Shiner Like A Diamond&quot;, the whole of the book is not nearly as funny as earlier work. For a writer as gifted as Sedaris, France seems too easy a target and it often falls a little flat. But when the subject is his wonderfully insane family, the words are absolute bliss. It is not that this is a bad book, in fact it is a great book. But after reading the other work, I have come to expect more and I know Sedaris can fulfill his readers high expectations."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"was taking this often hysterical (if uneven) collection of essays with me to jury duty.Judges seem to hate it when a juror laughs out loud for no apparent reason...until the judge is familair with the wonderful David Sedaris.No doubt many reviewers will say that the first half of the book, which deals mainly with David and his father, is much more amusing than Part deux, which deals primarily with his life as the village idiot in France. Pay little attention. The second half pales ONLY because the first part of the book is practically flawless.My personal favorite is the chapter in which David's sister Amy (now seen on the Comedy Central Show &quot;Strangers With Candy&quot;) comes home for Christmas wear half a fat suit, driving their father crazy. Laugh-out-loud funny!Sedaris is an amazingly truthful writer. If he views the world, his family harshly, its only because he values them so much. Throughout these stories, you find a sense of wonderment and joy (well, maybe not so much with the giant turd piece, but still...)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"no one else writes with the charm of david sedaris. although I'm sure it's not, his writing seems effortless. I enjoyed this collection as much as Naked and, as always, I loved the pieces about Sedaris' family most dearly (two notables: his father's food storage habits; sister amy's fat suit)."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Being an avid reader of many genres of literature, Me Talk Pretty One Day has to be the most humourous novel I have ever read. David Sedaris takes his personal experiences and compiles them into a halarious novel that I just couldn't put down. David tells about his experiences in France and of his family, where my favorite essay comes into mind. He tells about his lovely brother in the story titled You Can't Kill the Rooster. I have also read Naked and Holidays On Ice by David Sedaris and I have been to a reading where I had the chance to hear David tell these stories himself. When my mother recommened David Sedaris to me, I didn't know what to expect. She said that he was funny, but I wasn't sure how funny. Me Talk Pretty One Day is highly reccommed for those who need a good laugh and want the pleasure of knee-slapping humor and somewhat appalling stories that you could never believe to be true. If you want to do yourself a favor by adding some laughter into your life, pick up a copy of Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is funny; however I definitely have read things far more comedic. I like the short story format, and some of the stories are great - however I did not read the first book, Naked, so perhaps I am slightly out of the loop. Despite the fact it isn't supremely funny there are some laugh out loud moments that make the book certainly worth your while."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Wow! I bought this book after reading other people's reviews of it. There were moments reading it where i simply could not stop laughing... It was so hysterical! David Sedaris' sense of humor is right up my alley, and i'm sure other people feel the same way! Now my mission is to go get his other books, because if they are even close to as funny as this one, then i'm sure i'll be satisfied. :)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I want more! This book was very funny, easy to read and sad to finish (only because I did not want it to end.)The chapters are all thoughts on random events about Sedaris' life. The topics are Seinfeld-ish. They range from talking about a large poo left in the toliet to realizing that he sounds so bad speaking French he just stops talking.The stories get better as you move on so don't become discouraged if you don't like the beginning of the book.I would not recommend this as a gift for a grandparent, an in-law or someone you don't know well as the subject matter may offend. Also, if you're into amazingly well written colorful language, this book may not be for you. His writing style is simple and colorful, but not in a descriptive way.However, if you're looking for a quick read, a good laugh and an escape from your problems, give this book a try."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Yes, most of these essays are quite funny but by the time I was halfway through, I found the author to be way too judgemental in his opinions. Others have commented on his &quot;self-deprecating humor&quot; but I found him to be self-absorbed and couldn't find any particular justification for his superior attitudes. I know that all the other reviewers of this book will disagree violently with me but I believe that there are far better satirical essayists out there."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was a bit disappointed in this book, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't read it. David's worst book is funnier than anyone else's best. The trouble is just that anyone who's already been introduced to the Sedaris family in Naked will find the first half of the book a bit of a rehash. The parts about Amy are great, though, especially Shiner Like a Diamond, which was the least glib and most hilariously absurd piece in the book. But is that a testament to David's writing or Amy's twisted fat-suit-wearing antics? She might be the biggest genius of the family. The parts about mangled french are pretty funny, with David putting a semi-fresh spin on one of the oldest jokes around: miscommunication. As always he's funnier when he's criticizing everyone around him than when he's trying to make a point or be cute. But who am I trying to kid: I would buy a grocery list if it was written by David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was an absolute gem to read.I read it on a train ride to NYC several months ago and found myself laughing -- and having to stifle my laughter realizing where I was.There isn't one story in this set that won't bring a smile and faint air of recognition.Enjoy..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I am a wary reader. I hate fiction dated past the era of Hunter S. Thompson, Hemingway, and Faulkner. I'm comfortable with Kerouac. I'm agitated with anything written past the 1970s. And if I do pick up anything past 1970, it's usually something that can be found in the deepest, darkest dungeons of a brilliant but unnoticed 'zine.So I picked up Sedaris's book for the sole reason that I thought the title was funny. Much to my surprise, the title wasn't the only thing that was amusing about the book. Sedaris is witty without even trying and has this incredible ability to make the obvious and the every day brilliantly funny. He's taken all the things that we complain about--living in Brooklyn, parents, lovers, tourists, learning a language--and has given them a personality of their own, something that I believe that only Sedaris can do. He's turned this anti-contemporary fiction reader into a full-fledged fan."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have read this book dozens of times and I still laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME I read it. How anyone's life could be that messed up and they still survive to adulthood is beyond me, but I for one am glad that David Sedaris has had a bizzare life."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Im only halfway through this book, but already, I can'twait to finish it and read his others. I am veryexcited to learn Mr Sedaris had several other books!Very funny, love it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Having just finished Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris, I felt really let down. Not because the book was a failure in my eyes, but because it was over, and I had no more opportunities to laugh out loud,nudge people and say, &quot;Hey, listen to this!&quot; Which doesn't exactly buy me any points with anyone. The book is the best of its genre: ascerbic and witty and, as I used to tell my creative writing students, self-effacing. One can hardly point out the absurdity of others without showing his own, and Sedaris does such a clean, uncluttered job of it that my critical editor demon, who lives in the hope that she will get a good piece of prose to chew up and spit out, goes hungry, and I am fed just enough. He manages to tell just enough, enough to make the reader believe in the truth as stranger than fiction essays in the book. I was being treated like an adult, one with enough intelligence to see much more than is on the paper, trusted with intimate details of a life strangely lived. Sedaris is the kind of writer that makes you want to meet him, hang out with and talk to and listen and try not to be embarrassed at the fact that he is maybe oblivious to the social laws he is breaking by sitting in boxer shorts and black socks in an outdoor restaurant. And I want to do the same.On a trip to England, my husband and I watched Miss Firecracker on the television in our room instead of joining in with the rest of the country's celebration of the 50th anniversary of D Day, which just happened to begin when we arrived, and which I was unaware of until getting off the plane. As we staggered into Heathrow, hundreds of signs were waving, hoping to connect with the great numbers of older couples,politicians, and entourages that had accompanied us on the flight. And on our return,a week after OJ drove down a California highway with a disguise and his passport, we were oblivious to the event and sordid details until we hit Boston. That's the kind of thing Sedaris helps us see--the embarrassment and confusion of coming into the room and knowing everyone is talking and then they suddenly turn to look at you and you want to think you don't know why but you have probably six reasons tucked away ready to jump up and own the enbarrassment and humiliation.I loved this book, pure and simple, and hope others who avoid nonfiction like the plague, as I do, will give it a try."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is a series of essays about speaking, some of which are laugh out loud funny, and others of which are just pleasant to read. The first few essays are about childhood and the author's speech therapy, and are quite funny and touching. The last few are about the author's attempt to learn French in France. If you have ever tried to learn a foreign language you know the ridiculous, embarassing mistakes you make. I read this book on a plane, and actually had to close the book during these essays because I was convulsing in laughter and the other passengers were starting to look at me funny.I recommend this book, mainly for the last few essays which I found hysterical. The first few are also good, don't get me wrong!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is a collection of humorous essays having to do with the author&#8217;s life and his observations, similar in format to those we&#8217;ve seen by Woody Allen, Steve Martin, George Carlin, or, if you go back far enough, Robert Benchley. They start when he was a boy in junior high school taking speech therapy lessons (&#8220;The word therapy suggested a profound failure on my part. Mental patients had therapy&#8221;), to his life as a fortysomething adult in France. In between he lives with his family in western New York and Raliegh, North Carolina, and as he grows up he works in various occupations in New York and Chicago. He also travels a lot. The essays are uneven to the extent that while some of them will cause you to bellow or guffaw uproariously, many will only cause you to chuckle gently or giggle uncontrollably. Yes, the book is that funny.Of course, the author was lucky enough to grow up in the Addams family. I take that back. The Addams family looks like Make Room for Daddy in comparison with Mr. Sedaris&#8217; family. There is his father, to begin with, who, among other things, can&#8217;t bear to throw away food. He keeps little bits of it tucked in the pockets of his clothes, his suitcase, behind his bed, you name it. Occasionally he&#8217;ll whip out a piece and start chewing. There is his sister, born and bred to be thin, who surprises her father one day with her &#8220;fat-suit.&#8221; She is also prone to saying things to her brother like, &#8220;Good luck on beating that rape charge!&#8221; while exiting a crowded subway with him on it. And then there is the pathologically profane brother, the self-proclaimed, &#8220;Rooster.&#8221; Mr. Sedaris has a lot of material to draw from, but then, it is doubtful that anyone else could quite put it his way.The brother essay is particularly funny. 5&#8217;4&#8221;, with a high, girlish voice, eleven years younger than Mr. Sedaris, he is the one member of the family who took to the South, unlike the rest of these transplanted New Yorkers. But I suspect even the South would have reservations about the Rooster: &#8220;Certain m*********** think they can f*** with my s***,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But you can&#8217;t kill the Rooster. You might f*** him up sometimes, but, b****, nobody kills the m************ Rooster. You know what I&#8217;m saying?&#8221;And then there is Mr. Sedaris trying to learn French, in France, with Poles and Italians and Koreans. The teacher asks them to try to explain Easter to the Morrocan student who has never heard of it. &#8220;A party for the little boy of God who call his self Jesus.&#8221; &#8220;He make the good things, and on the Easter we be sad because somebody makes him dead today.&#8221; &#8220;One too may eat of the chocolate,&#8221; says the Italian nanny. The teacher asks them who brings the chocolate. &#8220;The rabbit of Easter. He bring of the chocolate.&#8221; I could go on with this, but it is difficult to type when one&#8217;s fingers are shaking from laughing so hard.There is so much more. I&#8217;ve barely even scratched the surface. This book is a real treat. Light, witty, clever, occasionally insightful and always very, very funny. It serves as a great, humorous break between reading the Tolstoys and the Dostoyevskys of the world, and best of all, you don&#8217;t have to sacrifice your intelligence to do so."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris's style is wonderful. It is surpassed only by his imagination for topics to write about. The chapter on learning French had me on the floor laughing. Nearly 30 years, ago when we emigrated to Israel, we attended daily classes in Hebrew and his stringing together of sentences reminded me so much of myself at that time. Highly recommended for anyone who likes quirky humour and a great writing style."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Reading David Sedaris or listening to him on NPR feels like a guilty pleasure. He's just so funny that it seems somehow wrong to enjoy his take on life so much.But enjoy him I do. It could be his scathing humor, his bizarre family or fascinating life. Sedaris is a great essayist with an eye for the minute and ridiculous and the ability to tell funny, interesting, thought provoking stories of daily life."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Oh how I would love to meet David Sedaris. Other than Dave Barry, I have not read a book that has made me laugh so hard I cried. Mr. Sedaris can find humor in the most mundane and he makes ordinary people extraordinary. His storytelling ability is not to be rivaled. I almost felt like I was watching him in Paris. I can't wait to read the rest of his books, but this one will be hard to beat!!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris' Me Talk Pretty One Day is a very amusing collection of essays that I enjoyed, so long as I read them one or two at a time. I personally found, after reading more than that, that Sedaris's narcissism started getting on my nerves. That being said, these essays are very amusing, some more than others of course. A good portion of them concern his move to France, although many focus on his family. Sedaris story telling style relies heavily on the humorous exaggeration, and for the most part it works. Again though, after too many essays, it may grate on your nerves. This book is a fun read, definitely nontaxing (for instance, I was easily able to read these essays in a moving car (I wasn't driving)). Enjoy."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"What can be said? Truly one of the best story tellers around. Yes, I've read a number of the stories in other places previously or heard him read them live (a treat unto itself) but I cracked up just as hard the second time. The new ones were hysterical.Do yourself a favor and catch him live. The book was well worth the wait. Outstanding."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The first time I ever heard of or saw David Sedaris was when he went on the Late Show with David Letterman and read an excerpt from Me Talk Pretty One Day. I laughed so hard I almost threw up and the next day, I went on Amazon.com and ordered this book.I read it in about 3 days, and it is one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read in my life. This book is a classic. The way he tells stories is unbelievable and it is impossible to put this book down unless you're really hungry or you have to use the bathroom. [....] Sedaris is the wittiest writer that I can think of and his book was so amazing that I ordered Barrel Fever and Naked the same day I finished it.It is a great book to pick out stories from and read them out loud to your friends or family. The only problem with reading them out loud is that you'll probably start to laugh while reading it and have to pause for a moment while you catch your breath."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris's humor clearly appeals to a distinctive taste. Some times it is warped bordering on creepy (particularly in &quot;Holidays on Ice&quot;), but often his wry observations are very poignant. What I particularly appreciate is his ability to laugh at himself. He may poke fun at any and all, but he also doesn't take himself seriously.Having really enjoyed &quot;Naked&quot; I was very disappointed by the critical reviews in the press for &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;. Generally, reviewers flayed him for being too caustic and harshly criticizing Americans abroad now that he is an ex-pat.I am glad that I finally overcame my reluctance and read this book. I did not find &quot;Me Talk Pretty&quot; at all divergent from his other works; in fact it is equally satisfyiing. His wit here is consistently savage about the ignorant and rude, with an endearing appreciation of the quotidian and absurd. He continues to pugnaciously defend his right to an unhealthy habits, including tobacco and alcohol, and foods of dubious nutrition. Of course, appreciating Sedaris the reader has to recognize that he recognizes what is wrong and self destructive about these things and that he is mocking himself.Contrary to the prevailing opinion of the reviews (did they read the book or each other?) I didn't detect any sense that he has become a Francophile. In fact, his French hiatus has served as a foil that has enhanced his perspective on the United States, and has made his observations more insightful and he seems, in his own twisted way, to be more appreciative of many things here.I didn't enjoy every one of the essays; however, I didn't expect to either. Overall I did enjoy the collection, and while occasionally a bit too odd, I do find Sedaris's distinctive, absurd, and mostly sage humor quite refreshing."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Casual readers of the title of this review will no doubt wonder if Mr. Sedaris was naked in Barrel Fever, perhaps appearing nude in its pages or in the buff while writing it. But those of us who know and love Sedaris (and recognize &quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;Barrel Fever&quot; as the titles of his two wonderful books) should rejoice in the release of Me Talk Pretty One Day.Do not expect an essay on the perils of homosexual love with Mike Tyson, like the one that graced Barrel Fever. Me Talk Pretty continues the trajectory begun with Naked. The work is still funny, but it's not side splitting like Santaland Diaries was; instead, it has the humor of honesty: these things are funny because they happened, and because they happened to someone with such a noticable gift for conveying personal tragedy as Mr. Sedaris.Indeed, Me So Pretty is, if anything, more naked than Naked. Perhaps you thought that Mr. Sedaris had no more secrets to reveal, no nooks and crannies of his early personal life left unilluminated after his 1998 autobiography. Me So Pretty proves that, at least for someone as talented as Mr. Sedaris, there is no end to facets that can be evoked from one's life.Or the giggles."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"IF YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF TWISTED SENSE OF HUMOR YOU'LL BE LAUGHING OUT LOUD AND STRANGERS WILL BE EITHER WANTING TO SEE THE TITLE OR PEOPLE WILL START MOVING AWAY FROM YOU .

'Me Talk Pretty One Day' will not be a contendor for the next Pulitzer Prize due to it's ground breaking literary contention, but it will make you laugh for a little while. The novel and it's author display an amazingly eccentric ability for not ALWAYS taking life so seriously.Through this collection of short essays, David Sedaris (often heard on NPR) takes us through his malfunctioned childhood in North Carolina, his drug induced and somewhat irresponsible twenties to his days of living in New York and Paris in his early and late thirties. Tons of quaint anecdotes throughout his life are comprised to make this quirky (and sometimes humurously perverse) story, it is an excellent and refreshing break from the more serious novles, and most certainly deserves it's place on the NY Times Best seller list.Although not my normal stlye of reading, I would certainly reccomend this novel to anyone. It's short, quick, easy to read, plus you get the bonus of a non-fiction reading choice that reads like a soap opera. Some may find it a little idiotic, but the truth is that Sedaris thinks the same zany many of us do, we just don't admit it as openly. It's quite a refreshing change of pace during such serious times and will cause the reader to remember how much fun it is to laugh at your self once in a while."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I laughed so hard reading this book that snot came out of my nose."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I approached this book with great anticipation, because I had already read any and everything I could find that David Sedaris had written.The book more than met my expectations.My only regret was when I finished it,which,was too soon.Every chapter is a gem.I've done nothing but tell anyone who will listen,even make eye contact,to read this book.The thrill of my life,was to have my copy authographed by David,when he appeared at one of our local bookstores.He was a genuinely nice guy and hearing him in person,is an experience I will cherish forever."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was lucky to hear Mr. Sedaris read excerpts from this book on a visit to Milwaukee as he was writing this book.

I may have stopped laughing long enough to grab a bite to eat or mix a drink. \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is even better.Sedaris, in his own charming, self-deprecating way, tackles living in a foreign country, a childhood speech impediment, and the difficult subject of being gay (without making it the center of his works) delightfully. His wit - dry in places, far from dry in others - and charm shine through in every story.Really, the best part of these stories is that just about every one of us can relate to most of them. Strange neighbors, childhood traumas, etc. Sedaris proves that every life is interesting and full of memories. I can't wait for more."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have taken my sweet time getting to the end of this book. And now I am rewarded for my efforts. Sedaris's 'Dress your family...' is about to arrive on June 1st. HIP HIP HOORAY!!!!'Me talk pretty...' is so WONDERFULLY REFRESHING. I have taken a lot of time to get through it because I just don't want it to end.But NOW I can finish it and enjoy a new Sedaris book in just a few days.'Naked' was my first introduction to Sedaris and I found myself laughing even harder with 'Me talk pretty one day'. He depicts his life adventures (trully that is what they are) with such dry humor that you will indeed find yourself laughing in public, if you chose to venture outdoors with his books. The reader should be warned!I LOVE DAVID SEDARIS!!! BUY HIS BOOKS, NOW.(Except for 'Barrel Fever', not as funny.)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'm reading this book again on the eve of a family week-long trip to Paris. Although I know I thoroughly enjoyed the book the first time, it is just and funny and fresh on the second read. I'm not the type who normally laughs out loud while reading or watching t.v. for that matter, but certain pieces in this book have had me in TEARS!!! David Sedaris is a genius! I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes brainy satire and enjoys a good laugh..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"i laughed alot but not as much as i was supposed to. not alll of it was funny but it was pretty good."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I've read this book twice, and it was even funnier the second time. Sedaris has had very interesting and amusing life experiences, and he's more than willing to share these with us. As a chain-smoking, lisping homosexual in a country that has banned smoking for the most part and often detests gay men with \\"effeminate\\" characteristics, Sedaris is unabashed and certainly not regretful.He shares his experiences of his quirky family that includes his sister Amy Sedaris, former star of \\"Strangers with Candy\\" and his rotten-fruit-eating father. He recounts his struggles with a speech therapist who attempts to correct his lisping (the apparently obvious mark of homosexuality) and his brilliant tactics to avoid its correction. Many of his stories are taken from his time in France where he lived with his boyfriend Hugh. These stories successfully convey both the difficulties and joys of living the expatriate life - appreciating a new culture, learning a new language, and viewing American tourists in a new and often all too revealing light.The best of his stories, in my opinion, unleashes onto us his younger brother, a foul-mouthed, gangster rap fan who is a stark contrast to his father but is his most dependable support. This particular story really demonstrates what Sedaris is capable of. It's incredibly funny but so poignant at the same time.This book will make you laugh at loud, and I hope you get a chance to read it. Make sure you check out \\"Naked\\" also for more of Sedaris' brilliance."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Borrowed and plowed through this book in a few days on a busy vacation this summer. LOVED IT. Unusual humor, well written, easy to read and funny as hell. Some good themes to think about, as well. I only read a handful of nonfiction books a year, and am glad I grabbed this one. Couldn't put it down till it was over, and when it was gone, I was wishing for more."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was standing in Miami Airport, looking for something to read on my impending long flight. I saw this book, flipped through a couple of pages and thought &quot;What the heck?&quot; The hours that followed were filled with my audible and uncontrollable laughter permeating through the departure lounge and the aircraft. I kept grabbing my best friend/travel companion so I could read passages to her - I haven't laughed that much in a long time. I have since purchased an unprecedented 10 volumes for family and friends, so impressed am I with this work. David Sedaris' take on life is hilarious - the chapter on his brother, Paul, &quot;The Rooster&quot; is one of my favourites. Each chapter is a short story about one subject or the next. Make sure you concentrate on each one. I now own all the David Sedaris books, and can't wait for his next installment.Just terrific!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was recommended by one of my brightest friends so, despite its weird title, I picked it up and started reading. I quickly found that Mr. Sedaris has an incredible gift for writing straight from the heart and telling it like it is. As a former foreign language teacher, I especially connected with the hysterical accounts of his struggle with French - which is where the weird title comes from, by the way. The format of this book is a refreshing break from the novel genre, especially for someone with time constraints that don't always allow huge chunks of reading pleasure. While there were a few essays which I could have done without, overall I found reading Me Talk Pretty One Day to be a wonderfully entertaining way to spend my time."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I could hardly put the book down as I read the first chapter. However, I was disappointed as I continued through the book. I did not find the subsequent chapters as entertaining. It was a easy read for vacation, but it did not keep me engaged."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is one funny book! I was reading it in bed one night and my laughter kept waking my husband. When David and his partner hit France the laughs are almost non-stop. If you need a good guffaw this should do it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I often wanted aspects of my life put into a book or on television and I always suspected that I was being watched at times, now I know I was. David Sadaris has captured pieces of all of our lives in his book ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY. Sadaris sense of humor and life's experiences are ones to be envyed and enjoyed. He openinly shares those life lessons which at the time were hard to learn but in retrospect are hilarious. From learning to play guitar to the death of a pet, Sadaris shares his feeling and experiences in a way to make the more cynical person laugh out loud.In the story &quot;The Youth In Asia&quot; Sadaris writes about the many family pets that often come and go in the typical American Family. After the death of a cat, Sadaris' mother was torn. David and his sisters were of no help as the rubbed salt in the wound of her lost in a way I wish I would have dreamed up. Of course mothers and elephants never forget as David experiences his own lost of a pet and his mother helps pay the expense of having the cat cremated and lovingly wrote a check with a memo that will cause you to scream in delight.Part two of the book is devoted to David's life in France where he must learn the language and the traditions of the French. Unlike most Americans, Sadaris is not overly concerned to see the Louve or the Eiffel Tower, he is facinated with watching old &quot;B&quot; movies from the United States. Although armed only with less French than an American high schooler, he is able to muddle through France and find humor in his life that all of us can appreciate.WARNING TO ALL READERS - Be sure you read this book in a place where you can laugh out loud. Because you will."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Just as entertaining as Naked - keeps you interested and laughing the entire book. It was a great book to pass around with our teen agers on a road trip. We all took turns reading. The time flew by. Some material risky for kids under 15 or 16, but anyone else will find his stories compelling and hilarious."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I bought this book at an airport assuming I was going to read it after I finished the one I had midway completed. I had to change my plans, I was having so much fun with his stories that I could not put it down. He surely made me laugh with his less than perfect life. It is lovable to read someone who can laugh at his past and allow us do that at the same time. I have a lot of compassion for the author father though. I would not allow my teenage kid to read it, the reference to drug use is very graphic and I got the underlying message that you can come up right from drugs without any grueling effort."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I recently read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" and \\"Naked\\" (both by David Sedaris). Sedaris' style is very funny, tongue in cheek though some of the humor is extremely subtle. Anyone with a dry sense of humor will enjoy this, and gay men who can relate to the vignettes about growing up different will find it especially familiar.The later chapters of each book seem to have a sitcom-esque quality to them, though. The chapters seem to end where they began, as if they could be read in any order. Despite the subtlety of the humor, the comedy seems dull and repetitive by the end of the book. ..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"How many times have you read a review on the jacket sleeve of a book that coins the phrase &quot;laugh out loud funny&quot;, you bought the book, and then wondered if you had missed the section of the book referred to has &quot;laugh out loud funny&quot;? Well, this is truly a book that will make you laugh out loud. It took several chapters, but starting with &quot;You Can't Kill the Rooster&quot; and continuing on for several more chapters I couldn't help but laugh as though I were watching a comedy movie in the theater. Although the book tends to trail off near the end, the middle portion is well worth the investment. Irreverent, honest, poignant, enrapturing ... all descriptives that capture this book. I was taken in from the first page and didn't let go until I was finished."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The stories in this book are funny, there's no doubt about it, but I kept hearing that his writing was comparable to Augusten Burroughs so my expectations were much higher. While not as funny as Burroughs, the stories in this book were nothing shy of compelling and fun. Worth reading. I look forward to reading more of his work in the future."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was the first work that I read by Sedaris. I actually listened to the audio version first which is narrated by him. I immediately bought everything else he had written. I laughed I cried and I don't doubt that you will too. BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Anything by David Sedaris is better when he reads it to you than reading it yourself. Nevertheless, it is still a great fun read. So read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is a riot! It's taking me forever to read it because I've been laughing so hard that I'm crying and can't focus my eyes on the page! If you don't like drawing attention to yourself, DON'T READ THIS IN A PUBLIC PLACE! LOL!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"So be careful if you are reading it in public! This is the first book by Sedaris that I've read, and now I want to read them all. The series of short stories made me laugh so hard I had to put it down and take a moment. I most loved the ones about his family, sister Amy and brother aka \\"The Rooster.\\" Sedaris sometimes paints himself in the book to be such an unintelligent outsider/slacker, it's almost hard to believe he crafted such a well-written book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris's work is original, humorous and poignant. This is the best of his writing and a great place for a reader to begin his love affair with Sedaris. Sedaris is an extremely prominent figure in the world of the memoir. If this is a type of literature that generally interest you, this will be a treat."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Hearing David Sedaris sing television jingle lyrics in the voice of Billy Holiday is priceless, and sheer satirical genius. Sedaris' fourth book of short stories will once again make you laugh out loud with glee. Many of the stories center around the theme of \\"speech\\". Sedaris swears off the letter S as a child tortured by his Southern speech therapist. He struggles with the inability to speak as an adult when he moves to France and attends language school. His self deprecating humor is a delight and Sedaris continues to find humor and poignancy amidst his quirky family and the banal moments of life. If you have never heard Sedaris read his own writing than you are missing a whole other dimension to his humor. Check out the audiobook, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Hilarious! This is the first David Sedaris book I read, and after reading it I was hooked on this author."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris never fails to delight, but his MTP is the best thing he's ever come up with. There are far too many situations in this collection of essays to mention, but suffice it to say that you won't want to read this in public, lest you laugh out loud."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I reread this recently and I laughed as much as I did the first time I read it. David Sedaris is quite a national treasure even though most people don't know who he is! His writing is wonderful, poignant, sentimental and hilarious. The man knows how to write well and you can tell he continues to love his craft.I don't think I have read a book that made me laugh as much as this one did. I think I had to put this book down at least a hundred times and walk away from it because I was laughing too hard. You know, the kind of laughing that causes mild asphyxiation.This book is delirious with humor and great story telling. A must read for anyone who wants to have a wonderful reading experience. I don't see how you could miss with Me Talk Pretty One Day."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I randomly picked up this book, and I'm glad I did. I had no knowledge of David Sedaris' writing personally. By the middle of the book, I was laughing out loud for the first time ever while reading a book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"...reading his stories is like watching your crazy neighbors scrapping next door through a hole in the wall, and it's hard not to look away. You just think...thank God that's not my family! Like his other books, Me Talk Pretty is made up of numerous humorous (and hopefully exaggerated) anecdotes from Mr. Sedaris' recent and not-so-recent past.In the first story, a young David hilariously attempts to outwit the Agent--actually a young female speech therapist assigned to rid him of his lisp. About halfway through the book, after self-depracating discussions of his failures as guitar student, performance artist, and creative writing teacher who pulls his lesson plans from daytime Soaps, Sedaris again broaches the topic of \\"talking pretty\\". This time, he is trying to learn French. He wants to live with his boyfriend in a tiny Normandy village, which is difficult if the only French word you know is \\"ashtray\\".I thought the depictions of his French class and village life were the highlight of this collection, especially \\"Jesus Shaves\\" and it's discussion of Easter. When Sedaris makes the faux pas of mentioning the American tradition of the Easter Bunny, his (decidedly masochistic) French instructor corrects him: \\"here in France, a giant bell flies in from Rome bringing chocolate for all the boys and girls.\\" David observes that \\"a bell has all the personality of a cast-iron skillet.\\" And when a Moroccan muslim student asks about the point of Easter the other students, in their limited vocabulary, provide comic, wholly inadequate explanations.Bottom line: extremely addicting fare from Mr. Sedaris...laugh-out-loud funny in a macabre sort of way."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Great, funny & entertaining stories. Laughing out loud like mad. If you get embarrassed easily, definitely do not read in public :)Can't wait to read the rest of his work!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Priceless Advice to you all : get it on tape, he has the cute little boy voice and he does various impressions of whomever he is telling the story about.Some are better than others but there are several that made roll with laughter.I loved hearing about his dad and all of his wierd packrat habits and his clark griswold like optimismHis little sister Amy who lives with her imaginary boyfriend and likes to play mean, bizarre pranks on people.fav essays were Youth in Asia , Go Carolina and the last one where his dad only most eats his hat.the one about his drug use was devastating and bothered me alot because everything was so funny and then he starts on such a serious topic..But I think it was brave that he put it his novel.If you like dry funny conversational essays, you will enjoy this."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris did an excellent job meshing together humor and anecdotes to create a book that both powerfully funny and unendingly creative. Whether his life was really this adventurous is up to interpretation, but even if they are all lies, they're average enough to believe.There are multiple aspects of the book that make it a page-turners dream. Its \\"interesting essay\\" breakup, excessive use of humor, and imaginative characters all up to one grand book.The essay format I'm talking about is Sedaris's usual prose. He breaks up his interesting life into succinct chapters that are actuallly standalone essays that seem to casually flow together, except for where the author purposely leave out content to make you guess or feel different than if you knew all of the innards of the situation, such as the first few times Hugh is mentioned.Hugh is one of the many interesting and hilarious characters that have surrounded Sedaris through his life. I won't go into the characters and their personal quirks due to the spoilers, but trust they are not a boring bunch.So, Sedaris's semi-autobiography is full of laughs, laughs, and, uh, laughs. I'd recommend reading the second or thrid chapter. If you like it, you'll love the book, if you don't, this may not be for you. Just grab your funny bones and be prepared to stay up all night. This is one book you won't want to miss, unless you like your world unfunny that is."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"hilarious. awesome. loved loved loved this. this is sedaris' best best book, and it is incredible."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One DayVery quick read it keeps you wanting to turn the page if you dont know whats coming next but then nothing really interesting comes next!

My only complaint is that I wanted the book to be much, much longer. It's a great book for busy people who can only read a chapter at a time. I will admit, I did question my sanity while reading this since most of the humor is rather twisted. But if insanity breeds this kind of humor, I don't mind. Buy the book if you want to laugh. Period."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This memoir is Garrison Keillor crossed with Augusten Burroughs. More drugs than Keillor, but less depravity than Burroughs. It's non-linear and each essay is a portrayal of an event in his life or a family member. As you read it, it becomes apparent some embellishment is going on. It's a shared wink, I think, between author and reader, and I didn't mind. He's a James Thurber for our age.One of the shortest essays, \\"Big Boy,\\" is the funniest. At a party, he has to go to the bathroom. Once there, he discovers that the toilet contains a huge, uh, product that will not flush away. Someone knocks on the door and he panics, not wanting the next visitor to think said product is his. What to do? Well, there's a window ...In his portrayal of the childhood and teen years of his sister, the actress Amy Sedaris, he shows that she was headed to the stage at an early age. She wore fat suits to dismay her father. She made phone calls, imitating the voice of someone else. She would put fake cuts and bruises on her face and when asked how she got them, would reply, \\"I'm in love!\\"His mockery of New York restaurants that offer absurd, overpriced meals with ridiculous ingredients stacked vertically on the plate is priceless. After the meal, he buys a hot dog, relieved to be eating something \\"horizontal.\\"David Sedaris is one funny guy."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much. It was a fun, quick read. This book is very similar to one of his other books, \\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\\". Both books are a delightful way to kill time on a long plane ride."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is my favorite book by David Sedaris. It is the rare work that will have you not only laughing out loud, but grabbing your friends to have them read what you just read, yourself, to share in the hilarity immediately. Years after reading it, I can still recall the wacky French lessons and the unfortunate bathroom experience at a friend's party. Don't miss!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I love David Sedaris and his work. If you understand his sense of humor and enjoy him as an author you will love this book. \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is a collection of essays each of which cracked me up! This book provides an account of his life story - which is not what I would consider as being 'normal'. If you don't like or understand dry humor or if you don't think, or are not knowledgeable, on a global level you may overlook many of the funny moments. David's work is often compared to that of Mark Twain's. I have read other books by David such as; \\"Barrel Fever\\", \\"Naked\\", and \\"Holidays on Ice\\". I have enjoyed all 4 of thes books!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris' descriptions of his pathetic attempts at various endeavors throughout his life made me laugh out loud. Everyone shares similar experiences of failure and the sense of inadequacy, and Sedaris makes his incredibly funny. I loved the descriptions of his crazy family members, especially his parents. His description of learning French is realistic to me since it was my college minor. I've sat in that same chair."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Okay, so I like crazy. David Sedaris always provides a good amount of entertainment with his tales. His perspective is funny, and I think his family really helped create his zest for humor.

On one hand, I was rather unimpressed with this audiobook. The stories were okay, but most of them just gave me a chuckle or two or, worse, just mild amusement. On the other hand, perhaps it was just my mood, maybe I am not used to reading humor books.But I am getting ahead of myself.In David Sedaris' \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", Dave Sedaris relates episodes from his past, primarily concerning speech and his stay in France. I won't really say much more as it could destroy the humor from the situations that Sedaris creates in the books (for those that plan on reading). I've also heard that this is not exactly a biography as some of the stories were exaggerated for the humorous effect, but as I didn't expect 100% historical accuracy, I wasn't too concerned.First thing first, the audiobook does not have all the anecdotes that are in the novel form. I checked out both the audiobook and the novel (I was hoping to have time to read the novel for my Book Club, but that wasn't meant to be, so I also got the audiobook), and a quick comparsion showed that several stories particularly from the first section are missing in the audiobook.As for the sections I listened to, I found myself time and again underwhelmed. I would listen and maybe get a mild sensation of amusement. Sometimes, on a rare occasion, I would let loose a small chuckle. Only towards the end did I find myself belly-laughing.A lot of the humor tended to be deprecatory or rather gruesome. A good example of this would be the first anecdote \\"Go Carolina\\", in which a teacher purposely lies to David to get him to reveal his lisp and then laughs in his face. I just didn't get the humor of the episode, to be honest. Even though I know that it was likely hyperbole, I just couldn't get past a teacher acting so callously. Another good example of the disturbing humor is \\"Twelve Moments in the Life of the Artist\\". Most of the \\"moments\\" seemed to be nothing more than drug jokes. While some were admittedly mildly amusing, I never found any of these gut-wrenchingly funny.That doesn't mean the entire book was dry and boring and humorless. There were some times that I did chuckle or laugh heartily. For instance, \\"Nutcracker.com\\" really tickled me with Dave's tales about traveling with a typewriter and his disgust for computers. \\"Jesus Shaves\\" was hilarious in how some students tried to explain Easter in French to a Moroccan student. Other stories I liked were \\"Pledge Allegiance to the Bag\\" and some of the \\"Precious Moments\\" anecdotes.Perhaps it was my mood (because I do tend to like dry humor similar to Sedaris'), as the latter anecdotes sparked more of a reaction in me. Perhaps it was the format (audiobooks can sometimes lose me). Maybe it was the delivery (Sedaris himself read them, but maybe his delivery deadened the \\"jokes\\" for me). Whatever the case, the book just wasn't all that funny to me, and for that reason, I can't give high ratings. If I do end up reading the novel, I'll update this review with my thoughts, if they've changed.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'm not certain if one acquires a taste for David Sedaris, or already has a twisted sense of humor like his, therefore can easily relate to how he assembles and crafts his essays. Or is it both? I do have to admit that some of his books are better (more funny......funnier! than others) but this one is a gem. One of my favorite parts is when he translates verbatim what the students in his French class are attempting to say in French, but with the English translation. I was riding the bus home when I read that and had a very difficult time supressing my laughter so other's wouldn't think I was crazy. Very funny stuff.Buy this book and read it. It's truly well crafted."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was the first book I have read of David Sedaris.

But some of them certainly are, and are great.

I suggest reading in privacy as you will surely resemble someone with a Plague of Tics or Tourettes while you try to stifle your laughter in a public place. Plus, if you read in private i.e. at home, you'll have a change of undewear handy :-)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris writes humour of the New Yorker, and does so very successfully. I read one of his articles about a fellow airline passenger who was weeping due to a recent bereavement. Sederis, initially sympathetic, reminisced about his own past bereavements - mainly broken hearts - and how he had used them to assume a sympathetic persona. He concluded the article by thinking how his fellow passenger was just a tad overdoing the tears. It was quite a complex piece, done with pace and humour. I like it so much I bought this book.It's a collection of pieces which I presume were articles published separately before. I committed my usual mistake, and read the book from cover to cover, so that by the end there was a certain staleness and sameness to the articles. However, in general, I think the first section - dealing with Sedaris' family and youth were very funny. His family is of Greek origin, his father, sister and brother seem odd enough to provide even a less gifted humourist with material Sederis himself in gay, and grew up with a lisp for which he went to speech therapy - the first story, about the Speech Therapist, is for me, the best in the book. He manages to poke fun at himself, at his parents for sending him, and he exacts revenge (after all these years) on the speech therapist herself; all while keeping the reader interested and on his side. Remarkable.The second section of the book is a lot less interesting. He goes to France with his boyfriend, and has funny things to say about the French, about American's in France and about French language and culture. Even though the humourous tone is maintained, and he tries to be ironic about the \`gee-whiz' nature of American's observing the French, I think he falls into his own trap here. A much better book on this is Adam Gopnick's (another New Yorker writer) \`Paris to the Moon'.Nonetheless, the book is well worth a read. The humour is sustained and there were several times I laughed out loud. If you can dip into and out of this book over time, I think it's very rewarding ."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"\\"As far as I was concerned, the French could be cold or even openly hostile. They could burn my flag or pelt me with stones, but if there were taxidermied kittens to be had then I would go and bring them back to this, the greatest country on earth.\\"David Sedaris's new collection, Me Talk Pretty One Day, tells a most unconventional life story. It begins with a North Carolina childhood filled with speech-therapy classes (\\"There was the lisp, of course, but more troubling than that was my voice itself with its excitable tone and high, girlish pitch\\") and unwanted guitar lessons taught by a midget. From budding performance artist (\\"The only crimp in my plan was that I seemed to have no talent whatsoever\\") to \\"clearly unqualified\\" writing teacher in Chicago, Sedaris's career leads him to New York (the sky's-the-limit field of furniture moving) and eventually, of all places, France.Sedaris's move to Paris poses a number of challenges, chief among them his inability to speak the language. Arriving a \\"spooky man-child\\" capable of communicating only through nouns, he undertakes language instruction that leads him ever deeper into cultural confusion. Whether describing the Easter bunny to puzzled classmates, savoring movies in translation (It Is Necessary to Save the Soldier Ryan), or watching a group of men play soccer with a cow, Sedaris brings a view and a voice like none other."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Consistently funny, sardonic, and dark, David Sedaris is both brilliant and self-depreciating. Such critical wit should be experienced by everyone.This book--like most of his works--is a collection of short stories. What's unique is that they tend to be more about him and his experiences in Paris or NY (often with his boyfriend, Hugh) than his previous works. \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is a real gem and should be admired both for its humor and its focus. The chapters of him in France (\\"Jesus Shaves\\", \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", \\"The Tapeworm Is In\\", etc.) are the highlights, though anything involving his Greek father is worth noting as well (\\"Genetic Engineering\\" and \\"Giant Dreams, Midget Abilities\\"). Also, everything involving his brother, \\"the Rooster\\", is hysterical.Basically, buy this book and read it twice, then stick it on a shelf for a year and read it again, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Like many people, I became aware of David Sedaris through listening to the SantaLand Diaries on public radio. You don't get many elf perspectives these days -- or any days really. But, if you did, this would be the best of them. You'll laugh your pointy elf shoes off.Me Talk Pretty takes a broader autobiographical approach, from his battle with those who would silence his sibilance to misguided midgets teaching guitar. He offers up a self-deprecating style that leads you into one absurd encounter after another. All of them told with very funny and witty writing. Sometimes this kind of thing can be a bit self absorbed to the point where you get tired of it or it simply loses its edge but this manages to maintain. If you want funny, this is it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I first heard about this book on NPR, but I didn't actually get around to buying it until now. Sorry I waited. Mordant, dry, hilarious--as you probably have heard by now. So here's my only request: let's hear more from \\"Hugh\\", Sedaris's better-half and the straight man to much of his humor."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I can't decide how to rate this book using Amazon's system. 3 stars seems too low and 4 seems a little too high. This is the first Sedaris book I have read so I can't compare it to his other work. This is a series of autobiographical essays that are well written and driven by a sharp, multi-hued wit. It starts off with a great story of how Sedaris quietly fought a speech therapist who was trying to teach him not to lisp by avoiding all words with an 's' in them. One of my favorite lines in the book is when instead of saying 'rivers' he says 'many a river'. The strongest group of essays for me were when he went to live in Paris and took classes to learn how to speek French and quickly learned words and phrases that would never do him any good like 'facial swelling' and 'ashtray'. These essays provided most of the laugh out loud moments.Not every essay is funny. A few were tedious and others just sat there begging to be skipped over. Sedaris is a very funny writer. I wouldn't call this book hilarious as others have, but humor may be the most subjective of the art forms."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I think this is quite possibly the funniest book I've ever read! David Sedaris trawls through his life and up-bringing to deliver hilarious observations and stories, describing failures, foibles and more failures in minute detail. He has an eye for the little things, the tiny events and ironies that make up this cruel world, and a knack of abstracting ad absurdea. He paints a very self-deprecating, lovingly shambolic picture of himself through his writings, and it's the real identification with his character that causes you to laugh when he laughs and laugh when he cries.My favourite story is called &quot;Big Boy&quot; and details his attempts to use the bathroom at a garden party. It's insane that three pages can be this funny! I read it on an airplane and I was crying with laughter, much the the discomfort of the stranger sitting beside me. You need to read it and see...I'm not sure this book is for everyone though - if you're a conservative, homophobic, new-york-hater you'll find it hard to identify with the author, and therefore the humour might be lost, but you should probably read it anyway to cure yourself of your conservatism and homophobia...My favourite line details his experience with speech therapy classes in school, &quot;They should've put a sign above the door saying &quot;Future Homosexuals of America&quot;...&quot;. If you think that's outrageously funny then you'll love this book..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'd never heard of David Sedaris before and I bought the book primarily because a favorite teacher of mine was reading it and enjoyed it (thank you, Ms. Knight!) It's fantastic. His humor is right on the mark, his satire is wildly funny, and he catapults you into a meaningless existance - his own life. (That was a joke.) Comparable in humor to Eddie Izzard, cleverness abounding crazily - David Sedaris is amazingly (I am not going to say &quot;gifted&quot;) bestowed with a humor and reach far beyond his self-depracted IQ. He begins the story talking about the trials of his lisp and the general consensus that awaits such a boy, and ends it on a clever note with a hilarial account of his father's stash 'n spoil eating habits. Not for the faint of heart, Me Talk Pretty One Day is a glorious revelation of silly, nonsensical tales of someone too funny for his own good. Recommending this book isn't enough - I encourage it for anyone not too stuffed by morals. ;)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"better than his other books. i thought naked was boring and weird, a little self indulgent. this is really funny and interesting. stories about his dad are both funny and touching, and the essay about his brother the rooster is classic. check it out."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I brought Me Talk Pretty One Day on vacation with me recently and spent the entire time interrupting my husband's reading with hysterical tears of laughter. I basically read the entire book out loud to him because you can't just read a portion of it. He has such a wonderful ability of describing his life and the people around him. (I can't believe that some of this stuff actually happened). It's a light read and I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Slate magazine recently carried an article charging, in essence, that Sedaris was a fraud. The article's author alleged that there is evidence Sedaris has embellished some of his stories, so his writing is not really non-fiction. I think that argument misses the point - no one reads Sedaris to be educated on any topic, people read him because he makes them laugh. If he embellishes stories of his life to make them funnier I am fine with that - I'm looking for some laugh-out-loud stories now and then to lighten the load of daily life. I get enough of the reality of life in the news with the Iraq war, the widening Republican/Abramoff corruption scandal, our taxpayer dollars being stolen by companies our government has hired to provide services in Iraq and at home (Rep Duke Cunningham in jail, Brent Wilkes and ex-CIA guy Dusty Foggo facing charges,) global warming, etc.My absolute favorite Sedaris story is the one in this volume about the French language class he took after moving to France. The attempts of some of the students to explain Easter, with its crucifixation, Easter Bunny story, and candy, to a middle easterner made me laugh out loud. its great that his writing appears in The New Yorker sometimes so I can get a Sedaris fix between books."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"you don't know where the author is going with this book, but thats what makes it great. It's not a fast read, you actually get so into each chapter, each story, that you need total concentration.I read most of it on the train to and from work. I smiled alot, laughed out loud alot and sometimes just shook my head.Just read this book, don't ask any questions, buy, read and you'll just love it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris has an absolutely extraordinary ability to communicate the humor and absurdity in common situations - family holidays, menial jobs, learning a new language, etc. I bought this book on a friend's recommendation, and after reading it I immediately bought another copy to send to my family."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"...always pick David Sedaris. His writing never let's you down. He is always engaging and hilariously funny...but he never stoops to trying to hard by being gross. His situations and characters are outlandish...but there's always a grain of truth and realism. Which makes the humor all the more satisfying. It's vivid, alive, funny and even touching at times. And they are the kind of stories that you can read every few years...seeing the characters again is like visiting old friends."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Another collection of essays from a brilliant wit who you know you love to read. It's like I've said in my reviews before. There's no need to review each book when I can just give the author a blanket endorsement and guarantee you'll love whatever you find by the guy. I love it when that happens. I may have annoyed Jan by laughing out loud too often. Sedaris is like that."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the 3rd book i've read of Sedaris'. He is witty, crazy, weird and lovable all at the same time.The story about his lisping problems is absolutely hilarious--probably one of my favourtite David tales--it is really hard to pick favourites!If a good hearty laugh at someone else's expense is what you're after, pick up any of David's books ;)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is the front-runner of a new style of writing. Much like the unprecedented insurgence of reality TV, \\"reality literature\\" has bursted throught the book-worm doors and taken us all by storm. While this memoir will hardly edify you it will most certainly keep you laughing. I suppose the only way one could dislike Me Talk Pretty One Day is if they are trying to find some deeper meaning within David Sedaris' rambles on nests made of human hair, and his father's obsession with stocking and consuming spoiled food (and clothing!). I enthusiastically recommend giving Me Talk Pretty One Day a read (so long as you are aware that it won't make you a better person)."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris is witty moving and hysterical. He finds humor in everything, and twists it into lessons and love. Whether he is describing his lack of French fluency, childhood guitar lessons, or his time as an \\"artist\\" Sedaris writes to every audience, adressing questions, fears, and joys of every life."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have never, ever read a funnier book. An excellent collection of short stories. For the first time in my life, I had to stop and read lines out loud to a friend so I had someone to share the hilarity with. His other books are good but not as good so I would start with them and end with this one- that way you save the best for last. You also get to know the character in Sedaris' life."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"DAVID SEDARIS IS ONE OF THE FUNNIER AUTHORS TODAY! I loved this book -- and so did my husband. We read chapters out loud to each other at night in bed -- and it was the 2nd most fun thing to do in bed! :-) Thank you David!!!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is my first exposure to David Sedaris, and I'm totally impressed. His descriptions of his slightly-cracked family and friends reminded me of a less genteel James Thurber. Sedaris is original, self-deprecating, and totally engaging. I laughed out loud at some point in just about every essay. He certainly knows how to write for his audience.Loved it!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"What a fantastic book! I couldn't put this one down. I highly recommend it! The essay about the family pet was VERY AMUSING and reminded me of my own family."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I often find that when others claim a book is funny, it usually isn't very humorous. However, Me Talk Pretty One Day is the exception to this rule. Sedaris' short essays about small things in life are much like a Seinfield episode. His telling style and honesty about himself makes you feel as humble and as human as he is throughout the book. It is extremley well done, and it extremley hilarious."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I enjoyed stray lines from TALK, but overall it seemed much less like a cohesive whole than NAKED and certainly less surprising and funny than BARREL FEVER. Some of the essays were downright pedestrian. Vertical food presentation? Who cares. Sometimes they lose luggage on airplanes, too. And the rant against technology? Hey, how about an article about how tough it is to program a VCR. Some of the pieces seemed tame enough and [slow] enough for NPR but not insightful and edgy enough for a book with David Sedaris' name on the cover."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The excitement which gripped me when I saw that David Sedaris' new book, ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY, had come out was considerable. After all, this is the author whose comic voice I read as it developed in his first collection (BARREL FEVER). In that collection, Sedaris evolved from a rather aggravatingly shock-oriented short story author, to a man who was able to mine his considerably ridiculous autobiography for such brilliant short stories as GIANTESS and THE SANTALAND DIARIES.Then Sedaris wrote NAKED, a book that I return to once a year because of its amazing critical wit, a vitriol-filled eye that Sedaris does not spare himself from. Balancing this evil eye is a strong sense of humanity and heart (espeically in such short stories as ASHES) that keep the author from seeming too gutless and cruel.And now comes Sedaris' third collection of essays, &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;. True, the collection has many things going for it. Even though Sedaris is in a happy, well-adjusted relationship, his satirical vision is still intact. The author can crack a joke that bends you to its will, forcing you to laugh. But all of those things are present in NAKED.What this collection lacks are those things present in his earlier collection-- a sense of coherency and the insights that his critical eyes lead him to. NAKED is not framed as a coherent narrative yet it clearly follows the author from young childhood through to adulthood in his various journeys of self, whether hitchhiking with a quadraplegic or house cleaning for a lesbian anti-semite. ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY is packaged as a coherent narrative of Sedaris' experiences with the language, but rarely do the essays seem to really interrelate until the second half of the book when he gets to France.A lot of the time, the essays seem more catty than observational. Sedaris rests on the laurels of his humor, as opposed to making the kind of brilliant observations that mark his stories as something special. This collection is very funny, but it lacks the backbone that Sedaris' fans have come to expect from him. So, in other words, wait for the paperback, go buy NAKED, and read it a couple of times..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This collection contains what may be the funniest piece Sedaris has yet written, &quot;You Can't Kill the Rooster.&quot; It's about David's feisty, incredibly foul-mouthed brother and the touching relationship he has with their father. The first time I read it I nearly killed myself laughing (Paul Sedaris sounds like Daffy Duck crossed with a hardcore rapper.) Pure greatness."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Like another reviewer, I regret having read it so fast. It's another fabulously funny book by one of our world's truly original voices. He's just so funny and odd and wonderful. The chapters about France were especially interesting. He's very playful with language and culture. I look forward to reading it again, and taking my time to savor."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This collection is incredibly funny. Nobody spins a demented yarn quite like Sedaris and if a fraction of his observations reflect his actual experience, then his is a life (and mind) of epic comic proportions.Though the book seems somewhat fractured due to the previous publication of some if its stories, its hilarity will stick to your ribs like meatloaf poached in seawater."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is a person who grew up in a middle class family, has a pushy, over-supportive Dad, experiments with drugs, and ends up hooking up with a Sugar Daddy. This book was like sitting through an extemely bad After School Special. I have to admit his simplistic-sarcastic writing style did hold my attention but it would be great if he had something interesting to write about... like someone else's life -- someone who has got past thinking their story of growing up in middle America is an incredible epic.Get over yourself!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have to agree with the minority reviewers who thought this wasn't very funny. This is my first Sedaris book and I've heard lots of hype about how hilarious he is. Mind you, I have a wicked, twisted sense of humor, am gay, a former writer, and make my friends crack up constantly. So, I figured someone like Sedaris would have me in stitches. I'm about halfway through the book and I think I snorted a little (in laughter, not illicit chemicals) only once. Other than that I've barely cracked a smile. I don't get why people think this is so hilarious? It's not awful by any stretch, but it's hardly side-splitting humor. I hate to say it, but I think on a bad day I'm funnier than this. Honestly, I'm a little bummed. I wanted to laugh. Really I did."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I picked up this book right before a flight, and I spent the entire flight scaring the guy next to me, what with all my shaking, squeaking, and tears flowing from my eyes. I wanted to out-and-out guffaw, but I thought that a bit much in such a cramped space.First of all, I've seen the reviews here of people bitching that he doesn't really talk about Paris much. I beg pardon? Have you =heard= David Sedaris before? Did you think he wrote travelogues?Sedaris is a humorous, sardonic essayist, and almost all his essays are autobiographical. What do I mean almost, =all= of them are autobiographical. This book follows David from his childhood in Raleigh, to Chicago &amp; New York (&amp;somewhere else I can't remember, all I know is it involved hitchhiking), and then finally his escape to France, where he finds three French teens lying in the road in front of his house, supposedly waiting for Madonna to drop by to visit him (ha.)Many of these essays have been published in magazines like Esquire, and some form of most of these have also been heard on the public radio show &quot;This American Life&quot;. He really knows how to exploit his material, and I admire him for that.Do =not= buy this to learn deep insights into the human soul, for crying out loud, do =not= buy this to be inspired, and unless you're an idiot, do =not= buy this to find out what living in France is like for an American. Buy this because you want to laugh uncontrollably, buy this because you like reading about people who have very strange lives, and buy this to see how writing should be done."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"There aren't many writers who can force me to laugh out loud, but David Sedaris can--and did. Before reading Me Talk Pretty One Day, I knew Sedaris only through his semiregular commentaries on NPR's This American Life. Now I can't wait to read the rest of his books.Sedaris's writing style is utterly unique, and his ability to summon thoughts and feelings from days long gone make him a wonderfully vivid storyteller. I don't know a single person like him--let's just say his background is not that of the &quot;typical&quot; American--which is one of the reasons why I found his essays such a pleasure to read.The first half of the book was great, but the second half, chronicling Sedaris's experiences living in France, was my favorite--especially a brilliant essay on how an American abroad views other Americans.I'd say more, but I went to the library yesterday and have two other Sedaris books waiting for my attention."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is the most enjoyable read I have had so far this year. Anyone who has read &quot;Naked&quot; will appreciate the continuing adventures of David Sedaris. There is no other writer who can tell a story like this man. (No, I'm not one of his sisters). &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is comprised of various essays about family, relationships, New York, France, pets and the most interesting situations that happen in the life of this most talented writer. This book will make you laugh out loud, particularly if you have ever thought of yourself or your family as eccentric. I thank David Sedaris for speaking out in such an honest way about his life for our reading pleasure. Can't wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris's latest is both memoir and travelogue, a compilation of the foibles and reflections of the sardonic social critic and humorist. Made popular by 1998's Naked and long-standing appearances on NPR, Sedaris again delivers the same wit and insight as in previous volumes, with the addition of his skewed version of the American living abroad-in this case, France. Sedaris's family and upbringing are the subject of many of the essays, most notably \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster,\\" a hilarious description of the fantastically foul-mouthed youngest member of the Sedaris clan. \\"Twelve Months in the Life of the Artist,\\" delves into Sedaris's brief stint in the land of human hair sculpture and performance art. Equally raucous and charming as the family pieces are Sedaris's commentaries on French culture. Having gone to live in France with his boyfriend, Sedaris finds himself mired in a new culture and-much to his horror-a new language, the consonants and vowels of which both escape and dumbfound him. The title essay takes its name for one of many classroom scenes in which Sedaris attempts, along with other, equally handicapped students, to master French. Enter the sadistic French teacher who mocks student responses and a scene in which the multi-ethnic classroom tries to explain the differences between French and American observance of Easter, revealing the inherent idiocy of the both versions. In \\"Picka Pocktoni,\\" Sedaris finds himself face-to-face with two American tourists who assume that he is both French and-as they loudly and damningly discuss-a body-odor-ridden subway pickpocket. Sedaris's razor-sharp insights and devious queries into human nature make him the popualr humorist he is and will remain, wehther imported or domestic."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs an introduction to David Sedaris' work. This collection is, perhaps, my favorite (although Naked runs a close second). I'm going to get the audio also just so I can hear him tell the stories. No matter how bizarre or how awful the people are with whom he interacts, Sedaris manages to find the seed of humanity and that is refreshing."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My absolute favorite humor writer is Dave Barry, but Sedaris gives him a run for the money. His sense of humor is different than Barry's, but his ascerbic observations will have most readers howling in the aisle. One of his crasser stories, Big Boy, had me gasping for breath. Who hasn't encountered a giant turd &quot;no toilet paper or anything, just this long and coiled specimen, as thick as a burrito&quot; in a bathroom and has had to deal with it? If this kind of humor offends you, pick another book to read.His stories of trying to learn French are hilarious as well, particularly the American couple on the train who assume that Sedaris does not speak English because they are in Paris. The husband says loudly to his wife, &quot;Peeeew, can you smell that? That is pure French baby...this little froggy is ripe,&quot; referring to our narrator! Of course, he understands everything, but doesn't want to give away his English abilities until he hears what other stupid things they have to say. I also loved the final story about his immigrant father who stashed away ancient food items so that they didn't go to waste. After insisting on eating a very old carrot, his father pretends to enjoy it as the carrot, &quot;too weak to resist, quietly surrendered to the force of his jaws.&quot;Sedaris is very observant and these essays are filled with self-deprecating humor and funny tales that will keep you reading until people on the train with you with wonder what is making you laugh so uncontrollably."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is how funny this book is. I had read it 2, maybe 3 times before I ever attempted to read any part of it out loud to anyone. It's so funny I still couldn't make it past about the third paragraph without having to stop reading because I was laughing so hard. I stopped every other paragraph throughout, choking and snorting and gasping with laughter. Really it was a shameful performance on my part. But this isn't the best indicator of how funny the book is. What should really tell you how funny the book is is that even though mine was not exactly a smooth or even fully comprehensible reading, my listener still laughed. A lot.These essays are amazing. At times I thought that Sedaris has just had an unusually funny life filled with strange characters, that he has better material than the rest of us. But then I thought, shoot, I've taken language classes and spent time in a country where I didn't speak the language, and I didn't get even one really good story out of it. It takes talent to have seen the humor in many of these experiences, and talent to have preserved that humor on the page. Throughout the book Sedaris makes much of his drug-addled brain and mediocre intelligence, but he's clearly a genius.I'm reading it for about the fifth time now, and I'm still laughing too loud."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],G={key:0},M={key:1};function W(s,e,n,c,r,o){const y=m("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",O,[(t(!0),i(g,null,w(o.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),b(y,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(t(),i("span",G,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const B=u(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-806ec3bf"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/21.md","filePath":"drive/21.md"}'),x={name:"drive/21.md"},E=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{j as __pageData,E as default};
