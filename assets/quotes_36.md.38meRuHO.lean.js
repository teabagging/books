It's always scary trying a new author, after 20-30 pages you can usually tell whether you've wasted your money, or whether you've discovered something great--many times you've wasted your money. This was not one of those times.This book captures your attention and takes you on a thought-provoking ride. I agree with the other reviewers who noted characterization as a strength. Bron changes dramatically over the course of the book. I also felt that the pacing of the book was a strength--I lost the perception that I was reading and got caught up in the story.This is so different from a standard &quot;fantasy&quot; book. Strauss has given us a fully-formed original world that is worth experiencing."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"Victoria Strauss burst on the scene with this absolutely fantastic novel. The novel is based in a society that is terrified of &quot;Hand Power,&quot; meaning that technological advances are heretical offenses. &quot;Mind Power&quot; is where the young are taught the ways of life. It's the story of one man who fights against the powerful religious zealots who rule his world, rising through their ranks and leaning their secrets.An absolutely fabulous read. I could not put the book down and await any further work from Victoria Strauss. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"I found The Arm of the Stone compelling--the characters are vivid, and the author creates a real and frightening world and society. The plot moves swiftly, though the action takes place over a number of years. I am eagerly awaiting more books by this author--I hope there is a sequel."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"A very fine and well-written book, the kind you stick your nose into and don't come out until you've finished it. This was my first time with this author and I was not disappointed at all. Her characters are well-developed and she weaves a solid, steadily moving plot without any flat places. Four stars instead of five because as the story went on, she changes her mind about who the main character is striving against and skips over the explanation rather lightly."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"Unpredictable, imaginative, nicely written... What else can I say? It was a great book. Now I have to read the sequel. Too bad the third one isn't going to be published. :(The back cover doesn't describe this book accurately. This is a definite must-read."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"As a writer (The Legacy, Savage Press 2000), I appreciate good wordsmithing regardless of the genre of the book. I must be honest. Other than Ursula LeGuin, I haven't read fantasy/sci-fi in ages. However, I bumped into Ms. Strauss because of her heavy involvement with the SFWA website and her good work at that site attempting to assist new writers in avoiding dubious literary agents and agencies. Since she was so personable and helpful via email, I felt it only fair to buy copies of her books and give them a try. Guess what? She's one great writer and I thorougly enjoyed the initial book in the series, &quot;The Arm of the Stone&quot; as well as its sequeal. Though I generally read literary fiction, I was fully satisfied by the sophisticated language, plot and charectors used throughout both books.Bravo!"},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"I'm not sure what all the praise is for the beautiful writing. I see no beautiful writing here. I see a stilted story that captures every dumb cliche of melodramatic fantasy. I bought this book for the same reason that were previously stated, but was very disappointed by the silly characters and the ridiculous nomenclature--The One Who Comes, Mindpower, Handpower--puh---lease! Ms. Strauss, this sounds like a bad B SF movie."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"This is an original and unusually well-written story. I was impressed with the author's ability to create such a real world and convincing characters. Bron is a tragic hero who is nearly defeated by his own conviction that he can dominate events. Liliane is an appealing and sympathetic heroine. The story grips you from the start, and it's hard to put the book down. Victoria Strauss is a really fine writer with a beautiful style. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an above-average fantasy novel."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"This is a great book. It's based on a classic fantasy theme, but it bypasses most of the cliches you see in the fantasy genre to result in a really unusual, original story. You really care about the characters, and the world, with its repressive laws that restrict all use of technology, is convincing and fascinating. Right up until the end you think the story will leave you hanging (i.e., one of those to-be-completed-in-the-next-seven-volumes abominations) but the main threads of the story are satisfyingly tied up, while leaving room for a sequel. At least I hope so. I'm already looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"This is one of the most beautifully-written books I have ever read. The gorgeous writing cloaks an incredible story. The plot description sounded to me like a typical schlock fantasy novel, and I bought the book only because I had been told the writing was wonderful. The writing *is* wonderful, but the plot and characters are great, also.In this book, there are two viewpoint characters who never get to be &quot;on the same side&quot;. Each one has a life and a story, and these do intersect, but there are no easy reconciliations of their radically different viewpoints. Moreover, the two characters change significantly from their first introductions. The changes are well-motivated and believable.I am stunned by this book -- it's incredibly good. Every time I thought I had figured out what was going to happen, the author surprised me, but none of the surprises seemed egregious. The plot is seamless, and I cared about both main characters, even though they were in opposition to one another. In the end, however, the real strength of the book is in the writing, which surpasses even the plot and the characterization."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"A story developing a real and different complex world - Maybe the best I've come across since Darkover. The 'Magic' of the mind powers are rooted in the physical and the socio economic facts fit with the realities of the situation as developed.I could not put the book down and when finished, picked it right back up to read through again for all the subtext I had raced past the first time. It held up well to that second reading."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"The premise is decent, the wording of the story is also well done, but somewhere along the line the soul of the story is lost. The characters seem flat to me, there is a good solid base for excellent storytelling it just never seems to be attained. I have both this one and the sequel, I haven't read the sequel yet but I am going to give it a try."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"What drew me into this book was the characters and the excellent writing. The fantasy elements don't overwhelm the exploration of personal development, which is what I generally focus on. I would have liked to see more about the \\"missing years,\\" but since Bron's path was well set and the author made it clear what his goal was going to be, it was probably a wise decision not to make the book unnecessarily long.It was good enough to make me buy the sequel, which I also enjoyed."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"Strauss' The Arm of the Stone starts off a little rocky. I had a difficult time trying to figure out who all of characters were -- most had so little character. And the back of the book was rather lame -- the sort of writing that I despise (see the \\"product description.\\")But I was glad that I kept reading. The characters I couldn't follow smoothed out or left and she set the stage for a brilliant piece of fiction that relates to many facets of life and religion.Strauss keeps you reading by laying out the story with perfect clarity. You know how it's going to turn out. And then she adds a new layer that changes your perceptions on everything. And she keeps that process up all the way through the end.If you are to read only one book this year, don't read this one. But if you like to read and you love unique writing with fresh twists, then pick this up."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"I picked this book up shortly before boarding a trans-US flight, not expecting much except that it would help pass the 5+ hours trapped in coach. Suffice it to say that I wasn't disappointed, but neither was I especially enthralled. Ms. Strauss has created an interesting world, with some innovative ideas, but never really goes anywhere with it. I, personally, did not find the characters all that interesting, nor did I notice any development, despite the fact that the story takes place over the span of several years. In the end, this was just another, decent fantasy work. A good way to pass the time, but not something worth reading twice."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"As a writer of fantasy myself, I was very impressed with this book. It eschews the cliches of elves and dragons and instead delivers a fully realized world, very different from most found on the shelves. Ms. Strauss is a very fine writer with an eye and ear for detail. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"And I don't give out big numbers casually.Ms. Strauss has created a new and different kind of world, in which characters are more concerned with a better plow than a better sword. In &quot;Arm...&quot; draconian Luddite laws keep the people trapped in a perpetual middle ages, enforced by overwhelming mind power.How the hero resolves to tear down the oppressive government from within, then becomes seduced into accepting its ideals, is the meat of the story. &quot;Arm of the Stone has a great deal of intrigue and treachery, with a bit of forbidden love tossed in for extra spice.This is a terrific novel. Recommended."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"There are a lot of things I liked very much about this book.. The background premise (the mysterious Stone, and the division of the mindpower and handpower worlds) is interesting. The writing is technically excellent, particularly good at evoking moods. The characters are likeable. The plot setup (evil theocracy, boy with a Destiny, etc.) takes standard genre tropes and twists them into something a little out of the ordinary, and the way it was developing toward the middle of the book was both unusual and unexpected.So why did I want to throw the book across the room when I finished it?Put simply, the story Ms. Strauss chose to focus on was not the story I wanted to read. The thing that hooked me most in the early and middle sections of the book was the gradual discoveries by the 2 main characters that their childhood assumptions and goals were based on misconceptions about the Way Things Were, and that the real world, and their real places in it, involved a lot more ambiguity and compromise than they expected. The middle sections of this book portrayed very sensitively the process of disillusionment, and the replacement of illusions with genuine understanding and idealism, and I was fascinated with the way the characters were developing.Unfortinately, what followed was not a continuation, but a contradiction: the story did a jump-cut across the following 20 years, and the characters have both arrived in places that are perfectly consistent with their early illusions, not at all so with the direction they seemed to be moving in before the break. How did this happen? We get a bit of backfill and narrative explanation, but the real answer can only be, that's what had to happen because the author needed it so to make her plot work out.There are a number of clumsy elements in the final third of the book (important things happening offstage, for instance, and repetition of events from different points of view) that show a significantly lower level of craftsmanship than the earlier portions. The handling of several characters in that section was also unsatisfying, and inconsistent with what had come before. The final twist of the plot was indeed unexpected, but I wasn't in the mood to appreciate it.What I wanted, and didn't get, was the 200 pages of the Missing Years. Enough is implied and reported that it seems likely some of the missing material may have actually been present in an earlier draft of the novel -- if so, I'm afraid it was a mistake to cut it out. The imperative to bring the paths of the 2 main characters into convergence may have been overwhelming -- but I would have been much happier with the result had it been resisted, and the plot allowed to take a different shape."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"&quot;The Arm of the Stone&quot; is a fantasy about religion gone bad - not my favorite type of reading - but this is a very powerful, intricately plotted book. It is chronicle of hatred, prophecy, and a very, very conservative religious elite who govern through magic (the Domain of the Mind)and forbid any kind of mechanical innovation (the Domain of the Hand). The 'Stone' of the title is the magical equivalent of a fragment of the True Cross. A millennium before this novel begins, the Stone was stolen from its loving and noble caretakers who are hunted to extermination over the years. As you begin to read, the Stone's true caretakers are reduced to a single family, and ultimately, to a single boy. How he seeks to recover the Stone and wreak vengence on those who stole it is the heart of the story.Now the bad news: reading this book was a lot like being a spectator at a chess match. If the cold, logical intricacies of the religion that play out through this book are of interest to you, you won't mind sitting still until the end game. The story's climax is certainly worth the wait.However, if you're like me you'll put &quot;The Arm of the Stone&quot; aside, maybe for a week at a time, and look for something a bit more frivolous. I read all ten of Roger Zelazny's Amber novels (&quot;The Great Book of Amber&quot;) before I picked up &quot;The Arm of the Stone&quot; and finished it.The contrast between Zelazny's Amber and the grim, cold world of the Stone is like the difference between winning a vacation to Venusburg, or spending an eon in the refrigerated compartment of Purgatory. Zelazny's plots skip forward, driven by his wise-cracking, laid-back characters, while &quot;Arm of the Stone&quot; inches forward with all of the grim momentum of a glacier.All religious quibbles aside though, I'm ordering the sequel, &quot;Garden of the Stone&quot;. I really did come to care about the Stone's two main characters, chess pieces though they were. And it's hard to find fantasy as original, and intricately plotted, and well-written as was &quot;The Arm of the Stone.&quot;Read it out of duty, if not for fun."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"A gripping story which takes a standard fantasy story - the hero's quest for some stolen magic artifact - and makes it new. Lots of unexpected twists. I was especially intrigued by the world which Strauss created. The story is told from two points of view - one male and one female. Both characters are fully realized, complex people with conflicting goals.Read it just for kicks and you won't be disappointed - but thoughtful readers will also find lots to ponder here. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"I suppose fans of \\"worldbuilding\\" would likely enjoy this one, but I fell out of the story somewhere during the interminably long and soporific thousand-year history of the protagonist's family's ancient grudge against the antagonist, early in the book, and never fell back in. I was looking for more story, less history."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I must admit I didn't expect much from the cover art and the uninformative back cover blurb, but I found myself very pleasantly surprised and pleased by this book. It's a real page-turner, with thought-provoking concepts, a fully-realized world, and a gripping plot. The author's take on the prophecy that drives a good part of the action is interesting and unusual. I read the whole thing in two nights--and I usually take a week or more to finish a book.I have to say that I was surprised to see the comments of a couple of the reviewers below--that there wasn't enough character development over the course of the book, or the characters weren't fully realized. In my opinion, the characterizations are one of the best things about this book. The main characters are real, believable people, who change and grow over the course of the narrative. The hero's story--in which he starts with a dream of revenge, becomes seduced by the philosophy of those he wants to revenge himself against, and ultimately moves beyond both views to find an entirely new perspective--is especially finely-realized.In sum: highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"Interesting take on good vs. evil - and the ambiguities between them. A young boy whose family is exterminated has a VERY good idea of what evil is - and makes it his lifes ambition to infiltrate the group who killed his family and destroy it. That is, until he is finally accepted into this group - and comes to understand why they exist, and what they are trying to accomplish. He becomes a revered leader. Again - until he is re-united with his brother and realizes that there IS inherent evil in the group he now leads...Extremely lyrical prose makes the book even better!"},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"I never heard of this writer until I bought this book, but now I'm hooked. This book is tremendous. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It's a powerful, character-driven story which also has an exciting plot. Ms Strauss builds a convincing and unusual world from the idea that a group of Spanish Inquisition-like enforcers keep technology at a deliberately medieval level. She also writes very well, which you don't find often enough in fantasy. I hope there's a sequel!"},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"The prose in Arm of the Stone is very, very dense. Paragraphs are long, and everything is somewhat exhaustively described - this is one of the books only real failings, and I admit that I skipped any number of paragraphs and don't feel that I missed out on actual 'story.'Because of the density of description, the story itself is fairly slow, but it often skips over intervening years so we get a nice epic-feeling plot arc. The characters are well-written, especially the two main protagonists, and the world is both inventive and pleasingly complex, with our understanding of its depth growing as the characters do.All in all, a pleasing read."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"The beginning of The Arm of the Stone was really rocky for me. Honestly, it got to the point where I thought about giving it up; however, I didn't and I'm glad I stuck with it.I thought the beginning was rather drawn out and overloaded with characters, history, etc. Also, the conflict didn't seem very interesting to me: Bron's family swears to take back the Stone, which was once theirs and reclaim their power from the Guardians who now hold it. I thought this was too simplistic and it didn't really hold much promise. However, there is a huge turning point in the novel, and that's when the novel picked up its pace and started to become interesting.What I love most about The Arm of the Stone is the story and the world. Strauss does an excellent job in making the story seem very straightforward, and then she throws a curveball at you, completely changing your perspective of what's happening. Also, the world is extremely well-constructed. When I read the novel, I was completely immersed because of the level of detail Strauss includes.Another thing I liked was that I felt that the characters showed a lot of growth. The Bron we meet on page one is completely different than the Bron we know on the last page, which I think is one sign of a successful book. The same goes for many of the characters in the novel, including Liliane and Goldwine, to name a few.There were times when I got confused about jumps in time and it did take me a long time to finish this novel, because it's loaded with so much. I don't think the latter is necessarily a bad thing, but it's definitely not a quick summer read. It is, however, one of the best fantasies I've read in awhile and I'm greatly looking forward to the sequel.I would recommend this for fantasy fans who enjoy coming-of-age adventures."},{"Title":"Arm of the Stone","review":"When I first started this book I saw many of the typical fantasy themes: the lost magical artifact of incredible power, and the boy born of prophesy to change the world. Then suddenly the action kicked in and the whole plot was turned on its head. Wow.I loved the world, so richly portrayed and thoughtfully flesh-out. I loved the main character, who was never predictable, always rethinking his notion of the world. I loved the suspense of what is in many ways a spy story - that rush of being deep within the lion's den and the fear of immanent discovery.As a reader you get to see the point of view of two very different people, both of whom are sympathetic and engaging. Can they both &quot;win&quot; or will one inevitably bring the downfall of the other?By the end of this book, I had to shut myself away from the world and read non-stop. The last page had me so moved I was wiping away a tear. This is a great book, with a strong, character-driven plot, always surprising and never dull!"},{"Title":"Atemi Cobra-Jujitsu: Martial Arts for the Millenium Years to Come in the New Generation","review":"I have to thank a colleague with an incredibly ironic sense of humor for gifting me with Irving Soto's second effort at self promotion. In Defense of Soto's second work after the disasterous &quot;Atemi: The Forgotten Art&quot;, at least the kanji (Japanese characters) on the cover are correct. Other than that, the photographic quality has gone down, and I did not find the techniques particularly inspiring or advanced. Some in fact are very obviously demonstration techniques which offer no practical defensive worth. Soto makes the same unsupported claims as in his first book (regarding his claims to having been in and fought in Japan, though he can provide not one photo, article, or address of anyone who remembered him), although there isn't near as much...&quot;borrowed&quot; and uncredited material as in the first text. What Irv Soto demonstrates is more of a self-made American art, unique, but not necessarily effective. There is nothing technically or otherwise to tie his Cobra Jujitsu (correct spelling: jujutsu. And no, Cobra are not native to Japan) to the nation where he claims to have spent 18 years learning the art, but never learned the correct kanji for &quot;warrior&quot;."},{"Title":"Atemi Cobra-Jujitsu: Martial Arts for the Millenium Years to Come in the New Generation","review":"I'm sorry for the money I spent, don't let it happen to you...

When someone asks me to cite a real &quot;stinker&quot;, this book immediately comes to mind. The photos are grainy and indistinct, the layout is haphazard, and the techniques often deal with unrealistic stuations (unless you really think that, for example, you might be accosted by three people who will simultaneously grab your right lapel). I trust that Grandmaster Soto's skills are better than those depicted in this book, because frankly, they could hardly be worse. Give this overpriced attempt at self-promotion a pass-by."},{"Title":"Atemi Cobra-Jujitsu: Martial Arts for the Millenium Years to Come in the New Generation","review":"This work is disappointing in every category. It is poorly organized; text and photos are mismatched and incomplete. The production quality is really terrible; everyone in the photos is wearing black, the camera is 20 feet back, and the halftone screens in the photos are extremely coarse making it impossible to see any detail. The text descriptions of the katas are disorganized and inadequate; filled with grammatical errors and mispellings. The katas themselves are preposterous set-ups showing Prof. Soto overwhelming 3 and 4 pistol wielding attackers at once. A great deal of content is dedicated to Prof. Soto's celebrity shots. For the asking price, one might expect more than this thin paperback provides. I am not sure what Prof. Soto set out to accomplish in this book other than a sideshow of self aggandizement."},{"Title":"Atemi Cobra-Jujitsu: Martial Arts for the Millenium Years to Come in the New Generation","review":"I was fortunate enough to have been able to read this book without having to purchase it. If I'd had to, I'd be exchanging it for something of greater value. Unfortunately, 'Atemi Cobra-Jujitsu: Martial Arts for the Millennium Years to Come in the New Generation' falls into the category of books that fail in their attempt to actually teach martial arts in a practical manner. The photographic quality is of below average quality as are many of the descriptions of the techniques shown. There is little relevant historical information included in this work, and few existing texts support any of the techniques presented in this publication, though the author claims to have received training from &quot;experts&quot; in the field of martial arts.Let the buyer beware."},{"Title":"Atemi Cobra-Jujitsu: Martial Arts for the Millenium Years to Come in the New Generation","review":"I'm sorry but I can't find any redeeming value for this book.

This book falls squarely into that subject. Soto has no real background in any martial arts so he isn't qualified to teach some new \\"style\\" that he created.

I suspect, as a whole, it would be useful for someone at the very initial stages of thinking about forming an endowment--brainstorming, committee formation, etc. Even then, while it's got some practical information, the useful information to concept ratio was low, and many of the concepts are self-evident (at least speaking as someone who has served on a non-profit board for nearly 10 years). I was looking for something more nuts and bolts--my organization has already decided to form an endowment, and I was looking for guidance on form/structure (not concepts for form and structure, but actual forms), traps and pitfalls, legal issues, insulation from creditors, etc. I found none of that. Truth be told, I found no books like that in my search, and this seemed like the closest, but it was useless for my purposes. The closest comparison I could make would be if you went looking for a text on forming (building) your non-profit and got lots of concepts but not one sample of a charter or bylaws (or even a suggested link to one), no example of an organizational chart or a budget, no checklist of legal issues for start ups. This book might be fine if you want to think about forming an endowment, but it's not really going to help you do it."},{"Title":"Electricians Calculations Manual","review":"This book is really hard to follow for people with any experiance in electronics and math.I worked through the first end of chapter test and found 6 out of the 25 answers in the theback to be wrong.

I cannot believe this got to print. This is supposed to be a resource! It's inexcusable.The first problem I noticed, was that the answer on page 8 for number 2 was wrong, it mistook the amperage in the problem as being six when, in the page just before it has 5 written for amps. So the answer guide gives you the wrong answer. I'm only on the 8th page and I'm starting to doubt this is a good enough resource for me to rely upon. When I am learning something, I like to have a resource I can rely upon. McGraw Hill owes me a refund.The second and most shocking one I found was on page 6; it says \\"watts/ohms = amperage\\", when its actually watts/volts = amperage:. In the diagram above, it clearly contradicts what's written right below! Even if you read the line underneath you can clearly see that there is a glaring problem because its says sqrt(watts/ohms) = amps.

Often those books try to make the gospel into law or focus on very subjective things. Biblical sanity needed a booster shot. The release of an updated version of Randy Alcorn's The Treasure Principle: Unlocking the Secret of Joyful Giving is just such a booster shot.Randy's book is radical. He argues for radical generosity, and does so on (largely) biblical grounds (the tithe as a starting point). He offers 7 treasure principles which are not like 7 steps. But these are applications of the teaching of Scripture. For instance: \\"God owns everything. I'm His money manager.\\"This is not a justification issue- like some of these books can sound like. It is a sanctification issue, how we are to live in light of Jesus' amazing love for us and His lordship over us. Randy does a good job of applying pertinent biblical texts and illustrating them, often from his own experience. He's lived this. He's not some televangelist with $2 million in the bank wanting you to give sacrificially. He practices what he preaches.\\"Anything we try to hang on to here will be lost. But anything we put into God's hands will be ours for eternity.\\"I didn't get the guilt manipulation sensation that I did with some of the other books. I did feel conviction! We are in the midst of adopting. While I read this book we were deciding whether or not to adopt siblings. I was convicted of my tendency to seek financial security. Conviction is good, but guilt manipulation is bad. The first is the work of the Spirit; the second is the work of the author.\\"Where we choose to store our treasures depends largely on where we think our home is.\\"The book is short. That should have made identifying the new material easy, but I couldn't tell what was necessarily new. You can read this devotionally. You don't need large blocks of time but can squeeze a chapter into a lunch break or before bed.\\"Christ's grace defines, motivates, and puts in perspective our giving.\\"At one point he talks about \\"enlightened self-interest\\". Initially I thought of Ayn Rand, whose philosophy is not ultimately compatible with Christianity. But it is \\"enlightened\\" by the gospel and is not about self-indulgence but self-denial. It is not about greed, but generosity. This is more like Piper's work, seeking our ultimate joy in God not our stuff. So ... give it a read.(I received a promotional copy of the book for purposes of review.)"},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"\\"Unlocking the secret of joyful giving\\" is the subtitle for this tiny little book by Randy Alcorn. As I read through this book, I felt myself being drawn more and more to change my life into a life of a giver. Many of you who know me know that I am kind of a finance guy--I'm the business manager at Grace Church of DuPage, and a fan of Dave Ramsey. My wife will tell you that I'm all about saving and investing. We put together a budget in the last few years that was very conducive to saving and investing.But as I read through this book, I wondered to myself whether, instead of being a \\"saver,\\" I was being a \\"hoarder.\\" I began to wonder whether, instead of giving 10% to God, and then doing with the rest of \\"my\\" money whatever I pleased, if I should change my paradigm.Here are three things that I took away from this book:1. God owns everything; I only manage it for him. If we were truly to act as money managers with God's money, would we be so stingy with how much we give back to him?2. Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. Conveniently, this is from Scripture--Matthew 6:21. If I want my heart to be entwined with God's, then I should put my money there. If I say, \\"I want to have a heart for missions,\\" then I should give money to missions. Randy gave a quote from John Wesley toward the end of the book: \\"Money never stays with me. It would burn me if it did. I throw it out of my hands as soon as possible, les it should find its way into my heart.\\" If we don't want money to have a hold on our hearts, then we should give our money away!3. 2 Corinthians 8:7 b- \\"See that you also excel in this grace of giving.\\" We are to excel at giving. Alcorn exhorts, \\"Like piano playing, giving is a skill. With practice, we get better at it. We can learn to give more, give more often, and give more strategically. We reach the pursuit of excellence in our vocations. Why not make giving something we study, discuss, and sharpen, striving for excellence?\\"Questions: How do you excel at giving? Where is your heart at?"},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"Imagine God personally setup a meeting with you and during the meeting entrusted you with assets to manage. This is the basic principle behind The Treasure Principle. It is a short little book but is full of good perspective on what it means to be a money manager for God.Rather than thinking of your money and assets as yours, Alcorn discusses a different concept of God owning it all. When you think of money/possessions, not to mention many other assets such as time and talents, it changes the way you make financial decisions. By praying about purchases, saving, or giving away money, a person can gain insight into how God would like the assets used.Until a few years ago, I thought of myself as a relatively generous person but still thought of possessions and financial resources as my own. In changing to the perspective of being a steward of those assets, it really helps to keep in mind what is truly important and investing for eternal gain.I really like the discussion Alcorn covers in talking about spending temporary resources for eternal purposes. Anything that is owned here on earth will eventually be left behind so there is wisdom in seeking out the eternal purposes to invest in.For anyone wanting a quick read and a good Biblical perspective on being a financial steward of God, The Treasure Principle covers this nicely."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"I think I've read this book two or three times before. And I find Alcorn's treatment of biblical stewardship in The Treasure Principle to be helpful and motivating, and thus it's a book worth re-visiting on a regular basis. Alcorn begins the book, \\"All your life, you've been on a treasure hunt. You've been searching for a perfect person and a perfect place. Jesus is that person; heaven is that place.\\" Alcorn then goes on to explain how stewardship in your life now can affect eternity.\\"Some books try to motivate out of guilt. This isn't one of them.\\" That proves to be true as Alcorn motivates more from the promises God makes to those who live for Him. Alcorn lays out what he calls the treasure principle: \\"You can't take it with you - but you can send it on ahead.\\" The rest of the book is a further explanation of this principle from Scripture, replete with examples both from history and from Alcorn's own life. The explanations of the treasure principle fall under six themes (or keys).1. God owns everything. I'm His money manager.2. My heart always goes where I put God's money.3. Heaven, not earth is my home.4. I should live not for the dot but for the line.5. Giving is the only antidote to materialism.6. God prospers me not to raise my standard of living, but to raise my standard of giving.I highly recommend this short, readable book to individuals or study groups looking to grow in giving generously."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"Absolutely the best read on setting your heart free from bondage of stuff and being free to give...."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"This book honestly changed my life and my perspective on how I handle my money.

It is radical, yet profoundly biblical. Finally, I have the answer to the questions I have been asking in my many years as a Christian. I read in my Bible that Christ tells us not to love the world, nor the things of the world; to store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, not on earth; to give as the widow who gave all she had; not to be as the rich young ruler, etc. But, in America, Christianity is generally not practiced in this way! And, it is no wonder that we do not see the kind of joy that Christ promised either.

But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\\"The rest of The Treasure Principle is dedicated to six Treasure Principle Keys, which expand upon the Treasure Principle. Each of the Keys is supported with illustrations and/or Scripture. Finally, the book ends with 31 questions to ask God about your giving.I found The Treasure Principle to be a quick read: I read it in one sitting. I like that everything is backed up with Scripture. The questions at the end could easily be used for personal devotions. I'll caution you that you might find this book convicting!One passage that struck me as fresh was this:\\"Why does God give some of His children more than they need and others less than they need? So that He may use His children to help one another. He doesn't want us to have too little or too much (Proverbs 30:8-9). When those with too much give to those with too little, two problems are solved. When they don't, two problems are perpetuated.\\"Disclosure: I received a copy of this book, at no cost to me, for review purposes. Thanks to Blogging for Books for the opportunity!

Heaven, not earth, is my home.4. Live with a view of eternity - don't limit yourself to this world.5. Giving is the only antidote for materialism.6.

We can't take anything with us when we die, but we can send it ahead.2. While our giving delights us, it delights God even more.3. Reward for giving is Jesus' idea - He promises us generous heavenly rewards.4. Every thing we buy is more one thing to take care of.5. Use the resources God has given us on our brief time on earth to make a difference in His kingdom and for His glory.As mentioned, the book is a quick read full of excellent insights on how to spend and give away our money.Read and be encouraged and challenged to prayerfully consider how you can be a better steward of what God has entrusted to you.Recommended."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"How do you motivate greedy, self-seeking, materialistic Americans to grasp the idea of charitable giving?

The book concludes with a challenge to sign that has the potential to transform the financial outlook of anyone who will take it on.By sharing his own personal story of financial setback and how that set the stage for him to be more generous than ever with his money, especially his book royalties, Alcorn gives credibility to the principles that he teaches.

Alcorn makes the case for changing that, and making God's kingdom a priority in our lives. It is the true treasure, after all, and during this time of economic difficulty, it is also the path to financial freedom.This is a quick read, but if we follow Alcorn's advice, the results are lasting.

Giving is one of the most important parts of the Christian life, and it brings more joy than nearly anything else.The author discusses various topics on giving, beginning with the fact that God owns it all--we merely manage it. He points out that when we hold tightly to earthly possessions, we lose sight of what lies ahead! The Bible tells us to store up treasures in Heaven, not on earth, because we can't keep anything we gain here on earth. However, when we give to God by giving to the poor, to missions, to the local church, we are storing up treasures in Heaven that will never be destroyed.I loved this quote: \\"He doesn't just look at what we give. He also looks at what we keep.\\" (pg. 64)Giving brings such joy and it's something that my husband and I have made a priority from day one of our marriage. This book helped me to remember why we give and how important it is to continue to give away as much as we can. We want to please God with how we manage His resources, and this book gives practical ways to do so that are biblically based.I definitely recommend this book for every Christian. In our culture, it has become so \\"normal\\" to keep far more than we give, and we've become great at justifying why. However, that's not what God requires, and I think it is wise to dive into His Word (and use this book as a guide, as he gives tons of scripture references) to remember what He says about how we use our money.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"The Treasure Principle was extremely insightful. I was pleasantly surprised at how plainly the Bible explains our possessions on earth and how if we're willing to accept our tasks and roles on earth regarding our possessions how much more blessed we would be.Alcorn clearly defines why churches mention the \`10%', gives the biblical definition and goes far beyond what we can do with that as servants. There are no miracle solutions to God's gifts to us or how to get rich quick which I appreciated because I strongly dislike theologians (term used lightly) who try to make us think that if we give, we'll get while on earth. I feel these are promises nobody on earth can make come true and Alcorn is fully aware of that.Randy Alcorn helps us understand in this little handbook, how to begin a journey of giving in little step increments so there is no room for misinterpretation of what he's trying to get across to us. He uses his life examples in certain places and I've learned a lot about him and his family that I did not know but have humbled myself to prayer for them.Read this book with an open heart and pray that God will speak to you through Andy's text and you will see giving in an entirely new light.

I don't feel that's an accurate assessment, especially considering that Jesus talked about money and possessions more than He did about Heaven and Hell. In \\"The Treasure Principle: Unlocking The Secret Of Joyful Giving,\\" Randy Alcorn shares the keys that Jesus taught about this important topic.In just the first few pages, Randy sets the stage for this book by stating: \\"Why did Jesus put such an emphasis on money and possessions? Because there's a fundamental connection between our spiritual lives and how we think about and handle money. We may try to divorce our faith and our finances, but God sees them as inseparable.\\"The Treasure Principle mixes biblical instruction on handling our money, Randy's insights into those scriptures, as well as Randy's own personal experiences with finances. These are all used to support six treasure principle keys.One of my favorite parts of the book comes at the very end. Randy shares \\"31 Radical, Liberating Questions To Ask God About Your Giving.\\" This is where the rubber meets the road (or the principles meet the pocketbook!). This is setup for you to read one question daily for a month, to really allow God to speak to you through His Word and through this book about your financial perspectives and practices. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and I'm looking forward to continuing my month-long journey through these radical questions."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"Quite simply, you cannot argue with this book. It is simultaneously convicting and edifying as the Treasure Principle does not come from the mind of Brother Alcorn, it comes directly from the Scriptures. Ultimately, the reader cannot arrive at any conclusion other than everything we treasure belongs to God and we are but managers of this treasure during our fleeting days in this world. Once that attitude has come set in the believers mind, behavioral change is soon to follow.Unlike other books on this topic, Alcorn uses just a handful of application illustrations of a personal nature. This is not a \`name it and claim it' guide nor is it a strategy for managing your wealth for greater return. It is, on the other hand, an exemplary survey of the what the Bible has to say about the handling and giving of God's wealth that he entrusts to his people. Randy organizes a series of principles under the guiding light you can't take it with you - but you can send it on ahead.You will read this book in a couple of hours but you will spend many days and weeks thinking about the principles. Inarguable, you are confronted with the uncomfortable truths that the Spirit will use to prick your conscience as He realigns your priorities. Only the most callous will walk away from the book unmoved. Others will carefully and prayerfully review the true object of their heart and begin to make the necessary adjustments."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"Other than salvation, is there anything more controversial than dealing with the issue of money? Randy Alcorn, in his book The Treasure Principle, takes a hard look at the subject of money and finances and how it should be incorporated in the life of a Believer.The key question arising from The Treasure Principle is this: what am I holding onto that is keeping me from living the life God has called me to live? The answer in most cases would be money and it is from that perspective that Alcorn presents this small, yet powerful book.Due to the fact that the money we accumulate on earth can't go with us, Alcorn presents the principle of sending it ahead by giving and giving generously. A key concept mentioned by Alcorn is that there is a connection between our spiritual lives and how we handle and think about money. If you want to understand God's perspective on giving, The Treasure Principle is a book for you; a quick read that will change your mind on giving.I received this book for free from Water Brook.

He explains these principles in convincing and easily understood concepts.* God owns everything. I'm His money manager.* My heart always goes where I put God's money.* Heaven is my home, not earth, so invest in heavenly treasures.Because of his awesome presentation of the principles of treasure, I was shocked to watch him undermine his own principles in the last 60 pages of his book. While he teaches on the one hand that we give according to the leading of the Spirit, in the second half of this book he gives man-made rules telling how much to give and to whom. Although I agree with his suggestion that we ask God questions about our giving, his section on 31 Questions to Ask God includes only repetition of his man-made rules with little room for hearing from the Holy Spirit.The first 60 pages are great; the last 60 pages should have been left out. In the same way, I'm divided on whether to recommend this book or not. I guess it depends on how much of a book you want to get for your money. Maybe if it's on sale for half price?

I think for most of us, this principle loses it's meaning as soon as we begin to think about heaven. The \\"great un-known\\" to so many of us, but if better understood, I think we would seek it more earnestly (as we should). (By the way, Alcorn also has another incredible book called Heaven, that I highly, highly, recommend, by far the best resource I've found on the topic) Alcorn describes heaven as a place \\"of rest and relief from the burden of sin and suffering; but it will also be a place of great learning, activity, artistic expression, exploration, discovery, camaraderie and service.\\" If only we could grasp this and live our lives understanding the truth of money in light of eternity, materialism in relation to heavenly treasure and the earthly desire of possession as so shallow compared to what is to come. The truth is when we pursue and hoard these things for ourselves, we are wasting so much of our time, so much of our energy.... and for what?Something that really grabbed my attention in The Treasure Principle is when Alcorn shared a few quotes and statistics (from the PBS show Affluenza) with his readers, including the fact that \\"the average American shops six hours a week while spending forty minutes playing with his children\\" and \\"recently, more Americans declared bankruptcy than graduated from college.\\"I think Alcorn said it best when he says \\"we think we own our possessions, but too often they own us.\\"Alcorn does a great job unpacking what the Bible actually says about giving. It's easy to lack the joy of giving if we don't really understand it and view it from a Biblical perspective.The real truth is we do not own the money/possessions that we have, we are simply stewards of it. By holding on to money and things we help no one (including ourselves), but by giving we solve so many more problems than we could ever realize. By participating in God's design we can expect nothing less than HIS joy and HIS peace to permeate our hearts and lives.I highly recommend this book, within it's pages is a true Biblical message explained clearly and understandably without condemnation or shame."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"The Treasure Principle by Randy Alcorn is a great little book that is really easy to read, but has some very powerful words.

I was first introduced to this book about seven years ago when I was just beginning my pastoral ministry. It has been a foundation for my preaching on giving ever since.The book's appeal is its simplicity and brevity. The concepts are easy to understand and yet profound. The foundational principle (#1) is that \\"God owns everything.\\" Sounds simple, but how many Christians live with this conviction? It changes everything!My next favorite principle (#6) is that \\"God prospers me not to raise my standard of living, but to raise my standard of giving.\\" What a powerful antidote to the bigger and better American Dream lifestyle.I wish that the author would have made a better connection to the giver participating in God's Kingdom work presently happening on earth, but I understand that that is probably not his theological focus/priority.I would recommend this book as a launching pad for deeper and broader study on biblical giving.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"The Treasure Principle is a concise and pleasant book to read that gently approaches the subject of generosity as part of the Christian life. Without a doubt, this subject is considered to the be \\"third rail\\" of discipleship...since it deals with what many people hold closest to their heart...their wallets.Alcorn addresses the subject as a matter of Christian responsibility and Christian privilege. He reminds the reader that Christians exercise responsibility as stewards/managers of resources that belong to God.One point that I found to be particularly helpful was the manner in which Alcorn dealt with the subject of \\"progressing toward the discipline of tithing.\\" He correctly notes that to give 5% of one's income to the Lord when 10% is required...is not a matter to boast about. It is the equivalent of saying, \\"I used to rob six convenience stores a year. This year, by His grace, I'm going to rob only three.\\" (p.65).Due to its brevity, this is a good devotional read. While biblically supported, it is not a deeply theological work. I will recommend it to believers who want to understand their privilege and responsibility related to finances...and to those who want to unleash the joy that comes through \\"grace giving.\\"Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review as part of their blogger's book review program.

This book looks at financial giving to God from every biblical angle.It would be hard for any believer to read and walk away unchanged, therefore, I highly recommend it to every follower of Christ.The author uses scripture first to take away every excuse we have ever conjured up regarding our financial giving to God, but then he also successfully puts giving in the correct light of worship, stewardship, heavenly reward, and true joy.This book is not about laying a legalistic burden on people, or using guilt to motivate Christians to give to their church.It is clearly presented that the person who benefits most from giving, in this life and in the life to come, is the giver.Short and well-written, The Treasure Principle is an easy read that could change your life. Well worth the investment.The Treasure Principle: Unlocking the Secret of Joyful Giving (LifeChange Books)"},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"The Treasure Principle is a quick, strait-forward, read about Biblical stewardship. The premise of Randy Alcorn's book is nothing new, in fact it's rather ancient. Jesus said in Matthew 6:19-21,\\"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasure in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\\"Essentially, Alcorn gives six principles based off of this Scripture to encourage, challenge, and admonish believers to look at where there treasure (value, effort, materials) lies. As believers, we already know what the outcome of the economy, government, and society will be. He challenges us to examine why Christ has bestowed upon us the riches (and let's be honest, we are stinking rich in comparison to the rest of the world- and this is coming from a girl in debt from college and making little in the eyes of my peers.) that He has... are we blessed financially so that we can live comfortably... or so that we can help those in dire need of help?This isn't a long book. This book isn't full of new and radical ideas upon finances. This book doesn't give practical instructions on what you should do with your money in order to earn the favor of God. This book doesn't tell you what you should and shouldn't do with your money.This book looks to the Bible, to the instructions that God gave in the Old Testament and the stories of Christ in the New Testament, and poses the question to believers today: is God asking less of us then He did of the New Testament believers?Bottom line, God has blessed me with more money then I know what to do with. I'm often faced with how I should spend my money- and it's not if I should put food on the table or keep the heat turned on. No, the dilemma I face is, should I buy the newest electronic device or upgrade the amount of channels I can watch from 150 to 350.We are God's money managers. Everything I(we) have is from Him. Would He be pleased with how we are managing His money? We will all die. There is no escaping death. You can't take a single penny with you- but you can send your treasures ahead of you by investing your money in God's investments- taking care of the needy, feeding the hungry, and loving the lonely."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"The Treasure Principle by Randy Alcorn is a book that will transform your life if you let it.It's not a deep read or particularly lengthy. The message is simple, but revolutionary. If you give, you will be blessed.(A quick note here. Alcorn is most decidedly not of the prosperity-gospel mindset. He lives very modestly and takes great joy in being able to share his earthly resources to advance the Gospel of Christ.)He suggests several principles that summarize biblical teaching on money. (And the Bible is surprisingly full of references to how we should manage our finances.)-God owns everything. We're his money managers.-Our hearts go where our money goes.-Heaven is our real home, not earth, so we should lay up treasures in heaven, not on earth.-We should live for eternity, and manage our finances in such a way that reflects this.-Giving is the only antidote to materialism.-When God prospers us, it is not to raise our standard of living, but our standard of giving.The book is full of stories and examples to illustrate his points. One of the most powerful was that of Oscar Schindler, made famous by the movie Schindler's List. His only regret in helping to save so many Jewish lives was that he had not saved more. He wished he had sold his car, or his watch so that more might be redeemed and saved from Nazi extermination.When you think about this on a spiritual level, it's really quite convicting. When we die, will we regret the way that we lived? Will we regret not having lived more frugally so that others might have been saved? Do we really need everything that society tells us we need? Or can we live with less and use our excess to transform the lives of others?I can guarantee you that I will be thinking about this book for quite awhile. Very powerful, very convicting, potentially life-transforming."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"Please do not judge this book by its' cover. After all, it is only 94 pages, but each page is either a tight jab or uppercut to the heart. The subtitle that Randy Alcorn placed on the cover says \\"Unlocking the Secret of Joyful Giving\\". The implication brought forth by the author is that joyful giving is a secret in the fact that you will not understand or experience it until you try it. But before you try it, it is a mandate that you realize what God has given you in His Son, Christ Jesus.The bold truth of this short text is that God owns everything & what He has given to us, He expects us to manage well as stewards of his grace, gifts, & mercy. The things we already have as well as the things we will purchase are resources given by God for the purpose of His glory.Bottomline: Giving will empower your life & open doors that cannot be opened by taking or withholding for yourself.

It's a terrific, compact book that gives a biblical overview of money and finances. Alcorn reminds us that everything, including all of \\"my\\" money, belongs to God, I am just his steward.Throughout the book, Alcorn expounds on 6 key principles:#1 God owns everything. I'm His money manager.#2 My heart always goes where I put God's money.#3 Heaven, not Earth, is my home.#4 I should live not for the dot, but for the line (eternity).#5 Giving is the only antidote to materialism.#6 God prospers me not to raise my standard of living, but to raise my standard of giving.This book had a profound impact on my mindset towards money and finances and stewardship. God is using it to help me have a more balanced and correct view of blessing and giving. There's also a section with \\"31 questions to ask God\\" that will help you pray and think through your own personal view of money and your spending habits. If you're open to praying through what Randy writes, you'll most likely leave convicted, and recognizing more deeply that your view of money reflects your dependence on God.This little book is short and easy to read. The truths contained in it are invaluable, and a book that someone could easily give to friends or family. With a topic as delicate as finances, Randy does a good job of warmly exhorting by pointing to the extravagant gift God has given in Christ, which in turn should cause one to extend blessing to others, while not leaving you guilt-ridden. It's also short enough that I plan to reference it often, and possibly even read it once every few years.FTC Disclaimer: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"As I've been reading several books on stewardship, finances, generosity, I kept seeing one book mentioned more than any other as the must-read book in this area. That book is \\"The Treasure Principle: Unlocking the Secret of Joyful Giving\\" by Randy Alcorn. The back story of the author is quite powerful. I'll let Randy tell it in his own words, but he's given away all book royalties and is living on minimum wage, giving away the rest.This is a compact book that is easy to read. (Those wanting more depth can follow up with Alcorn's \\"Money, Possessions, and Eternity.\\") There are six chapters, and Randy skillfully describes the difference between investing for earthly gain versus investing for eternity, joyful giving, eternal rewards, roadblocks to giving, and getting started. Another welcome addition in the end is a 31 day prayer guide.Alcorn states the Treasure Principle in a nutshell: \\"You can't take it with you - but you can send it on ahead.\\" Then he shares six Treasure Principle Keys...1. God owns everything. I'm His money manager.2. My heart always goes where I put God's money.3. Heaven, not earth, is my home.4. I should live not for the dot but for the line. (life in heaven versus life on earth)5. Giving is the only antidote to materialism.6. God prospers me not to raise my standard of living, but to raise my standard of giving.I enjoyed reading The Treasure Principle. It's highly biblical, relevant and educational, incorporating story and inspiration along the way. What's best is that the author is very passionate about this subject and is living out what he teaches. He even does a great job discussing tithing. \\"Tithing isn't the ceiling of giving; it's the floor. It's not the finish line of giving; it's just the starting blocks. Tithes can be the training wheels to launch us into the mind-set, skills, and habits of grace giving.\\" There's a good reason this book is cited by so many others. It's a great book for church leaders and for those desiring to grow as generous givers.

Randy Alcorn describes what matters most to God in a wonderful, clear way."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"The Treasure Principle by Randy Alcorn is one of many books on the market encouraging Christians to give first to the Lord and trust in His blessings. This books stands head and shoulders above others in this genre because the author truly lives the message of which he writes. Alcorn, who is well known for his many books, especially Heaven, lives on minimum wage. All of his books belong to his church which donates 90% of the profits to charities close to Alcorn's heart. Compare this to other pastors who tell you to tithe, and that you can start by mailing your money directly to them! Alcorn's Treasure Principle is that when we are good stewards of the gifts that God has given us on earth, He will reward us, and we will store up treasures accordingly in Heaven. He uses as an example: if I offered you $1000 today or if you waited, $10,000,000 in a year and then again every year after forever, which would you take? Anyone taking the $1000 would be sacrificing a greater treasure for small happiness today. I know this is a sin I am guilty of, but Alcorn's book offers hope and straightforward reasons for me to repent. It's a thoroughly enjoyable book with a wonderful message."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"This is a book I have read and reread three times. It is one of my all time favorites on the topic of joyful and extravagant giving. What I love about this book is that it challenges me to a new dimension of what is possible in the realm of generous giving. It challenges the status quo of giving just a 10% tithe and adding some on top for special offerings or projects in the church. It challenges me to the core and helps me gain perspective that all that I might try to save for (retirement, our children's college or inheritance) will one day not matter, but souls always will.If God has entrusted me with greater financial blessing than I once had it may be that the purpose of that money is to raise my standard of giving and not my standard of living. (2 Cor. 9:11) Have I overaccumulated? Have I allowed unwise spending and accumulating debt to inhibit my giving to God? Am I honoring God as the owner and CEO/CFO of the assets he's entrusted to my care? Or am I treating him as a mere financial consultant, to whom I pay a fee (2% or 10%).Since I have no choice but to leave money behind when I die, is it really \\"giving\\" to designate through my will the distribution of my estate? If I were to make a list of all the assets God has entrusted to me, is there anything that I could not give away if God directed me to? Giving is the only antedote to materialism. Can I just say that this entire book is highlighted to me. I shake my head and say, Wow.. on every page.I think that what the Alcorn family lives demonstrates that they have an understanding on the true purpose of wealth in this earth. To affect eternal results. With the economy's downturn as of late, Brian and I have been more vigilant and indignant to want to give more- above our tithe- we're voting with our checkbook!If just government fluxuations can result in losing thousands of dollars and the housing market can plumet the way it has, then all the more we want to be big givers to the Kingdom work! It's the only thing that really matters! This book would be my first choice for anyone who wants to rise to new levels of giving.

The author, Randy Alcorn, is one of the best. He has an eternal focus in all of his writing and this one is no exception. It is based on the premise of Matthew 6:19-21, which says: 'Do not store up for yourselves treasures on Earth where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in Heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.

Alcorn challenges our cultural obsession with stuff through his call to \\"send it on ahead.\\" He argues that the prospect of reward is not wrong in and of itself, it is simply that we often aim for earthly rather than eternal rewards. We are focused on having it all here instead of using the resources God entrusts to us for others now and receiving eternal rewards later. This book provides a great argument against the prosperity gospel, especially in Alcorn's phrase, \\"God prospers me not to raise my standard of living, but to raise my standard of giving.\\" This book is simply the application of logic to the truth of the Bible.

This is a book for those who really want to understand God's perspective on giving. It is not \\"give and I'll bless you back,\\" though He does say that He loves cheerful givers. It is not about the amount or percentage that we give. It is not about when or where we give. It is about our hearts and giving.Are you willing to explore the thought, \\"Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal\\"? The Treasure Principle drills down on this thought and other key verses that help the reader understand that God is concerned about what our focus and perspective are, not on how much money we give. He is concerned about where our hearts are--compared to where they should be--not where our pocketbook is. He is concerned about the treasures we are collecting--and where we are storing them.Armchair Interviews says: This little book packs a punch, and it is backed by Dr. Alcorn's own experience of seeing The Treasure Principle at work in his life and the lives of those involved with his ministry."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"I got this book at a church.

Almost two-thirds of the book is devoted to giving. But not just the usual give to your local church because you should type of giving. Alcorn calls Christians to give generously, until it hurts.

God intends for us to invest it, in ever increasing proportions, for the expansion of His kingdom -- not ours. God also intends for us to learn what it really means to trust Him, as He prompts and enables us to give \\"even when the bottom line says we can't.\\"God's \\"inexpressible gift\\" of giving is counterintuitive to most of us. Our normal mindset, heavily influenced by the world's materialistic bent, is to horde as much wealth as possible for ourselves. This is true even in the church, where more and more believers are giving themselves over to the materialism that our culture says we are entitled to pursue and enjoy.It pains my heart when I see believers who will spend many hundreds of thousands of dollars for a 4,000 square foot house, and tens of thousands of dollars on a new luxury car or SUV, but can't seem to find a hundred bucks to support a short term mission trip. Those dear brothers and sisters are caught in a snare of the enemy. Randy Alcorn's small but powerful book tells them how to escape -- by giving away worldly wealth to store up eternal riches.Scripture teaches, and I have found by my own experience, that the more we have, the more we want, and the more we have to worry about. When we implement the Treasure Principle in our own lives, God delivers us from the bondage of materialism and prepares a far richer, eternal inheritance that is out of all proportion to the pittance even the most generous of us are able to give in this life.

I very much disagreed with Alcorn's opinion that giving should be a competition, and that Christians should be basically comparing what they give to what their friends give, in some sort of friendly way of encouraging one another. I believe that human nature can all-to-easily turn friendly competition into gloating and self-glorification, particularly where religion is concerned. I also was very turned off by Alcorn's story of his forced salary-reduction due to the results of a lawsuit. I found myself all too often focused on the author's situation, rather than on the actual topic of giving.There were also many great Biblical verses, points and examples in this book, but I believe that the majority of these are covered just as well in other books on tithing.

It didn't take long to read, but it was not soon forgotten. I shared or gave the book to someone else, I am not sure which, so when I occasionally wanted to reread the book, I couldn't. Then recently I had opportunity to receive a free copy of the book in return for reviewing it on my blog.I was not disappointed the second time through the book. The treasure principle is that all earthly treasures will either be lost or left behind, no exceptions, but earthly treasures can be exchanged for secure and eternal heavenly treasures (Matthew 6:19-21).Our problem is that we are reluctant to exchange the temporal for the eternal. Mr. Alcorn offers six keys that will free us from the tyranny of our earthly treasures and open a storehouse of eternal treasures. First, understand that God owns everything and that we are merely managers of his property. Second, our hearts will go where we put God's money. Third, heaven is our home, not earth. Fourth, we should live not for the dot (the temporal) but for the line (the eternal). Fifth, giving is the only way we can free ourselves from materialism. Sixth, God prospers us not to raise our standard of living, but to raise our standard of giving.I would highly recommend this book for personal reading and as a gift to others.

That's the truth of the gospel and that is the truth articulated in the wonderful book The Treasure Principle: Unlocking the Secret of Joyful Giving by Randy Alcorn. The book isn't about money, but about treasure. Its about joy.There's no doubt that Jesus talked a lot about money. As Alcorn points out, Jesus talks more about money than He does about heaven and hell combined. There is good reason for this. Alcorn writes:Why did Jesus put such an emphasis on money and possessions?Because there's a fundamental connection between our spiritual lives an dhow we think about and handle money. We may try to divorce our faith and our finances, but God sees them as inseparable. (9)He's right. Show me how you spend your money and what you spend it on and I will show you where your treasure is. Or as Jesus put it, where your money is, there your heart will be also. Alcorn shows that sacrifice presents us with the gift of joy. This goes against natural wisdom. Normally, we think wealth and possessions make us happy (who doesn't want to be rich right?), but Alcorn shows biblically and scientifically that that is not the case. For example, Alcorn shows a study that compares lottery winners with the paralyzed. Though at first the lottery winner is joyous over their fortunes and the paralytic is distraught by their paralysis, years later their roles begin to change. The lottery winner finds themselves not as happy as they had intended. The paralytic, on the other hand, slowly begins to enjoy life again.This does not mean that we ought to seek out poverty or paralysis. What it does mean is that real joy is not in what we own but in the gospel. The treasure principle is in the gospel - Jesus Christ Himself.I highly recommend this little book. One can easily read it in one sitting. It is simple to read and can be enjoyed by believers of all walks of life. It is a message we need to hear. In a culture as rich as ours chasing our tails of greed, we need to hear Alcorn on this.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"Having heard so many good things about this book, and needing some great material for a teaching series in our church, I checked out Randy Alcorn's *The Treasure Principle*. With only 90 pages of text, I figured it would be an easy read. But those ninety pages were full of difficult truth.Although the principles suggested by Alcorn are difficult to hear, he writes with sensitivity and from a position of integrity. He readily shares his own journey and the lessons he learned about his own attachment to money as he endured some difficult times. It is difficult to argue with someone who has fought a tough battle and emerged with scars and lessons learned.The book centers around six \\"Treasure Principle Keys.\\" The first key is \\"God owns everything. I'm his money manager.\\" Each key is illustrated with Biblical teaching, quotes, and stories from real life. Randy readily shares his own stories and those of others. You will not want to miss the story of William Borden. And when you read it, you won't easily forget it.As a pastor, I am often anxious and yet intrigued to see how authors interpret various Scripture passages. Alcorn never pushes a passage to say more than it was intended to say. He does, however, offer fresh but challenging insights into various Scriptures.I know I will never read Jesus' one-sentence parable of the buried treasure the same again. And I will never be the same because I read this book.

As the author wrote in his introduction: \\"Some books try to motivate giving out of guilt. This isn't one of them. This book is about something else - the joy of giving.\\" The author lives up to these statements. Over and over, he brings out Scripture, personal and biographical stories to show that seeing ourselves as stewards of God's resources allows us to experience great joy in managing our Lord's wealth that happens to be in our pockets.The author deals with such issues as tithing, hoarding, giving to worthy ministries, and so much more. I'm glad I read it and now desire to pick up a lengthier work of Alcorn's to see where he may elaborate on some of the issues he quickly discussed in this book.I obtained my free copy of \\"The Treasure Principle\\" from Multnomah for review.Matt EllisBrooksville, Florida"},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"This little book by Randy Alcorn is packed with marvelous gems of wisdom pertaining to our giving as Christians. Based on six Treasure Principles Alcorn makes a strong appeal for giving more than what we think or believe we should or can give. These principles include:1. God Owns Everything. I'm His Money Manager.2. My Heart Always Goes Where I Put God's Money.3. Heaven, Not Earth, Is My Home.4. I Should Live Not For The Dot But for the Line.5. Giving Is The Only Antidote to Materialism.6. God Prospers Me Not To Raise My Standard Of Living, But to Raise My Standard Of Giving.Alcorn starts out strong about what our attitude should be in the management of our riches. In the first chapter Alcorn talks about what Jesus said in Matthew 6:19-21: \\"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\\" Alcorn then explains what Jesus meant by this: \\"Consider what Jesus is saying: \`Do not store up treasures on earth.' Why not? Because earthly treasures are bad? No. Because they won't last.\\"Then Alcorn quotes Proverbs 23:5: \\"Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle.\\" It's within these two paragraphs that Alcorn makes a profound, yet simply true statement which sets the pace for the rest of the book: \\"Storing up earthly treasures isn't simply wrong. It's just plain stupid.\\"This book is stitched with powerful, yet succinct quotes by people such as Martin Luther, Matthew Henry, Jim Elliot, and many more. Throughout, Alcorn includes remarkable stories of people who's lives have been touched and profoundly changed by the simple act of giving beyond what they ever envisioned.But my favorite part of the book is the final chapter where Alcorn asked of God 31 questions about giving that we all at one point or another have or will ask regarding how and how much we are to give. And then he gives God's actual response. Here's an example:\\"Is my life revolving around You? Open my eyes, Father. What am I holding on to that's robbing me of present joy and future reward? What am I guarding and keeping for myself that's preventing me from having to depend wholeheartedly on You? Since money and things have mass, and mass exerts gravity, and gravity holds us in orbit, what can I give away that will bring me greater freedom? Which of \\"my\\" assets can I give to You, so that You will be my center of gravity?\\"Answer: \\"No servant can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.\\" (Luke 16:13) See also Psalm 42:1-2 and Matthew 5:6.If you've struggled with not understanding the concept of New Testament giving, of whether or not to tithe, or whether tithing is even commanded of us, this book will help you enormously in sorting through the \\"what if's\\" and the \\"buts\\" we might have about our \\"possessions.\\" A classic question Alcorn answers for us is \\"Well, what about our children; shouldn't we as good parents be saving for their futures?\\" You might be surprised at what he has to say about that.Great book! Superbly written . . . on a deep subject . . . which is crucial for our eternal understanding as followers of Christ. I can't recommend it enough!Please note that I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"In the *The Treasure Principle*, Randy Alcorn presents a condensed version of his other book *Money, Possessions, and Eternity*. This condensed version serves as a helpful resource to pass along to others who have questions (or need to ask questions) about their finances in relation to God through Christ.The format of Alcorn's book centers around 6 principles that govern our use of money, as distilled from the Bible. At the end of the day, Alcorn makes a good case that Western Christians are poised to use our vast resources to spread the glory of God, if only we will obey the clear call of Jesus Christ. Like no other time, Christians in the West have significant resources to impact the world for the Gospel. The questions is, will we relinquish these resources as God's money managers, rather than perceiving that we own what God grants us?*The Treasure Principle* is full of sound scriptural advice and pithy anecdotes to flesh out these Scriptures. Though not as fully reasoned as his other book (see above), this concise treatise serves to introduce the reader to many principles that we may have never thought of before. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"I have to say that this was one of the best books I read about finances. I would say it is the best, but I really feel like in order to follow The Treasure Principle you need to understand how to manage your money to a certain extent.I have to say, this book was quite different than what I was expecting, but in a good way. The Treasure Principle is not a book that is so much about managing your money but is about giving generously according to biblical principles and experiencing the joy that comes along with that.Alcorn's basic premise is that all we have is God's anyway and so instead of amassing wealth, why not give that money to good causes that can further the kingdom of God, which is of eternal value. He gives six principles throughout the book and the last one is this: God prospers me not to raise my standard of living but to raise my standard of giving. Not exactly the American mentality is it? And not exactly most North American Christian's mentality either.I think though that The Treasure Principle is the perfect compliment to Dave Ramsey's teaching. While I enjoy Ramsey's books, one thing that always bothers me is his amassing wealth mentality. True, he touches on giving but his mantra is \\"Live like no one else so you can live like no one else\\". It always strikes me as being rather self-centered, however I like his basic principles. Combine The Treasure Principle with Ramsey and you get what I think is a perfect combo: Ramsey gives you the tips for staying out of debt and Alcorn gives you the principles for joyful giving.I'll admit, when I began this book I felt like we were giving quite generously; after all, we give more than the typical Christian tithe of 10%. But as I read The Treasure Principle I began to realize that we could and probably should be giving even more. Reading this book challenged me in very good ways!I thoroughly enjoyed The Treasure Principle and highly recommend this easy-to-read 120 page book. I'd give it a 5 out of 5 stars.Disclaimer: I received a copy of The Treasure Principle for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review, however all opinions are mine."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"So, I just wrapped up Randy Alcorn's book, The Treasure Principle. What a treat! I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first picked it up; due to its size, I just assumed it was a lightweight gift book type, however the content inside was anything but that.In the midst of striving to attain security and loosing joy over it, this book was such a good reminder of what makes life worth living. We all have been given life through God. And we have all been bought for a price by the sacrifice of His son, Jesus. I don't know about you, but when I have been given an undeserved gift that blows me away, it makes me want to respond, to share the good news, to bless someone just as I have been so they can know that terrific, exciting feeling as well.This book got me on fire about just that. Giving not only makes a difference in the lives of the recipients- it changes you and your heart. It also has significance beyond our lives- an eternal significance when we give as the Lord prompts us, through tithing, but also through so many other avenues.For me the book was like a Scrooge moment, which Randy Alcorn actually references at the end of the book, when he realizes that the existence he has made for himself- a cold, secure, safe, controlling world, has lent him no joy and no appreciation for life. It's not until he sees that the wealth in his world is not in the bank, that he truly learns to give and share what he has.\\"Only one life, the still small voice, Gently pleads for a better choiceBidding me selfish aims to leave, And to God's holy will to cleave;Only one life, 'twill soon be past, Only what's done for Christ will last.\\"-C.T. Studd"},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"The Treasure Principle covers a concept that has been taught for many years, but in a way that is very easy to understand. Randy Alcorn explains about not living within your means, but below your means. Then, give the excess back to God so that it can be used for His glory. He supports this belief with verses from the Bible, and in a way that everyone can connect with.After reading this book, I realize that I need to take a hard look at what I am doing, and seek God's guidance on what to do with what He has given me.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group in exchange for this review."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"\\"Priceless treasure is within your reach. And with it, liberating joy.\\" This is the claim that Alcorn makes in his book, The Treasure Principle.I was interested in reading a book that was specifically about giving, that would help to clarify just what it is that God calls us to when he calls us to give. In my own personal study and through some other reading I have really been wondering exactly what God is talking about... does he call us to be Joel Olsteen or St. Francis of Assisi? Is it enough to give some portion that has be \\"set apart\\" or that is \\"between me and God\\" while still living a life that's far more luxurious than most of the world? And what about if we give a lot of money away? Is it okay to purchase a new car or should I be happy with the one that I have and give that money to some organization or person who needs it? Is it okay to go on vacation, and if so, what kind, to where, for how long, and how often..? This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of things I have been thinking about lately. And so, I grabbed a hold of Randy Alcorn's book.To be honest, I didn't fine this book to be that great. It was short and an easy read, and I did appreciate some of the conclusions he made, but by and large it seemed as though he was arguing for a motivation to giving because we will be rewarded in Heaven. Alcorn argues that Jesus will be okay with this concept because it was his idea; he [Jesus] tells the rich young ruler who comes to him to sell everything he has and give the money to the poor, then HE WILL HAVE TREASURE IN HEAVEN. Alcorn argues that while our money and possessions are temporary in this life, we can send them ahead of us so that we will receive them in Heaven.While I agree, there is a reward for us in Heaven, scripture talks about this often, I do not think that it will necessarily be a specific reward to us. It seems to me that Jesus is questioning this young man's heart. Jesus is confronting his greed with the understanding that there is no place for greed in God's kingdom! Jesus' message and ministry seem to be about ushering in the kingdom of God here and now rather than focusing only on some future orientation. And going back to that reward idea, if we are concerned for the things that God is concerned for, now, then we will rejoice with God when we see all things reconciled to him, later.I don' think that I would recommend this book as a purchase. It might be nice to flip through if you can borrow it or even get a cheap copy of it. I was rather disappointed as I read through this work.I received a free copy of this book from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing Group for review."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"Alcorn, a former pastor and prolific author, explains the need to invest in eternity. He asks: \\"why should we save and buy things we cannot take with us when we die?\\"Indeed, he suggests setting a budget with a fairly low standard of living, and giving the rest away to your church or other Christian charities.He warns against hoarding money for the future or leaving your children an inheritance. Instead, he says we should give now and give often to the Lord's work.Alcorn's perspective is refreshing and, mostly, dead right. But his message, at least in this book, may be misinterpreted by some.He vigorously reacts against those who save too much for the future because it makes them less dependent on God. He says you should only provide for part of your future needs. Yet we still have to plan/save for retirement.How much should be \\"our\\" part to save? At what point does saving too little make us irresponsible as opposed to spiritual?How exactly this tension is resolved is unclear. But I'm working on his longer book, Money, Possessions and Eternity, and I expect that his concept is more fully explained there."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"I was given this book free to review from Waterbrook Multnomah.I must say that I'm glad I didn't buy it. I was very excited to read it when it came, but was very disappointed once I had read it. I think that I am just not at a stage of my life for this book to be relevant to me, nor is the country in a financial state for it to be as relevant as it was 10 years ago when it was written.On top of that, I felt that the author used out of context scripture and circular logic to argue his point many times. He began every chapter with an out of place cliche or a story about a miserable millionaire. (Plus based on his other book titles, it seems that he fancies himself to be C.S. Lewis, but his eloquence is definitely lacking...)I did not disagree with many things that he said, mostly just the way he put things. I do think that people should give as they are able. He did try to make an argument for what types of organizations should be given to and which are not as worthwhile, and I think that is a very personal decision that he has not much business delving into.I also did not like how he assumed all of his readers had plenty enough income to spare, and that his main motivation for giving was so that he could be some sort of big shot in Heaven. I guess he thinks the homeless christians are going to be screwed over in Heaven too since they have nothing to give on Earth?? I just don't think that is how it works, nor should that be the motivating factor in giving."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"This is a terrific,quick read. It is entertaining and memorable. Lots of great Scripture refs."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"\\"Unlocking the secret of joyful giving\\" - It's the subtitle of a book I was asked to review recently. \\"The treasure principle\\" was handed to me a week or so ago and I decided to read it quickly so I could write the review and move on.This apathy probably comes from a wealth of head knowledge accumulated from 26 years of Biblical teaching on money. I was pretty sure I knew everything the author, Randy Alcorn, had to say about money, tithing, and giving. But, since it was a free book and it was helping out a friend, I read it. So, in a sentence, here's my honest review: I read it and I'm glad I did.While I can't say that the majority of the content was new to me, I can say that Alcorn took the highlights of many longer books and seminars and packaged just what you need to know conveniently in a little 120 page booklet.So what is the treasure principle? At it's very core it is Jesus' teaching, \\"Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\\" Have you ever wished you had more of a heart for missions? Well, Alcorn suggests putting some of your \\"treasure\\" into missions and watch your heart for that need grow. This principle can work for or against our Christian walk. We can invest our treasure into earthly things or heavenly things. One brings the possibility of immediate return, the other the promise of eternal return. The choice is ours.I really appreciated Alcorn's approach as well as his own personal story skillfully woven through the book. An added plus is that the author seems to practice what he preaches. Books about storing up treasure in heaven and not on earth are always a little more convincing when the author doesn't own 3 houses and a jet.Overall, this book has challenged me in a positive way to reevaluate what constitutes \\"discretionary\\" income, where it has been going, and shift my perspective toward things that last. I absolutely recommend this book and for $10 and a few hours, it's a great investment.This review was written by Abigail Cristo, [...]. She was a guest blogger on my blog, [...](The legal stuff: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.)"},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"Today I finished a book that challenged me. I was unsure what to expect when I ordered my complimentary copy from Waterbrook press to review, but was pleasantly surprised. It is called The Treasure Principle by Randy Alcorn. At first I was concerned that it would be similar to the rave that went through for a while about the prayer of Jabez and praying to get more from God. Yet that wasn't even close to what I found. This book was to unlock the secrets of joyful giving.It covered 6 quick keys or Treasure Principles as he called them.*God owns everything. I'm his money manager.*My heart always goes where I put God's money.*Heaven, not earth, is my home.*I should live not for the dot but for the line (focus on eternity not earth).*Giving is the only antidote to materialism.*God prospers me not to raise my standard of living, but to raise my standard of giving.It took a challenging look at the worlds and Christians perspective of money. Sadly it seems that they are generally the same. One of the primary focuses on the book was tithing and then evening giving after the tithe or giving until it stretches you. That is something I've heard before, but you don't hear it preached on often.I wanted to share one of the challenging passages with you from the book...\\"It is increasingly common for Christians to ask one another the tough questions: How is your marriage? Have you been spending time in the Word? How are you doing in terms of sexual purity? Have you been sharing your faith? But how often do we ask, \\"How much are you giving to the Lord?\\" or \\"Have you been robbing God?\\" or \\"Are you winning the battle against materialism?\\"\\"In the end of the book it includes 31 questions just to help people think through the process of giving and then as an \\"answer\\" it includes a scripture and more you can go read through if you have the time. Incredible short 120 page book and I would recommend it to a new or old believer in the faith!"},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"Like a refreshingly cold splash of water on a half woken face, The Treasure Principle by Randy Alcorn, opened my eyes to see the vastness of my material wealth in comparison to the world around me and how selfishly I horde it. While sharing his testimony from living on a hefty church salary and book royalties to minimum wage, Alcorn was clear that following your money trail (where you spend your money) is the thermometer of where your heart is. Additionally, there was a healthy weave of Scripture, Godly wisdom, and illustrations that at their core were rooted in biblical truth.This short book (120 pages) challenged me to my core not only in how I spend my money, but also in the use of my talents and time. Unlike other Christian books on money, this title was not teaching on how to diversify your portfolio to the glory of God, or how to store up a great inheritance for my children's children. Alcorn encourages the reader to give out of the overflow of the grace that they have received. He argued that the inheritance that one leaves should be a spiritual inheritance, a legacy of giving.While I must legally disclose that I received this book free of charge for the purpose of reviewing it, I am in no way obligated to present it in a positive light. I can with integrity say that as a Pastor I would strongly suggest this work for the purpose of teaching on money in a discipleship, small group, or Sunday school environment."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"\\"John D. Rockefeller was one of the wealthiest men who ever lived. After he died someone asked his accountant, How much money did John D. leave?\\" The reply was classic: \\"he left....all of it.\\"If that point is clear in your mind, you're ready to hear the secret of the Treasure Principle.\\" (pg. 18)The Treasure Principle by Randy Alcorn is a short readable book based on a set of principles each built on top of each other. The first principle is that everything we have, including all our money, is God's. The second principle is that if we treat all we own as the Lord's we will spend it according to God's will. This involves seeking out how God wants us to spend His money. The third principle is that if we truly are seeking God's will in how to spend His money then we will be giving sacrificially.The impetus is the focus. Alcorn expounds on his \\"Treasure Principle\\" which comes from the words of Jesus:\\"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and hwere thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thjieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\\" (Matthew 6:19-21)If we keep our mind on our eternal treasure we will willingly give up our temporary one. In one chapter he tells of a widow who fasts every Thursday in order to use the money she's saved to buy food for others.Alcorn discusses not only how we should be spending our money but, as Christians, who and what we should be spending our money on. He compares the different viewpoints of tithing, concluding with his own. He also talks about the fruits that God promises to people who see themselves as the managers or caretakers of God's money rather than regarding it as their own.\\"Give and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.\\" Luke 6:38What Alcorn has to say is convicting and requires a lot of faith to follow. Lest anyone think, \\"Well sure, easy for him to say. He's a successful author and pastor\\" I'll point out that Alcorn is practising what he preaches. Some years ago he peacefully protested outside an abortion clinic. He was arrested and put in jail. The judge awarded the clinic a substantial amount of money. Alcorn refused to pay it because he didn't want any of his income going to an industry that profits from infanticide. The judge then demanded his church pay a quarter of his wages to the clinic each month. To prevent this from happening Alcorn resigned. He now can make no more than minimum wage to avoid garnishment. Recently the ten year statute of limitations came up and Alcorn would have been able to receive his salary again but the judge awarded an extension of another ten years. What does Alcorn have to say about all of this?\\"What others intended for evil, God intended for good (Genesis 50:20). ..My inability to legally own assets was nothing I sought after and nothing to be congratulated for, but God used it to help me understand what He means by \\"Everything under heaven belongs to Me.\\" Job 41:11 (pg. 23)In conclusion The Treasure Principle is a good book to read but don't do so unless you want to be convicted.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Multonomah book publishers in exchange for my honest review."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"\\"The Treasure Principle: Unlocking the Secret of Joyful Giving,\\" by Randy Alcorn is a quick and easy read that addresses the issue of giving from a Biblical perspective. I really appreciate Mr. Alcorn's candor and straightforward style. His transparency is ultimately what makes the book so good. He is asking the reader to join him on an adventure that he has already undertaken.Throughout the book Mr. Alcorn manages to artfully prod at the heart of the reader on how to give from a biblical perspective. The material is both factual and persuasive, theological and practical, sensitive and pointed. Overall it is a fantastic non-fiction book with just the right amount of motivation and practicality. The fact that it is about giving with a biblical mindset makes it even more stunning. I was both convicted and challenged to follow God more surely with our finances through this book and I highly recommend this book to you.\\"The Treasure Principle\\" is only around 120 pages, small, and hardcover making it an excellent gift book even for those who don't read much.

I was pleasantly mistaken. It's not a sophisticated work, but I can see why it's selling. It's a thoughtful and energetic attempt to reframe the way most American Christians see their money and belongings. It's goal is to help us to let go a bit and give a bit more, and I think it's succeeding.The great part of Alcorn's work is that he walks us through his own experiences, both of giving and of losing money without meaning to. His fascinating personal story includes moments at which he could have lost everything and the successful course he charted into becoming a radical giver.I'm going to guess that the primary customers of this book have been pastors and non-profit managers (who, if they're wise, have given out this book by the boxful). But the reality is that any Christian who knows that they aren't particularly generous will find an encouraging challenge to give that emphasizes rationale rather than playing upon guilt.I didn't expect to say this when I started the book, but I'd recommend it.

Randy Alcorn calls this passage the \\"Treasure Principle.\\" He wrote this book to remind us that we can't take any treasure with us to Heaven--but we can send it on ahead by investing in timeless, eternal treasures.Alcorn carefully explains the emptiness of material affluence. He gives examples of millioniare businessmen and of lottery winners who found that wealth does not bring happiness. As he concludes, \\"Giving is the only antidote to materialism.\\"He deals with tithing. Though he is hesitant to say that ten percent is a must, he does note that throughout the New Testament, we see believers giving more. He then proceeds to discuss freewill offerings beyond tithing.At 120 pages - only 94 of which form the main narrative - the book is an incredibly fast read.

How does one give in an economy of materialism? How does on give in a down economy? Should one give above the standard 10% tithe? These are all questions that Christians ask and that Randy Alcorn attempts to answer in \\"The Treasure Principle.\\" If there's one thing for certain, this book will change your perspective on the giving of both your time and your money to the Lord.Alcorn is one who learned the hard way about having to give sacrificially. Sued by an abortion clinic in the early 1990s, he had to resign his pastorate, take a minimum wage salary, and put all his assets into his wive's name to avoid paying anything to a clinic that would only kill more babies with that money. Ironically, he says, that he had just written a book on money (\\"Money, Possessions, and Eternity\\"). This book is quite a short little read at only 94 pages, plus an addendum of 31 questions at the end for where ever you are in your walk of life with regards to money. He gives 6 keys in the book to help you see where you should put the money. Overall, this short little book does pack a punch into how you give your money (and I would say time).The 6 keys are:-God owns everything. I am His money manager.-My heart always goes where I put God's money.-Heaven, not Earth, is my home.-I should live not for the dot but for the line. (Dot is here and now, line is eternity - my summary).-Giving is the only antidote to materialism.-God prospers me not to raise my standard of living, but to raise my standard of giving.In an age of materialism, these ideas are so counter-cultural. The average credit card debt in the U.S. is about $14,750 and the total U.S. consumer debt is around $2.4 trillion (source). Those numbers are staggering. I attempted to find tithing statistics, but they appear to be few and far between. Suffice it to say that Christians are not even giving to the Church as they should be or when they do, they are giving with the wrong motives. Let me say this, this book is not to be used as prosperity teaching. People like Creflo Dollar encourage you to give so that you can get and live like the wealthy. Alcorn is so against that. In fact, he is encouraging Christians to live below their means so that they can give more. I can resonate with that.In all, if you want to read a book that will change your perspective on giving, this is it. In an age when Christians may be relying on Dave Ramsey for financial planning, this book may even be counter to those ideas. We should be good stewards of the resources that God has given us. We have been giving generously for a number of years now and wish we could do more, but this book has changed my idea that perhaps we could do more. Let's not think about if you can afford to give this month because you cannot afford to not give."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"First, some basics: this is a small book. It's printed on 120 pages of 4x6 paper. The font is big enough, but not oversized. No pages are wasted with fluffy illustrations, so the book is all content. We're just not looking at a large amount of content.Since, then, we're not talking a lot of content, to be worth the time, the content had better be good. Is it?Alcorn has an accessible writing style. Between work, graduate study, and free books for blog reviews (like this one, from Multnomah), I read a broad spread of books. The ones I read range from work for the general public to people with doctorates who are just showing off. Alcorn writes at a level that I would hand to teens and above.The content of The Treasure Principle is focused on.....stuff. Money, most specifically, but material stuff is the theme. This book is helpful to wrestle with the question of what Christians should do with their money. How to handle what we have in the abundance many of us live in.Alcorn is direct. He expresses that Christians need to understand that none of the stuff they have is actually their own stuff, which it isn't. It truly does belong to God because we all belong to God. Beyond this, he has several practical suggestions of where and how to start.Finally, though, as to value: this book is small. I'm not entirely sure it's worth buying at the cover price for an individual, but books like this are rarely sold at that price. If it's on sale, it's worth purchasing. It would also make for an excellent, affordable small group study."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"Each time I receive a book to review, I honestly feel that God has hand picked these books with a special message for me and my family. And this book was no exception to that rule. I was sent The Treasure Principle by Randy Alcorn.To put it simply, this book is about \\"the joy of giving.\\" In Acts 20:35, the Bible says, \\"The Lord Jesus himself said: 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'\\" According to Alcorn, nothing in this world is truly ours. Instead, the money, gifts, talents, material possession, etc. were all given to us by God for us to do God's will. So with that mentality, if God has blessed us with something we should use it to help others. Throughout the book, Alcorn lays out the six keys to the treasure principle and explains using scripture why he believes this is Gods calling to all of us. Alcorn challenges his readers to not only give, but to give beyond our ability.I really enjoyed this book. It was a fast and easy read that provoked my thinking and motivated me to change the way I think about tithing and giving. The book is very short and I do wish that there was a little bit more to the book. I loved the words that Randy Alcorn uses to show why it is so important that we give, but in these economic times I think it would be nice to give some suggestions on how to get started (ie different organizations and there contact info that are legitimate). Alcorn also mentioned why it was so important to stay out of debt so that you are able to continue to give. Well, what about those of us that are already in debt? Should we be giving more or getting ourselves out of debt? Overall, this book was excellent and I would recommend that anyone and everyone read it!The Blogging for Books program, through Waterbrook Multnomah Press, was kind enough to send me yet another free book in exchange for my honest review."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"The Treasure Principle by Randy Alcorn is a book my husband and I both love! In his book, Randy reminds readers to store up treasures in heaven, rather than on earth. This book is not only challenging, but biblical and counter-cultural. It has revolutionized the way I view money and possessions. I sincerely desire that every believer read this book!"},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"This little book is powerful and something I've purchased and sent to friends. I've been a long-time tither of my monetary resources, but Randy Alcorn goes beyond the 'usual thoughts on giving'and makes the whole thing such fun and a joy to be a part of. I think everyone should read this little 'treasure'. It may change your thoughts on how you view 'stuff' (material things) AND if you follow the scriptural principles laid out in this little work, it may change your life! I should add that Alcorn gives clear reasons for not accumulating wealth here on earth and he shows how to live a life without concentrating on prosperity. Fun to read...........couldn't put it down!

The challenge for us is to make sure that we are being a blessing with the blessings that God has entrusted to us. In these hard economic times facing the church, we all need a little encouragement to make sure that we are giving by faith and giving faithfully. Desiring to give generously is good so long as we actually do give as generously as we can. Alcorn reminds the reader that this is what the Bible teaches, \\"just as the readiness to desire it, so there may be also the completion of it by your ability,\\" 2 Cor 8:11. Yet this is exactly where we all need a little help and encouragement, and Randy Alcorn in his The Treasure Principle gives not a little but a lot. So if you need a little motivation to give, let Randy Alcorn show you Jesus' \\"treasure principle.\\" He explains that everything that we store up on earth, we'll lose, and everything we invest in Christ's kingdom will accrue for us a thousand-fold dividend that we can enjoy for eternity. The church needs more wise investors who give to bless and not to store up treasures on earth. I strongly recommend the wise biblical counsel of Alcorn's simple to read and life-transformational book as he unlocks Jesus' \\"treasure principle.\\" May God bless us free us from the snare of materialism and raise up more saints who have a passion to meet needs now and who have an eye fixed on future glory.Secret Sex Wars: A Battle Cry For Purity"},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"Randy Alcorn is no stranger to financial success, financial loss, and sacrificial giving. In The Treasure Principle, Alcorn shares with his readers six important keys to joyful and free Christian giving.PositivesIt is very possible that many Christians do not even recognize the hold that materialism has upon their lives. Alcorn's work helps us to see just how devastatingly attached we are to our things, and how sadly we miss the joys of giving.Alcorn challenges us to realize that God is the true owner of everything while we are merely his stewards. We will give more freely and rightly when our mindset on giving changes. Alcorn encourages us to realize that all the money we have is God's. Instead of thinking, \\"What does God want me to give,\\" we should think, \\"How much would God want me to keep of his money?\\" This mind-shift is very helpful for believers.NegativesNot much is negative in this book. It is possible that Alcorn is too simplistic or sweeping in his statements. This negative is not damaging for most readers, however, only for those who read this book without discernment.RecommendationIt would be very good for almost any Christian, especially in western cultures, to read through and strongly consider Alcorn's The Treasure Principle. Perhaps it would open our eyes and hearts to giving for the joy of the eternal reward and the glory of God. Yes, readers should be careful and consider their steps wisely, but this is true of any book. Without question, believers should consider how God would have us worship him through giving in the midst of this difficult financial time.I am grateful to [...] for their excellent downloadable version of this book. They also have a free download of conference audio from Alcorn on this book (I haven't' listened to it, but I'd suppose it contains much of the same material for $0 and in a 50-minute lecture)."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"This is an excellent book to show you God's word about His money that He allows us to manage while we are here on this earth."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"If you are having trouble with feeling happy, satisfied, and/or wealthy, read this book and start giving."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"I have known of Randy Alcorn's books for years, but this is the first one that I've read. Overall, I was favorably impressed. The basic premise of \\"The Treasure Principle\\" is to reshape the way that American Christians think about money and possessions, and to that end, I would say that he is mostly successful. Much of what he says is not particularly new, but his writing is succinct and clear. And he shares his own rather unusual financial situation to provide some authenticity to his claims. Alcorn suggests that most of us should give away more than we do. He challenges some commonly held assumptions about savings and inheritances, even suggesting that it is not only unnecessary but potentially damaging to pass along significant wealth to our children. Though I'm not necessarily ready to embrace all of Alcorn's ideas, I love his willingness to challenge the church to consider some new and seemingly dramatic ideas about money.My disappointments with the book are two-fold. First, I was disappointed by Alcorn's narrow view of which organizations are worthy of our generosity. As he encourages us to increasing levels of giving, he suggests that only Christian organizations specifically geared towards evangelism or discipleship deserve financial contributions. He specifically calls out arts organizations as unworthy. I think this position reflects a short-sightedness about the scope of God's work. Though I understand the need to invest in churches and Christian ministries, I am convinced that God's work is not so limited, and we would be well-served to think more broadly about our giving.Finally, I thought the appendix to the book was ridiculous. It was described as a series of questions that the readers should ask themselves in prayer before God, but the questions were completely loaded, leading questions. Rather than honest questions, that portion of the book was more like an opportunity for Alcorn to rehash what he had already stated earlier in the book. I don't mind an author offering challenging opinions, but couching those opinions as questions was repetitive and even felt a bit disingenuous.With these two frustrations aside, I am still glad to have read this book. Alcorn is engaging, honest, and challenging. He offers a firm challenge that the 21st-century American church needs to hear. I am happy to recommend this book to anyone willing to thoughtfully consider if God might be calling them to step into a new life of generous, sacrificial giving."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"I would recommend Randy Alcorn's The Treasure Principle: Unlocking the Secret of Joyful Giving. [...]The author's treasure principle is that \\"You can't take it with you - but you can send it on ahead\\" (Alcorn, 18). A Psalmist had something similar in mind when he wrote, \\"Do not be overawed when a man grows rich, when the splendor of his house increases; for he will take nothing with him when he dies, his splendor will not descend with him\\" (Psalm 49:16-17). What I appreciated about this book, which is not always the case with many Christian financial resources, is that it is balanced and biblically based. Unlike much of the prosperity teachings that are out there, the emphasis of this book is on giving to God and to others rather than on giving more in order to just get more. Imagine how much more effective the church would be, on the mission of Christ, if we grew in our giving and sacrifice?Official Description: Bestselling author Randy Alcorn introduced readers to a revolution in material freedom and radical generosity with the release of the original The Treasure Principle in 2001. Now the revision to the compact, perennial bestseller includes a provocative new concluding chapter depicting God asking a believer questions about his stewardship over material resources. Readers are moved from the realms of thoughtful Bible exposition into the highly personal arena of everyday life. Because when Jesus told His followers to \\"lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,\\" He intended that they discover an astounding secret: how joyful giving brings God maximum glory and His children maximum pleasure. Discover a joy more precious than gold! After years of writing and teaching on the theme \\"God owns everything,\\" In 1990 Randy Alcorn was sued by an abortion clinic (for peaceful, nonviolent intervention for the unborn). Suddenly he had to resign as a pastor and was restricted to making minimum wage. Legally unable to own anything, Randy gave all his book royalties to missions work and need-meeting ministries. He and his family have experienced the reality of The Treasure Principle--that God really does own everything, takes care of us, and graciously puts assets into our hands that we might have the joy and privilege of investing in what will last for eternity.Author Biography: Randy Alcorn is the founder and director of Eternal Perspective Ministries (EPM). Prior to 1990, when he started EPM, he served as a pastor for fourteen years. He has spoken around the world and has taught on the adjunct faculties of Multnomah Bible College and Western Seminary in Portland, Oregon.

The writing is to the point. However, don't expect to read it without doing some soul-searching.We all know deep down what is expected of us. Really. No matter what we cover it up with, we know there is something bigger than us, something beyond the physical space we take up on this planet. regardless of what we call IT. We also know there is a response of some sort required.I've lived on both sides of the coin -- living for myself and living for a purpose. Self leaves me feeling empty and unfulfilled. And that's the bottom line. With comments such as \\" As the wealthiest man on earth, Solomon learned that affluence doesn't satisfy.

If you are not a Christian or are a Christian who doesn't really like the idea of giving God control over your life, I guarantee you'll come away with at least one bruised toe. However, if you are wondering what might be missing in your life, looking for something to bring meaning to your existence, the questions at the back of the book alone are worth the investment you'll make if you chose to purchase the book.

Good packing. 100% satisfied."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"This book, more than any other has led me to cast serious doubt on the validity of Christianity. While it may have some valid points on the value of giving, it comes off as cultist and fanatical. The more I read it, the more I doubted it. The more I found it absurd. The author has no rational understanding of what money is, and why it is a good thing. Yet he stated that God owns everything even the money. Let me ask you this, and this is what I thought of while reading this: what does God need with money? With sacrifice? If Jesus paid the ultimate price, and was the ultimate sacrifice, if our deeds truly are as filthy rags, then what does God need with our sacrifices? What does he need with our money? I guess it is at least commendable that the author isn't telling me to give the money to him, but this fanatical idea that if I give away 90% of what I earn will somehow bestow blessings on me is ridiculous. I would starve. If God intended my money to go to someone else, then why didn't God just give it to them? I would be very happy knowing that someone else was better off, it wouldn't take away from my joy. I guess what I'm saying is that the author is advocating that we give all our money to the church. Presumably so the church can do God's work, but money is evil, right? So WTH? And God can do his work with or without money right? I'm supposed to have this \\"free gift\\" of salvation, but this author is now saying. \\"pay for it, that's not your money anyway.\\" The hell it's not. Maybe if God had come down and told me himself I'd believe that. But let's face it, people who work for the church will reap the benefits of our donations. We work our asses off, and then they tell us that we should give half of it to them because that's what God wants. Thats the whole reason why we made the money. I'm sorry, why GOD allowed us to make the money. This basically is coming off like any other \\"free\\" scam that comes in my junk mail folder. It didn't make me feel joyful, it pissed me off. This author has it all wrong as far as what money is and what is at the root of money. Being wealthy and not giving it all away is not greed, as he would suggest. Nor is it materialism to have nice things or increase your standard of living. It just makes me think that he wants my money. And if not him, then the \\"church\\" should have it. Well, the church didn't earn it for me and now he and others like him are saying that they are the ones who deserve it more than I. And it's not that I'm against giving, but this book makes me want to kick a homeless person out of spite for the author. I'd give it minues five stars if I could but I can only give it the lowest possible rating. I am a Christian, but this book makes me think that Christianity and indeed all religion is just a scam to get my money - something I have almost none of."},{"Title":"Treasure Principle","review":"TWO VIEWS OF TITHING: Randy Alcorn and Russell E. KellyWritten by Russell E. Kelly, Ph. D., January 14, 2006Introduction:The following is a rebuttal by Russell Earl Kelly, Ph. D. of The Practice of Tithing as the Minimum Standard of Christian Giving and Money, Possessions and Eternity (chapter 7) by Randy Alcorn. Alcorn is the leader of Eternal Perspective Ministries, www.epm.org and has authored many books and articles which advocate tithing. Kelly is the author of Should the Church Teach Tithing, A Theologian's Conclusions about a Taboo Doctrine. His web site is www.tithing-russkelly.com.Alcorn's most important point is that, since tithing was the minimum standard of giving during Old Covenant times, then it should be the starting point for Christians under the New Covenant because Christians should be expected to exceed the legal requirements of the Mosaic Law.Kelly teaches that tithing as a minimum standard for all OT Israelites never existed and is a false assumption because tithing was limited to food from farmers and herdsmen. Kelly advocates total free-will giving motivated by a Spirit-driven desire for the salvation of the lost.................................................................................Alcorn begins his discussion with the account of Zaccheus from Luke 19:1-10 and the rich young ruler from Matthew 19:16-26. However, neither of these accounts concern or include tithing. In both instances, Jesus told them to \\"give to the poor.\\" Therefore, Jesus was instructing them about free-will giving. It is noteworthy that He did not tell them to give anything, including a tithe, to the Temple and its Levites and priests.Acts 2:42-47 They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. ... All the believers were together and had everything in common. Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved. NIV (quoted by Alcorn)ALCORN: Concerning Acts 2 and 4, he wrote: \\"Proof of change, Holy Spirit's work. Generous sharing and giving of money and possessions. People selling their possessions and giving to the needy. Liquidating assets for the good of others.\\"KELLY: Alcorn uses Acts 2 and 4 to illustrate tithing. However, his conclusions are wrong. What he omits about these texts is important. (1) The texts are not discussing tithing. (2) While these earliest Jewish church members devoted themselves to the \\"apostles' teaching\\" (Acts 2:42), that teaching did not include tithing because those Jewish Christians were still scrupulously observing the Law of Moses. That is why Acts 2:46 says that \\"Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts.\\" (3) Thirty years later, James and the elders boasted to Paul, \\"You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law\\" (Acts 21:20). They must have been tithing - to the Temple! There is simply no other conclusion from the wording of Acts 15:1-32 and 21:17-27.Acts 4:32-35 All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they had. With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and much grace was upon them all. There were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to anyone as he had need. NIV (quoted by Alcorn)KELLY: Rather than teaching tithing, as Alcorn desires, Acts 4:32-35 merely states that the earliest Jewish Christians lived together in communes and shared their possessions equally. Since this is not done by Alcorn and his fellow ministers, then it should not be used to prove any point, especially tithing. Since the distribution was equal, then the apostles had exactly the same as the poorest person in the church (which is not true about tithing). If these Jewish Christians had stopped paying tithes to the Temple system and had started giving them to their pastors, then Acts 2, 4, 15 and 21 make no sense at all. Alcorn offers no proof for his claim.ALCORN: I'd like to focus now on the biblical foundation, the cornerstone of stewardship. It is not the whole superstructure of stewardship, far from it. It is not the ceiling of giving, but merely the floor of giving. [1st repetition]KELLY: Alcorn assumes that his readers will not dispute anything he says. However, (1) God's Word does not say that tithing is the \\"biblical foundation, the cornerstone of stewardship.\\" (2) Neither does God's Word say that tithing was the \\"floor,\\" or \\"minimum standard of giving\\" (which Alcorn will restate and repeat thirteen times to make sure that this unscriptural point will stick in the mind). The reasons for my remarks follow.While using Leviticus 27:30 to demonstrate the \\"principle of tithing,\\" it will be seen that Alcorn's strongest text fails to prove his arguments at every single point! The following is how Alcorn marks his emphasis of the verse. The underlined portions are my focus.ALCORN: \\"A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD.\\" NIV (quoted by Alcorn)Lev 27:30 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD.Lev. 27:31 And if a man will at all redeem any of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.Lev. 27:32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.Lev. 27:33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.Lev. 27:34 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai. KJVKELLY: Alcorn's uses God's Word very selectively. While only quoting verse 30 out of context, he completely ignores the remainder of verse 30 and also the surrounding texts.ALCORN: \\"Tithe\\"-- the meaning of the word \\"tithe\\" is ten per cent. If someone makes $2000 a month and puts $50 in the offering box he hasn't tithed. If you make $2000 a tithe is two hundred dollars. You cannot tithe 2% or 4% or 6% of your income any more than you can \\"whitewash\\" a wall with red paint.KELLY: Alcorn's definition of \\"tithe\\" is \\"10% of all income or increase\\" [usually gross income before taxes], only excluding business expenses. However his definition of \\"tithe\\" is wrong because it comes from a man's dictionary instead of God's Word!In God's Word, \\"tithe\\" does not stand alone. It is the \\"tithe of FOOD.\\" The biblical tithe was very narrowly defined and limited by God Himself. True biblical tithes were always: (1) only food, (2) only from the farms and herds, (3) of only Israelites, (4) who only lived inside God's Holy Land, the national boundary of Israel, (5) only under Old Covenant terms and (6) the increase could only come from God's hand.Therefore, (1) non-food items could not be tithed. (2) Clean wild game animals and fish could not be tithed. (3) Non-Israelites could not tithe. (4) Food from outside God's holy land of Israel did not enter the Temple. (5) Legitimate tithing did not occur when there was no Levitical priesthood. And (5) tithes did not come from what man's hands created, produced or caught by hunting and fishing.ALCORN: EVERYTHING [from Leviticus 27:30]: \\"Everything.\\" Doesn't mean \\"some things.\\" Doesn't mean \\"most things.\\" Means \\"everything.\\"KELLY: Alcorn stresses \\"everything\\" from Leviticus 27:30 and totally ignores the following words, \\"from the land\\" from the very text he quotes!Again, it is not a tithe \\"of everything, or all.\\" Rather, God's Word calls it a tithe \\"of the land\\" (Lev. 27:30), \\"of the herd\\" (Lev. 27:32), \\"of grain and wine\\" (Numb. 18:27,28), \\"of grain, wine and oil\\" (Deut. 12:17; 14:23; Neh. 13:5), \\"the increase of your seed\\" (Deut. 14:22), \\"of the ground\\" (Neh. 10:37), \\"food\\" (Mal. 3:10) and \\"food\\" (Mt 23:23).Tradesmen such as carpenters (Jesus), fishermen (Peter) and tentmakers (Paul) did not qualify as tithe-payers because their increase came from their own skillful work and use of their own hands rather than wholly from God's increase and blessings off His holy land. Day-laborers at farms did not tithe because the land-owner paid tithes. And the \\"double portion\\" inheritance law of Deuteronomy 21:17 eventually pushed many into the cities to earn their livelihood by trades.ALCORN: It \\"belongs to the LORD.\\" It doesn't belong to me. It's not my money. It's not your money. It's God's money.KELLY: (1) The O. T. tithe was never \\"money\\" at all! It could be exchanged for money because it was not money. It could also be converted into money because it was not money (Deut. 14:24-26). (2) In the O. T. the tithe \\"belonged to the LORD\\" because it had grown on God's land, inside the boundaries of national Israel and was grown by an Israelite. If these conditions were not met, then it did not \\"belong to the LORD.\\"ALCORN: It is \\"holy to the Lord.\\" \\"Holy\\" means \\"set apart.\\" It is to be set apart and given to God, and used for no other purpose.KELLY: The tithe had \\"no other purpose\\" than to support the Levitical servants to the priests who gave a tenth of their tithe to the priests. It was a sin to use the tithe for \\"any other purpose.\\" Since the \\"purpose\\" of the tithe never changed, and since the tithe was never given to elders and preachers, then are not elders and preachers \\"robbing God\\" by receiving the tithe under one pretense and then using it for an entirely different purpose than used in the Old Covenant?The O. T. tithe, like almost everything else in the book of Leviticus, was either \\"holy\\" or \\"most holy\\" to the LORD (Yahweh). (1) Again, it was only holy because it was grown on God's land by God's covenant people. (2) It was holy as an O. T. ceremonial worship statute, or ordinance. (3) The N. T. church rejects almost everything else in Leviticus similarly called \\"holy\\" and \\"most holy.\\" (4) O.T. Israel was commanded not to share its covenant statutes with any other nation (including Sabbath-keeping and tithing) (Ex. 23:32; 34:12, 15; Deut. 7:2). (5) The tithe was not to be given to prophets or rabbis. As \\"most holy\\" it must only be given to Levites (Numb. 18:9, 10; Neh. 10:37). Its sole \\"purpose\\" (to use Alcorn's word) was to totally support the Levites who were servants to the priests. Although the Levites were guards, singers, bakers, craftsmen and animal skinners, they were not the priests.The tithe was NEVER used to support missionaries of pay any Temple expenses. Although the priests received one tenth of the first tithe, they also had many other means of support. See Numbers 18.Mal. 3:8 Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me. But you ask, 'How do we rob you?' In tithes and offerings. NIV (quoted by Alcorn)ALCORN: \\"You rob me.\\" Stealing from God. \\"Thou shalt not steal.\\" Taking what isn't yours and doing whatever you want with it.KELLY: Malachi is in Old Covenant context and is never quoted in the New Covenant for the church. Compare 2:8-10; 3:7 and 4:4 with Nehemiah 10:28, 29 and Deuteronomy 27:26.ALCORN: In \\"tithes and offerings.\\" The mandatory giving and the voluntary giving. Not only are they not doing the voluntary--they're holding back the mandatory. [2nd repetition]KELLY: In Malachi the priests had robbed God. Especially in 1:6; 2:1 and 3:3, Malachi is addressed to dishonest priests. The priests had stolen the tithes from the Levites and the best offerings from God. Nehemiah 13:10 says \\"And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.\\" The priests had stolen the Levites' tithes and Temple worship ceased when the Levites returned o their fields. See Nehemiah 13:4-13; Malachi 1:6-14 and 2:1 to 3:7.Mal. 3:9 You are under a curse--the whole nation of you--because you are robbing me. NIV (quoted by Alcorn)Mal. 1:14 [To the priests] But cursed be the deceiver, which has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, says the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.Mal. 2:2 [To the priests] If you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, says the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it to heart.Gal. 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.ALCORN: \\"You're under a curse.\\" God promises the blessings of obedience and curses for disobedience.\\"KELLY: Malachi's audience was under the Old Covenant ordinances which included both blessings and curses. The general curses of Deuteronomy 27:26 were reaffirmed by Israelites in Nehemiah 10:28, 29. Specifically, the priests had already been cursed several times in Malachi for breaking their special \\"covenant of Levi\\" (Mal. 2:1-10).Those who were cursed in Malachi were primarily the priests. See 1:14 and 2:2. In its context, \\"This whole nation of you\\" probably refers to \\"you priests.\\" Otherwise, God would have switched from cursing the priests (from 1:6 to 3:7) to assisting the priests in 3:8-10.Alcorn's greatest error is in placing New Covenant believers back under a curse which Christ has abolished. When Jesus said, \\"It is finished,\\" the Old Covenant ended, along with its curses. Paul plainly states in Galatians 3:13 \\"Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.\\"Mal. 3:10 Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,\\" says the Lord Almighty, \\"and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it. NIV (quoted by Alcorn)ALCORN: God says \\"Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse\\"-don't hold back any of it. ... Where does the tithe go? Into the \\"storehouse.\\" This was something in Israel that you didn't decide for yourself. The whole tithe went into the temple, for the work of the Levites.KELLY: The tithe is still only food.KELLY: Malachi 3:10 is greatly misunderstood and misused. It is easy to prove from God's Word that the \\"whole tithe\\" NEVER went to the Temple. (a) The Levitical cities must be considered and Jerusalem was not a Levitical city. The Levites and priests lived inside the Levitical cities with their families and herds. See Numb. 35; Josh. 20, 21; 1 Chron. 6; Neh. 13:10 and Mal. 1:14. Israel was commanded to bring their tithes first to the Levitical cities. See Nehemiah 10:37, 38 and 2 Chron. 31:15-19. It makes no sense to teach that 100% of the tithe was brought to the Temple when most Levites and priests did not live in Jerusalem. (b) The 24 courses of Levites and priests must also be considered. Beginning with King David and King Solomon, they were divided into 24 families. These divisions were also put into place in Malachi's time by Ezra and Nehemiah. Since normally only one family served in the Temple for only one week at a time, there was absolutely no reason to send ALL of the tithe to the Temple when 98% of those it was designed to feed were still in the Levitical cities (1 Chron. 24-26; 28:13, 21; 2 Chron. 8:14; 23:8; 31:2, 15-19; 35:4, 5, 10; Ezra 6:18; Neh. 11:19, 30; 12:24; 13:9, 10; Luke 1:5). (c) Therefore, when the context of the Levitical cities, the 24 families of priests, under-age children, wives, Numbers 18, Second Chronicles 31, Nehemiah 10-13, and all of Malachi are all evaluated, only about 2% of the total tithe was normally required at the Temple in Jerusalem. (d) Therefore God was telling only the priests to bring their \\"whole\\" share of the tithe to the temple because they had stolen it from the Levites and had kept the best for themselves while offering the lame and sick to God. Therefore normally only 1% to 2% of the \\"whole\\" tithe went to the Temple. See Neh. 13:4-13 and Mal. 1:6 to 2:10.ALCORN: Closest parallel today to the temple is the church. ... Seems to me the tithe should go to where the center of God's program, which is the local church. Now, the ideal is for the church to support those ministries.KELLY: By implication, Alcorn defines \\"church\\" as an organization and local building. Actually the only \\"parallel\\" to the O. T. temple (where God dwelled) is now the body of individual believers, the Body of Christ (where God now dwells) (1 Cor. 3:16, 17; 6:19). There is NOT a parallel to the O. T. Temple building. Again, unfortunately, tithes were never used to support missionary activities, especially outside of God's holy boundaries of Israel.ALCORN: [The] NT church is not a storehouse, has a world evangelism focus temple didn't have. It's more a clearing house than a storehouse. Acts--apostles pass on to the needy.KELLY: Right! The church is not a storehouse, a building, or an organization for the receipt and storage of food tithes. And the N. T. does not call it a storehouse either. It is an assembly of believer-priests. For several centuries after Calvary Christians did not even have their own buildings for worship because Christianity was an outlaw religion. They defiantly refused to call their worship locations \\"church buildings,\\" \\"tabernacles\\" or \\"temples.\\" It is wrong to translate the Greek word, ekklesia, as \\"church.\\"ALCORN: The closest parallel to the Levites is the elders of the church. You see that in Acts 2 in Jerusalem, where it says the money was laid at the feet of the apostles, who then decided how to distribute it.KELLY: Wrong! (1) There is absolutely no parallel between the O. T. Levites and the N. T. church leaders. The Levites, who received the whole tithe, were neither priests nor ministers. They were only servants to the priests (Numb. 18:21-25; Neh. 10:37). (2) O. T. priests only received one tenth of the whole tithe from the Levites (Numb. 18:25, 26; Neh. 10:38). This procedure is nowhere carried over into Christianity. (3) The apostles in Acts 2 were not receiving tithes because they were still devoutly supporting the Temple then and also years later as seen in Acts 15 and 21. (4) The apostles in Acts 2 did not become wealthy by teaching tithing; they shared the wealth with every church member. This is not done today among those who teach tithing.ALCORN: In Malachi 3:10 God says something striking: \\"Test me in this and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing. . . \\"Deut. 28:12 The LORD shall open unto you his good treasure, the heaven to give the rain unto your land in his season, and to bless all the work of your hand ... [not merely tithing]Mal. 4:4 Remember the law of Moses My servant, even the statutes and ordinances which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel.KELLY: God does not tell post-Calvary believers to test Him, or else He will curse them. Malachi 3:10 is wholly in the context of the O. T. blessings and curses as mentioned earlier from Deuteronomy 27:26; 28:12 and reaffirmed in Nehemiah 10:28, 29. Only twelve verses later Malachi 4:4 reminds everybody of the context of 3:7-10.Today the poorest uneducated classes are victims of unscrupulous persons and are easily tricked into the get-rich-quick magic of both the lottery and tithing. Yet for the vast majority neither works! In fact, it can be positively demonstrated that Malachi 3:10 does not work! U. S. Internal Revenue Service statistics prove that the very richest pay the smallest percentage to charity while the very poorest pay the largest. If Malachi 3:10 really worked for New Covenant Christians, then millions of poor tithing Christians would escape poverty and become the wealthiest group of people in the world instead of remaining in poverty.ALCORN: No one asked, \\"Would you like me to tithe, Lord?\\" ... You don't have to ask--God has already told you. ... But there is a debate about whether tithing is still a minimum mandatory standard. Some think there is no such thing as a minimum standard of giving any more. [3rd repetition]KELLY: God has not told the New Covenant believer to tithe because both His Temple and priesthood are now within every believer and its purpose has been abolished.What principle of interpretation does Alcorn and other tithe-teachers use? Some say that the moral laws are still valid, but the statutes and judgments ended at Calvary. However, tithing was a ceremonial worship statute and all of the others in Leviticus have ended. Others say that God repeated in terms of grace that which He wanted the church to know after Calvary. Again, tithing was not repeated. God told Old Covenant Israel to tithe to support the Levitical priesthood and He plainly says that the Levitical priesthood has been replaced by the priesthood of every believer (Heb. 7:5, 12, 18, 19; Heb. 4:16; 1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 5:10).Alcorn repeatedly uses the common false assumption that tithing was, and still is, the \\"minimum standard of giving.\\" The average church member does not realize that this has never been true! Tithing never was a \\"minimum\\" for anybody other than O. T. Israelite farmers and herdsmen who lived inside of God's holy land. Even Jews do not tithe today because they realize that the old standards cannot be met.Free-will giving built the sanctuary and the Temple. Non-tithe funds maintained the Temple. Free-will giving and ardent evangelism built most denominations in the United States until they became free of state churches (which mandated tithing) and formed their own tithing organizations.O. T. tithes miserably failed to either perfect the giver or produce missions. Israel did not use tithes for missions. The system became \\"un-profitable\\" and was replaced by Spirit-guided and love-provoked grace giving. The problem with the church is not its failure to reintroduce legalistic tithing. Rather it is a failure to motivate personal evangelism through preaching the love for lost souls. See Heb. 7:18; 2 Cor. 3:10-18; 8 all; 9:7.ALCORN: We don't offer sacrifices anymore but that's because the New Testament makes clear the sacrificial system has been fulfilled in Christ.KELLY: The financial basis of the fulfilled sacrificial system was tithing. Tithing allowed the sacrificial system to function. The ceremonial worship ordinances/statutes clearly ended at Calvary. When the system ended, its support apparatus also ended. Now there is no need for tithe-supported priests to hear confessions and offer sacrifices. That is the clear point of Hebrews 7:12-19! See also Ephesians 2:14-16 and Colossians 2:13-17.ALCORN: Nowhere are we told the tithe as a minimum standard of giving no longer pertains.[4th repetition]KELLY: Like a bankrupt company, the entire system which tithing was legislated to financially support ended. (1) The old covenant \\"no longer pertains\\" (Heb. 8:10-13). (2) The physical temple \\"no longer pertains\\" and was replaced by the every-believer-temple. (2) The priesthood \\"no longer pertains\\" and was replaced by the every-believer-priesthood. (3) The Levitical cities ended. (4) The Levites, who received the whole tithe, disappeared. Most of the servant functions they performed are now performed by non-paid ushers and greeters (guards), choir members (singers), non-paid bakers and builders and repairmen who are not paid out of \\"tithe\\" funds. (5) The storehouse concept \\"no longer pertains.\\" There were no legal church buildings in the early centuries because Christianity was an outlaw religion. (6) The necessity for full-time paid clergy \\"no longer pertains\\" (Acts 20:29-35; 1 Cor 9:12-18). The early church followed the pattern of Jewish rabbis who had their own jobs and refused to be supported for teaching God's Word. (7) Hebrews 7:5 reminds us that the OT priests collected tithes because they had a commandment (statute) to do so; 7:11 says that priesthood failed; 7:12 says that it was \\"necessary to change the law\\" (referring to tithing) because Christ was not from the tribe of Levi (7:13-16); and 7:18 says \\"For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and un-profitableness thereof.\\" This was the \\"commandment\\" of tithing which financed the Levitical support through tithing in 7:12.ALCORN: Tithing was practiced before the law, by Abraham and Jacob (Gen. 14:20; 28:20-22) and is never specifically rescinded in the New Testament.KELLY: The argument that \\"tithing was practiced before the law\\" is extremely weak and does not constitute a biblical principle. The mere fact that something is very old and very widespread does not make it a moral principle and God's will. The same pagans who practiced tithing before the law also worshipped idols and practiced child sacrifices and temple prostitution which are not moral principles.For the following reasons, Genesis 14:20 cannot be used as an example for Christians to tithe. (1) The Bible does not say that Abraham \\"freely\\" gave this tithe. (2) Abraham's tithe was NOT a holy tithe from God's holy land produced by God's holy people. (3) Abraham's tithe was only from pagan spoils of war common to many nations. (4) In Numbers 31, Yahweh only required 1% of spoils of war. (5) Abraham's tithe to Melchizedek was a one-time recorded event and Abraham moved often. (6) Abraham's tithe was not from his own personal property. (7) Abraham kept nothing for himself; he gave everything back. (8) Abraham's tithe is not quoted anywhere in the Bible to endorse tithing. (9) Genesis 14, verse 21, is the key text. Since most commentaries explain verse 21 as an example of pagan Arab tradition, it is contradictory to explain the 90% of verse 21 as pagan, while insisting that the 10% of verse 20 was God's will. (10) If Abraham is an example for Christians to give 10% to God, then he should also be an example for Christians to give the other 90% to Satan, or to the king of Sodom! (11) Since neither Abraham nor Jacob had a Levitical priesthood to support, they had no place to bring tithes during their many moves. (11) Jacob's tithe was a free-will vow that probably was given to the poor.ALCORN: There is no question that Jesus tithed. He was raised in a devout Jewish home, meaning that his parents obeyed the Scriptures, tithed and taught him to tithe.KELLY: Since Jesus was a carpenter, and not a farmer or herdsman, then he did not qualify as a tithe-payer. The increase from one's skill, efforts and ingenuity (works) did not qualify as tithes of food.Matt. 23:23: \\"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices--mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law--justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.\\"Matt. 23:2 The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:Matt. 23:3 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.ALCORN: In Matthew 23:23 Jesus states that while they should have paid attention to more important things, the Pharisees were correct in being careful to tithe.KELLY: The text actually reads \\"more important things of the law.\\" Jesus promoted tithing because He was a Jew living under the jurisdiction of the law (Gal. 4:4). In Matthew 23:2, 3 Jesus commanded his disciples to obey all of the (thousands of) things which the scribes and Pharisees taught. This is because the people had yielded to them as the legitimate interpreters of the Law. This is a pre-Calvary text and is not in New Covenant context. Just as Jesus did not instruct Gentiles whom he healed to show themselves to the priests, neither did he instruct them to begin tithing to the Levitical system.ALCORN: The truth is the New Testament portrays the norm of Christian giving as far beyond the tithe.[5th repetition]2 Cor. 8:12-14 For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man has, and not according to that he has not. For I mean not that other men be eased, and you burdened: But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:2 Cor. 9:7 Every man according as he purposes in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.KELLY: There is no \\"norm\\" or minimum commandment for Christian giving. The New Covenant teaches that both the poor and the rich should give to the best of their ability so that there may be an EQUALITY. The poor may not be able to give as much, but the rich should make up for their lack. The NT does not call freewill giving \\"tithing.\\" Christians were motivated through the indwelling Spirit and because they had a strong desire for evangelism.ALCORN: It never suggests the \\"floor\\" set by the tithe was eliminated, but simply that the ceiling of Christian giving was far above it. [6th repetition]KELLY: Tithing was only a \\"floor\\" for Israelite farmers and herdsmen inside Israel. There never was a \\"floor\\" for free-will offerings. Where free-will offerings were involved, the people often gave too much and were asked to stop giving.ALCORN: Jewish Christians dominated the formation and policies of the early church. Because tithing was so deeply embedded in the Jewish consciousness, the Jewish Christians naturally gave their tithes to the local church assembly. This almost became a moot point because they went so far beyond the tithe, as we see in the early chapters of Acts. But their going beyond it did not negate it. [7th repetition]Acts 21:18-21 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present. And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law: And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.................Acts 21:24 Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law.KELLY: Alcorn is completely wrong here. The Jewish Christians in Acts 2 and 4 became the Jewish Christian church seen in Acts 15 and 21 and these texts absolutely must be fully explained by anybody trying to justify tithing as a valid New Covenant doctrine. (1) The Jewish Christians did not \\"naturally gave their tithes to the local church assembly.\\" In Acts 21:24, at the END of Paul's missionary journeys, almost 30 years after Calvary, Jewish Christians were still fanatically observing all of the Mosaic Law. They were offering sacrifices at the Temple and still paying whatever tithes they had to the Temple - otherwise they would not have been allowed to worship inside it! (2) Since the food tithe only belonged to the Levites, then the Jewish Christians would have only given it to the Levites! (3) Acts 2 and 4 are not examples of tithing; rather, they are examples of free-will giving.ALCORN: There is no indication the early church ever retreated from the concept that the tithe was the basic minimum to be given to the Lord. [8th repetition]KELLY: The opposite is true. Every indication points to extreme asceticism, not tithing, as the practice of the earliest church. Respectable church historians from many denominations agree that the earliest church leaders all worked for their livelihood.

Men as well as women can profit from Dr. Ashley's distillation of wisdom gained through life experience. The author likes acronyms, and BITCH stands for Being In Total Control Of Herself. This may sound like a denial of spiritual influences. It isn't. It is an assertion that within this energy-field called the universe, earth, and us, it is our job to develop the potential of our personality in this incarnation, and to take responsibility for htis self. Vikki gives us specific keys for doing just that. Dr. Ashley wears many hats, including a beautiful red one on the cover of her book! As the oldest of 12 children, she developed multiple skills at an early age. She is now a psychologist, entrepreneur, musician, and coach to executives and managers. She has been a university executive and adjunct professor, a program developer and politician, as well as a single mother. She believes that the glue that holds us all together is communication, and she practices what she preaches. I shared her San Francisco opeing with her, and found her a loving, delightful person. Vikki's book is sprinkled wtih autobiographical vignettes. It begins with the gripping story of her intercession for compassionate care for her son as he was wasting away of AIDS. Alan recovered, and had three more years of quality living. She writes of that experience: &quot;Love is the only thing. Love of self that brings self-esteemand the courage to do what you think is right in spite of everyone and everything...And a tough kind of love that allows others to be where they are, whether I agree or not, so that there is no hate, only allowing.&quot; Vikki covers everything you need to know to grow yourself. She arranges her book in twelve chapters, and each chapter subtly includes a sign of the zodiac. (Vikki is an astrologer also.) Chapter 1, for instance, is about self-discovery (Aires) and Chapter 2 is entitledI Have What It Takes!(Taurus). Chapter 12(Pices) is called Holding the Hand of God! Vikki offers many helpful and inspirational quotes throughout her book. In Chapter 12 she says, &quot;Self-acceptance is Self-realization. Now that I know who I am, I no longer worry about what being on this earth is all about. I know I am a spirit having an earthly experience!...designed for my soul to come to an understanding of its powers for use in moving toward integration and unity with the Universe and for me to come to an understanding that all is Mind and all is One...Energy and consciousness do indeed create the nature of reality.&quot; This is a rich book, packed with information, guidelines, and sharing about the nature of being human. Vikki's honesty about her own life lends drama, poignancy, and personality to her message. The lessons which she is passing on become very real as she tells us how she learned them for herself.(This article originally appeared in Daykeeper Journal of Consciousness, Volume 2, Issue 1, May/June 1999, page 14, reviewed by Maya del Mar."},{"Title":"How to Be a Bitch With Style: Being in Total Control of Herself","review":"In late summer of 1998, the 150th anniversary of women's rights was celebrated at Seneca Falls, New York. During the last century and a half, women gained the right to vote, to own land and work in professions that were formerly open solely to men. While great strides have been made, glaring inequities between the sexes still abound in the workplaces, courtrooms, schools and homes of our society. These differences are so deeply ingrained that upon close examination maybe we haven't come such a long way, baby, after all. For instance, most everyone has noticed that when a man speaks his mind frankly and doggedly pursues his goals he is admirably assertive; when a woman does so, she is a ruthless bitch. Attitudes like this don't seem to be going away any time soon, but rather persist despite the efforts of many people. In such a climate, the prospect of surviving and thriving optimally feels bleak to most of us. What's a woman to do? In her ground breaking workHow to Be a Bitch* with StyleDr. Vikki Ashley provides not only creative answers to this question, but also many in-depth strategies for transformative action. Subtitled \\"*Being in Total Control of Herself\\", the material she provides in the book extends far beyond the now dime-a-dozen assertiveness training manuals which focus mainly on the conscious use of language. What she has written is nothing less than an exciting and inspiring autobiographical spiritual odyssey as well as a compendium of valuable metaphysical information and tools for self awareness and metamorphosis. The format of \\"Bitch with Style\\" is twelve chapters which, unlike the familiar 12-step recovery programs, introduce us to an innovative12-step discovery process based in the ancient astrological principles of Being: I am; I have; I think; I feel; I create; I choose; We are; I desire; I seek; I build: I see; I know; the exploration and integration of which leads to \\"therefore I am\\". Dr. Ashley's style is at once street savvy and sophisticated. Each segment contains an illustrative anecdote from her life which reveals how she has effectively applied these seemingly lofty principles and practices in times of failure and success, pain and joy, tragedy and ecstasy. In addition, this well researched book contains a Bitch's Book Bag, an informative toolkit to help us along as we join her on this meaningful and magical journey toward authentic Selfhood, incorporating the mundane and mystical as we create our realities. The good news is that when all is said and done, How to Be a Bitch with Style is ultimately not for women only, but rather for all of us who sincerely desire to enhance our own lives and that of others. I highly recommend this book and feel that it will be among the finest offerings of inspirational literature in the year 1999.(This review originally appeared in the journal &quot;silent messages&quot;.)"},{"Title":"Granny Was a Buffer Girl","review":"Jess is going away, but not without knowing all the familys ghost stories, love stories, and secrets.

Patterson was Shevlin's surrogate father, and he was a peaceful man that didn't believe in violence. Shevlin knows that things don't add up when he hears that Eli was killed fair and square in a gunfight. Shevlin also discovers that dishonest local mine managers are stealing high-grade ore from the out-of-state owners. One of these offsite owners is Laine Tennison, who asks Shevlin for help. Most of the town, including Shevlin's old friend, is in on the scheme. There is also a war between cattlemen and the miners over land preservation.This is a second string Louis L'Amour Western novel. The familiar hallmarks that distinguish his best writing are absent. The typical emphasis on the freedom of the big sky country is lacking, and the lure of distant trails is missing. The story gets downright claustrophobic inside the mines. The story is told in the third person form. L'Amour's best work (e.g., the Sacketts series) is told in the first person narrative form. This allows the reader to really get inside the head of the main character. There is some action and suspense, but the plot rather plods along.

However as a complete work it remains unsurpassed in the school of form-critical method, but this also demonstrates the work's age, since source criticism has drawn the attention of scholars in recent decades. It is, however, a work that cannot be ignored; Bultmann's reputation as a scholar and theologian of the finest quality is permanent, and this book is an excellent illustration of why that is."},{"Title":"The History of the Synoptic Tradition","review":"Rudolf Bultmann (1884-1976) was a German theologian and professor of New Testament at the University of Marburg.Although the founder of Form Criticism of the gospels was actually Martin Dibelius (e.g., see hisFrom Tradition to Gospel (Library of Theological Translations), this minutely-detailed 1921 book is the cornerstone of the discipline. It is still of considerable value to even modern, post-Jesus Seminar students of Jesus and the gospels.In the first chapter, Bultmann states, \\"more than anybody else, M. Dibelius ... has subjected the different units in the Gospel tradition to form-critical inquiry. Admittedly, he has not examined the whole content of the Gospel material, but has contented himself with certain types of material essentially narrative, and brilliantly shown how fruitful the method is for discovering the stages in the development of the tradition as well as for the Gospels as a whole. The following investigation therefore sets out to give an account of the history of the individual units of the tradition, and how the tradition passed from a fluid state fo the fixed form in which it meets us in the Synoptics.\\"He states the aim of form criticism as \\"to determine the original form of a piece of narrative, a dominical saying or a parable. In the process we learn to distinguish secondary additions and forms, and these in turn lead to important results for the history of the tradition.\\"His Conclusion is that \\"The collection of the material of the tradition began in the primitive Palestinian Church. Apologetic and polemic led to the collection and production of apophthegmatic (i.e., terse and witty) sections. The demands of edification and the vitality of the prophetic spirit in the Church resulted in the handing on, the production and the collection of prophetic and apocalyptic sayings of the Lord. Further collections of dominical sayings grew out of the need for paranesis (i.e., advice or exhortation) and Church discipline. It is only natural that stories of Jesus should be told and handed down in the Church.\\"Bultmann's exhaustively-precise analysis of the gospels is impossible to summarize in an Amazon review. Interested persons should simply obtain a copy and read for themselves."},{"Title":"The History of the Synoptic Tradition","review":"This was one of the hardest books I've ever read. That's not because Bultmann's arguments are difficult to follow or because a large part of it is written in untranslated Greek. I follow the arguments fine and the Greek is mostly from the NT which I can read easily enough. The book is difficult to read because Bultmann quotes so many verses and if one wants to follow the arguments one will have to look up thousands of verses by the time the book is over - unless, of course, you have virtually the entire Gospel tradition memorized so that the mere mention of, say, Luke 12:21 means something to you.Anyway, I am amazed that anyone could put something together like this. The book must have required immense amount of labor. One cannot help but feel saddened, however, that Bultmann has been so influencial. His works are rife with methodological fallacies and hyper-critical judgments. For a good critique of Bultmann - and one that is also easy to read - I'd recommend Bauckham's book, \\"The Gospel for all Christians\\" which seriously criticizes the whole form critical notion that scholars are able to determine - with any useful degree of accuracy - the Sitz im Leben of the Gospel traditions. For the serious students I'd also recommend Sanders' book \\"Tendencies of the Synoptic Tradition\\", which is a thoroughgoing critique of Bultmann but is, unfortunately, even more tedious and agonizing to read than Bultmann's book. For a good study on methodology that will address many of the conclusions Bultmann reaches in his \\"History\\", I'd further recommend, \\"New Testament Interpretation\\" by I.H. Marshall. It's a little old but still helpful."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Mernissi's book is a refreshing departure from the usual stories out of the Muslim world.

This aside, Mernissi does not attack any religious institution in her book. She simply writes of her own mental progression, and the diverse influences on that progression throughout her youth. Do not read this book expecting political fireworks or a grand emotional saga. If those styles seem better suited for you, I recommend Savushun. This novel is a much gentler, more subtle investigation of the culture through the eyes of a young girl who is trying to make sense of her world. I find the innocence of this novel very endearing, and feel that the understated messages make this book a more powerful read than most memoirs.

The book tells of her life growing up in her father's home. It describes the richness of her life, living among an extended family of cousins, aunts and sisters. It tells of nights of communal story telling and play acting, of special outings like going to the public baths and the movies and life in the country side. The men in the book have no names but the women are richly described with their many interests and backgrounds. What makes this book interesting and different is that it is told from the point of view of a 10 year old girl rather than an adult looking back on her childhood. Therefore the book is full of wonder as she is seeking to describe life, trying to figure out what life is about and seeking to define the concept of harem. She discovers that a harem in the city means being locked inside a very large house with a guard on the door and having to seek permission of the men of the house before a woman is permitted to leave, however in the countryside, harem means something much different.

Fatima takes the readers through her confusing life of trying to please her father by obeying tradition, and trying to please her mother by modernizing.

So emic, so true, so feminine. Through the simple stories of her life as a child, Mernissi shows us the falseness of Western stereotypes and the tragedy of Islamic sexism. She shows us what a true harem is- the pure companionship of women, and not the sexual lasciviousness which the Western imagination dreamed up in it\`s ideal of the exotic- in the process revealing far more the degradation of Western society than they anything true of Arabic culture. But she writes with great honesty about her own people as well, and the control that a woman is constantly placed under, perceived as the \\"devouring vagina\\" (as she writes in another work,Beyond the Veil), needing to be controlled and put into it's place for the protection of men. One sees here, not through telling, but through story, how Moroccan women have so little freedom to be who they desire in a world where all that is public is also male. But we also see the beauty of women together in that same society, and through that, can dream."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Dreams of Trespass is a wonderfully written novel about a young girl growing up inside a harem.

Since it took the view of a child it was an easy book to read. As a child, Fatima struggles growing up. Her father is strictly traditional and her mother is open for change and wants her children to have opportunities that she never had. Before reading this book, I did not know what a Harem was. Now that I have read this book I have a better view on what it might be like to grow up in a Morrocan Harem."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"I couldn't help but fall asleep whilst reading this book. I only was able to go through about a little over a half, mostly because I was required to read it. Generally, the book is about a middle eastern girl living in a Harem and surrounded by the conflicting Western Power, the French Army. Lots of battles with tradition and western cultures, and primarily about the rift between men and women. So you're in for a subtle yet quite obvious gender conflict, which was in my opinion awfully sexist (I know it's from the view of a woman but that doesn't take away from the fact that she explicitly tries to write as if she were a child again with \\"innocence\\" yet fails because of her mature agenda). The author, Mernissi, spends about 10-15 pages per chapter driveling on about the most useless facts or coincidences. Just when you think she's reaching her point and finally bear fruit, it's the start of a new chapter and another take on a topic or segment of her life that is completely irrelevant."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"once again, mernissi has used the literary forum to vent her personal venom against her faith. As a reader searching for actual scholarly or literary value, I find her books an absolute abomination. A &quot;bayt arabi&quot; (arab-style house with a courtyard in the middle) is not a haram, nor is the extended family setting Mernissi describes. At least not in most households. But an account of life in a &quot;haram&quot; is sure to sell. I've travelled widely throughout the middle east and have spoken to countless women, in seclusion and privacy, learning their language in order to gain their trust, and rarely have I encountered the kind of frustration Mernissi depicts in this, or any of her books."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"i was surprised to find only one unfavorable view on this book.. i found it's ornate diction along with its detailed descriptions and banal subjects most suffocating and tedious to read. and i was disappointed that she made Islam such a big part of the book.. it's clear her frustrations are merely an image of her mother's.. and those are just fantasies of wanting to be like the others.. if she was to speak about islam.. she should have mentioned islam was the first to give women political and social rights.. and the women that are veiled today are the true hardcore feminists.. the book really disgusts me.. she is a pseudo feminist.. if she wants to rebel.. why not do it against her culture and her dress.. she enjoys her lavish abode.. spends countless hours on beauty (and a million pages it seems).. it's no wonder she wants to go out and flaunt it.. i thought the book sucked.."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"The struggles of a girl's life in Harlem brings together the major ideas of this book together. In the book Dreams of Trespass a girl tries to understand her place in society, but doesn't want to accept what might lay ahead in her life. As generations go by women want more out of their life and ultimately want to be considered equal with men. Unfortunately not only Men stand in their way, older women are content sticking to the old traditions and it was hard to even explain why they would want a life out of Harlem. The plot in this book in nearly non-existent, the book itself is merely a description of life experiences that will shape a young girls life later life. Untimately I didn't realy like this book because its lack of plot. I was hoping for more of a continuing story, but this book is a series of stories. The author does a good job in blending these stories together, but this is not the kind of book that I would normally ever like."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Mernissi brilliantly tells her story through her own eyes as a small child. She describes a world few people have ever seen and gives a voice to the countless powerless women who were kept prisoners in a man's world. It proves that female intelligence, emotion and creativity are universal, that even if you lock someone up like an animal and deny them education, you cannot change human nature."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"One of the most misunderstood aspects of Arab life is the harem. Long viewed by the West simply as a place of sensual abandon, promiscuity, and overall languor, the harem has suffered denigration and misrepresentation based largely on supposition alone. With her semiautobiographical Dreams of Trespass, author Fatima Mernissi subverts this Orientalist viewpoint by providing a much more accurate portrayal of harem life through the eyes of a nine-year old resident. This female narrator, also named Fatima, relates her life and the events of her world in an innocent fashion, yet her voice is wizened with an insight that bespeaks her burgeoning understanding of patriarchy.As she gains acumen into the familial structure of the harem, Fatima is plagued with confusion on both personal and political levels. She is, after all, a young girl, content with the games, laughter and trappings of childhood; yet she is also growing up in a highly sheltered world dominated by men, and this emerging reality constantly penetrates her thoughts. It is through this unique lens that the reader is invited to understand Fatima's struggle between boundary and freedom, and the distinct ways in which both are found within the harem.Young Fatima's world, restricted largely to her harem compound, is beset with boundaries - both physical and implied - and to that end, the book is rife with metaphor, as well as visually rich descriptions of Fatima's home. Her scope of life is widening with age and insight, and she begins to understand all the ways in which the home and family life she loves is indicative of a restriction she cannot name. Instead, she resorts to naming those things with which she is familiar. Often she sits on the threshold of the harem's courtyard and observes her world, describing the appointments of the harem and ultimately coming to a confused conclusion that there does, indeed, exist a freedom that remains tantalizing but intangible. And in a child's manner, Fatima discovers the cracks in her patriarchal home life, teasing into the slippages and winnowing out the ways in which she can maintain a loyalty to her family, yet grow into independence as an Arab woman.I appreciate not only the succinct way in which Mernissi begs social change from especially her female readers, but also the book's rich visuals, portrayed with photography and painted textually with Fatima's voice. The Moroccan art and architectural patterns that pervade the book also serve as a grounding point for Fatima - a touchstone, a way in which she can remain secure through the things she knows, as she senses the changing world outside the harem. I believe this type of grounding is a way in which all women firmly grasp their place in their respective societies, and I applaud the skillful and affirming way in which Mernissi weaves together this global unity.I found this to be a beautifully compelling and insightful novel that offers a unique perspective into the realities of harem life. Mernissi's clever talent is apparent in using the young voice of Fatima to address not only the problematic position of Arab women in a patriarchal culture, but through the wide array of distinctive female voices in the book, Mernissi speaks to all women."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Though the book jacket and title suggest this is an exotic and lurid look into the hot, steamy and abusive world of Middle Eastern brothel life it is actually a humane portrait of familial relations within the confines of a harem (quite different than its reputation would suggest) and how they operate under foreign occupation. Fatima Mernissi understands the misconceptions about female domesticity-within Morocco specifically and the Middle East in general-and proceeds to cordially deconstruct and undermine western stereotypes at book's length. From the affectionate father that attempts to accommodate Mernissi's mother while both suffer under the constraints of patriarchy (a problem not uniquely Middle Eastern) to the private feminine community behind harem walls to the varied interaction with popular culture both local and foreign, this book doesn't offer pat indictments of anything, but, in a way that mirrors the harem, creates a space in which discourse can operate. The Harem is partly presented as a sacred space, one in which the Western gaze of the colonizer and the general gaze of the male cannot penetrate at will. Despite notions to the contrary, the activity that takes place behind these walls can be read as feminist and in some cases radical. Thus, Mernissi is a feminist, but one that works within the context of Islam, endlessly reconstructing traditional patriarchal interpretations of the scripture with those women can assert agency in. Like many Arab Women Writers she walks a tricky line between humanistic portraits of brethren that combat Orientalist stereotypes while also, as per James Baldwin's phrasing, putting her people's business on the street. Her mother, deprived of formal education but smart as a whip, provides deep-seated ire at her status as a woman, but the book isn't a stark and depressing, black and white reduction of everything to her situation. Like all good literature, it's complicated. The book is rich, too, in non-western literary and cultural tradition as well, from Sheherezade to Om Khoultoum, showing that binaries between Western \\"civilization\\" and Eastern \\"primitivism\\" are false and destructively counterintuitive. Worth a look!"},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"The author describes the every day life in a family in this culture. I found it very interesting and entertaining. This is another view of the stories of harems that we hear all the time."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Dreams of Trespass is an interesting insiders view into the life of the author, Fatima Mernissi, growing up in a 1940s Morocco harem. (Harem, in this case, referring to the extended family within the walls her family's home.) Mernissi is a skillful writer who effectively draws the reader into her story. Along with Mernissi, the reader learns about the role of women in the harem and the boundaries which hold them there. Throughout the story are mixed in jewels of wisdom told to Mernissi by her mother and other female relatives through stories, plays, and discussions, about the importance of thinking for herself and not letting anyone else control her life.However, this is not a particularly exciting read. The story does not really follow a plot line, but simply moves through Mernissi's childhood and stops rather abruptly around the time of her reaching adolescence.Overall, I would recommend this book as I found it entertaining, and connected with the ideas presented by Mernissi on following your own path and being who you want to be."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Mernissi's memoir is of her childhood in an affluent, traditional Moroccan household in the 1940s, when the country was largely dominated by the French, with one enclave in the north under Spanish control. I've used it to teach on issues of modern imperialism to undergrads for a few years now, and it's one of the best resources I've encountered for that topic.Mernissi's memoir documents a world in rapid flux. Morocco had been forced open to French hegemony barely two generations earlier, ushuring in deep social changes in part based on foreign models and aspirations: (affluent)women driving their own cars, dressing in European ways, moving about unsupervised by men, and serving as a \\"bad examples\\" to others. Young men educated in French-style schools, speaking fluent French; not to ape European ways, but for acquisition of European technical knowledge as part of the liberation struggle. One wife of Mernissi's grandfather who as a young woman abandoned a traditional life to engage in the armed struggle against the French and Spanish during the Rif War of the 1920s. The structure of traditional family life under stress as some Moroccans opt for the model of the nuclear family pionnered by the Dutch bourgeoisie in the 17th century, verses the multi-generational extended family that typified family life in nearly all societies until the advent of modern capitalism and its social forms. Meanwhile, the great imperial power, the French, are a humiliated nation under German occupation, their weaknesses now exposed to subject peoples. There are few other biographies that make these great historical themes of the modern world come so alive in such quotidian and human ways as does this little book. Mernissi's sympathies clearly lie with her mother's frustrations against the restraints of traditional Moroccan family life, particularly as these traditions are defended by her paternal grandmother. But there is nuance here, and Mernissi treats all parties to these struggles in her family with love and respect. This book would not be half as good as it is if she did otherwise.The fact that Mernissi has written this memoir from a little girl's perspective makes it all the more immediate and readable. It's an enjoyable read in its own terms, without reference to the world-historical dramas I contextualize it in for use with my students. I recommend to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"I read this after returning from Morocco. The insight into what life used to be like for most women enriched my understanding of the culture which I found fascinating. I'd spoken with several women while in the country who are \\"liberated\\" but heard none of the story of the lives of women who adhere to the old traditions. I saw many others who still live behind closed walls. This is the story of the latter group's growing up years that I couldn't have gotten otherwise."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"In 1940, harems still abounded in Fez, Morocco. They weren't the opulent, bejeweled harems of Scherezade, but the domestic sprawl of extended families encamped around a walled courtyard that marked the edges of women's lives. Though born into this tightly sheltered world, Fatimi Mernissi is constantly urged by her rebellious mother to spring beyond it. Worried that Mernissi is too shy and quiet, her mother tells her, \\"You must learn to scream and protest, just the way you learned to walk and talk.\\" In Dreams of Trespass, an enjoyable weave of memory and fantasy, it is clear that Mernissi's fertile imagination let her slip back and forth through the gates that trapped her restive mother. She spins amiable, often improbable tales of the rigidly proper city harem in Fez and the contrasting freedoms of the country harem where her grandmother Yakima lives. There, one of Yakima's cowives rides like the wind, another swims like a fish, and Yakima relishes twitting the humorless first wife by naming a fat, waddling duck after her.From Publishers WeeklyThis rich, magical and absorbing growing-up tale set in a little-known culture reflects many universals about women. The setting is a \\"domestic harem\\"in the 1940s city of Fez, where an extended family arrangement keeps the women mostly apart from society, as opposed to the more stereotypical \\"imperial harem,\\" which historically provided sex for sultans and other powerful court officials. Moroccan sociologist Mernissi ( Islam and Democracy ) charts the changing social and political frontiers and limns the personalities and quirks of her world. Here she tells of a grandmother who warns that the world is unfair to women, learns of the confusing WW II via radio news in Arabic and French, watches family members debate what children should hear, wonders why American soldiers' skin doesn't reflect Moroccan-style racial mixing and decides that sensuality must be a part of women's liberation. With much folk wisdom--happiness, the author's mother told her, \\"was when there was a balance between what you gave and what you took\\"--this book not only tells a winning personal story but also helps to feminize a much-stereotyped religion.

I expected the exoticized harem of one sheik with many wives that we hear about in the movies and in literature. However, this discussion of a real harem without all the exotic trappings shows Mernissi's family life and her experiences growing up while finding her place in the world. It is a story of family, but also Mernissi's own feminist story of breaking through the patriarchal walls and gaining a higher education and social standing despite tradition. Telling the story from the perspective of a female child coming of age shows the reader how far Mernissi came from her childhood locked within the walls of the harem. Mernissi's mothers, aunts, and cousins, while not able to escape the harem themselves, plant the seeds within Mernissi that allow her to find her own path in the world outside the harem."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"This book was very entertaining and informative.

Most Westerners take the word harem and think Turkish harem - hundreds of women floating around large tiled rooms waiting to serve the lord and master. Mernissi, a western schooled sociologist, feminist, and scholar, takes us into the life of a young girl born into a family in Fez (in Western Morocco) in the 1940's. Her harem is not the rooms of I-Dream-of-Jeannie look-alikes but rather the complex social structures of the Moroccan/Muslim family in the middle of this century. Her harem is the world of women, daughters, mothers, aunts, and grandmothers who live 'inside' the urban home (but interestingly, live more freely out on the country farm). We learn about the feelings she and her brother (with whom she is close) experience when they come of an age to be separated; he relegated to the world of the men, and she to the hidden world of the harem. Mostly, though, this beautiful book tells the stories of the women in Fatima's harem who have dreams and fantasies (that will never come true), including the dreams of trespass into the outside world, the world of men. After having worked in Morocco in the early 1990s, I could see that much has changed for Moroccan women, but thoughout the Arab world there still exist plenty who still have those dreams of trespass."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Subtitled, &quot;Tales of a Harem Girlhood,&quot; this is the story of the author, Fatima Mernissi's Moroccan childhood in the 1940s. Now a sociologist at the University Mohammed V in Rabat, Morocco, she has skillfully recreated the sense of wonder and observation of a child. Her own father had only one wife, but she lived in an extended family with an aunt, uncle, cousins, divorced female relatives, and even some women who had once been slaves and who no had nowhere else to go. The term &quot;harem&quot; as she uses it, means the seclusion of women. Her mother, who was illiterate, dreamed moving beyond the walls, but did not even have the privilege of simply walking down the street as western women do. Instead, she rebelled by embroidering birds of flight and encouraged her daughter to get an education. The household was lively, and I felt myself drawn right in, getting to know each person through Ms. Mernissi's eyes. I was treated to their storytelling and home theatrical productions; I observed them sneaking up to the roof to get a bit of privacy; I understood why the act of chewing gum was considered a rebellion; I left the walled compound in the city with her when she visited her maternal grandmother who lived on a farm, one of eight co-wives, who gets to &quot;cuddle&quot; with her husband only one out of eight days.As I'm about the same age as the author, I couldn't help thinking about my life and how much I took for granted in my own childhood - such as the simple act of walking down the street and being exposed to the outside world through newspapers, radio and television. This book provided a magnificent glimpse into a world that seems as strange to me as mine would have seemed to her. And it certainly opened my eyes. At only 242 pages, &quot;Dreams of Trespass&quot; was much too short. I could have gone one reading and reading. And my only criticism is that it was only about her childhood. I wished it would have gone on and described the next fifty years.

I just watched an interview a few weeks ago and the gentleman interviewer smiled from ear to ear when his guest (a female professor) mentioned the word. I guess I was lucky to have visited a harem in Berrechid, Morocco over a decade ago and got the true story of its cultural evolution over time. Well there were pashas at one time and they did have several wives, but today it is the tales about them that feed our curiosity. Although these stories are not as Romantic as we may like, they still feed the imagination in a remarkable way. This book is simply wonderful in its direct and simple approach to a cultural phenomena that is still evolving, and Mernissi is helping that evolution to occur. It is above all her way of telling old stories that can tame the Shahriyar's in all of us. How could you not fall in love with Chama? Mernissi writes with deep feeling and compassionate understanding for the Morocco that all Westerner's should know but so rarely get a chance to experience. In her writing she takes you behind the hijab and the 40's harem wall to meet with people who have so much to teach us about limits, boundaries, and breaking out. But breaking out means knowing the rules (qa'ida, read 62-3). I think that the lesson is in learning 'how to know.' Not just knowing the rules as they are but in knowing 'how' they exist.Mernissi explains all uncommon and new words to readers by way of interesting footnotes that are valuable even for people who are familiar with Moroccan societies. That helps the reader again to know 'how' the rules of the harem exist.More than anything I am attracted to her descriptions of the beautiful people that live in her memories. Though some may see this book as just anthropology, socoiology, or even feminism, I think it is actually a book about the human capacity for compassion and love. In fact when I go back through the book I see it everywhere in Asmahan's \\"Ahwa!\\" (I am in love) and even in such names as Aunt Habiba (root habib=friend, companion). Even when she writes about Christians or Jews it is always with a comical kind of curiosity never malicious or spiteful, just enough to make you smile. She brings the outside in. This is a dream book, one you can enjoy in your own interior harem, or if you prefer Castillo Interior (Santa Teresa's \\"interior castle\\")."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"I found this book to be entertaining, educational, inspirational and thought provoking all at once. I personally and Americans in general are largely confused and misinformed about the concept of the harem and how the women in them lived; and it is no wonder or surprise that we are! It seems that even within the high walls and locked gates of the harem the residents cannot agree on the subject! What is a harem? Is it a den of iniquity? A commune? A brothel? A prison? An extended family? A refuge?Told from the perspective of a 6-9 year old girl growing up in a domestic harem in Morocco in the late 1940s, this book has a freshness and naivet&eacute; that only a child can muster as she ponders her place in her home, society, and the world at large.Her observations of the world around her are uncensored, and guide the reader to a greater understanding not only of other cultures and other women, but of our relationships and ourselves. Only a child has the innocent courage to stand up and say, \\"The Emperor has no clothes!\\"As I learned about another world, I began also to draw parallels to may own life and current times. Changing laws does not grant freedom to individuals. Here in America we have all the freedoms that these women were deprived of and fought for, and yet in many cases we remain trapped- prisoners of our fears, our habits, our insecurities, and our weaknesses.In this book I found lots of hope and inspiration, reminding me of many ways to experience freedom inwardly- without the necessity of changing outward circumstances.2006 Shahina"},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"It is really difficult for Americans to comprehend a culture as different as traditional Moroccan culture. In particular, the lot of women, confined in domestic harems and obliged to submit to male rules, seems intolerable. This lovely book gives a portrait of one Moroccan family living in a tradtional way. Or are they? Rebellious ideas abound, and women find ways of stretching restriction. The stories are beautifully human and funny. It is easy to be critical of another culture that seems so different, and I would never be able to live that way. But I feel that I have a better understanding of how they did. I sent a copy of this book to my mother."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Please read the review,Reviewed by Karen Henry------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Karen Henry is an Arab-American free-lance writer and lecturer from Michigan.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------She knew how to talk in the night. With words alone, she could put us onto a large ship sailing from Aden to the Maldives, or take us to an island where the birds spoke like human beings. [We] traveled so far that no gods were to be found, only sun-and-fire worshippers, but even they seemed friendly and endearing when introduced by Aunt Habiba. Her tales made me long to become an adult and an expert storyteller myself. I wanted to learn how to talk in the night. (page 19)We enter each chapter of Dreams of Trespass through an exquisite photograph and are held there by the magic of Fatima Mernissi's words, proving that she has indeed become an expert storyteller. Mernissi's memoir about her childhood in an urban domestic harem in Fez in the late 1940s recounts the life experiences of her female relatives and her own reactions to the world around her. The book demystifies the harem and puts a face on Arab Muslim women in a personal and highly entertaining manner, exploring the nature of women's power, the value of oral tradition, and the absolute necessity of dreams and celebrations.The comfort of tradition is recognized and celebrated while women's advances and past accomplishments also are applauded. The strong women characters-mother, grandmothers, aunts, cousins-have different responses to and methods for coping with restricted life in a harem. Fatima's mother celebrated her daughter's birth with the same level of enthusiasm usually reserved for boy babies; she claimed male superiority was nonsense and anti-Muslim. The nationalists' struggle against French rule and for gender equality gave strength to the women's occasional acts of rebellion. The intimacy of harem life allowed eight-year-old Fatima to observe and to participate as well as to question endlessly in order to understand what was happening in changing Morocco.Her grandmother Yasima, although also part of a harem, lived on a farm where the women had access to the outdoors. She grew plants and rode horses, redesigned her clothing for more freedom of movement and told Fatima that the days were near when men would have only one wife and women would be equally educated. As the men held on to tradition, with the support of some of the women, most women argued for equality and change and found ways to express their desires. For example, cousin Chama and Aunt Habiba staged elaborate plays celebrating famous women's lives with all the women and children of the harem (and occasionally the young men) participating as members of the production or members of the audience. These plays helped Fatima decide that singing, dancing and sensuality were part of the feminists' lives and should not be forgotten; sensuality is a refreshingly natural part of life throughout the book.In Dreams of Trespass we glimpse a world of Arab women struggling to maintain some aspects of tradition while emerging into a modern and freer world. As the women identify the nature and limitations of their power and the opportunities for change, they do not abandon their dreams. Mernissi tells us on page one that the women dreamed of trespassing all the time and that the world beyond the gate was their goal. But how they got to that world was an important part of achieving their goals: Confronting Ahmed (the gatekeeper) at the gate was a heroic act. Escaping from the terrace was not, and did not carry with it that inspiring, subversive flame of liberation. (page 60)The power of the oral tradition, a tradition very important to the Arabs, is manifest in this book as it opens worlds, creates variety, provides sensuality and inspiration. Fatima's Aunt Habiba, who could take her listeners all over the world, says: When you happen to be trapped powerless behind walls, stuck in a dead-end harem, you dream of escape. And magic flourishes when you spell out that dream and make the frontiers vanish. Dreams can change your life, and eventually the world. Liberation starts with images dancing in your little head, and you can translate those images into words. And words cost nothing. (page 113.)Magic flourished throughout this book as it educated and entertained us. It is wonderfully written and has the power to open Western eyes to a world often objectified and trivialized. In the process, it creates a new appreciation and understanding for the varied lives of Arab women."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"I had to read this book for class and I found this book to be easy to follow and interesting. It was interesting because it discussed what life was like in a harem. The book was written from a child's perspective, which made it more personal. The book provides a lot of information on harem life that the reader does not even realize they are being taught while enjoying the story. I also thought the title was good because it describes how the women of the harem are dreaming of the outside world and what is beyond the walls. I thought Fatima Mernissi did a good job describing harem life and I would recommend reading the book for those interested in harem life, Moroccan women, or for enjoyment."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"This was a great, easy reading book that many people could really use as a tool for learning about a different culture. In this book, Fatima tells us about her life as a child growing up in a Harem, and the trials and tribulations that go along with that. Throughout the story, one of the major themes that is asked over and over is what is a Harem? Is it a place with four walls like the Harem she lived in? Or is it like her grandmother's Harem which is out in the country with no walls, only open fields. Fatima's mother's role is crutial in this book because her mother is so against everything that has to do with the Harem. She wants her two daughters to grow up and have every opportunity they can in life, unlike the lack of opportinities her mother had. To do this, Fatima's mother dresses the girls in western style dress with frills and lace. Fatima's father does not seem to say much when his wife does this, unless it is a holiday, then the girls are expected to be in traditional attire. The book itself was great and I would highly recomend it! The details Fatima Marnissi uses in describing the women's lives is fantastic, as is her point of view that this is being told by a child. Any age that is studying this area, or time period in history would enjoy this book as did I!"},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"This is a tale of a young girl born in a haran in Morocco in the 1940's and the struggle she and other Moslem women faced. Fatimi Mernissi was a shy girl born into a world she was sheltered from. She is restricted by the Moslem culture, but uses her imagination to escape beyond the boundaries of the courtyard to see the outside world. She is encouraged by her mother and relatives to fight for women's rights and she tells of the lessons she has learned. I think that this is a great book. Very interesting and easy to read. If you have the time, it could be read at one sitting."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"I would have given this book a 10, but subtracted a point because of the title. I agree with Kirkus' review (below) which suggests a more appropriate title, _The Making of a Muslim Feminist_. The present subtitle, _Tales of a Harem Girlhood_, is not only sensational and provocative, but detracts from the real subject matter of the book. Yes, the book does contain tales of a harem girlhood in a sense, but more importantly it provides a rich, eloquently told description of a culture in which women were (and still are) held back from achieving their potential because of prejudice, ignorance, and blind obedience to a dysfunctional cultural tradition. I find this book to be an enlightening account of the life of an intelligent, courageous woman for whom I have the utmost respect and admiration. After first reading _The Veil and the Male Elite_, what Mernissi has to say in _Dreams of Trespass_ provides insight into some of the events and perceptions of her early life that helped shape who she is today. I highly recommend this book, but would urge readers to first read some of her non-autobiographical works (then you can more fully appreciate her autobiography)."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"Fatima Mernissi did a great job writing this book.

Mernissi transports the reader to 1940's Morocco with her frank tales of childhood. Colorful vignettes and reminiscences tell the story of her youth and underscore the restrictive lives of harem women She tells of the methods women used to entertain themselves and each other in a world that allowed women to participate in few activities outside of the harem. Dreams of Trespass emphasizes the solidarity that occurred between the women that were so closely confined. Mernissi's numerous references and footnotes lend authenticity to her memoirs and tempt readers to further study.The vast differences between city and country harem life are particularly interesting, as the country harem in which her Grandmother, Yasmine, lives is much less restrictive than the harem in which she lives in the city. In the country, the harem is more a state of mind, as the women have free run of the surrounding countryside. The harem in which the author lives restricts the women of the family to the home. The gatekeeper will not allow any woman or child to leave the home unless an adult male family member has granted permission.The similarities between harem life and that of African slaves living on plantations in pre-civil war America was striking. Certainly there are many differences, for example, harem women were generally affluent and often had servants and slaves of their own to wait upon them while plantation slaves often had few resources to call their own. Both groups were totally dependent upon others for their upkeep and were not allowed to make decisions. Neither group had a sense of autonomy, because the freedoms experienced by both groups were dependent upon the will of their masters, husbands and fathers in the harem, owners and overseers on plantations.Mernissi's description of the possession dance that Mina participated in has its roots in Ghana and is reminiscent of the stories of slave celebrations in the United States. As Mernissi states on page 161 in a description of the women's behavior at the possession dance,\\" It was as if the women had freed themselves for once of all external pressures\\". I can't help but wonder if the slaves weren't feeling the same sense of release when participating in their own celebrations.The same sense of camaraderie experienced in harems may well have been felt by slaves in their own restricted societies. Harems had their own rules of social order, as did those in slave's quarters on plantations. Hierarchy was determined primarily by age in both cultures. Stories, plays and other forms of entertainment were methods used to experience the freedoms that were forbidden. Perhaps the subjugation of people generates a desire for entertainment that includes the independence that they lack.The progressive feminism that existed in the harem was surprising in that the women were so very cloistered. They were allowed no radio or other means of information unless they had first secured permission from one of the men and yet they had a real sense of how little freedom they had and just how much of the world they were missing. Throughout this book, runs a thread of dissatisfaction and a desire for more education, opportunities and experiences.The methods used to rebel against suppression were almost comical. They smoked forbidden cigarettes and chewed outlawed gum and designed embroidery that did not fit the accepted rules of tradition. The women were very aware of how limited their freedoms were. \\"Running around the planet is what makes the brain race, and to put our brains to sleep is the idea behind the locks and the walls... the whole crusade against chewing gum and American cigarettes was in fact a crusade against women's rights as well...but men opposed them because they gave women opportunities to make decisions on their own, decisions which were unregulated by either tradition or authority\\" (Mernissi, p.186-187).It is apparent that the same tactics were used against the American slaves. Keep them ignorant, allow no decision-making and they will not cause trouble seemed to be the prevalent attitude on plantations. But no one figured out a way to prevent dreams, in the harem or on the plantations. And dreams of freedom were common and necessary in both societies."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"We all have preconcieved notions of the Middle East and the idea of harems. This book, written by someone who should know, will dissipate any stereotypes the reader may have about harem life. By wrestling with the definition of a harem throughout her childhood and her narrative Mernissi is able to reveal to western readers who are unexperienced and often unknowledgeable about harem life the truths and untruths envolved with being raised in a non-western society. A real eye opening read for anyone seeking knowledge about a society all too foriegn to us."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"This was a good look at life on the other side of the world.

The only problem I had with the book is that it glossed over a serious issue. The author sacrificed credibility for readability."},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"This is a great book that describes a world that is foreign both to nonMuslims and the vast majority of Muslims. The book describes a world where females are shut out from the world, locked in a house, unable to live a normal life. Many of the women are starved for affection as a result of having to share their husband with other women. The story of women deprived of the things that should be normal, everyday life (monogamous marriages, jobs, schooling, shopping, charity work, interacting with men), who retreat to fantasy worlds is truly depressing reading. One reviewer described this as \\"Islamic culture\\", which it most definitely is not. The seclusion of women is a preIslamic cultural practice that has no basis is Islamic teachings. Unfortunately Mernissi leaves the impression that this is common behavior in the Muslim world. 99% of Muslim men are monogamous and many Muslim women live lives not much different from those of western women. In the most populous Muslim nations such as Indonesia, Bangladesh, India etc. this kind of lifestyle is nonexistent. Men and women are not separated in daily life and mongamy is the norm. Men who practice polygamy for any other reason other than for the purpose of caring for orphans are violating Islamic principles, not following them. I'm also troubled to see some Muslims condemning this book. Wake up, take your heads out of the sand and realise that there are many Muslims twisting Islamic teachings to oppress women. Does it matter that Islam gave women lots of rights if some Muslim men forbid the exercising of those rights?"},{"Title":"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood","review":"The book was great and interesting.

I went through this book with a pen in hand, underlining the names of particular foods mentioned. The author tries to put Indian food in their cultural context, a kind of demystifying of Indian food. She travels across India in her food quest, and provides many snapshots of different regions. She loves eating the food she talks about. Why I didn't give this book 5 stars: the author's language needs, I think, editing: pruning here, working for a more felicitious phrase there. Was it rushed into print? But I think that both neophyte and advanced cooks will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Hedonist's Guide To Beirut 1st Edition (A Hedonist's Guide to...)","review":"As a person who has lived in Beirut for most of my life, I found this book very accurate, straight to the point and reflective of the city's style and character.The book is perhaps one of a few books that looks at this battered nation from a leisure perspective and offers some good news at the time most other books available on the subject limit their literature to political news and regional conflicts.Not only Short takes in his book Beirut to a new perspective, his elegant style further enriches the Hedonistic dimension of the city as it presents an already entertaining city in a decorative, yet simple, language.The book is worth the money. Buy it and you'll find yourself boarding the first flight to Beirut."},{"Title":"Hedonist's Guide To Beirut 1st Edition (A Hedonist's Guide to...)","review":"As another reviewer mentioned, this is one of the few travel guides available for Beirut. Unfortunately, having been published in 2005, it's pretty dated. It also didn't turn out to focus on a significant portion of what I was interested in. Here are a few of the issues that I had.First, as I mentioned, the book is rather dated, having been published in 2005. It's not the writers'/publishers' fault that the statement about cross-border relations betwee Israel and Lebanon having been calm for the last few years - obviously outdated after 2006, and there's a lot more of that when you consider the events that have taken place in and around Lebanon since '05. Recent history, and other events since, obviously play a role in the character of present-day Beirut. This also comes into play when you figure that the book itself states that things change quickly in Beirut, particularly restaurants, hotels, and other aspects of the city that the book is specifically intended to provide guidance for. With respect to restaurants, of the two that I decided to try on a three day trip, one (Brookes in Gemayze) no longer existed; the other (Le Relais de l'Entrecote on Monot Street) was great, but that's still a 50% success rating based on the age of the book.Second, as another reviewer said, the maps aren't spectacular, especially since they basically don't include street names. I have extensive land navigation training and experience, and I've done London, Rome, Paris, Florence, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast, and Dublin, all of them on foot. I found Beirut to be more difficult to navigate than most, and trying to do it with a map that lacks street street names or other terrain features was an unnecessary hassle. The maps were basically worse than the free tourist pamphlet map that I got from the front desk at my hotel.Third, and probably most important, I found that HG2Beirut didn't really focus on what I was interested in seeing and doing in Beirut. Apparently the HG2 series prides itself on catering to a certain type of traveler, so if your travel plans revolve around which restaurants and hotels are the most trendy, then maybe the HG2 series fits you. When I travel, decent restaurants and good hotel recommendations are great, but I would tend to avoid restaurants that describe their food using the word \\"fusion\\" and the whole point of travel is getting out of your hotel room and seeing the location you've traveled to, and this is where HG2Beirut failed me most of all. It has a handful of listings in the book for \\"culture\\" locations, but these listings are mediocre at best, and grossly incomplete. Case in point, I was eager to see the several Roman sites in Beirut, which are part of the city's multicultural and historical heritage - certainly the sort of thing that one would expect high minded people who are interested in fine dining and stylish hotels to be interested in. Of three Roman sites within a ten minute walk of one another near Parliament Square in downtown Beirut, HG2Beirut mentions only two, and if memory serves, only one is on the mediocre map for the downtown area - and that one is only listed as \\"archaeological remains\\". Would it have been that difficult to call it by name (\\"Cardo Maximus\\") and mention its purpose (a Roman market)? And what about the nearby Roman baths and the Roman hippodrome? If you're going to list cultural sites, why would you do such a mediocre job of it? Let's face it: if people were going to Beirut for its French restaurants and art galleries, they'd just go to Paris. People go to cities to see the things that make those cities unique and distinct, and to just gloss over those cultural aspects of the city sort of defeats the point of a travel guide, even if your focus is on the \\"hedonistic\\" aspects of the city. Charge me an extra dollar and give me some information that I can use to really enjoy the intricacies of the city - if you have to, cut a restaurant or hotel out to make space. It's not a difficult concept, and I promise that if someone is that focused on entertaining their senses, they're probably the kind of person who cares about the cultural and historical heritage of the city in question.In closing, I paid $14 for an outdated book that confirmed what I was able to discern about my hotel, led me to one restaurant, gave me a few disposable tidbits of information about Beirut, had a few maps that were occasionally useful in conjunction with a regular street map pamphlet, and added some weight to my satchel while walking around the city. This book may have been adequate when it was published in 2005, but it failed to meet my expectations for a travel guide in 2012. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone going to Beirut, and I wouldn't recommend the HG2 series to anyone I know. I'll be sticking with Lonely Planet and Let's Go! from here on out."},{"Title":"Hedonist's Guide To Beirut 1st Edition (A Hedonist's Guide to...)","review":"This is a useful accompaniment to any trip to Beirut, and at the moment is about the only guidebook available.

She was a woman ahead of her time!"},{"Title":"MAGIC YEARS","review":"I read this book because Holly Van Gulden recommended it at an attachment workshop I attended. I've read it twice now and I refer to it all the time.Fraiberg's writing style is a bit awkward at times, so it took me a while to get through the book, but it was definitely worth the effort. She offers reasonable and understandle explanations of the stages and struggles of the developing young child. Using concrete examples from her vast experience, she addresses the roles of anxiety, fear, imaginary friends, and language in the emotional and intellectual development of the child from birth through age six.As the mother to a child with mild attachment problems, this book was invaluable in helping me gauge my daughter's emotional development and making informed decisions about the kind of therapeutic parenting she needs. I found Fraiberg's explanations and advice to be reassuring and empowering."},{"Title":"MAGIC YEARS","review":"I first read this book 28 years ago when my daughter was born. I didn't remember the whole name nor the author, but I had read it several times, and it made such a lasting impression on me that I did remember the words \\"The Magic Years\\". I was very glad to see it's still in print. Now I'm going to send it to a niece who just had a baby. There are many books about the physical sequence of development in babies and toddlers and how to enhance each stage of development but none addresses their mental and social development and needs as completely as this book does. Unfortunately for babies and young children, adults tend to view their mental and social development from an adult's perspective. This can result in a lot of misinterpretations and misunderstandings regarding a baby's or young child's behavior. What I remember most about this book is that unlike any other book it enabled me to see the world from a baby's and very young child's point of view. It vividly describes what adjusting to and living in our world is like for babies amd young children and enables parents to see the world from their perspective. The result is parents who understand their baby's and young child's behavior and who can then react to and influence it positively instead of negatively. The book is not for those who want an easy to read, quick, month by month synopsis of their baby's development. But for the parents who want a thorough understanding of their baby's or young child's mental & social development and needs and who want to do their best to meet these needs, it's a resource unlike any other: a resource I've remembered for 28 years and one I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"MAGIC YEARS","review":"Get inside an infant's and toddler's mind. This book will teach you that your baby is not driving you nuts for fun or profit. They are just being normal. It made our lives easier, and it made us better parents."},{"Title":"MAGIC YEARS","review":"Of the twenty or so books on parenting I read after our first daughter was born, I recommend this one to friends most often. Based on research, well written and with almost no redundant material, this book helped me understand psychological development of our child very much. Two more books I would readily recommend are Haim G Ginott's Between Parent and Child and Kathy Hirsh-Pasek's Einstein Never Used Flash Cards."},{"Title":"MAGIC YEARS","review":"This book is excellent. It was given to me by a psychiatrist, and I have often been grateful for that. I had experience raising older foster children, but upon the arrival of a baby, discovered new parental challenges for which I wished to be well prepared. I found this book to be extremely enlightening as to the way that infants and young children view their world and the healthy way a parent can respond to them. It logically explains how children develop a conscience. It showed how easily parents or caregivers can misinterpret a child's behavior and make mistakes that may adversely affect the parent-child relationship and the child's emotional development, and set the stage for lifelong conflicts, emotional imbalance, and perhaps even anti-social behavior.As Dr. Fraiberg explains, the infant is born absolutely self-centered, and her book is invaluable in guiding parental response in order to set the child up to be emotionally healthy enough to become autonomous and objective, which in turn will allow it to develop a healthy self esteem, and compassion and generosity to others.I am very glad I read this book and have bought many copies for friends and even strangers. I always offer this with my gift: There are a few pages right at the beginning that are somewhat technical, defining mental health and the roots of anxiety, and that might scare some readers off. In actuality, the book is a very enjoyable read with humorous examples and descriptions. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"MAGIC YEARS","review":"What a fantastic read - hard to believe it was written over 40 years ago! It is still as relevant today as it was then. My son is almost 2 and it is interesting to see the way that she describes what he is experiencing as he starts to be more aware of everything around him. The book is broken into several chapters highlighting 0-18 months, 18 months-3 years old and 3-6 years old plus some additional topical subjects such as potty training. As I read it, I had several \\"ah-ha\\" moments as to why my son did certain things along with ideas to cope with some of the issues one may face with a toddler.

(1918-1981), was an American social worker and professor of child psychoanalysis. This, the original version of her volume \\"The Magic Years,\\" first arrived in 1959 containing 305 pages. She chose its title because she found young children believe they can magically create anything they desire. Interestingly, Austrian born and later American psychologist/former psychoanalyst Otto (Rosenfeld) Rank, Ph.D., once said in his \\"The Myth of the Birth of the Hero\\" (1914), that when the child gets older, he entertains acrimonious imaginings toward his parents, nevertheless cloaking what would be a magical time when \\"...his father still appeared to be the strongest and greatest man, and the mother seemed the dearest and most beautiful woman.\\" Fraiberg's book comes in five parts, of which I'll describe some of the points I found intriguing made in each of said.In her work's Introduction, she approaches mental health as a value system integrated within an incorruptible ideal self and conscience, working in conjunction with society. Here a salubrious ego does not fall prey to neurotic approaches to conflict, although anxiety, the reaction to a peril one anticipates--with its wall of defenses, may ensue.Next, Fraiberg covers the first year and a half of a child's life, explaining why a baby smiles. Originally, it's the mouth relaxed to instinctively demonstrate contentment during nursing. Later, the repetition of nursing and its pleasure is mentally associated with the constant sight of the mother's face and embedded in the baby's memory. Fraiberg affirms that it is the mother who connects the child to the outside world, helping him find his own self, with anxiety first appearing when the threat of the loss of her love is apparent. She also mentions \\"the vanishing object\\": things the child no longer sees when placed elsewhere and therefore does not search for. The parents then become persons the child may believe disappear permanently (but may reassure himself through magical thinking that they'll reappear) and, like objects, not expected to return until a permanence is ratified as he develops, reducing separation anxiety. And as the baby becomes personally unique, more independent, and therefore more mobile, he begins to put distance between himself and his mother.Then the author explores the child's progress from eighteen months to three years of age. Here pre-verbal, primitive thought and language, first derived from magic--because magical type thinking is the earliest mental activity--plays a role. She speaks of \\"missionaries\\"--parents, teachers, et al, which release the child from the Pleasure Principle, based on satisfying one's pleasurable bodily needs. He subsequently adjusts more to reality by embracing the Reality Principle, which is governed by reason, in order to ascend to higher forms of thinking, like abstract, logical and ordered processes. Fraiberg demonstrates through case studies how the child, notwithstanding, invents figures through imagination, utilized to surmount his fears; molding creativity and intellect. But things go awry when, as American psychoanalytically trained pediatrician/psychiatrist Benjamin McLane Spock, M.D., said in his \\"Baby and Child Care\\" (1945), ''...he is spending a good part of each day telling about imaginary friends or adventures, not as a game but as if he believes in them, it raises the question whether his real life is satisfying....the remedy may be finding him children the same age to play with and helping him...enjoy them. Another question is...he...having enough...companionship with...parents.\\" Therefore, Fraiberg emphasizes how crucial family bonding is in a youngster's mental health.The author next probes the child's maturation from age three to six, explaining further his concept of himself--just who he is and where he came from. She says that this stems from how he views his own body in relation to himself and world. Fraiberg follows with a discusssion on the Oedipus Complex (Electra Complex in the girl), which does not have to be the literal, jealous rancour the child feels for the father because he is enamoured with the mother, whom he wants to possess. It is transformed into an unfulfilled and unfeasible daydream expressing itself through aggression and guilt; but because he cannot replace the father, identifies with him instead, by wanting to be like him. The child then, naturally acclimatizes to many of life's other disappointments and conflicts. So, symbolically, the Oedipal conflict can express itself in latter guilt or anxiety charged behaviours, where conduct is distorted.In her Conclusion, Fraiberg says, \\"...for while...experiences of early childhood provide...foundations for personality development, there is no way of predicting...early...how these experiences will influence personality....because...adaptive mechanisms in each child's personality are at work...early in development, acting upon experience...unique for this personality, and the product...depends...upon the ego and...mode of adaptation...not the experience itself.\\" Therefore one cannot guarantee that a child will not fall prey to neurosis, however, she states that--more significant than constitutional, animalistic instinctive, or maturational factors--the love via family bonding is the quintessential humanizing element enabling a child's ego to healthily cope with conflict and frustration. Although as Austrian born American child & educational psychologist/psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim, Ph.D. (philosophy), in his 1950 made-for-parents work \\"Love Is Not Enough\\" (in which he documents work conducted with emotionally disturbed children at the Orthogenic School in Chicago) says, there is (in addition to love) a socially useful skill required here, \\"...that of living well with oneself and with others...in an emotionally stable and satisfying human environment.\\" Freiberg asserts it's then that the child's own expectations can adapt harmoniously to the challenges of the real world.All in all, Selma H. Fraiberg's \\"The Magic Years\\" is a simplicity to read. It shows us how to comprehend and deal with arduous issues of early childhood when the child created magic and he received his jeweled candy from Merlin in awe."},{"Title":"MAGIC YEARS","review":"Seeing the child's world through this perspective provides understanding and joy to the reader.

I purchased it again as a gift for some friends who are parents of an almost three year old. I know they'll get some help from it as well.

This book was required reading when I attended the University of Michigan School of Education back in the early 70's. Since then I have shared it with friends and family, and most recently with my daughter. This book helps demystify the toddler years in terms of behaviors, anxieties, and misunderstanding of situations. Small children lack the experiences and cognitive development that older children and adults have acquired. The introduction by Dr. T. Brazelton is also helpful to parents, who tend tooverprotect, rather than allow for discovery and sense of self in the toddler."},{"Title":"MAGIC YEARS","review":"Read this book not from cover to cover but by chapter as the child reaches the age described in the chapter.

I think it is the best guide for teaching parents about their young children and how best to teach them to be healthy, kind, and independent adults. I buy it whenever I can and give it to young parents to use as a guide. I love the concept that responsible parenting is not about discipline for young children, but teaching them self control so that they will learn how to be responsible and comfortable young adults. My job is as a clinical social worker who works with all kinds of patients, many of them young parents who start out without having any idea of how to handle their children. This is the best guide I know of.

Readers who are not at least somewhat knowledgeable about European politics, culture and psychological trends at the start of World War II are likely to feel somewhat lost. Peter Slavek is a 22-year-old radical from the intellectual class who has no true understanding of the oppressed masses for whom he campaigns. His commitment to socialist revolution is swept away into insignificance by the horrors overwhelming Europe. After being tortured, he escapes to the capital of Neutralia (not kidding), where he encounters a female psychiatrist whom he knew as a child. He also meets Odette, a young homeless wanton, and falls in love with her. Torn between his politics and his love, he suffers a mental breakdown and hysterical paralysis of one leg. In a series of informal but very intense analysis sessions, Dr. Bolgar, the psychiatrist, uncovers the \\"dynamic roots\\" of his radicalism, revealing it to be the sequela of a traumatic incident from his childhood. So his politics aren't real, they're just his way of making lifelong expiation for his imagined sins. Bingo, his neurosis is cured, and he regains the use of his leg. In addition to the psychoanalytical jargon, Koestler devotes considerable space to dialogues between characters about political theories and philosophies fashionable among liberal European intellectuals in the first half of the 20th century. History teaches us that most people either didn't know or didn't care to know about the Holocaust; if that is so, why didn't Koestler's matter-of-fact descriptions of the fate of the Jews in this book attract more attention? These parts of the book read more like a historical novel that was written today than a book published in 1942. \\"Arrival and Departure\\" was the last of a trilogy that began with \\"Darkness at Noon\\" and I tend to agree that it is the weakest of the three books. It was one of Koestler's earliest books in English---he had previously written in Hungarian and German---and it shows in this book: Its formal, stylized, rather lofty prose actually does read more like a translation than like a book written in English: Reminiscent of the prose of Joseph Conrad, but a bit flatter. I recommend this book only for the reader who is a fan of Koestler's work or who wants to read what is now essentially a period piece about life among the displaced and refugees in wartime Europe."},{"Title":"Arrival & Departure","review":"Koestler was always facinated by the psychology of imprisonment and torture;what makes a person crack or hold out.Peter Slavek has escaped to Neutralia.

So much so that it comes with a chapter named &quot;Words of Warning.&quot; The first part of the book covers tools and techniques for gathering, transporting and preparing Hawaiian plants, including using the modern version of the Hawaiian O\`O (digging stick). Following that is a chart of what plants grow at what elevations (I've never seen one like it anywhere else). The next (and largest) section is an alphabetical listing of 54 major medicinal plants (one page each) with descriptions, comments and drawings. The only negative is that the plant drawings aren't in color - readers will probably want a supplemental plant guidebook to help with plant identifications. The final section is an alphabetical listing of ailments that the plants can be used to cure, AND complete instructions on how to prepare and use them.I wouldn't hesitate to use this book at all for my personal health. I didn't know that awa would stop a headache cold (it does) until I read it here. The author has been interested in medicinal plants since childhood and obviously believes in them. At the same time he is realistic and doesn't hesitate to point out when modern medicine works better (like aspirin for fever reduction, for example). If you live in the islands, you need this book near your medicine cabinet!

But, instead (along with Israel) it continues to engage in colonization, which is the euphuistic term for hegemony, and genocide. {{{Sorry for digressing, but this needs to be said.}}}Anyway, the America Indians are extraordinary, viscerally strong, resolute, and residual, and they cling to their proud culture no matter the odds. However, the coming of the White Man nearly eviscerated their culture and almost destroyed America's identity, but in the end there are still patches of Indigenous influence throughout this country.This book concentrates its thesis on the wars that were fought, the names of many tribes and the leaders involved, as well as battle stratagems used in the wars.What mostly struck my interest was that many African Slaves managed to escape to Florida and assimilated with the Seminole Indians, but of course this didn't settle well with President Andrew Jackson.The U.S. wars with the Seminoles were the pinnacle of trouble for Jackson in Florida since this soon to be acquired territory was to be purchased from Spain, and believe it or not the events that were transpiring during 1814 and beyond would later lead to the 1898 Spanish American War.On many occasions the Indians were left with no alternative but to side with the French, or the British, for every time a treaty would be agreed upon the White Man would egregiously renege on it and usurp more territory, pushing their way further out west, which was a revolting development that literally cost lives and the soul of a nation.Other wars that are covered in this book are:1) The British and Indian War, which we are more accustomed to calling it \\"The Revolutionary War.\\"2) The French and Indian War also known as \\"The Seven Years' War.\\"3) Black Hawk's War.4) The Trail of Tears: the relocation of the Cherokee Indian.5) Geronimo and the Apache Indian's last stand and relocations to prisons in Florida.6) Wounded Knee and the relocation and near Genocide of the Lakota Sioux.This is just a sample of what's inside of this book. There are many tribes that this book covers and even more sanguineous stories of warfare and terrorism. \\"The American Indian Wars\\" is heavily detailed and scholarly, yet easy to read and ascertain.Everyone should read this book, or should I say historical catharsis. Then reflect heavily upon who and what the United States of America really is and what it may metastasize into if this nation doesn't shift gears?Will America still be a xenophobic nation engulfed in its heinous nature, or will we become xenophiles in the end?Is the U.S. really \\"the land of the free, home of the brave?\\" Or is it an imperialistic nation that will destroy any obstacle in its path for the sole purpose of its aim?Well, if you ask a Navajo, Shawnee, or a Cheyenne they probably will say \\"absolutely.\\" The question is what would you say and how will you act upon this disquieting elucidation?We can't change the past (history,) but John Tebbel & Keith Jennison cathartically gives us a plethora of reasons to change the future for the better, and that's a perspective we should all pledge to achieve. The Indigenous aren't an anachronism that no longer belongs in the American dynamic. The truth is their spiritual integrity should be what America should subscribe to achieve. The American Indians along with African Americans are the quintessential backbone of this nation's moralistic outlook. Tebbel & Jennison too a certain extent pedagogically demonstrates this truism throughout their historical account."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of earned-value management: Government projects: Learn how to use an earned-value management system to help integrate budget and ...

The binding is flimsy, and the book is poorly put together. Many of the poems are not properly printed--for example, most of poems appear in paragraph form! Don't waste your money on it."},{"Title":"Chamber music,","review":"These poems are like smoke rings. In a few moments, Joyce creates a scene and a mood; and in a few more moments, it is over! Very fleeting, very pretty when it works -- which is much of the time."},{"Title":"Chamber music,","review":"We don't normally think of James Joyce in terms of poetry, yet, here in this work he demonstrates his considerable poetic skills. I read it in bits, not all at once, in order to digest and think about what he has said. I would recommend this to anyone who loves poetry."},{"Title":"Chamber music,","review":"Here you can find pure and beautiful words from the century author!

Why are the little lyrics of this great lyric artist so minor, and however their charm and music, of minor significance? Is it because Joyce has much greater lyrical works, with it being possible to argue that Finnegans Wake is one long poem alone? Or is it because the minor perceptions and feelings here do not strike us to the depth of the soul as the lyrics of Dickinson or Blake do?As words of a great genius these small poems are valuable. As little poems of pleasure they also make sense. But had Joyce written only them he would not be remembered today. The same cannot be said of Dubliners or a Portrait or Ulysses."},{"Title":"The Escape Orbit","review":"This may be my favorite Sci-Fi book of all time. It may have also been the first Sci-Fi book I ever read. James White has created a prisoner of war camp that is a whole planet. How do you escape from a planet where your captor restricts your technology to the bronze age level and most of the &quot;prisoners&quot; have long since stopped regarding themselves as soldiers. James White makes the attempt seem plausible and exciting. It reminds me of a Sci-Fi &quot;The Great Escape&quot;. And, he also pulls a twist at the end that wraps the book up nicely and makes you rethink the rest of the book. I know it's not in stock, but try to find it! While it's different than White's Sector General stories, he still instills the attention to detail that makes his SG stories authentic."},{"Title":"Santa Claws","review":"For a 90's young adult thriller, this is fairly typical fare, but it was a good book for its genre. It mixes suspense with the zodiac in the form of a serial killer who is targeting people one by one based on their zodiac sign, starting with an Aries girl who he strangles with a wool scarf, choosing this weapon because wool comes from a ram - he then goes on to kill a Taurus, a Gemini, etc, choosing their methods of death according to their sign. The motive for this is eventually revealed, and the overall story is well-written and nicely paced for a young adult novel. I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"Santa Claws","review":"I remember reading this book as a pre-teen thinking that it would make a great slasher film (great characters, good story, gory and creative deaths, what's not to love? Any current or future filmmakers reading this review: please try to make this book into a film. It would rake in the dough and it would be way better than a lot of the more recent horror films) and the book stayed in my mind even in my twenties. If you are a fan of slasher films/books, I would highly recommend this book. Heck, even if you aren't into slasher films/books, you'll most likely enjoy it. So, if you can find it, buy it and enjoy it. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Santa Claws","review":"I loved this item. It was exactly as discribed.

So once I got to the end I wasn't shocked, but I liked the way the author handled it. Robyn was a good character and she knew her stuff.

When I finished I looked back at some of the pages I really liked and I thought that was an excellent book. And I'm gonna tell everyone I know to read it.

But that's not what made want to read it, what made me want to read it was some of the line's I read after a couple of pages."},{"Title":"Santa Claws","review":"This book was really great. I really love books about werewolves and this book was one that I really loved. I wasn't really expecting the ending but it was really cool. This book has all the genres for a horror book: slasher killing, a strange but cool hero, good setting... I love this book, you should definetly read this book!"},{"Title":"Santa Claws","review":"In the small town of Branton, a savage bloodthirsty cougar is on the loose, killing anyone in its way. First it was the animal keeper at the game farm, and then the high school student, Chrissie Kelly, followed by the hunter who was on its trail. But for two teenagers--Cory Darnell and Holly Parker--these killings mean more than just the random, thoughtless attacks of a cougar. For Cory, it&#65533;s physical proof of the unaccountable bloody visions that have been plaguing him lately. He can&#65533;t remember where he&#65533;s been or what he&#65533;s done when he blacks out at night, but he remembers the hunt and the kill of all three people vividly. Is he, indeed, responsible for killing his girlfriend and the other two people--or is there something far more sinister happening in Branton? The one person who knows the answer to this is Holly, the lone teen investigator who is out to prove that the cougar is just a cover up for a much larger, smarter creature--a werewolf. But first she must find out who the werewolf is, because after only three deaths, the creature is hardly satiated, and more people are likely to die unless Holly can find and kill it before then.The ending of \\"Santa Claws\\" was definitely exciting, even though I had guessed the secret of the werewolf beforehand. Still it&#65533;s well worth reading if you&#65533;re a fan of horror and, especially, of werewolves. As warning, there is some violence, but it&#65533;s tolerable if you&#65533;re used to blood and guts and you&#65533;re older than twelve. The ending did leave a possibility for a sequel, which I would love to see happen. I really enjoyed this book and think a second book would be just as good.The only thing that bothered me, though, was the front cover and the title of this book--both greatly misrepresented the story. There&#65533;s very little to do with Christmas except the mention of holiday caroling and decorations at the end of the book, plus the snow. And the creature on the front cover could have been anything, but hardly looked like a wolf of any kind, least of all a werewolf. If I had known \\"Santa Claws\\" was about werewolves, I probably would have started it a lot sooner."},{"Title":"Money Power for Singles: A Common-Sense Approach to Proper Money Management (Money Power (Chelsea House))","review":"this is a great book it helped me in money porblems"},{"Title":"Money Power for Singles: A Common-Sense Approach to Proper Money Management (Money Power (Chelsea House))","review":"this is a great book it helped me in money porblems"},{"Title":"Economic Growth","review":"Professor Weil has provided a very readable text for the senior or graduate student. His organization is excellent, as he steps logically through a description and analysis of the main drivers of economic growth. There is just enough math to display the Cobb-Douglas and Solow models and how they help understand economic growth. Additional appendices with mathematical proofs. Topics covered include physical and human capital formation, productivity, share of a nation's resources devoted to investment, population, technology and institutional elements. A most enjoyable read - I recommend it."},{"Title":"Economic Growth","review":"This is a fascinating book, and that is an amazing achievement for a textbook. The approach David Weil takes to this very important subject allows the reader to get involved in the subject, understand why the easy conceptions we have about this subject are indeed too simple and why they are too simple, and develop some intuitions and models with somewhat greater understanding. It is written for a general reader or student with only a very basic understanding of economics (micro and/or macro). Not much math is required to read the chapters (very little, actually), and the discussions with more math are put in appendices for each chapter. So, if you want the math, it is there, but if it scares you - well, you can read the text of the chapter and skip over the appendices.The overall approach is to provide an introduction to the topic, build some tools and approaches to the problems of economic growth through a series of important topics and then synthesize all of it in the concluding chapter. Weil provides seventeen chapters that are grouped into five parts. However, there are really three big sections to the book. The first section is Part I and the first two chapters that provide an introduction to the issues of economic growth and a basic framework for the discussion. The third broad section is Part V, the last chapter, that provides the conclusion to the book by summarizing all that has been discussed in the book. The second section makes up the bulk of the book and is comprised of Parts II, III, and IV.Part II discusses the issues of Factor Accumulation. These are the problems around physical capital (not just money, but the tools of the economy as well), population issues, and human capital.Part III examines productivity. Those of us who are not well versed in this topic have no idea how subtle and interesting this subject is. Just defining and measuring it are not easy, but then going after what the real order of causality is turns out to be far from obvious. That is one of the great things Weil does in this book, he shows us over and over again that the simple assumptions one might make about what causes what is not as obvious as we might have assumed. However, he doesn't leave us in a state of confusion. He shows us how to tease out some knowledge and to frame questions for future investigation (both in later chapters and for future research).Part IV deals with issues of government involvement in the economy, income inequality, culture, geography, and resources. In each of these discussions it is a matter of degree and what choices a society makes in seeking its desires. What costs is it willing to bear? Rapid growth and resource exploitation might cost some environmental degradation. Importing resources from other places might have a limit as world population soars to ... what point? Culture tends to change as societies become rich and subsequent generations throw off some of the values of those that provided the riches. What is the effect of that change in work habit and moral behavior?The book also has interesting articles in each chapter that are shaded in blue and provide very interesting insight into the topic under discussion. And since it is a textbook, there are questions, vocabulary, and such at the end of each chapter. There is also an extended resource list, a very helpful glossary, and an index. The book also points you to a website with very helpful resources.I recommend this book for anyone interested in this topic. It is written so well that a motivated general reader will have no problems with it and students will have a much better experience with it than most of the textbooks produced nowadays.Fine read and a great text!"},{"Title":"A Matter of Trust:: Connecting Teachers and Learners in the Early Childhood Classroom (Early Childhood Education)","review":"In a Matter of Trust, Howes and Ritchey bring their deep understanding of the world of the classroom and the world of developmental theory and research to produce a book that is both revolutionary and well grounded. They present a strong and clear rationale for the central role of trusting teacher-child relationships to children's successful adjustment and learning in daycare, nursery school, and early elementary classrooms. Using rich classroom vignettes, they show us how teachers can and do succeed in building trusting relationship even when working with children living in truly difficult circumstances. Their clear presentation of attachment theory sheds new light on children and their motivations and new light on the role of adults in children's development. I found their discussion of one of the sacred cows of discipline, time out, particularly illuminating."},{"Title":"A Matter of Trust:: Connecting Teachers and Learners in the Early Childhood Classroom (Early Childhood Education)","review":"I had ordered 60 of these books.

There is no sense of evolution here; Dream takes off right where \\"Fruit of the Secret God\\" left off five years ago. And it screams!Perusing through the pages of Dream is like entering another world, another dimension of human consciousness. A murky, cavernous realm where nightmares are reality, where Carl Jung sips tea with Freddy Kruger. The naked forms within are showcased as erotic centerpieces that are themselves part of a grander, seemingly more menacing vision. Bodies and body parts, shapes, symbols, and variety of different objects are weaved into a single, sexual tapestry, meant not so much to arouse as to incite.Few will be able to view these images and not be moved, some may be offended, some excited, others frightened. But for those propitious few mesmerized and capable of looking deep into each portrait, and even deeper within themselves, they might be surprised to discover the most frighteningly original vision of human reality since Hironymus Bosch painted his medieval visions of Hell."},{"Title":"Dream: The Dark Erotic Photographic Visions of John Santerineross","review":"In the introduction, the creator of these photographs claims that his works of art are inspired by his dreams.If these are his dreams, I hate to see his nightmares!All the models are nude, and are in strange positions: holding bizzare items, draped just so.Kinda makes you wonder: what will this guy think of next?"},{"Title":"Dream: The Dark Erotic Photographic Visions of John Santerineross","review":"I was anxiously awaiting this title....after purchasing John's first book several years ago...I have hungered for more. This book exceeds my highest expectations!!! John Santerineross has the amazing ability to capture beauty and darkness simultaneously to create images that invoke an emotional response.

I really enjoyed every page of the fine printed works of John Santerineross one of my favorites photographers and symbolist."},{"Title":"Dream: The Dark Erotic Photographic Visions of John Santerineross","review":"John Santerineross's vision is undeniably gothic, but his artistry in staging, lighting, costume, movement and tableau makes it singular and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Dream: The Dark Erotic Photographic Visions of John Santerineross","review":"This book was the first exposure to Mr. Santerineross' work, after seeing a single shot of his on the internet. I have since seen other of his works, including a gallery show with Chas Krider in my city.The art of this photography is simply unmatched. The blend of the iconic, the erotic and the dream is masterfully portrayed in the photographs. His use of lighting and settings only emphasizes the artist's vision and control. The imagery has a power to pull one in-- to contemplate and absorb it.I would rather have several of his prints framed and mounted on my study wall, but until I can gather those sorts of funds I am more than satisfied with the sheer, raw unadulterated beauty of the imagery in this collection."},{"Title":"Dream: The Dark Erotic Photographic Visions of John Santerineross","review":"I received this book as a gift and it is truly something I have treasured. As I turned the pages, I created narratives in my mind for each of the evocative images. Every object, every glance from a model tells me their story but also the story of the artist himself. I was taken in by the sense of motion in many of the photographs and was amazed that this was created \\"on-set\\" and was not the result of editing software. One cannot look at this book and not be impressed by the sheer amount work that must surely go into building the world of each image. In my opinion, it is impossible to look at this work and not feel touched by it. While some may look at it, like Catholic League President Bill Donohue, and have an overwhelmingly different reaction than myself; I can, however, guarantee a deeply visceral reaction nonetheless. After flipping through this book for the first time, my own dreams that evening took on the interesting twist of mimicking the style of John's photos; I believe it was my subconscious still enjoying what I had seen whilst awake."},{"Title":"Dream: The Dark Erotic Photographic Visions of John Santerineross","review":"Dream is visionary, every time you look at a photo, you will see something new.

While I'll admit that right off the bat I'm skeptical of artists that self-publish (if they're so good, why hasn't a recognized publishing house taken them in?). Usually these are vanity publications and this is no exception. I will agree that some of the women are attractive -- mostly Suicide Girl-types -- but the imagery is rather derivative and like the text, incredibly self-conscious and \\"artistically high-minded.\\" If I were a twenty-something goth perhaps this would appeal to me, but otherwise I think not. If you're looking for something more Witkin-esque, I would suggest Jeffrey Scott's Visions Within the Mechanism. Or on second thought, why not stick with the master (Witkin) himself for true originality."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Western Movies","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK for the western film aficionado. Notice I put the first phrase in capital letters for emphasis. This is because I will also say, THERE IS ONE VERY LARGE AND GLARING PROBLEM.However, I will digress a bit. This is truly an encyclopedia of American made western filmsIt lists films by each decade since the 1930s (with some 1920s films also)and there is a preface for each decade that addresses the \\"flavor\\" of the western films for that decade. Each entry gives the following information: The director, producer, script writer, cinematographer, leading players. Also, running time, alternate title(s)and if it is color or b/w. The book is profusely illustrated with b/w stills. Each entry also has a synopsis and opinion by the author regarding the film.It would be difficult to find a western in the main section that is of any great interest to most of the population. However, there was obviously not enough room for EVERY western film to receive the treatment given in the main body of the book. However, the author very generously enumerated all films not put in the main section by listing those in an appendix with the year of production, running time, director and two main actors. There are other appendices as well which add significantly to the information for students of the western.The glaring problem of which I spoke is the fact that the author has chosen to put what is commonly called a spoiler in the majority of the discussions of most films listed in the main section. No holds are barred in relating how the story ends and what happened in most of the stories. Why Mr. Hardy chose to do this is beyond me.So, I will recommend this book very strongly for anyone who has an above average interest in the Western genre. But, be warned, if you have not yet seen the movie in question do not read the entry in this reference before viewing if you do not want to know the plot resolution.Also, it should be said that this book was reprinted with very small revision. The new title is THE OVERLOOK FILM ENCYCLOPEDIA (THE WESTERN) by Phil Hardy. As far as this writer can tell the original book was simply reprinted verbatim but there were a few more films from the 1980s added to list for that decade.So, this is a book I have referred to numerous times and find it to be a treasure. I just have a problem with the fact of the spoilers."},{"Title":"Balcony stories","review":"I first read about Grace King and her \\"Balcony Stories\\" in Christopher Benfey's \\"Degas in New Orleans.\\" Benfey quotes King as writing about New Orleans balconies' secret life: \\"There is much of life passed on the balcony in a country where the summer unrolls in six moon-lengths, and where the nights have to come with a double endowment of vastness and splendor to compensate for the tedious, sun-parched days.\\"This quote caught my attention, as did Benfey's brief description of the stories -- all about women: Cajuns, Creoles, free women of color. And I had to read the stories for myself. I'm glad I did -- the stories are a window into a very specific time and place in an area of the South that seems a world of its own.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller"},{"Title":"Irish Guards in the Great War 2nd Battalion","review":"In the aftermath of Kipling's loss of his 18-year old son in World War One, the famous writer was asked to write a history of his son's regiment. He consented at once and began immediately, embarking on a task which would take five and a half years.The devotion and the skill of one of the great masters of the language are manifest here, in what Kipling called &quot;my great work...done with agony and bloody sweat&quot;, producing a work that stands as a literary masterpiece, as well as superb military history.Sarpedon is to be congratulated for this excellent edition of an unjustly neglected work, which is in two volumes, one for each battalion, reissued with rare photos and the original excellent maps.(The &quot;score&quot; rating is an ineradicable feature of the page. This reviewer does not &quot;score&quot; books.)"},{"Title":"Philosophical discussions,","review":"The paperback book used print on demand technology and is so full or errors that it is nearly unreadable. In one case a footnote that is spread out over the bottom of three pages in the original book is presented as a continuation of the text on each page.

Is he never wrong? Just for his writing of Glengarry, Glenross, I bow down in eternal obeisance. Anyhoo, I read a stray remark of his in some obscure magazine article where he set forth the novel premise that this book was the best thing ever written on American politicians. Booyah, I said to that. But then I ran down a copy of this book, and discovered, yet again, dang it, he's right. The book covers the Presidents Harrison through Coolidge as well as the lesser politicians, Richard Croker, Thomas Collier Platt, Alfred Emanuel Smith and William Hale Thompson. White writes a vignette about each man but stitches the whole thing together as an alternative history of British royalty from The Old Kings, through The Early Stuarts, Two Warwicks, The Great Rebellion, The Restoration and, finally, The Young Princes of Democracy. This could have been pretentious fluff but it's not. White was an old-school newspaper editor who knew cant when he saw it and loved to skewer it. He's a very entertaining writer--just like Mamet. Sigh."},{"Title":"Masks in a pageant,","review":"Mamet and the first reviewer are right -- this is a great book and provides a very interesting read. White's prose style and sentence structure is often strange, queer, and maybe incorrect. A better editor back then may have been needed. This is a reprint from the original plates. There are some artifacts that show in the reprint but they do not affect readability. The cover does not look like the one shown here. In fact, my cover reads; Title, Masks in A Parade White; Author, Allen William. Obviously no QC."},{"Title":"Masks in a pageant,","review":"I came across this book after David Mamet referenced it in an essay. Roughly three years later I finally bought it and I am not disappointed. I learned about people that I had never even known existed in the national political landscape. Five of the standout people covered (Richard Croker, Grover Cleveland, Al Smith, Teddy Roosevelt, Thomas Platt) were active in New York, or spent their entire political career in the state. New Yorkers dominated politics from roughly 1880 right on through the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt. The details are not the most important part of each of the biographies, William Allen White's firsthand experience of many of the events covered is. If you are slightly interested in the history of U.S. politics, this book is for you. If you are a fan of great writing, this is also for you."},{"Title":"Working with Young Children","review":"This absolutely is the best textbook on the market for preparing to teach preschool children.

Half a century and five editions later, this is still a standard, authoritative reference work necessary for scholars and interested non-experts alike.Under the editorship of Margaret Drabble, author and biographer (known for 'The Witch of Exmoor' and the more recently published 'The Peppered Moth'), this volume remains faithful to Harvey's intention of placing English literature in its widest possible context while exploring the deep classical and continental connections that underpin much of the history.How can literature be divorced from cultural context? Surely it cannot be -- hence the newest entries into the edition include topics that read as if they were taken from today's best-seller shelf:- Anglo-Indian Literature- Simon Armitage- Kate Atkinson- Louis de Bernieres- Censorship- Ben Elton- Gay and lesbian literature- Hypertext- A. L. Kennedy- Lad's literature- Literature of science- New Criticism- New Irish Playwrights- Carol Shields- Travel writingThis sample listing of the latest entries is representative of the more established categories, in that the entries (encyclopedic in character) include Authors, Subjects, Titles, Events, Characters and Critical Theory. The entries are unsigned (an ever-controversial practice in reference works such as this) -- well over a hundred contributors assisted in this volume, including the likes of Matthew Sweet, Salman Rushdie, Ceridwen Lloyd-Morgan, Katherine Duncan-Jones, and Brian Vickers.This volume serves the general reader well in that one may follow cross-reference trails through the text. Take, for instance, Aaron the Moor -- the reader will be directed to Titus Andronicus, to which one is directed to Shakespeare, and from there a host of other cross-references historical and modern. Under the entry of Gabriel Josipovici, one is led back the entries of Rabelais and Bellow, influences as well as objects of Josipovici's study.The appendices are new features of this edition. The first appendix is a Chronology that lists the chronology of the production of English literature from c.1000 to 1999 side by side with major historical events in Britain and beyond, and the significant events in the lives of literary figures. Appendix 2 lists the Poets Laureate in chronological order, from 1619 (when the office unofficially began) to the present -- surprisingly, there have only been 21 (19 official). Appendix 3 lists major literary award winners: Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, Library Association Carnegie Medalists, and Booker-McConnell Prize for Fiction. Obviously not all of these are British authors, but it helps to place British literature in the wider world context of the twentieth century (as all of these prizes are twentieth-century creations).In addition to the encyclopedic entries, there are major essays scattered through the text. These include the following topics:- Biography- Black British Literature- Children's Literature- Detective Fiction- Fantasy Fiction- Ghost Stories- Gothic Fiction- Historical Fiction- Metre- Modernism- Post-Colonial Literature- Romanticism- Science Fiction- Spy Fiction- Structuralism and Post-StructuralismThese essays include history and current development of the genre or topic, as well as bibliographic information for further research, which (regrettably) the smaller encyclopedic entries rarely have.This is a terrific, one-volume reference that should serve well anyone with a need for quick and ready reference material. It should find a welcome home on the shelf of any avid reader, fan of literature and modern fiction, history, religion, or any devoted Anglophile."},{"Title":"The Oxford companion to English literature","review":"This is one book I turn to over and over again.

You almost imagine having to blow the dust off it before you can begin! But it is so much more rich and diverse than this and should not be avoided by those made nervous by it's title; it is not the untouchable work it sounds like it may be.If literature is a love of yours, whether by author or genre, then you will find this brilliantly informative. Don't be put off by this being such an enormous book, it needs to be, it will become a dear and chubby friend in no time!"},{"Title":"The Oxford companion to English literature","review":"As a teacher of Survey of British Literature (both halves), I rely on this work and refer to it regularly in class.

No student of British Literature--whether instructor or traditional student--should be without it."},{"Title":"The Oxford companion to English literature","review":"Disliking an Oxford Press book makes me feel like a heretic. The majority of their Companion books are superb, remarkably concise yet thorough works of scholarship. The English Companion is an unfortunate and surprising exception.The entry for 'New Criticism' is an efficient example of the book's shortcomings. For one thing, there's a laundry list of authors, dates, and books but very little is said of the IDEAS that characterize New Criticism. The entries are generally hamstringed by a focus on the sociopolitical and historical aspects of writers and works. The effort is laudable but inappropriate and uneconomical for a reference work. In its most extreme form, the historical emphasis goes into bizarre detail about an author's upbringing -- is it really necessary that we know where an author went to grade school and when? Entries love to entertain tales of writers' deaths and and of their insignificant travellings. I often felt as though I were reading minibiographies.One will also notice, in the case of 'New Criticism', the absence of any mention of the 'organic'. This is ridiculous and indicative of the book's lack of attention to concepts as such. There is a non-cross-referenced mention of 'organic' under Coleridge, yet even there it is only mentioned as one of his ideas, not in terms of what the theory tried to say. I would compare it to someone's asking, 'What does X mean?' This book's reply: 'X was one of so-and-so's ideas'. Too often, the response ends there. Literary theory entries are usually on the thin side, though the deconstruction essay is solid. However, even in the longest lit theory essays there is more of an emphasis on people and movements -- far less on ideas.Along with the lack of depth (or conceptual emphasis), there's little sense of the overall significance of ideas, works or characters (ironic given the attempts at a social-historical approach): Caliban is mentioned in the Tempest entry, and even gets his own paragraph elsewhere, but there's nothing about his character as it's been re-elaborated and re-invented by a long tradition of English writers (Auden, Browning, Joyce, and Wilde for starters). There's nothing about Caliban's portrayal in that tradition, nor mention of Caliban's mirror, etc. Under 'hubris' (which is found, in turn, under a terse account of 'the Poetics'), there's nothing about Icarus, nor is there anything about hubris as a specific theme in so many works.Speaking of hubris, it's baffling to me that Drabble's entry is longer than either Hill's or Heaney's. The general editor would have been better off focusing more of her energy on other writers: that expansive babbling space could have been put to stronger use had a more thorough background been given on either of those poets, among others.Readers seeking to understand why an author alludes in his work to a character or poet will be little helped by nebulous terms like 'icily poised' or 'sensuously textured', which are more suggestive of gastronomic, rather than literary, criticism. To my mind a reference's primary function should be to offer a quick source of the 'essentials' of a book or of a writer's ideas, an understanding of which would illuminate one's reading of the alluding work. While I appreciate that entries shy away from 'this or that' critiques or strict (canonical) interpretations, giving lists of facts does an injustice to the works themselves and to the way these works have been interpreted by others. (Believe it or not, people CAN come to their own conclusions even after being introduced to an opinion.)The book's scope is appropriate to literature, as literature tends to allude to so many disparate disciplines. But if one were truly trying to give an encyclopedic account of literature, the book would have to be much bigger. In this case, specialization suffers. I would have preferred a much more focused account of 'literature' as such; I'd then supplement this with other references focused, for example, on English history. One gets the sense that too many entries end up attenuated in this book.On the positive side the plot summaries are strong and more nuanced, though many entries are badly written (full of odd, obscuring, convoluted syntax). Again, good editorship would have recognized this.The book primarily succeeds as an enervated survey. Nevertheless, readers will occasionally happen upon some interesting, well-summarized topics.I'm going to check out the Cambridgean counterpart to the Oxford Companion, and I'm hoping it will give a more in-depth account of ideas and themes. The other Oxford Companions are, however, truly amazing works and deserve a close look."},{"Title":"The Oxford companion to English literature","review":"I teach English literature, so this book is invaluable to me, but also for anyone who watches movies based on nineteenth-century.

The basic storyline is about a feisty young girl's rocky marriage to a much older man. Barbara Aderly, 15 and grandaughter of very illustrious British family, is utterly besotted by the wealthy, powerful and handsome Roger Montgeoffrey, Earl of Devane. All her dreams seem to come true when Roger weds her, but if it's too good to be true, then it probably isn't. Barbara travels with her new husband to France (this occurs in the early 1700s), and she is exposed to Roger's society--rakes, harlots and vicious gossip mongers--except these people are the Princes, Dukes, and Duchesses of France. Barbara feels that she can make Roger love her, as she him, and so is oblivoius to anything unsavoury about her husband--including evidence that Philippe, the Prince de Soisson, seems to be more than a friend to Roger....Barbara is a very human heroine and it's very easy for the reader to relate to her. She is stubborn, and kind, sometimes doing scandalous acts and throwing wild temper tantrums, but always, she has a heart and cares for her loved ones.Roger, the flawed man and husband with all of his deceptions and betrayles to Barbara, still remains a uniquely beloved hero.The novel, in length, is epic worthy but because of the many twists, surprises and relevations in the characters and in the plot, it reads smoothly and easily. And other characters beside Barbara and Roger stand out and capture our hearts. There is Bab's clumsy cousin Tony, the Duke, who suffers painfully from unrequited love for Barabara, Therese who is Babs' maid and her difficult life as a servant--easy prey to aristocratic men, the Duc de Richelieu who is obsesses with having Barbara at all costs, and many more memorable people.This is bittersweet novel about love. Love, as we see, has the power to destroy, as Roger is destroyed. It can also bring out the worst in us like in Richelieu. Or love can mature and make one a stronger person, like Barbara. Through a Glass Darkly is thus, a classic novel. Timeless."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I had seen this book on a list of recommended reading under the category, British historical fiction. The history is a backdrop; that is, the setting is the early 18th Century. But don't expect to learn much about the times.The author spends the first 200 pages on a marriage contract that ultimately fails. Why she takes 200 pages to get to the point is beyond me.I did get a good sense of the characters. So if you like character development and stories about family relationships, you might like it. What I read of the book resembled WIDEACRE by Philippa Gregory. But if you are looking for historical fiction, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Based on the enthusiastic reviews, I was hoping for some substantive and entertaining historical fiction.

It was very hard to put down and I would love to read more books by this author in the future."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I'm an eternal optimist when it comes to books. I picked this one up at a bookstore, intrigued by the historical fiction aspect of it and that it was about a reign (King George I) that wasn't often written about. I also picked it because I love a good personal mystery, and all the characters were hiding something.This book was very disappointing, because it's barely historical fiction. I think the author used the setting more for the manners and clothes, rather than fully exploring the rich possibilities the era gave. The most disappointing aspect was Roger's \\"big secret,\\" which is alluded to throughout the first half and is exposed in the second half. The secret is a terrible letdown, as most readers will guess it within the first few mentions. Moreover, the historical aspect regarding Roger's secret is totally ignored, and makes me wonder if the author did her research at all, or if she did research and just wanted us to put 20th century mores into 18th century characters."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"SPOILERS HEREIN.I ... was not sure what to think of this book. It's got well-developed characters and good style, but the plot is ... nonexistent. And the next time I see a book that has 3 things on the blurb, I might steer clear of it if it means after 700 pages I'll be left going \\"What the hell was the point of THAT!?\\" I realize the setting is aristocracy and all, but my God, it was so very \\"white people problems\\". None of these characters had any real problems, so they decide to make their own. And on top of that, not a single one of them takes a proactive stance morally speaking, or in terms of the strengths of their convictions. Everyone just kind of resigns themselves to their fate. And while life happens and I get that, I'm looking for a tad more than that in a story. I mean, the main character Barbara was the only one that showed any amount of pro-activity by pursuing Roger. That was it. And then when she finds out the guy is seriously in the closet, she doesn't bother trying for a divorce because she \\"loves\\" him and decides her best course of action is just to sleep around on the guy. Which is so out of the pages of the most psychotic Cosmopolitan magazine pages I could cry. (Nothing is better than when ladies are telling ladies this is the best we're capable of, right? Then you know we REALLY believe it.)And, I'm sorry, Roger's gay lover saying \\"She will never know our dark secret, here, let me stick my tongue down your throat on a balcony\\" seemed just the slightest bit contrived. After twenty some odd years of keeping it all a secret, you'd think they'd be better about it. And after the big reveal, that's the end of the book. Except there's 300 pages of characters reflecting on their brutal disappointments left to go. No one triumphs, no one wins, and no one learns. Everyone just kind of bitches about how it's not fair, (or kills themselves over the unfairness of it all) despite the fact that no one made any effort anywhere in the book to try and make things happen. People make mistakes in the book and end up trapped by them, not because they're against impossible odds or an unfeeling society, but because they don't bother. And everyone else around them says \\"don't bother\\" either. It was a strangely nihilistic tale, truth be told. A sort of weird, sordid story that suggests riches just make crappy people who make bad decisions. And possibly that childbirth and child-rearing is awful. Which, again: I get, that kind of stuff did kill the average woman, but the one women who wants kids is barren, and EVERYONE else hates them as miserable leeches that ruin the body, sag the boobs, and suck the soul from you. Until they die of smallpox en masse, and then it's tragic, utterly, utterly tragic.I have no idea what the hell to make of this mess. If the value of a book lies in how much time you spend trying to figure it the hell out: this one manages that pretty well. But in terms of satisfaction or resolution ... completely lacking in that department. Things go nowhere and people do nothing. Makes you wonder how the author managed that with a pretty turbulent backdrop for a setting. I'll give it some stars for characterization and description, but holy crap, Koen, give us a story next time!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"What a great book!!

This one is not badly written, but, the author does not seem to know what to do with the people in her novel and she keeps killing then. After 400 pages I learned not to get attached to anyone the beautiful Barbara loves, for surely he will die shortly. Can you believe the authoe killed the 5 beloved young brothers and sisters of the heroin in one page?, I was horrified, (the remaining older brother had to kill himself for lack of plague). It was no surprise that a cute 4 years old godson had no chance of surviving the flue and a mirracle that his brothers were still breathing at the end of the novel. I do not dare order the sequel for I am sure that if barbara will ever have children, they will not live very long. I dare Mz.

I found in its stead, a riveting book I just could not put down. A bit slow in the beginning, but necessary as it sets up for what is to come. This novel provided the history I craved, and the unexpected love story I thoroughly enjoyed by providing the details of the mores and values of the elite society in which the stories take place. It also delves into the lower ranks of society, what they were expected to do, their station in life, and what they had to suffer. The same holds true for women and what they had to endure insofar as their station in life. I was surprised by so many things. I do not wish to give away any of the plots or any of what I learned. I crave a sequel to this book because I want to know what happens to several of the characters whom I became so familiar with each evening as I set down to read. Please, Ms. Koen, keep writing!

So I expected to like TAGD also.But NO! This book absolutely NOT as good as Dark Angels, which I would describe as a 1/2 sort of historical novel, 1/2 sort of romance. And well done.This book is definitely not a historical novel. There is just the tiniest bit of backdrop of history, that's it. The rest is gushing, over-the-top, histrionic romance. Oh the CRYING! Never have a read a book with someone constantly crying about something. And the PASSION! Somebody was constantly \\"passionate\\" about someone else. And the MELODRAMA! Talk about drama-queens. And the superficial BEAUTY! There was such an emphasis on beauty and handsomeness, -- someone, over and over and over, was SO beautiful or SO handsome.GAG! -- That said, it did keep my curiously piqued to find out what happened next (though I wound up skimming over numerous paragraphs of repetitive, gushing blather). I stayed with it right up to quite awful ending."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Karleen Koen does a great job of presenting a historical fiction novel in early 18th century London and Paris from 1715-1721. The story evolves around the central character, 15 year old Barbara Aderly. She is raised by her grandparents, the Duke and Duchess of Tamworth. Her mother is pretty useless and selfish, worried more about how she can get more money, boyfriends, etc. Her mother Diana has decided that Barbara should wed the much older friend of the family, Earl Devane.The story is full of duels, deception and romance. It is over 750 pages, but does not drag on. I thoroughly enjoyed the great descriptors of the homes and clothing of the era. There are many characters that you grow to love. Although some reviewers have lamented the ending, there is a great sequel Now Face to Face, which finishes up the details. However, I would recommend reading the prequel, Dark Angels, first so that you get to know the Duchess and keep the history in chronological order."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This was a great story, I could not put the book down.

But in this novel it definintly has it all. The heroine and hero is actually portrayed as actual flawed human beings also capable of great love.

Barbara Aderley is a charming women living in a very dysfunctunal family. And even in the face of utter betrayel still finds the strength to love. The feelings between her and her cousin is among my favorite parts of the book. Karleen Koen very eloquently wrote this book and stirred my emotions more than any other novel has and, believe me, and i've read many. The second part of this novel was also very well written but i felt it lacked much of the emotions the first one had.

My mother reads romances, and we are always having mock arguments. When she pressed this heavy, extremely long book by Koen into my hands, I balked. I don't read historicals, I barked. But this isn't your average historical, she said.This was in 1990. Nearly a decade later, I finally picked up THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY (heretofore referred to as TGD) and read it in a week, consciously slowing down as the pages grew thinner and thinner.TGD is a gorgeous book, a tapestry; it evokes the early 18th century in brilliant detail. I loved the grandmother. What a wise woman! My only regret is not listening to my own sweet mother. I wish I'd read this book ten years ago.Unlike some hardcover historical novels, TGD is easy to read but beautifully written. I have ordered Koen's second book, Now Face to Face. I do wish she'd write a little faster! I wish I could read TEN of her novels. She's that good.Also: this book would make an excellent movie.

It was thick and oversized which is just what I like. However, it was in the Fiction section. I was expecting something with more history and less you-know-what. As I read this, it seems MUCH more like a romance novel than a book of historical fiction. If romance novels are your cup of tea, go for it.As I read it the first time I was slightly disgusted with all the sex and with some of the characters being rather two-dimensional (notably Diana, the mother of the heroine, and Tony, her cousin). The Duchess (grandmother of the heroine) is always irritable and snappy, even when she's being loving, and the heroine, Barbara, spends most of the novel in emotional turmoil about her marriage. But it does have a good effect of transporting the reader to the era, so I reread it, and once I was able to mentally class it as &quot;romance&quot; and not &quot;fiction&quot; it was enjoyable as a sex-filled period romp.

Barbara, her mother Diana, and her grandmother Alice are all strong colorful characters who spend time managing their many family and social relationships and getting dressed in gowns and jewels.The recommendation might be 5-stars for readers who go for plot with passion, but Through a Glass pales against Gone with the Wind, to which some reviewers have compared it."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books. I never read romance novels, and would not consider this one a romance at all. There is a lot of talk of love and happiness but very little romance in the traditional romance novel term. It is very historical, painting a rich portrait of society on several different levels, the country which the heroine travels, and the limited resources a young woman, even one of a higher economic class, had in those times. You feel close to the main character and can even imagine that you are there, sometimes forgetting you are even reading a novel. It is very real and though it is set in another time, the heroine is very reachable, very knowable.

I hope that Karleen Koen continues to write historical fiction because I would snatch it up in a heartbeat!You must read this book!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"It is almost a misnomer to call &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; a romance. Though the protagonist is a young woman and though much of the plot does center around her on-going involvement with one man, Ms. Koen weaves a deep, rich tapestry of history, family treachery and greed with a surprisingly current theme. I recommend &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; to anyone of either gender who wants to truly experience another way of life in another time."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Though I love long books and historical fiction, I must say at first I was a little intimidated by this books 741 pages. Even the first 100 pages were ordinary, and I almost put it down and did not pick it back up.For some reason, though, I kept on going, because I despretely wanted to see Babara married to Roger. I am so glad I did because I soon found myself flying through at least a hundred pages a day, until I finished the book this morning. What an amazing book!England, circa 1715. Fifteen-year old Barbara Alderley has lived a simple life at her grandmother's rich estate in Tamworth. She spends her time playing with her brothers and sisters and pulling pranks- until her mother, Diana- a beauty who will sleep with anyone for money- comes to visit. Since Barbara's father is a traitor to the king, Diana is petitioning for a divorce. She sees an ally in weathy Roger Montgeoffry, whom she decides to marry Barbara off to. Despite a large age difference, Barbara has been in love with Roger since childhood, and she is more than happy to marry him. She is sure that she can make him love her. And Roger is a good man- except that he has a few \\"particular\\" tastes, tastes that he cannot control, no matter how hard he tries. Barbara soon finds herself having to face scandal and heartbreak- will she prevail?I loved this book, and I loved both Barbara and Roger. The sideplots about the Duchess of Tamworth (Barbara's grandmother) and Jane were fascinating as well. This book was such a treat that I wish it could have been even longer! (P.S. I hated Charles. Didn't you?) At the beginning of the book I feared it would turn out like a lot of historical fiction, when everybody upon everybody seems to be obbsessed with the main chracter (Barbara, obviously) and you can only tell if someone is bad if they don't like her.(Plus- SPOILER! it was annoying at first how it seemed all her siblings died calling to her- she wasn't their whole world, in my opinion. I was glad that farther on into the book people who liked her weren't nessessarily good. (Like Charles.)Overall, a wonderful book and worth every minute I spent reading it."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Ok here goes.....I love fictional books based off historical times. I must admit that this book was definitely a page turner for me, I could not put it down. I cried, cheered, fumed, and laughed(very little though). Do not read this book if you suffer from depression. The leading lady went through more in her 5 years (15-20years old in the book)then some of us and our own parents go through put together.I have mixed feelings about this book because it seemed like there was never any happiness. The leading man was 27 years older than her, I can get passed that because of the time period. He feel in love with her, how and when? From part one to part two, 3 years in between, there was no real detail as to what happened to her life, just little snippets that she would think about.The descriptions of places and events was just too much. There was more thinking in their heads and descriptions of events than conversation and this is a pretty good sized book for all that.I do not think I would ever buy another book from this author because she is just too depressing!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"When \\"Through A Glass Darkly\\" was released in 1986, it drew a great deal of attention because of the enormous advance paid to Karleen Koen, a previously unpublished novelist. I was intrigued enough to buy it in hardcover, and it's been a mainstay in my library ever since. It's not a fantastic novel, but it is very compelling. Koen's details of early eighteenth-century England and France are astounding--nothing is prettied up. She seamlessly weaves historical figures with her characters, and her dialogue evokes the times without going overboard. The book was also a bit shocking for the time since it addressed a homosexual love affair involving one of the main characters, a major plot twist. In the current ridiculously politically correct climate, one has to wonder if that combined with the romance between a fifteen-year-old girl and a forty-three-year-old man would have been so hotly fought over by publishing companies today as it was in the mid-eighties. \\"Through A Glass Darkly\\" does traverse an extremely fine line between historical romance and serious historical fiction, doing so with finesse and style. If you're a fan of either genre, you'll enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"The strange, obscure sounding title of \\"Through A Glass Darkly\\" refers to the lenses through which people see things, the expectations and emotions that color all our reactions and feelings relating to the people around us. The book is full of disappointing things happening to people because they saw \\"through a glass darkly\\" instead of seeing things for what they really are.The books' main character is fifteen year old Barbra Alderly, who is sold in marriage at the beginning of the book to forty six year old Roger Devane, who wants to develop the massive and well placed land given to her as a dowry. This isn't a problem for Barbra whose been in love with Roger ever since she can remember and thinks she can make him love her, but Roger has no thoughts at all for his young bride, and he has a skeleton in the closet that will threaten all of their happiness.Set against the lush backdrop of early eighteenth century England and France this book is a visual feast. Ms. Koen is so adept at describing scenery, food and fabrics it's hard to remember that you're even reading a book. Her way of allowing the characters thoughts to roam across the page as real thoughts do is most impressive, I'd never seen train of thought used more effectively in a novel. But still, the book has its faults.All the characters, from young, rash and beautiful Barbra to her domineering and grouchy loveable grandmother see, a little too typical at first. They seem to be cast from molds when we first meet them, and only gradually through the book do they become non-stereotypes. Roger is probably the best example of this. It's a pleasant surprise to see such a skilled evolution of character and to realize that the characters really don't fit the molds our culture oriented minds readily cast them in.This book is charming, beautiful written, and so sad its heart breaking. The illusions people cast for themselves over the course of the book will frustrate you, and make you want to yell at them to see the truth. It's what makes this novel so good, and so compelling. I'd recommend it to anyone. It's not only an example of great historical fiction; it's just a good book. My only problem with this book is that there is a couple of missing years that are eluded to but never explained in detail.For further reading track down the sequel,Now Face to Face: A Noveland the prequel which explores Barbara's grandmother's young lifeDark Angels: A Novel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"...it is a terrific love story, really a bunch of love stories, all poignant. The relationship between Barbara and her grandmother is beautiful, the relationship between Barbara and her husband, DeVane, is tragic. Someone else called this the story of a dysfunctional family---that was an understatement! Set against the intrigues of the French court in the early 1700's and the South Sea Bubble venture, this is the story of a headstrong young woman who's determined to marry a man clearly not right for her, a man whose romantic and sexual past will come back to haunt the girl he marries. Koen pulls no punches. People die, children become ill, fortunes disappear, lives are ruined, love affairs turn out badly, but the wonderful Barbara will get through it all and emerge a stronger, better woman. Get out your handkerchiefs! The biggest problem I have with Karleen Koen's great big terrific historical novels is that she writes so few of them. She can give the more prolific Diana Gabaldon a good run for her money!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"On the surface, Karleen Koen's books may appear to be nothing more than historical romance fluff. You know, the typical muscle-clad hero meets independent but distressed damsel; the two parry and thrust (if you will excuse the phrase) and then, finally, succumb to the throes of passion. Natuarally, this all occurs in some exotic, historical loacle. Koen's books have the fluffy exterior but the interior is much,much meatier than any historical romance I have ever read.&quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; is set in 18th century England and France. The main character, or heroine, is a young girl in love with an older, fatherly type gentleman. As is the case with most young , headstrong girls, the heroine's passions rule her actions and cloud her judgement. After marrying the man of her dreams, she learns the shocking and devestating truth about his character. Because I hold this book in such I high esteem, and because I would like you to enjoy it as heartily as I did, I will not divulge any more of the plot. I will say that there are more turns and twists in this novel, and the sequel &quot;Now Face To Face,&quot; than the most harrowing and breathtaking of rollercoaster rides! As trite as it may sound, expect the unexpected in these books. The hero and heroine's are not nearly as pretty, the locales not nearly as exotic. Nevertheless, there is more substance to this book than any fluffy Harelequin.If you love history, and Koen loads her books with fascinating historical anecdotes and trivia, then you will love these books. However, if you are looking for the formulaic boy meets girl and lives happily ever after in fairyland, don't even consider these books. The characters are colorful, diabolical, interesting, and admirable...far from formulaic.Happy Reading. Let me know what you think"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Having debated long on it, I decided to rate this book purely by its story and not by the author's research (which is extensive and I salute her for it - but I could get that from history books.)I cannot recall ever coming away from a book with a worse feeling in the pit of my stomach and with so much rage at the author. Not because of the tragedies heaped on the characters. I did not expect a fluffy ending tied with a pink bow. What I expected was a modicum of respect for me as a reader.My main reason for hating it so much is this: All the set-ups were empty promises! The author had no idea how wrap things up. I felt she was terrified of confrontations. Because nothing gets resolved. All the fantastic threads of Part A become a tangled mess in Part B and the end was another big set-up that screamed of \\"Go buy the sequel!\\"I know it is hard to believe my critique after so many reviewers raved about this book. The thing is, I totally understand why - the book is wonderfully written but it should come with a big warning tag that says: MAJOR FRUSTRATION AHEAD!Here are the things that killed the book for me:1. The big problem with the main characters - never resolved (and the author went to great length to do that, like making the husband so sick he could not talk and explain. And of course in his letter he said, \\"This is not something to be discussed in a letter.\\" Arggg...)2. The long list of sub-characters with their endless thoughts - not important in the end. You can skip them - trust me! Especially that boring Jane character.3. The counter-hero the author developed throughout the book - gets nothing. Goes to waste. So why did the author tell us about him anyway?4. The heroine, Bab, changes abruptly from the person I rooted for and felt for to something unrecognizable and unbelievable. From a misguided teenagers who insists on marrying the wrong man, she becomes her grandmother's pawn, because having lost faith in her own judgment (and if you read the book you will understand why), she totally loses control over her life, her wants, her dreams for the future. I felt that Bab just lost it at some point. She gave up (at 20!) She didn't know what to do with herself and so handed the reins to her grandmother and did what the old woman said, which was basically to run away like a ditz. Another unbelievable twist since the grandma Alice had a wonderful life in which she was a queen in control. Bab began as a sweet, spirited girl, and ended as a too-stupid-to-live mess of a woman. Did I say a total ditz?5. The slap-in-my face jump from the second before the great climax of the story to years ahead was just rude. That really pissed me off.I kept reading, hoping for resolutions - and never got them. The author pours research into the book as if the pages are vessels for repetitive descriptive details (how many times do I need to read about all the powders and rouges on the vanity table? of the flowers? the clouds? the furniture? the trees? the holidays season?) I could get a magazine for that. When i buy a book i want a story with characters that DO THINGS and take charge of the pages.It felt as though two different people wrote the book: the good Dr. Jekyll wrote Part A and the crazed Mr. Hyde wrote Part B. The good build-up totally disintegrated in the end.This is not good literature. I don't care what people say. Look up Aristotle's POETICS and find out why. This book was worse than bad - it insulted my intelligence.Having read DARK ANGELS and raved about it with my review, I immediately bought the next 2 books in the series. Having read this book, I threw the 3rd - a brand new book - into my trash can without a second thought. I am not treating myself to more abuse from this author."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Overall review: Lavishly detailed but quick-paced early Georgian-era historical fiction in the tradition of Kathleen Winsor or Anya Seton, but including some of the same clumsy styling and lapses in writing craft as those authors. A disappointment to those who hope for a historical romance novel, but worth at least a read for those who do not.--------------------------------------------------------------------------GENRE: Although I recognize that literary genres are artificial marketing devices used by publishers, genres do play by their own rules, and clarifying genre will clear obstacles to your enjoyment of this book. A romance is at its core a book whose main plot thrust is the [ultimately monogamous, male-female] love relationship of one or more sets of lovers, which ends in a betrothal or the promise of long-term happiness. Without this crucial ingredient, there is no romance novel, even if there exist many of the incidental \\"trappings\\" common to many romances (e.g. a forced marriage; social obstacles to love; \\"the Other Woman\\"). Pride & Prejudice is a quintessential romance novel; Gone With the Wind and Through a Glass Darkly are not historical romances, but historical fiction. The best (popular, non-scholarly) exploration of this subject by a scholar is Pamela Regis' _A Natural History of the Romance Novel_.PLOT: The protagonist is a 15-year old noblewoman in Hanoverian/early Georgian England who uses land in her dowry to entice into marriage the 42-year old object of her infatuation. Her marriage takes a nosedive and she finds herself mired in several social, emotional, and political intrigues. We are given a front-seat view of life in both the English and French courts, emphasis on the French, with all their sexual and financial indulgence and moral lassitude.POSITIVES:1. Engaging, memorable characters. You will probably remember and be amused for some time to come by the imperial Duchess, scheming Diana, and nosy Abigail.2. Good use of historical detail. Although there is not great emphasis on actual historical events (wars; coups, etc.), there is liberal and interesting use of the culinary, mortuary, sartorial, sexual, marital and other customs of the age. One of the characters has a \\"secret\\" that was much commoner in the Georgian era than many today are aware; the fact that Koen uses this as a plot device is worthwhile, though her handling of it is not necessarily so (see below).3. Multi-generational emphasis of the \\"mini-series \\"sort that gives heft and drama to novels.4. Interesting inter-weaving of the major literary influences of the time, from the King James Bible to Shakespeare to Alexander Pope.5. A plot premise (see above) that is sound, and the ability to hold one's attention through many plot twists and turns, often through the use of emotional trauma (i.e. deaths).NEGATIVES (You guessed it was coming).1. Characterization of Protagonist. Barbara as spirited child is well-developed, but Koen does not effectively bridge the gap between the different stages of her development. The leaps from excited, nave bride to disillusioned lady about town to survivor of multiple traumas are disjointed and unconvincing. We never really get a handle on Barbara the woman, or her motivations behind her sometimes shocking reactions to her marital problems. And, most importantly, we never learn WHY she is still in love with Roger, after all he has put her through. If anything, we are given evidence of a deep connection with Charles Russel, Tony, and others whom the reader speculates would be better with Bab. In short, if you asked me to explain the character of Babara Alderly, I could only cite her early years with any confidence; everything post-Roger would be referred to as \\"a put-upon woman who asserts herself in ineffective ways and who doesn't know what she wants.\\"2. Characterization of Love Interest. Roger is an unfathomable character. We are told--not shown!-- he is charming and loving toward Barbara, but the majority of his actions indicate the opposite. He makes inscrutable decisions--such as how he lives after the falling-out with Bab--that Koen never explains. The telling instead of showing is a big detraction and indicative of the fact that this was Koen's first novel.3. Inept Time Shift. The single biggest flaw is the way in which the aftermath of Roger and Bab's falling-out is handled. The jump in time from the exact moment of Bab's discovery to a time 4 or 5 years later in which several new characters are lobbed at us is disorienting in the extreme. Plus, it deprives the reader of experiencing first-hand poor Bab's emotions, Roger's reactions to them, etc. Again, telling, not showing.4. The \\"Secret\\" is mishandled. Many people in this class echelon would have been familiar with the symptoms and mere general fact of it, yet Koen's are taken by surprise or totally oblivious. White and Diana, for e.g., would almost certainly have suspected and known of the possibility. Next, we are given to believe that another character's love is so great that the secret, while disturbing to this character, does not really actively bother or disgust or hurt or haunt him/her, and is even incidental to a later expectation of happiness. Finally, we never get what we really want--a satisfactory, detailed explanation and apology from the character whose secret is exposed.5.Style and Technique. The [heavy] use of interior monologue needed major work. Koen is fond of alternating, minus quotes or italics, rapid-fire mental musings with fragments of famous poetry or Bible passages. The result is stream of consciousness on steroids. Next up, Koen often employs the hackneyed phraseology and dialogue tags of some less skillful writers . Finally, she writes large chunks of exposition and historical detail that are not worked into the plot or dialogue; they just sit there.6. Loose Ends. There are too many to count. The entire character of Jane could have been excised, because we are certainly given no lasting impression of what her character has contributed to the other characters or plotline. One character has a 3-page scene describing his wish to rape another character; despite the heavy foreshadowing, no assault is forthcoming. Roger never explains himself or his behavior during or after the falling-out. Tony--who by the end of the novel has shaped up to be an interesting character--is snatched out from under us in a manner that screams \\"sequel.\\" The list goes on.*** 3 Stars to indicate it interested/entertained me, but the problems above would likely keep me from investing in a copy."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"It's not often I don't finish a book, if the book starts off on the wrong foot, I usually stick with it until the end in the hopes it gets better, and also for the benefit of the doubt. Not with this book, it promptly went into my \\"started but not finished\\" file on my Kindle. I could not finish it, no matter how much I wanted to. From all of the reviews, I expected it to be good and couldn't wait to dive into it. I tried, really, I did try to like it, but after a while I found myself to be getting very annoyed, aggravated and exasperated. To start, the writing style is not the greatest, I became very annoyed with the numerous two word sentences....I did! I do! I will! Also, the characters babbled on endlessly, I found myself skimming and skipping a lot of parts. Detail is great in a book, it can draw a reader in to the character's world, but here, detail was used too much, too often and repetitively, it's like, Okay, I get it!! To say the least, I was very disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Seven years ago, when I was fourteen years old, I picked up this novel and absolutely fell in love with it. The style and detail of each character made the reader care not only about Barabara's fate but everyone as well. As an aspiring writer myself, I understand the importance of establishing a strong connection between the reader and the characters. This in effect allows there to be a level of suspense which carries the reader from beginning to end. The ability to create that sort of relationship is not an easy task. If you are unfamiliar with Koen's work, Through A Glass Darkly is the perfect introduction. She takes the time for you to understand the main characters and let's the drama unfold for itself. This is not merely a romance, but an interesting historical critique which revolves around the dynamics of a very dysfuntional family. Overall, I have always considered Karleen Koen to be an amazing author because she has taken the time and effort to polish her craft. The only disappointment is the little amount of information known about her, and the small number of novels published. To my knowledge,I have read all the books she has published thus far:Through A Glass Darkly &amp; Now Face to Face. If there are any other publications of her work I eagerly await to read them."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I bought this book hoping to obtain a portrait of the Georgian age, a compelling study of a family struggling to survive political intrigues and economic upheaval, and lastly, as a satisfactory romance. Well, this book did not work for me on any of these levels. The story is set around the failed Jacobite rebellion of 1715 (which forces the heroine's father into exile), the accession of the Hanoverians to the British throne, and lastly but not leastly, the almost concurrent economic crises in France (Law's bank) and the UK (the South Sea Bubble). The last event played a crucial role in the story, and was well-done. Unfortunately, the rest of the period was *not* so well-evoked.Part of the problem lay in the fact that so much of the story was set at the corrupt French court (the regency of the Duc d'Orleans for the young Louis XV), that more of French court intrigue - mostly sexual - was evoked than of British political, economic, and social life. However, the real problem probably lay in the heroine - who is a willful spoiled girl of 15 who has her bridegroom essentially bought for her by her doting grandmother. Barbara Alderley is not all that bad - she is a loving sister (to a wastrel eldest brother and younger siblings) and she is a fond granddaughter. She has suffered from negligent parents who married too young - a Jacobite father who has fled into exile, and a notoriously promiscuous mother (who like Barbara insisted on an early marriage that was a personal disaster). Unfortunately, neither of the marriages ring very true for the period. In the late 1600s and early 1700s, although there were doting parents, marriages were contracted strictly for financial and political reasons, as dynastic and familial alliances rather than love marriages. There were notable exceptions, but this part of the plot is not addressed very well. Barbara's grandmother and late grandfather are presented almost as copies of the 1st Duke and Duchess of Marlborough. The real Duke and Duchess of Marlborough are curiously absent.Some of the political luminaries of the day appear (notably Sir Robert Walpole) but are presented almost solely in terms of their relationship to Barbara's mother or her husband, not as personages in their own right with their own careers to make and dynasties to found.Most of the story is about extra-marital sexual liaisions. When Barbara is betrayed by her husband and when she experiences another devastating loss, she does not seek consolation in educating herself or in . Rather, she becomes a duplicate of her mother, taking lovers recklessly - rather like the notorious court favorites of the Restoration period. Despite her infidelities (and despite her husband's infidelity), the couple supposedly remain in love until the very end. How and why is never very clear to me.I should warn romance readers that there is no happily-ever-after unless you count a trip to a Virginian plantation as a HEA. Perhaps this is why the book has been compared to Gone With The End. However, for that book, the age and society in which the book was set was brilliantly evoked, and the heroine (while unlikeable in many ways) had a strong sense of self and of family. I could not feel the same way about THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY or about Barbara Alderley. Her sole merit was that she nursed her husband to the very end and that she loved certain people dearly. Otherwise, she was just another promiscuous beauty - and the book the story of her love affairs, that of her husband, and that of her mother and brother."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"A thoroughly riveting historical drama, Through A Glass Darkly drew me in slowly, I must admit, but before I knew it, I was wholly engrossed! I positively devoured the story, even as I tried to slow myself down to savor its various rich and frothy delights. Its backdrop of early Georgian England is a deep canvas painted with a master hand, which deftly positions the reader right there in the crowded ornate rooms or the fragrant apple orchard, with the winds of the 18th century in your ears.The characters are so expertly presented you begin to feel as if you really love them, and I for one carried them in my thoughts well after I had finished reading. I don't need to go into the plot, since other reviewers have done so well. I only want to add my voice to the chorus of cheers for this truly remarkable, even, for me, *life changing* book!A Bit About The Order Of The Three ConnecTed NovelsI have read the complete saga with real passion, including Dark Angels and Now Face to Face. I must admit I read them \\"out of order\\", at least, out of order of publication. I read TAGD first, then Dark Angels, and Now Face to Face last. I am now reading TAGD again, and I think I will pick up Dark Angels again next. If anyone is curious abut the order in which the books are best read, I would say as long as you don't read Now Face to Face first, you'll be fine.A Bit About My Class With The AuthorA few months ago I casually inspected the \\"About the author\\" on the back flap and my jaw dropped to see that Karleen Koen lives here in Houston. Well, I immediately contacted her through her publisher, and she emailed me back less than a week later, giving me her phone number and offering to meet to talk about her research. I am an amateur historian, and I am truly curious as to how historical fiction authors learn enough about a era to write about it with confidence, let alone really send the reader back in time. And Karleen truly has a gift for time travel.She is also a funny, kind, down-to-earth, fascinating woman. To read her books again, knowing the woman who created these vivid characters and stories, makes for a much richer, more thought-provoking experience.I cannot say enough abut Karleen Koen or her books. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"\\"When I was a child I spake as a child. I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I become a man I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly, but then face to face\\"Through a Glass Darkly is the second in a three book series set in Georgian England. Barbara is the granddaughter of the Duke and Duchess of Tamworth and she and her younger siblings were raised by their grandparents instead of their parents Kit and Diana Alderley. Kit is an exiled Jacobite involved in the plots to put James III on the throne and Diana is a scheming slut desperate to wed Diana off to a wealthy man to save her from her creditors. Diana is negotiating with the much older but very wealthy Roger Montgeoffry, Earl Devane, and Barbara is thrilled as she'd always loved Roger from afar - although Diana's insatiable greed might bring those talks to a screeching halt.The path to true love and married bliss is never easy, especially when you have a family as complicated and double dealing as the Barbara's, and it is way too complex to try and explain - just sit back and enjoy the fun. Roger eventually takes his new wife and business to Paris and an innocent Barbara soon gets quite an education in the debauched lifestyle of the French court and its courtiers. Eventually someone from Roger's past returns that thoroughly upsets Barbara's marital applecart and sends her life spinning out of control, and only Grandmamma can set it to rights. Or can she?And that's all I'm going to tell you - I don't write book reports. This is the second time I've read the book and I enjoyed it just as much as the first. While I enjoyed all of the family's antics, I most especially adored Grandmamma and her cats, as well as Barbara's very smutty mother who steals every scene she's in. I loved watching Barbara mature from a young innocent (you will want to slap her a few times) to a mature woman who could take just about anything life threw her way - and life throws her a lot of heartache. It broke my heart watching Tony's unrequited love for Barbara, and as for Philippe? Grrrrrr.This is a book to be savored, like a box of fine chocolate or a rich red wine. Highly recommended, and one I will read again and again and again. The first book in the series isDark Angelsand the last isNow Face to Face.

This is one of the books that when you read it, you could just kick yourself in the shin for not reading it sooner! I LOVE drama and this book did not disappoint.Through a Glass Darkly is a novel about Barbara Alderley and is set in England and France in the early 18th century. Barbara and her siblings were raised by her grandmother, the Duchess of Tamworth. Her mother, Diana, being too selfish and caught up in her own drama to worry about the children she bore and her father has just left the family, taking the money with him.When Barbara's mother informs her that plans are in motion for Barbara to wed Roger Montgeoffrey, she cannot contain herself, to her mother's surprise. Roger was an old friend of her grandfather's that she has been secretly in love with since she was younger. What Barbara does not know is that she is part of a deal her mother has concocted.The story goes on to follow Barbara as she moves to London and marries Roger. She quickly grows up when surrounded by the deception and cruelty of the English and French courts.I really enjoyed this novel. The characters were well-developed and easy to like, although they had their own faults (but that's what makes them real). Koen paints a very pretty picture through her words and you as the reader feel like you are right there with Barbara through all of her ups and downs. What was interesting to me was watching as Barbara tried to stay true to herself and her beliefs amidst the licentiousness of court. The love between Barbara and Roger was beautifully written, so much so, that you could feel it in your heart. One word of caution: have plenty of tissues ready when you are near the end (and if you do cry, then do in a separate room as your husband or he will more than likely make fun of you, like mine).Bottom line: I highly recommend this book to all historical fiction fans!Song: Torch by Alanis MorissetteFavorite lines:When you can no longer taste the divine nectar of life, when love no longer exists, then life is death.Never run away from the truth because you carry it on your shoulder and someday it will put its ugly face into yours and say, \\"Boo\\".Forgiveness: It is never done well in little bits and dabs. Do it all at once and never look back, or do not do it at all.Change is an easy thing to decide and a difficult thing to do. It is the day-to-day struggle of it that defeats people. Do not despair if old ways look good to you. Despair only if you fall into them too often."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"In 1988, when i read 'Glass' for the first time, I was fifteen years old, no older than Barbara, the heroine of Koen's masterpiece novel. Eleven years later, I have read this novel no fewer than ten times. I am amazed at the constant source of magic that is TAGD. Each read brings me deeper into the world of Barbara and her protective grandmother...each read brings me deeper into the realm of what it was to live and breathe in the eighteenth century. TAGD is a masterpiece and a forceful read. Easily one of the best novels ever written. My letter from Ms. Koen is framed and hanging on my wall :)"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I highly recommend it. This book will break your heart and make you jump for joy. Must read!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I really love this book. I have read it more times than I can count. Beautifully written. Do not waste your time with the sequel or the prequel, though."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time! It sat on my shelf for several years before I decided to read it. So glad I did."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Yes, Yes, Yes!! THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY is so good. I can't believe it took me nearly ten years to get to this book. I was absolutely enthralled with the book and put it up there with the likes of some of my other all-time favorite historical fiction such as THE PROUD BREED by Celeste DeBlasis and KATHERINE by Anya Seton.It takes place in London and Paris in the early 1700s. 15 year-old Barbara Ackerly is the granddaughter of the Duke and Duchess of Tamworth and has been raised in proper society standards. Her mother is attempting to arrange a marriage between her and an old family friend, Roger Montgeoffrey, Lord Devane. Roger is 42-years-old and Barbara has had a crush on him since she was about 10. Barbara's mother, Diana, a beautiful but nasty woman who likes to sleep around and is attempting to arrange the marriage in order to help pay off her enormous debts. Roger is interested in Barbara because by marrying her he will get the deed to some property he wants to develop. (Barbara's mother is deeply in debt due to her estranged husband's drinking and gambling). Barbara is excited at the prospect of marrying Roger. She just knows she can make him love her. However, Barbara's aunt has other ideas. She wants the property for her son, Tony, who is the latest Duke of Tamworth and does everything in her power so that the Barbara/Roger wedding does not become a reality. The story goes on from there. To tell much more would rob the reader of the pleasure of discovering all its drama for themselves. The characters are so real that I feel I know them. This is more of a historical novel than a romance. Sex scenes are not detailed.I have to give this a 5***** rating. It goes on my keeper shelf and on my list of favorite books of all time.I did try to read the sequel, but could never really get into it and gave up fairly early. I may try again later."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Although this sort of period romance isn't my usual cup of tea, &quot;Through A Glass Darkly&quot; remains one of my favorite novels, one that I've reread many times. The characters are vividly drawn, the story is engrossing, the writing style is lush. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This book is perfect. It had everything. Intrigue, drama, romance, beautiful people, a flawed heroine, everything. It is the only book I have read more than three times. This book set the benchmark for what a historical drama should be."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"My friend recommended this book to me saying it was reminiscent of Gone With the Wind. Frankly, my dear, Through a Glass Darkly blows Gone With the Wind away. I absolutely adored this book and the sequel Now Face to Face. Karleen Koen is a master story-teller. She brought this century to life for me. I felt as though I really knew the characters personnally. When I finished the books, it felt as though I had lost close friends."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I read this book when it first came out and just finished rereading it. This book is so well written I felt like I knew these people and I felt like I was there. A very well researched historical novel that teaches as well as entertains. If you like Gone With the Wind type books, you will love this one. It's hard to put down once you get started!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"It's true! I read Karleen Koen's novel, Through A Glass Darkly, several years ago and was spell-bound. I have always loved historical romance novels but this one broke the mold, with surprising plot twists and flawed heroines. My first novel, Willing Captive, was published in November 2000. I am proud of it...until I read Koen's novel again, then I feel compelled to work harder and write tighter. This is a fantastic novel. Buy it if you enjoy history and romance (Along the lines of Rosalind Laker novels)."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I just got done reading this amazing book. It touched my heart and soul. I have renewd my faith in god because of the reading of this book. I find the heart ach expressed to show the true reality of becoming a women. It is not like other romances were things turn out best for everyone. Mrs. Koen leaves you hanging on every word and beging for more!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I had the honor of meeting the author, Karleen Koen just after the book was released. Turns out, my brother had been helping her sister haul the manuscript home in boxes as it was being written. My brother wrangled an invitation to the tea the author's sister was throwing in her honor right in my neighborhood of Deer Park, Texas. I thought I loved the wonderful book simply because I had met Ms. Koen and found her to be so warm and gracious. After reading these wonderful reviews, I realize I am not alone in my love for this book. Ms. Koen wrote a work of art that is unsurpassed, and I recommend it to anyone who just wants to completely lose themselves for a few days. Her knowledge of the history of that era is almost as if she lived it. And her understanding of the ups and downs of even true love is unbeatable. I loaned my autographed copy to someone and never got it back. Awesome book."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I read this book when I was hardly 12 years old. I found it in a second hand store on top of some dusty old boxes. The cover interested me because it was so new and seemingly untouched. I took it home and spent that entire summer reading it again and again, thoroughly emmersed in a world that changed my life. I learned to really read from this book. I learned what it meant to create and to become a writer myself because this book was a work of art I had never experienced before. It made me aware of the imagination and inspirations that surround us. Koen created this beatifully woven history and story and brought to life a time period that has long been past. It filled my life with a direction that is present today. I have since read countless short stories, novels, books and so on by great authors like Vonnegut and Faulkner. But none will ever mean as much to me as Koen. Thank you."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Kathleen Koen intricately weaves a story capturing both your heart and imagination. She is a master at surprises and breaks your heart dealing with the bare truth. I have never, in my 40+ years of reading, enjoyed a novel this much."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"You'll love this one. Personally, when I read fiction, I like a bit more escapism in my reading. Real life is depressing enough. The book is well-written and historically accurate but it reminded me a bit too much of The Thorn Birds. Heart-wrenching, shocking and although I couldn't put it down (kind of like seeing a bad car accident and not being able to look away), I was more than happy when it was finished. Not the happiest kind of book to read in these trying times."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I'm only about 3/4 of the way through this book, and I have enjoyed it so far. The only thing I'm taken aback by is some of the explicit/perverse sex scenes. I don't believe I'm a prudish person, but there are just some things I don't want to know the details of. Especially when I'm reading a historical novel. I wish, however, that I hadn't read the reviews before I finished it since it supposedly leaves you hanging on a lot of the characters. I may post again after I finish."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This brilliant, if weighty novel made its appearance sometime around 1986. Lush and engrossing, it is truly like no other novel.A hybrid of romance, historical fact, and mystery (though not in the usual sense) it is difficult to write a compelling review of this work without giving away some of its secrets. And secrets it does possess.Perhaps the reason for my reticence will be explained when I describe the circumstances which first brought me to this work. Rifling though a bin at one of the major book retailers in Manhattan (the bin containing books with no jacket), this intriguing title caught my eye. With not inside flap to offer any description and no review blurbs on the back, I was at a loss as to what I was about to encounter.Finding the style easy and flowing, and the story interesting enough, I leisurely padded my way through the first several chapters. But then something happened. Call it a \\"hook,\\" call it anything you will, but the can of worms Koen opened up with the development of the characters took hold and there was simply not putting this book down.Innocent, young and pretty Barbara Anderley has led a sheltered life. When she and her sister and brothers were abandoned by her courtesan mother, they were taken in by a doting grandmother. Life on their 18th century country estate was a somewhat isolated and protected one.We follow Barbara from age 15 up until she is 21, and if we thought her formative years were an education, what she learns about her husband, his peccadilloes, sex in general, and the world around her will make most heads spin. If you look up \\"dark secrets\\" in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of Barbara's husband, Roger. Suffice it to say the trials and tribulations of married life that Barbara goes through will leave you gasping for air.Through a Glass Darkly is filled with sex scenes, but the descriptions are anything but offensive and they are so well woven into the plot that you won't be able to imagine the book without them. What happens to Barbara, the protagonist in the novel, and how Koen keeps the tension up to the climax is sheer genius."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This work is beautifully crafted. The author put so very much work into this, I hate to give it a bad review.The writing is stunning, the characters lovable and memorable...but the last 1/3 of the book desperately needs to be cut. This would be an astounding work of art, but there is simply TOO MUCH for the reader to endure.the travails of Jane and her husband (I will not go into details in case people actually care and it's a spoiler) just need to be cut out. Most of the woes and tragedies that happen after that point need to be cut.This cannot be enjoyed for the beautiful work it is when there are so many weeds clogging it. I loved the first 2/3, could not stop reading, couldn't put it down - the author's research is meticulous and spot-on...the writing is flawless...but please, oh please, someone take pity on what could be a fine work, and EDIT IT!!!!I stopped reading about 2/3 of the way through. Even I, who cannot do that as I have a reading compulsion, even I, couldn't wade through as this dragged on and on. I stopped caring about the characters that I had really come to care about...when you do not give the readers any relief of the depressing tragedies, they lose their ability to identify and to care.When even minor characters have major tragedies that are described in numbing detail, the important things are lost.please edit this book...It is painful to give it a less than stellar review, as this could be such a fine and stunning work.My apologies to the author. I can see what an enormous amount of work went into this, and I can see, also, why it was so very difficult to cut any of it out. But a good editor is badly needed here...an author can get too close to their own work to see that some of their precious story needs to be sacrificed. There are many, many, many (MANY) scenes in here that can be hinted at rather than given in excruciating detail...if you emphasize every single thing, the reader feels utterly bombarded.The meticulous and hard work will show still, even if some chapters are cut away, some happenings mentioned in a single paragraph rather than a hundred pages.still. Fine work. It will be glorious one day, when someone edits it."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This 700+ page tome is such an engrossing read, I was almost sad to finally finish it (thankfully there's a sequel). The book opens when Barbara is fifteen and her mother is plotting her marriage to Roger, a man old enough to be her father (he's in his 40s). Barbara's grandmother, a spirited woman who holds the family together, doesn't fully support the union though Barbara desperately wants it as she has been in love with Roger for years. Eventually, despite the scheming of Barbara's mother which causes the collapse of the impending marriage, the two are married.Immediately upon marrying they head to Paris for a few months and Barbara is thrust into her new role as a high society wife. She desperately wants Roger to love her as she loves him and she is disappointed when this is harder than she thought. She has misteps as she learns how to survive - and thrive - in society. But Roger remains just out of reach, alternating between a passionate, caring lover and a distant, absent husband.Money and the economy of the time (late 1700s) play a big part in the book and the characters' lives and how they're shaped. Roger - and therefore Barbara - are wealthy and live a life of luxury, but this comes at a cost. Gossip runs wild and influences actions. When Barbara learns something scandalous (I won't spoil it!) it causes her to flee her marriage. Though apart, Barbara continues to love Roger, even if she is hurt by his actions and angry at him. Later, when circumstances bring them together again she cannot help but feel for him and wonder what their future may be.Lies, deceit, love, passion, loyalty, and greed all play out in this excellent novel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"A few years ago, I found a copy of \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" in hardcover at a used book store. I fell in love with its layered story and lovable characters, and read it again and again. I purchased the edition here after my copy eventually fell apart, and it's every bit as lovely as the hardcover edition.This is one of the finest examples of historical fiction I've ever read, outpacing popular authors like Philippa Gregory by a mile. Fans of Kathleen Winsor's \\"Forever Amber\\" or Ken Follett's \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" will love it. The prequel and sequel to \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" are also highly recommended. If you love a lush storyline and flawed, human characters with a range of emotions, this is one worth reading."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Definitely read these books (Dark Angels, Now:Face to Face, and Through a Glass Darkly) if you love a book that will feed your soul. They're tragic and triumphant, heartwarming, adventurous, intriguing characters, chock full of political and historical detail, and amazing detailed descriptions.Koen's three books are honestly the most engaging, beautifully written books I've read in years. We all read books and see them through our own key hole of perception, and for me this was essentially a story of personal growth. Barbara is an inspiring, strong, resourceful woman; a heroine, really. A character like this is hard to find in a book, and when you find one so well written you not only feel a connection to the story, but are transported to her world.The relationships are written so cleverly. Koen manages to make you see a character's personality more in a look or gesture than with their dialogue. You see what's behind their words. You really do feel and sense everything that's not being said...it's almost difficult to put into words.It is also the story of a family and what the women do to survive, and all of the problems that arise within and outside family walls.The family home as well as the developing sights of London are always described down to the detail of the scents of the flowers in the breeze. You can almost hear the jingling of the harnesses on the horses, the bell in the tower, the swish of a gown...There was also ample political and historical information."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This was an historical, emotional read. I loved it...every page.It brings the entire background of life in that period so that youcan see and feel it. I feel like I knew the characters. The researchwas amazing."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"through the glass darkly is one of the greatest romance novels of all time. Simply because of the way Koen makes the characters come alive. Each significant female character holds her own. Diana's heartlesness,Barbarba's love, Theresa's poverty and the grandmothers age, make each one human.Barabara's love for her husband is both compelling and realistic. Koen shows step by step their love for each other develop.This book is amazing, heartstopping, beautiful, poetic and deep. You can read it multiple times but still come away with something different.If you want to discover love the bitterness of life Read it. It's worth it"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I read this book about a year after it was published, and I loved it. Recently, I decided to purchase it and read it again, and now I love it even more. Karleen Koen does a phenomenal job of taking the reader past sympathy for the characters, and actually making you feel empathetic as you read the book.Barbara is a timeless heroine, going from naive first love to the disillusioned acceptance of her married life, she starts the book as a child and emerges a young, strong, woman.This book possesses all of the things that make historical romance great: diverse characters, rich descriptions of opulent settings, politics, corruption, fashion and manners. But the underlying themes of unconditional love, and undying faith are the things that really make this a novel worth reading.Although this book appears voluminous and long, the story is so well written and plot driven that the 700+ pages seem not to be enough.Barbara and Roger made me cry, Diana made me laugh. Much like life, this book offers the bitter and the sweet. Excellent writing and enriching reading."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"My suggestion would be that an editor get hold of this with a red pen. The pages could be reduced by almost half and not much would be lost.I picked this book because historical romantic fiction is one of my favorite genres. As history it is \\"good\\"; accurate in the economics, life, and prevalent morbidity in early 18th century Europe. The author includes the rise and fall of \\"new money\\" as well as the endurance of \\"old money\\" and title. The romance is more sexual and many times deviant with far too many affairs. The book gives the impression that if you were in London or France no one sleeps with their spouses. (This includes the handsome, risqu&eacute; husband of the heroine who also finally succumbs to revenge sex with others).I try desperately to finish every book that I start and this book pressed the limits of that personal commitment. Details of description were WAY out of hand and I found my self skimming quickly to try to get to the next morsel of a far too dragged out plot. (Did I really need to read a whole page of \\"Robinson Crusoe\\"? If I wanted to read Robinson Crusoe I would READ Robinson Crusoe!) I actually couldn't wait to finish the book so I could move on.The ending poises you for a sequel but believe me, I am content to leave everyone just where they are. I choose to believe somewhere in the historical romantic fictional world they lived historically, romantically, and fictionally happy.There were times the book was interesting and page turning, but those times were rare. If you read this, do not expect a riveting, appropriately paced plot. Expect to keep reading if only to say, \\"I climbed Mt. Everest and won!\\""},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book! In fact, had to purchase the prequel and sequel companion books. Found myself immersed in the characters and couldn't wait to turn the page to see what was coming next. Ending of sequel was weak, incomplete and left me dissatisfied - what happened to the lead characters? Perhaps another sequel is in the works? Worth your time to read - enjoy!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Disappointing...you get wrapped up in the character, feel her pain, then try to muddle through gaps of time where you can't tell what's going on, and suddenly new people are in the picture. The ending of the book was the most frustrating. If you go through 6 years of misery, why do you suddenly leave the only person who has shown you support and love? I know a sequel has been written, but the reviews are far from glorious. I will not be purchasing it. I think I will leave our heroine in the ocean."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Not as well written as Philippa Gregory books, but very enjoyable. Would have preferred a book more about royal family."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I loved this book. It was enjoyable and interesting and I laughed and cried but mostly i just couldnt put it down."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I wish I could give this book 7 stars. It's complex, fascinating, compelling reading of a type that you can no longer find in historical novels today. Somehow I missed it when it came out, but I'm rather glad I did because it was such a pleasure to read a novel this good now.I have just finished reading the sequel which is just as good and comes to a very satisfying ending, but not without a great deal of angst.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"We just got back from a cruise down the Danube from Prague to Budapest where our traveling buddy was reading this book, Through the Glass Darkly.

What a talent!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Once in a great while, you will come across a book that leaves you stunned by its creativity, lush background, and unforgetable characters.

This is a remarkable story with a substantive plot. It is fulfilling. Although some of the characters had a frivolous nature indicative of the time setting none of the characters/secondary characters were frivolous. Every single character had a purpose and added depth to the story. The characters were alive and complex! It's a story about history, romantic ideals, reality after disillusionment, intrigue, selfishness, selflessness, pitfalls of vanity and excess, and life's journey's ugliness and beauty. What an adventure! It will leave an impress long after you finish the beautiful story. Can't wait to read the sequel and prequel!!!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I first read this book years ago .. when I found it available as a Kindle ebook I had to grab it!I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading historical fiction. This one is worth the time.."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I love to read, but the author has over done it. It's too long and drawn out. There are too many things going on. The majority of the book, I skimmed over and just flipped pages. I was not impressed. I only read the entire book because I wanted to find out what happened to Barbra and Roger. There is way to much going on and a lot of useless information given. I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends or family. I feel that the author should have focused on the 2 main characters and their story, but the author just goes into so much non-sense in the book and just draws it out. How this book is a \\"New York Times Best Seller\\" is beyond me. It's not that great. Choose for yourself how you feel. I chose this book because it had good reviews from people, but I don't think those were honest reviews."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"The way this story is written is odd. I never felt a flash of anxiety, happiness, excitement, etc. It was just flat. The plot is what kept me reading because a great potential always seemed to be hovering around the next corner. The fights, the sex, the turmoil, and the sorrow were beyond confusing me with the authors inability to maker me FEEL any of these things. The book is in two parts and I found the transition any thing but seamless and compelling. Let me get to the point...I won't even be giving this author a second chance, it was that big of a let down. Two stars for the over all vision and idea of the plot."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I was amazed that a book this long could hold my attention so firmly.

The details of the late 1700's in England and France captured my attention and the way Koen writes the characters feelings, thoughts, and actions that literally passed through me and into my very core. It has the strength to make even me, a very tough, and hard pleasing person, cry and worry over the characters' dilemmas. Since I do not have much time on me, I must wrap things up. This is the best novel that I have read so far its twists and turns kept me turning pages from early morn to late at night wondering what would happen next until everything ended. I love this book so much I went out and bought it right after I finished (I had rented the book from the library when I first read it) it! I would totally recommend this book to any fan of: heartbreaking love affairs, old English/French history and of course a long, hearty 743 page novel to pass the time reading."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I just read this book and it has been almost impossible for me to put it down. If you read one book this summer make sure this is the one. I have not yet read the sequel but I can hardly wait to get it and read it.

This book will stay with you for a long time, and the characters will become a part of your life."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Through A Glass Darkly is a book that will never leave you.

I just reread it for I believe the 6th time since it was first published. Although it no longer makes me cry as it did the first time, I am always misty. The only letter I have ever written to an author was to Karleen Koen begging for a sequal. Unfortunatly, the sequal is no near the triumph that this book is. If you haven't read it, you should.

There are words and phrases that have been dropped from the ends of some of the passages. I know this for sure because I started reading this on a library copy of the book. I emailed customer support and they blamed the publisher and told me the only way to get a refund was to have them stop streaming the book to me. This didn't seem fair as I'm still trying to read this copy. I asked for some kind of discount or something on another Kindle book but they said it was all or nothing. Customer support then wanted me to tell them exactly where the text was dropped! Again, maybe it's me, but I don't think it's right to ask someone to do your editing work when there is absolutely no compensation. In conclusion, Amazon was the one who collected the money from me and they should be the ones to stand behind the goods they sell.

I'll start with what I liked.The first part of this book was very good. It was interesting to see Barbara slowly work her way into Roger's heart and life, little by little. I also liked the suspense that was added by the author's little hints about this \\"great secret\\" about Roger. The part of the book set in France was also really good. I really liked learning about French society during that period, especially the \\"behind the scenes\\" look. My favorite part, though, were some of the secondary characters. Roger's two employees, White and his manservant (name?), were hilarious. I also really liked Therese and Richelieu. The author also didn't spare details about the less pretty side of life in this time such as rotten teeth and smallpox epidemics that nearly took out whole families at a time.One of my main complaints about this book is how just as you hit the climax and Barbara finally finds out Roger's \\"big secret,\\" the author skips to four or so years later. That's what I was waiting to read about and I felt cheated. The reader learns these things in flashbacks from Barbara. We even missed out on her affair with Richelieu. Also, her behavior after she finds out about Roger is a little cliche and frankly I just found Barbara plain annoying throughout most of the book. Another problem I had, which is a small one, is Barbara's age. I know that it was common for older men to marry younger women, but I couldn't get past the fact that he was older than her parents - by a lot! Also, I didn't care for such a young heroine, she was just a child. This might not bother other people, but I just get tired of reading about such young heroines.All in all, this was a good book, and I kept turning the pages to find out what would happen. There is a sequel which I also plan to read."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"...Whoever shelved this book with romance novels was dead wrong. It is far, far more substantive than the usual watery romance fare. To begin with, Roger, the main male character, the heart of Barbara Alderley's desire, possesses all the qualities of a romance-novel hero, with one little flaw. Which, of course, I will not reveal, lest Amazon axes yet another one of my reviews. Suffice it to say, it is not his fear of heights or bad memories about a cold-hearted mother (standard romance novel \\"dark secrets\\") that will pain Barbara, his wife.In addition, the book is far, far darker than most romance novels are. There is death--quite a lot. People die, children die, smallpox comes and wipes out whole families. (Koen's descriptions of smallpox and its consequences are stomach-turning and heart-breaking at the same time.) By the end of the book, Barbara will suffer so much that the fortitude she shows is absolutely remarkable (somebody said she was winy; most modern heroines would have long been on Prosac, if they had to go through what she goes through in the book).Another reason why it is not a romance novel is that the characters are complex. As i said, Barbara was wonderful--and a difference between the Barbara of 15 at the beginning of the book, and Barbara of 21 at the end of the book is startling--and vivid. Both her grandmother, the Duchess of Tamworth (the entire family is painted, rather masterfully, from the Marlboroughs), and her mother, Diana, are wonderful. You love the former, you want to murder the latter. Roger is, of course, a true fallen angel--and he manages to enchant you absolutely, much like he enchanted his young wife. And of course, the most controversial (I think) character in the book--the absolutely evil, but captivating and tragic, Roger's friend, Philippe, Prince de Soissons.Finally, it is quite unlike a romance novel in that it provides the reader with an amazing amount of historical detail. Koen did an astounding amount of research, including on-site research in England and France. She manages to describe the contemporary English (and French) society with such masterful strokes, you really feel THERE. Their weddings, funerals, theater, everyday life, clothing, sex, death, food, the court, history--everything.All of that said, it is not a historical novel, either--the single historical event described in much detail is the terrible South Sea Bubble crisis of 1721, in which the lives of characters become entangled. Indeed, I think, this book quite stands out amidst women's novels--it is meticulously researched, fascinating, beautiful, poignant, sad, and very life-affirming. Perhaps the best book I've read in the past year."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Through A Glass Darkly is my favorite novel of all time. Simply put this novel is a masterpiece of writing.The setting, 18th-century London and France. The main character, Barbara Alderley, a young girl from a wealthy family is married off to a much older man by the name of Roger Montgeoffry.This is a magnificent tale in which the reader becomes swept up in the turmoil that ensues as the novel progresses. The characters in which there are many come to life due to the wonderful way in which the author Karleen Koen writes them. The novel is overaught with emotion,the description of places and settings in the novel are rich and glorius. You will come to know the characters on an intimate level. Loving some and loathing others. I loved the way in which the author wrote the book to show it's many layers so that you understand the smaller characters in the novel as well as the main ones.This is a gripping and tragic tale but also densely atmospheric. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"In the tradition of Kathleen Windsor's Forever Amber, Karleen Koen gives us the story of Barbara Montgeoffrey, a young woman who matures as she ages. The story begins when she is fifteen and marries Roger, a man much, much older than herself but whom she is determined to marry nonetheless. Barbara, like her counterpart in Forever Amber, is headstrong and willful, but I think Barbara is more likeable as a character.The cast of characters is fantastic: Barbara's grandmother, the aging Duchess of Tamworth; Barbara's mother, the spoiled and selfish woman who tries to get a divorce from her husband; Barbara's cousin Tony, a shy boy who grows into a very capable young adult and who remains in love with her even after all that she goes through; Barbara's husband Roger, a man who is not as bad as we think he is; Philippe, Roger's on and off again \\"friend;\\" Therese, Barbara's French lady's maid, who becomes an invauable companion; and Hyacinthe, a boy originally bought to serve as Barbara's slave, but who becomes like a son to her. There are also Harry and Charlotte, two pugs who are almost people themselves.The book is divided into two parts, beginning with Diana's decision to marry her daughter to Roger Montgeoffrey, a bachelor who is notorious but also incredibly wealthy and well-connected at both the English and French courts. Barbara, completely in love with him gets her wish and they marry, but not without the forebodings of the Duchess, the old woman who has cared for Barbara since she was a small child. They go to France, where Barbara is pursued by many men and Roger finds himself becoming jealous over them.The first part ends with a bang. It is then that Barbara learns about the true nature of the relationship between her husband and the Frenchman Philippe. It is at this point that Barbara loses her innocence and steps into adulthood. She and her husband separate for a period of four years, not to be reconciled until almost the last moment.The second part opens four years later. It opens with another bang: the popping of the South Sea Bubble, a crisis that had deleterious effects on not only England, but its colonies as well. By this point Barbara has become notorious fer her bavior: sleeping with several different young men, causing them to duel, and getting sent away from the Hanoverian court. There's a reconciliation with Roger, but it comes much later than the reader would have liked.This was a wonderful book; filled with insightful research and storytelling, I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction and romances--but not the cheesy kind."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Having tired of the constant hit-or-miss factor of self-published works, I bought this book on a whim. I knew nothing about it - I just recognized the title as a famous one and thought I'd try it out.I had no idea what I was in for.I dreamed about this book, and I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it. It was beautifully written and had some of the best prose I've ever read. (I highlighted many passages in my Kindle to read again later on.)With the possible exception of Abigail, whose \\"I always know the right thing that everyone should do\\" attitude was a bit too self aware for my tastes, the characters truly came to life on the page. I became emotionally vested in all of them, which made what the author did to them (and, by extension, to me) all the more unfair.I'll agree with a previous reviewer in that I really, really, really wish the last third of the book didn't exist. (See spoilers below.) If it didn't, this would likely be my favorite book of all time.If I had to rate \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" based on *how* it made feel, I would only give it one star. But I gave it five stars because it did make me feel something and is extremely well written - two of my biggest criteria for a good read.The writer has a strong command of the English language and knows how to effectively weave emotion into a story. The words were like silk on the page, but they cut with the sharpness of a knife. It is unfortunate that they cut so deeply.[SPOILERS]I didn't like who the main character became in the last third of the book, and I say this as a judgment based on her moral standards, not mine. I just don't believe she would really make some of the decisions she did; her actions felt very out of character to me, no matter how upset she was.There was so much tragedy in this book that I wanted so badly, so desperately for a happy ending, but I could barely finish the last 20 pages because I was crying so hard - literally grieving. I found myself angry at the author for playing God in such a cruel way, for making these characters' lives so bitterly unfair.There is an ongoing theme in this story, which could be summarized as \\"Whatever your heart desires most, you will never have it, and anyone you care about will die.\\"Everyone's life was miserable in this book. Although some of it was their own doing, the result of some very human mistakes, most of it was beyond their control. And just when you think 'It can't possibly get any worse', it does. And then it gets worse again. And it never ends, never gets better. It's okay to have a down ending in a story, but not if the rest of it is as depressing as this one is.I've never been left with such a feeling of despair as I felt with this gut-wrenching book, which literally made me sick with its apparent message of 'Life is inherently unfair, and nothing you can do will ever make it right'.It took me several days to recover from this story. It truly is not for the faint of heart! :("},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I really hated to see this book end. Wonderful descriptions of the 1700 era of England and France.It really feels like you are \\"there\\"."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is the first book in a long long time that I read front to back in the course of a day. I stayed up most of the night reading.I was soooo drawn into this century, to these towns, into these people's lives.I was saddened by the lost opportunities between Roger and Barbara. So many lost years because both had been so terribly hurt.I absolutely love historical novels and its been quite some time since one has entranced me so."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I love, love, love, love, love historical fiction.Through a Glass Darkly: A Noveland its sequelNow Face to Face: A Noveltake you on a grand tour through English and French high society in the 1700s. Koen's evocative writing style and incredible descriptions of time and place will transport you into a world of intrigue, paranoia, and love (and fortunes) lost and gained. The love story underpinning the first two books alternates between touching and heart-breaking and is as fine a cautionary tale about the double-edged nature of getting what one wants as any I have had the pleasure of reading.Dark Angels: A Noveltakes you deeper into the backstory of one of the most endearing and curmudgeonly characters in the two original novels. And fortunately for you, dear readers, the books are all readily available now (when I was first introduced to the series, through the prequel, I had to painstakingly track down used copies of the sequel - and pay an arm and a leg for it. Mind you, it was completely worth it. But still...)"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This book was a joy to read. I always have a hard time taking someone else's reviews and recommendations on books, but I was happy this one wasn't a disappointment. This book actually pulled at my heartstrings and found myself shedding a few tears here once I started connecting with the characters. My only complaint is that the paperback version I received from the publisher, Sourcebooks Publishing, is a grammatical nightmare. Punctuation missing from paragraphs, people's names are misspelled. But all in all, the experience of this book was lovely."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE BOOKS THAT DREW ME INTO HISTORICAL FICTION. AWESOME BOOK. MS. KOEN DRAWS YOU IN TO THE CHARACTERS SO MUCH SO THAT YOU ARE LITERALLY CROSSING YOUR FINGERS AND PRAYING SHE BRINGS THE CHARACTERS BACK FOR ANOTHER NOVEL."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Not since Gone With The Wind, The Count Of Monte Cristo, and The Far Pavilions have I read through a thick epic so quickly. The sheer, rich luxury of Koen's writing left me deeply involved in the characters and their lives, breathless with their intrigues, charmed by their goodness and appalled at their cruelty.Lush, sweeping, magnificent, grand, sad, tragic, poetic, risqu&eacute;, all of these words apply to 'Through A Glass Darkly'. Set in England and France in the 1700's, we move languidly through wealth, financial downfalls, boom markets and crashing markets, clandestine and overt love affairs, depravity in the elegant mansions, endearing love, tragedy in illness and death, true friends and schemers, loyalty and betrayal. The major character of the epic is Barbara Alderly, granddaughter to the powerful dowager Duchess Of Tamworth. Barbara's mother, the Vicountess Diana Alderly, is still stunningly beautiful even after birthing eleven children to her now estranged husband Kit, seven of whom still lived in Tamworth while Diana freely roamed London.Diana, a very un-motherly woman, has found herself in debt and is attempting to arrange a marriage for fifteen-year-old Barbara to the handsome, forty-two year old Earl of Devane, Roger Montgeoffrey. Both Duchess and Diana are shocked to discover that Barbara is delighted, she has loved Roger Montgeoffrey for years, since he served under her grandfather in the war.Barbara follows Diana to London, where Diana begins to play Roger against her widowed sister-in-law Lady Abigail Saylor for a valuable piece of property in London called Bentwoodes, Barbara's dowry. Diana knows Bentwoodes is the only reason the Earl of Devane will marry Barbara, but needs money more than the match.Intrigues and backstabbings abound until the distraught Barbara makes some mistakes and writes to her grandmother to help her right her wrongs. In doing so, the elderly Alice, Duchess of Tamworth, brings her power and influence to London, seeing to it that her beloved granddaughter receives what she so wishes for, Roger Montgeoffry. Abigail's son, the next Duke of Tamworth, stumbling and bumbling Tony, also falls in love with his pert cousin Barbara.The book is divided into two parts, Barbara's innocence and Barbara's awakening to the hardships and cruelties that life brings with maturity. The many players in this cast of exquisitely painted characters, Barbara, Roger, Diana, the Duchess and her tirewoman Annie, Prince Philippe, Caesar White, Francis Montrose, Tommy Carlyle, future Duke Tony Saylor, Barbara's older brother Harry, Lady Abigail Saylor, Barbara's childhood friend Jane, Barbara's great aunts, maids and servants and pets, each play an intricate role in the saga of Barbara and the Tamworth estates and family.'Through A Glass Darkly' is such a rich epic that it will appeal to a broad audience, it's not just another historical romance or a boring account of flagrant Paris in the 1700's. With fully fleshed characters and a descriptive prose that leaves you smelling the flowers, tasting the food, and feeling the rich fabrics on your skin, Koen's novel is not one that you will soon forget. Definitely worth a 'buy'. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I am only a hundred or so pages into this wretched book, and I really don't know if I have the heart to go on...if I do, then I'll write a part 2 to this review. If I can be bothered.I bought this book thinking that it would be a wonderful, serious, well-written historical novel. Ha! Boy, was I suckered! This isn't a serious book - it's a romance novel, of the Harlequin/Mills and Boon variety (though not even a very good one), trying to masquerade as real literature. But at least romance books usually have the decency to stop at a few hundred pages long, whereas this book goes on for almost seven hundred LENGTHY pages. Ugh! I don't know why the author made it so long-winded. She really shouldn't have. It's painfully full of filler and unnecessary stuff. I myself can sum up the first hundred pages a lot more briefly and effectively:Evil wanton mother: \\"Daughter, I am cruel like a stereotypical Disney cartoon villainess, and I say, you must marry Roger.\\"Spineless, insipidly dull but virtuous daughter: \\"Oh goody! I love Roger! I can't wait.\\"They go to London. Although witless daughter knows that her family have fallen on hard times, she is surprised to find she is forced to live in the kind of dingy little abode you live in when you've fallen on hard times. Still, she doesn't complain, because she's a doormat who never says anything, except about how much she loves Roger, of course. Repeatedly.Handsome and impossibly perfect hero, Roger, enters. He says \\"I'll marry her because she looks just like her grandfather.\\"Silly heroine swoons.Relatives complain about the dowry.And that's pretty much it.I wasn't kidding about the grandpa thing. The hero actually says to the heroine,\\"God save me, Barbara, but you are the very image of your grandfather!\\" And the heroine takes it as the NICEST compliment she's ever received, and proof that Roger is a kind man who likes her. Argh! If some guy told me I looked like my grandpa, I DEFINITELY wouldn't take it as a compliment - I'd assume he was insulting me by telling me I looked like an elderly MAN! That, or I'd worry that he fancied my grandpa.The dialogue in this book is inane. But at least its gaffs are mildly amusing at times, albeit unintentionally. Not so the shallowness, and sometimes extreme nastiness, of the writer in the way she describes her characters. In true romance book style, EVERY character's physical appearance is described in great detail, and their looks assessed and rated, as if how physically beautiful they are - or aren't - is a guide to their worthiness as a person. The hero is of course impossibly good looking, not to mention rich and fashionable and beloved by ALL, and his good looks are mentioned CONSTANTLY, over and over and over again, page after page. It's like being hit with a beautiful sledgehammer. I wanted to yell at the author, \\"Okay, I get it, he's handsome, there's no need to keep going on about it. Can you not find something else to say about him? Something INTERESTING perhaps? Some character trait other than just him looking good?\\" The hero was so perfect, so utterly flawless in his physical appearance, that I just couldn't believe he was a real human being, so the story around him seemed unrealistic too. The heroine, also, was naturally a physically attractive character (grandpa comments aside), though thankfully her looks were rarely mentioned, unlike the hero's. But apart from those two, the only other attractive character is the mother, and only because it was necessary for her to be, since she was cast in the stereotypical part of the wanton villainess who enjoys seducing men. (Why is it that in so many of these clicheed stories, the heroine is virtuous and good, but the villainess is the kind of woman who'll sleep with a number of men - what a cliche, as if women who sleep around are always bad! So old fashioned!)The pious, virtuous grandmother of the heroine is not mentioned as pretty, but at least she's not much maligned. The author is reasonably kind, for once, but again falls into the trap of seeming to imply that a woman must be virtuous (not to mention God-fearing) to be a good person.The other characters in this book, outside of the four I just mentioned, are described as fat, or old, or ugly, or a combination of the three, and the author absolutely RIDICULES them for their physical imperfections, going on and on and on about it. And naturally, these not-so-pretty characters are always stupid and mean and greedy, because we all know that if you're not beautiful on the outside, you're not beautiful on the inside, right? The overweight maid Clemmie, especially, is ridiculed at every opportunity, her weight constantly made fun of, her looks derided, and the author has written her as a stupid, clumsy character, one that the prettier characters laugh at (seemingly with the author's approval). Many, many parts of the book also deride the elderly characters, talking about their wrinkles, and how silly the characters look and behave and think, and how they shouldn't be dressing in 'younger fashions', and how much fatter and uglier they've become with age.Argh! I was repulsed! It was so mean and shallow and beauty-obsessed, as if only pretty people are worth something.The only halfway interesting minor character was a gay man who's a friend of Roger's. But even he seems like a charicature, a stereotype, flamboyant and gossipy and b*tchy and openly promiscuous, with no real depth or substance or life outside of his role in the hero's life. I thought he seemed more like what people in the eighties who didn't actually know any gay people might think a gay man from San Francisco would be like, based on what they'd seen on tv comedy skits, rather than what a gay man a few centuries ago would actually have been like. I am almost tempted to keep reading the book to see if his character is going to be further developed. But I sense that things aren't going to improve for this character, and may just get worse. He's probably only there to spread some gossip or something.But anyway, back onto the subject of shallowness, I got sick of reading every character's appearance being picked apart, like a corpse by a vulture. It was like reading one of those cruel celebrity gossip magazines that are full of articles about which star has put on, or lost, a few pounds, and in which all the celebrities are constantly scrutinised for every little flaw in their appearances. If you like those kinds of magazines, or if you're the type of person who likes to criticise the way that people around you look (presumably because you look so perfect yourself) then you'll probably like this book. It'll probably help if you're also the kind of person who loves romance books and those really trashy, barely-believeable soap operas that are screened during the day on tv. However, if you're a lover of intelligent, witty, well-written or truly entertaining literature, and if you're not totally hung up on personal appearances, and bad cliches make you cringe, perhaps you might do better to bypass this book and look for a better one. Also, I don't think guys are going to like this book. But hey, I may be wrong. Guys can be really unpredictable. And that's the way I like them. I like that guys are interesting and mysterious and individual, with more to them than just IMPOSSIBLY PERFECT LOOKS!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I'm no expert on literature or anything, but I know what I like and don't like. This book falls into both categories! Lots of reviews have gone far into the plot, so I won't. But there are some spoilers in the third paragraph and beyond.I liked most of Part 1. I thought the love story between Barbara and Roger was unique, and most of the characters, with all their scheming, were interesting. The story was just fast-paced enough to keep my attention.But then I came to Part 2 and it all fell apart. The end of Part 1 was a cliffhanger (although not a big surprise) and I wanted to know exactly how everything unfolded, just as Part 1. Instead, in my impression, the story goes vague. I hated that the author just skipped four years. I didn't feel as if I knew Barbara or her choices anymore. Roger never had a chance to explain himself. And a lot of time was taken building Tony up for just a sad little piffle at the end.The ending was a huge disappointment with loose ends to tie up; just because a book needs a sequel to finish the story doesn't mean I want to read the sequel. As others have said, the character of Jane added nothing to the story. Finally, the author chose a strange way to show Tony's mental dullness, by having him speak in partial sentences. It was distracting and annoying. She could have described him as mumbling or just saying off-the-wall things.Overall, I did read the whole book, and it kept my attention to the end, which is why I gave it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Even though i've been an avid reader of romance novels for some time, I've usually found something lacking. But in this novel it definintly has it all. The heroine and hero is actually portrayed as actual flawed human beings also capable of great love. This story will sweep you back to a time of great decadence and scandel, and how this stories characters live in it is very accurate. Even some of the characters trully existed! Barbara Aderley is a charming women living in a very dysfunctunal family. And even in the face of utter betrayel still finds the strength to love. The feelings between her and her cousin is among my favorite parts of the book. Karleen Koen very eloquently wrote this book and stirred my emotions more than any other novel has and, believe me, and i've read many. The second part of this novel was also very well written but i felt it lacked much of the emotions the first one had. I feel there will be a third installment before the story of Barbara and her search for true happiness is found. This is the greatest of books and a definite classic. Ms. Koen, thanks for giving us this book. AND PLEASE WRITE MORE!!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"There is something about summertime that just begs for a long, lazy read. Books for the beach have become the catch-phrase for this sort of thing, novels full of intrigue and passion, of lovers doing all of the wrong things, and plenty to make you sit up and go Oh! How could he do that!? If your tastes run towards the historical novel, author Karleen Koen has come up with a humdinger of a story, full of frustrated longings, greed, and plenty of tangles to keep anyone engrossed for a week or two.Queen Anne of England has died, and a new dynasty has come to rule in England. King George I is from the small German kingdom of Hannover, and has a very tenuous claim to the English throne. Already there is a brewing rebellion, and for one noble English family, strife is already pulling the family apart.Alice, the Duchess of Tamworth, is elderly, and has already buried her beloved husband and all of her children, save one. That particular child, the vicious, sexual Diana, is creating scandal by trying to divorce her husband, a known Jacobite rebel, and is more than willing to do anything to see it happen. One of those things is selling her daughter, the beautiful, vivacious Barbara off to the highest bidder. The same goes for her son, Harry. Clearly Diana is one of those parents who doesn't care too much for the wellbeing of her children.For Barbara, there is only one man that she cares for -- the wealthy, charming Roger, Lord Devane. She has had a hopeless love for him since childhood, and now at the age of fifteen, she's certain that he is the man for her, despite the fact that he's more than old enough to be her father. And Roger, for his part, has always been on good terms with the Tamworth family -- he was a close friend of Alice's husband, Richard, serving alongside him in the long wars with Louis XIV of France. And Barbara, with her enchanting voice, red-gold hair and vibrancy, has more than a little of her grandfather with her.But for every rosy romance, there's bound to be a few spots of trouble. And for Roger and Barbara, the list is long. There's her mother, Diana, whose greed nearly ruins everything, Aunt Abigail who wants Barbara to marry not at all, her hulking son Tony, the current Duke of Tamworth. But Barbara perserves and when she finally manages to get Roger as her husband, it seems that the future is going to unfold itself into a glamourous future.Most of the novel takes place in Paris, where Barbara and Roger settle for a time. This is the time of the Regency, where the child-king Louis XV is little more than a mouthpiece for his uncle, Philippe d'Orleans. Paris is a decadent, free-wheeling society where gambling, sex, duels and adultery are common. For an innocent like Barbara, madly in love with her husband, it's going to be an eye-opening adventure. She attracts several would be lovers, including the wicked Duc de Richelieu, and finds out that wanting isn't quite the same as having -- especially when an old friend of her husband's turns up, more than eager to renew the relationship...I don't want to reveal much more of the plot here, as it's quite a potboiler, full of betrayals and friendships. Koen's writing style tends to be rather florid, but she manages to keep it from getting too over the top. I was hooked by the descriptive writing, and how she managed to let the reader into this world of aristocratic indulgence. There's flashes of humour and insight, along with some pretty deep personal anguish and unhappiness. Too, she's not afraid to have tragedy strike a beloved character either.Best of all, it was her knowledge of the lifestyles and attitudes of the period that made this book such a pleasure to read. A major twist of the plot invloves the infamous South Sea bubble, and the theories of John Law, an economist that proposed letting credit and inflation solve the debt of a nation. All of this has a major effect on the story, and builds to quite a climax -- and a very unusual ending.While this isn't a short novel -- it takes more than 750 pages to tell the story, it is certainly worth the time. The narrative flows smoothly, the anachronisms are kept to a minimum if at all, and I got to genuinely care about what happens to everyone. Even Diana, the spite filled bag of venom that she is.This was originally published in 1986, and turned into an instant bestseller. There was a sequel to this as well, Now Face to Face which continues the story; the sequel has been long out of print, but is scheduled to be reprinted in January 2008. And for those who are intrigued by the story of the old Duchess, Alice, her story is told in [...]If you want an involved story that blends history, romance, and human nature, this is one great read. I was happily entertained for several days over this one, and would happily recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"After reading numerous reviews and seeing this book come up in so many lists of great historical fiction I picked it up as a Christmas present to myself. At the time I was reading Here Be Dragons by Sharon Kay Penman, which is easily one of the best books I have ever read. I was very excited to dive into this book, but I must say that it fell flat in every way for me and was a huge disappointment.I believe the most important elements of a book is the bond which is developed between the reader and the characters. I want to feel happy, sad, cringe when bad decisions are made, and cry when tragedy lurks. This book created none of this for me. I can honestly say that I didn't care for any of the characters in this book and actually found them a little irritating. I don't even know why some of them, Jane in particular, were even in the story. Most of the secondary characters added nothing and only lengthened an already dull plot. The love story the book is based on was not rich enough to fill close to 700 pages and lacked passion. I didn't like Barbara or Roger, found Diana to be irritating and the Duchess predictable.Another disappointment is the ending of this book which dragged on far too long only to discover that there is no true ending.There are more books in this series which I will not be picking up. Although this book is dripping with rich detail I can not bring myself to recommend this as a great historical fiction read."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Yes, Yes, Yes! THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY is so good. I can't believe it took me nearly ten years to get to this book. I can honestly say I haven't been this enthralled with a book since I read THE PROUD BREED (by Celeste DeBlasis) approximately three years ago. All 750+ pages have been absolutely compelling reading.It takes place in London and Paris in the early 1700s. 15 year-old Barbara Ackerly is the granddaughter of the Duke and Duchess of Tamworth and has been raised in proper society standards. Her mother is attempting to arrange a marriage between her and an old family friend, Roger Montgeoffrey, Lord Devane. Roger is 42-years-old and Barbara has had a crush on him since she was about 10. Barbara's mother, Diana, a beautiful but nasty woman who likes to sleep around and is attempting to arrange the marriage in order to help pay off her enormous debts. Roger is interested in Barbara because by marrying her he will get the deed to some property he wants to develop. (Barbara's mother is deeply in debt due to her estranged husband's drinking and gambling). Barbara is excited at the prospect of marrying Roger. She just knows she can make him love her. However, Barbara's aunt has other ideas. She wants the property for her son, Tony, who is the latest Duke of Tamworth and does everything in her power so that the Barbara/Roger wedding does not become a reality. The story goes on from there. To tell much more would rob the reader of the pleasure of discovering all its drama for themselves. The characters are so real that I feel I know them. This is more of a historical novel than a romance. Sex scenes are not detailed.I have to give this a 5***** rating. It goes on my keeper shelf and on my list of favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Karleen Koen's \\"Through A Glass Darkly\\" is as rich and broad in scope as the period she writes about - the initial years of England's King George the First's reign. Her plot is exciting, romantic, historically accurate, and includes many real life personalities, i.e. Chistopher Wren (one of England's greatest architects). Her fictional characters display an extraordinary depth. What is most enjoyable about the men and women she peoples her book with is that they are not cardboard figures but are allowed to grow with time & the experience they acquire. The novel reminds me a bit of \\"Gone With The Wind\\" in terms of its sweep of history and unforgettable characters....or it might also be reminiscent of an \\"upscale Forever Amber.\\"England, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, was filled with political unrest & economic upheaval. King George I of Hanover had inherited the English throne, (1714), succeeding his cousin Queen Anne. English law stated that their King/Queen must be Protestant - and King George, even if he could not speak English, was definitely Protestant. However, many English Catholics, known as Jacobites, wanted to overthrow George and crown James Stuart, (James III), called \\"The Pretender,\\" as king. He was the son of England's King James II & directly in line to the throne through his royal English bloodline. Thus plots & whispers of revolution abounded.Interestingly, the terrible economic times of this period resemble those we are experiencing today. In 1711 the South Sea Company was formed. It was given exclusive rights to trade with the Spanish colonies in South America, transporting many slaves from Africa to South America. In 1720 shares in the company became massively overpriced. Then the share price collapsed - the South Sea Bubble burst - and many investors, from the highest nobles to the poorest commoners with a few guineas to invest, lost huge sums of money - their entire life savings. The losses and subsequent impact on the country's economy were catastrophic.Fifteen year-old Barbara Aderley is central to the plot. This is her coming of age story and so much more. Bab, as she is called, is beautiful, intelligent, precocious, strong-willed and ready to be married off. The custom in these days is to marry young and for money and/or title. Her grandfather, Richard, Duke of Tamworth, a famous general, is deceased and much beloved by his countrymen. Richard's widow, Alice, the Duchess of Tamworth, may be elderly but is every bit as sharp and lively as her granddaughter. She is a powerful dowager who rules her roost, but has an extremely soft spot in her heart for Barbara. And Diana, Barbara's vicious but gorgeous mother, bears child after child to her unscrupulous Jacobite husband and leaves them with the Duchess to raise. What can I say? Diana is a hoyden and a slut...to put it mildly. And she is willing to sell her daughter off to the highest bidder.Roger MontGeoffry, Lord Devane, served as an officer under Barbara's grandfather in the long wars with Louis XIV of France, and she has known him and adored him from early childhood. And why not? He is handsome, brilliant, kind & charming. Although there is more than a twenty-five year difference in their ages, when Lord Devane is proposed as a potential match for Barbara, she is thrilled. And he is extremely fond of her and needs her fortune to build a visionary architectural estate and museum in the center of London.Sweeping, passionate and scandalous, the story moves from London to Paris to Italy, taking with it the members of a great English family with all the intrigue and baggage they bring with them....and a haunting, hurtful secret and betrayal to boot.I usually do not read a book twice unless it is a beloved classic. However, I read \\"Through A Glass Darkly\\" when it was first published & it became a favorite. I read it again about ten years ago and found that the novel only improved with age. Now that a sequel has come out, (\\"Now Face to Face\\" - also excellent), I read it for a third time so that there would be a flow of events & people when reading both books back-to-back. I cannot recommend \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" highly enough.PS - To see \\"through a glass\\" -- a mirror -- \\"darkly\\" is to have an obscure or imperfect vision of reality - perhaps by letting our emotions distort the true nature of people or events. The expression comes from the writings of the Apostle Paul, the King James version of the Bible, Corinthians 13.Jana Perskie"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I guess it is the wonderful writing that made &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; such a compelling page-turner. I loved all the descriptions of the British aristocracy (or should I say the 'idle rich'?) during the early 1700's. And I was intrigued and repulsed by the images of the French royalty (and their patrician friends and acquaintances) and the lurid and decadent details of their nightlife. Learning about the workings of Tamworth, the lovely estate that is central to the story was absolutely fascinating.When I read a book, I like to transport myself into the principal character (or the female who is closest to the lead). Even with the 'Harry Potter' series, I can visualize myself (quite easily) as a student at Hogwarts. I could not see myself as Barbara Aderley. I can't imagine falling madly in love with a man who was almost 30 years older than me WHEN I WAS TEN! Throughout the entire novel, we are constantly reminded what a good, kind, honorable, and decent man was Roger Montgeoffry. I'm sorry; I just couldn't see those qualities. To me, he was a selfish, thoughtless individual who lived a very immoral and depraved life. And I am not referring to his 'little secret'! He was a horrible husband who had no qualms about leaving his fifteen year old wife (for more self indulgences) immediately following a horrible tragedy. Throughout all of this Barbara remained in love with Roger--I can't understand it. Wouldn't these events have been an impetus to sever the relationship (for most normal people)? I also felt cheated because supposedly Roger had promised an explanation for his actions--and we never received it. I love fairytales--any book or movie where there is joy and most definitely 'happy ever after.' There is very little joy in this saga; very few people are kind and there is a lot of death (read with kleenex). I really wanted something good to happen to Barbara, Therese and to poor Tony (who started off being fat, stupid and insecure and then morphed into movie star good looks, confidence and intelligence) but nothing ever did.I recommend THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY to anyone who enjoys a well-written historical novel. If you enjoy a warm fuzzy book, then read Rosemund Pilcher (my preference!)."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"The title comes from a Bible verse:When I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face; now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.I Corinthians 13:11-13And from this verse flows the essence of the story of Barbara: a young woman with an open heart full of dreams and desires, longing to please, to love and be loved with a child's innocence, who comes to know a woman's life and to be known as a woman, amidst the heartache and bitterness of failed expectations, personal tragedies and the duplicity and debauchery of the English and French courts.England, 1715. Barbara is the sheltered granddaughter of the late Duke of Tamworth, one of England's most famous military heroes. With a traitorous father on the run and a scandalous, uninterested mother, Barbara and her siblings have been raised by their grandmother, the Duchess, an iron-willed woman who strikes fear in the hearts of those who oppose her, and will go to any lengths to aid those whom she loves.Barbara is content to spend her days happy and carefree on her grandmother's secluded country estate until her money-scheming mother arrives and plants the idea in her head that she could marry her childhood idol, the dashing, worldly, and much older Roger Montgeoffrey. Barbara latches onto that idea and moves to London, spinning grand dreams of her future and enlisting her grandmother's help to see those dreams to fruition. Though Barbara is young and unknowing in many ways, she is aware from the beginning that Roger marries her out of respect for her grandfather and for the dowry she brings him, but she is determined to make a place for herself in his life and in his heart.Roger, a rising investment star in the infamous South Sea Company, has plans for his life, and though Barbara is an unexpected and intriguing addition to that life, he's not planning on making any significant changes. As soon as they're married, he and Barbara are off to France, where Barbara makes her debut in society amidst a decadent and licentious French court. In this world of sex and scandal, Barbara is left to her own counsel and must choose how to conduct herself, all the while striving to hold her husband's attention, praying for him to return even a fraction of the love she feels for him. And just when it seems she's about to get everything she wants, tragedy strikes Barbara's family and Roger's hidden past sweeps into Paris. And as he succumbs to the temptations of his dark secrets, Barbara's life crumbles around her. Attempting to pick up the pieces, Barbara embarks on a journey of discovering who she is and who she wants to be.This book is one of those slow burners that takes its time to draw the reader into a sensuous world of compelling characters. It is a beautifully written coming of age story, love story and family saga rolled into one; a heart-wrenching portrayal of emotions, of the damage people can inflict upon each other; of human nature in every shade, where nothing is black and white. The outstanding cast of supporting characters adds dimension and layers to the story and the lushly depicted era of opulence, political unrest and financial instability of England and France weaves a rich historical texture throughout.I loved every minute of this book and I cried my way through the last hundred pages. Then, after I got hold of myself, I went right out to the library and picked up the sequel. This is one of those books that kept me up late and then woke me in the middle of the night - I could not stop thinking about it. Definite Keeper Shelf. Highly recommended to fans of emotionally charged, character-driven historical fiction."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"OMG! This is one of the best books I've ever read. It is just as good as stephanie myers books in a different way. It is for mature readers, like 16 and up. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I liked this book. Just Like, not Love. The setting, details, and timeframe were intriguing to me and there were definitely some strange happenings in the book that kept it interesting to the end. The characters and relationships are well-developed. This author is certainly not afraid to kill off characters, that's for sure. I think this book is worthing reading, though I haven't bothered to order the sequel or prequel yet. Maybe when my to-read list gets a little shorter..."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"We read this book in my book club. I think that it was the first time that everyone loved the book. It is a page turner."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This was the first book I have read by Karleen Koen. If you are a fan of Phillipa Gregory's writing like I am you will love hers as well! The characters are great and I was pulled into this book. I get bored easily so it was nice to have my attention kept. Takes place in the early 1700's in England and France. Great detail. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Through A Glass Darkly is carried to greatness by its main character, Barbara, a young, spirited noblewoman who quickly captures the interest and heart of the reader and manages to hold onto both for over seven hundred pages. Other characters -- Barbara's husband and the love of her life, her adoring, crotchety grandmother, the rest of her family, her servants, the servants of others, malicious nobles, her infatuated cousin, her husband's lover -- all are given a voice and perspective, making this tale full and multidimensional.The historical accuracy of this book is awe-inspiring in its detail, but often given in list-like form and thus not as complimentary an addition as it should have been. The story spans six years of Barbara's life, and is well-paced and interesting most of the time, laced with happiness, wit, tragedy, cruelty, and again, detailed historical background.All in all Through a Glass Darkly is a worthwhile read that manages to stretch 743 pages without getting too thin, or too thick."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I had heard about this book some time ago, but only just got around to reading it recently. Most likely because I have an unsatiable hunger for GOOD historical fiction. \\"Through A Glass Darkly\\" more than hits the mark for qualifying in this category. I found the beginning a bit slow, but it could have just taken me some time to get used to the large cast of characters. After that, the book just sails.At first, I found young Barbara's declared \\"love\\" for the much older Roger to be a bit much, too unbelievable by far. Of course, I realized it only adds to the degree of pain the heroine suffers when she discovers the hidden truth to Roger. Any experienced reader will be able to pick up the many clues to Roger's BIG SECRET which are peppered throughout the first half of the book, prior to it's revelation.A host of strong secondary characters play integral roles in moving this story forward. The Duchess, Barbara's grandmother is a fiesty old battle axe whose presence adds some humor to the tale. Barbara's mother, Diana , flawlessly plays the role of a woman who whores herself for her own selfish purposes . Diana's nemesis, her sister in law and Barbara's aunt Abigail is another humorous character; a busbody trying to advance the interests of her son Tony, the current Duke of Tamworth. At first Tony come off as a fat bumbling idiot, but by the end of the book he's a slim, dashing young man, who happens to be in love with his cousin Barbara. What a tangled web. I found myself rooting for Tony and Barbara to end up together. I was thrilled to learn of the sequel \\"Now Face To Face,\\" in the hopes they may end up together yet.This book is more historical fiction than a true romance. It covers, in great detail, economics, politics and social mores of early 1700's England.I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves big beefy works of historical fiction. It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I first read this many years ago...and have read a a couple of times since. It's one of my favorite historical fiction novels &amp; is probably the book that got me into historical fiction. I think it's a fantastic read!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is a really fun read. It's not at all difficult to read, in fact it may even be on an adolescent level of literature or less. Like I said, it is fun and entertaining, appealing to the baser senses.This is one of those books where you begin to care about the characters (not unlike a soap opera) and think about them for a long time afterwards. Therefore you must follow them to see where the story goes. I thought that Diana Alderly was as fascinating a character as Ingrid Magnuessen from White Oleander, or even as much as Scarlett O Hara.One odd thing was that, the very first line ever uttered from Barabara was when she called her maidservant a slut for not letting her know when her mother had arrived in chapter one. For the rest of the book Barabara was someone else entirely; she was admirable, determined, caring, doting, and maternal to loved ones, so on. It was mildly bizarre that that was the first quote from her, but other than that, its a fine read.You buy the books you know that you will want to read again, and I would buy this."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I have read both this book and its sequel both twice thru, it's that great. The author's ability to blend historical fact into such an interesting plot line is amazing. Most books I read that try to involve historical politics tempt me to skip ahead due to boredom, but not this book! The characters' individuality makes for realistic interaction and conflict. I couldn't help but read this book in no more than five or six sittings. It really is quite a sizeable book, but if it's the type of reading that catches your attention, pick it up, set yourself down, and prepare for one of the most realistic, captivating, enjoyable treks into the fictitious past."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I have read this book probably 7 times and each time I cannot put it down. A truly wonderful historical romance that is flaky in its dialogue sometimes, but always intriguing. Its follow-up, Now Face to Face, is also worth reading, but not quite as good."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Through A Glass Darkly was an enchanting book. The best book I have read so far. The book was hard to put down, it made me feel that I was there in Barbara's world which made the book fun to read. I loved the book, it was unique and inspiring. The characters became your friend's or enemies that made you feel that you knew them or have met them before. It's a must read for those who want to read an excellent book. I can't wait to read more of her books."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is a wonderful book. I love it. I read it every year or so. I first bought the hardcover and now I have the paperback too. This is the kind of story that you become a part of. When I re-read it, it's like visiting old friends. For years after I first read TAGD I searched for a new Koen novel. I am thrilled to find out a new one exists."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This book makes you remember what it's like to be so young &amp; in love. The characters were wonderful; you grew to love, or even hate them.Although Barbara is young, she portrays that rare quality that few have in that forgiveness goes with true love. I read constantly, but this is one of my all-time favorites! It should be made into a movie. Unfortunately, the sequel didn't have the impact I would have liked. However, I hope Ms. Cohen will try again. She is a wonderful writer."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I am known for only reading very high-end quality romances--and this is about my favorite. Ms. Kohen's descriptions are so vivid, you can practically see the characters and what they are wearing. She really makes you care about them, and it's not just alot of sex, like in alot of romances, the relationship really develops.This is a must read for anyone who loves the victorian era."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"My God, the dangling prepositions, anachronisms, and just plain mistakes- \\"...dying in a battle he did not have to be in.\\" - The English and especially the French would never be so overly familiar as to suggest Christian names on first meeting- so on and so on- Good plot but after a while, it became a game to correct the many distracting mistakes- Maybe if it is ever made into a film these things will be corrected-"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This book comes with A LOT of good reviews. And I cannot deny that it is well written. The story follows a teenage girl whom I felt protective of and her mother whom I quickly felt sorry for. But the author put in more sex than was necessary. Simple allusions to it would have sufficed.The book reads slowly. It felt like it took along time to get to the first main event in the story. As to its historic nature, the author has pinned many details perfectly and she fills the story with facts and details that brings the story to life."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I am not a literature expect by no means but I have taught middle school reading courses throughout my twelve years of teaching career! I don't know where to start. In my opinion, there were TOO many flat characters. I could help but wonder why the author included them.The chapters were TOO long and it seems to change settings too many times for the readers to accurately keep them straight in their mind. I don't understand why the author had chosen to have part I and II. Wouldn't it have been better to have developed this book into a trilogy? It appears as if part I and part I was written by TWO different authors. In the first part, the author separated out each characters inner thoughts by use of italics or starting new paragraphs. In the second part, the author made no attempt to separate each characters' inner thoughts. I had to constantly reread the paragraph to decipher the conversation and each thought the characters involved. Look at this example passage.Where is Roger? Where is Roger Devane? I will claw out his eyes. I will cut out his heart and eat it myself. Where is he, Barbara? Where? I do not know, Mother. Where are you, Roger? Come to Tamworth, please. I need you.It is too hard to decode. It should been clear that Diane, the mother was saying,\\" Where is Roger? Where is Roger Devane? I will claw out his eyes. I will cut out his heart and eat it myself. Where is he, Barbara? Where?\\"Barbara's respond should have been, \\"I do not know, Mother. Where are you, Roger? Come to Tamworth, please. I need you.\\"The sexual situations and language was a bit strong for my taste. In all fairness, I really don't have much of a comparison since I do NOT read books with content such as Fifty Shades of Grey.I have taught my students the plot map and the elements of fiction. For the most part, they know that after the climax of the story, there should be should kind of falling action and a resolution. This story did not! Barbra's grandmother, known as the Dutchess in the story, sent Barbra off to Virginia to inspect some land that had come into her possession. After conflict about Barbra leaving England to Virginia, the author has the Dutchess crying into the arms of her grandson. This was never resolved. I wanted to know what happened to Barbara!I would have to say that the author needs to go back and attend some writing courses! Readers must have a resolution!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I had high expectations for this book, but I can't say that they were met. Despite turns of plot that promised character development, I found that most characters, including the protagonist, remained fairly one-dimensional. Peculiarly, some scenes that Koen could have used to show character growth were left to occur in a time-lapse vacuum; in one case, instead of seeing Barbara sort through the challenge of a particular plot twist, the reader is swept directly to a scene several years later, none the wiser. The plot itself held no surprises for me; Koen's foreshadowing came across as clunky and heavy-handed. This book suffers from a serious case of Chekhov's gun. Despite my litany of complaints, it's a fine, inoffensive read, but I never was drawn in to Barbara's world, nor did I become invested in her story. There is much better historical fiction out there."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Well, I'm not going to tell you what happened and spoil the book - like some readers do. What's the use in reading it if you already know what happens? This is a great book. It is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I have read it many times &amp; never tire of it."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I literally have worn out two paper copies of this novel by Karlene Koen. It is perhaps my favorite period novel. It has everything required for the genre: the rakish yet honorable nobleman, the young, unprotected female come upon hard times, the political intrigue, etc. What I particularly like about this novel is the complexity and depth of the characters and the excellent dialogue. The setting is well-realized and the novel is faithful to its historical setting in its depiction of daily life and behaviours (as far as I know!)It has been many years since I read this novel, because I had lost the middle 100~ pages of my last paperback copy when they fell out during a re-read. I am very excited to read this old favorite again!

I couldn't wait to start the next one (Now Face to Face). I have to know what happens next."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Through a Glass Darkly is the story of Barbara Alderley. At the opening of the novel, she is a mischevious 15 year old girl, living at the home of her grandmother, the Duchess of Tamworth. Young Barbara has a penchant towards eavesdropping and so we are introduced to a scene of family discord between her mother, the selfish and hedonistic Diana, Lady Alderley and her younger brother, the irresponsible and handsome Harry. Barbara's mother is disgraced due to her father, Viscount Alderley, having fled England as a suspected Jacobite (supporter of the Stuarts, the descendents of James II who was overthrown by the Glorious revolution and who are barred from inheriting the English throne due to the Act of Succession, which bans Catholics from the succession). Viscount Alderley left his wife with a mountain of debt. In order to avoid ruin, the greedy and selfish Diana has planned a glorious marriage for Barbara. Fortunately for Barbara, the planned marriage was with the Earl of Devane, a man whom Barbara has adored (and loved) since childhood. The first part of the novel deals with the tumultuous marriage negotiations and family drama. This part of the novel is delightfully gossipy, as Diana is a real peice of work and the author's descriptions of her relatives is amusing. Eventually Barbara and Devane marry. However, as Barbara begins to see Devane for who he really is, a skelaton in his closet seems to ruin her chances for happiness. The novel deals with the fall out from Barbara's discovery of her husband's secret.This is a 3.5 star read. At times, this book is a solid 4 stars, with a delightfully gossipy view of early 18th century England and France. At other times, Through a Glass Darkly drags, as Kathleen Koen has a tendency to be too wordy and drags the story out. Ms. Koen's style is to include long passages of internal dialogue reflecting the various character's thoughts. The novel is at its best during the marriage negotiations and when Barbara and her new husband are in France. The French nobels are a debauched bunch and it is entertaining to imagine the innocent Barabara in that environment! While Koen's writing style can be entertaining - bordering on the catty - it also can be repetitive, causing the story to drag, particularly in Part II of the novel.Readers who enjoy novels like Forever Amber or Gone with the Wind would like it. However, unlike those novels, Through a Glass Darkly is substantially lighter on the history. I also liked both of those novels better. That is not to say that Through a Glass Darkly isn't entertaining. Compared to those classics however, this one is a lightweight."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I read this book in one day. I couldn't put it down. I liked this book but it was sooooooo depressing. I felt very depressed after I put it down :). I wish there was at least one character in this book that wasn't unhappy, lol. Barbara and Roger's story was so heartbreaking. I'm not sure if I'm going to read the sequel or the prequel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"One of my pet peeves is when romance readers (of which I am) criticize a book by saying \\"this is not a romance!\\" As if the book is somehow less because of it.Well, TAGD is not a romance. It has a marriage at the center of its plot, but the theme, the meaning, the depth is not about finding HEA. Not at all.In a nutshell TAGD is about a 15 year old girl with a spine of steel who decides she wants to marry a 42 year old licentious earl and make him fall in love with her. The first 200 pages contain her struggles to make the marriage happen. In all honesty, I had to force myself through them. They are rather boring and the characters unlikeable and cardboard. I am SO glad I kept going though.Once Babs and Roger are married, the story becomes vibrant and painful and lovely. Many of the things I previously assumed about the characters are only superficial characteristics. I thought this was especially well done with Diana and Tony.Babs must face the truth of getting what she asked for. That Roger both is and is not the person she thought (on meeting him only a handful of times). In fact, the world is far more complicated than she could ever have imagined. She makes some monumental errors in judgment as does Roger and pretty much every other character. I ached for them. One of the characters (I can't remember who) says that personal suffering generates empathy for others. I disliked the characters at first, but as they suffered I grew to love them.TAGD is beautiful journey that ends with God giving Babs what she wants by ending things in a way that neither she nor Roger could ever mess it up again. (hard to spit it all out in a way that is coherent without giving away the details of the ending!!!) There are huge spiritual undertones throughout the book. They are handled with grace and great subtlety though, so I enjoyed them rather than feeling beat over the head.As much as the theme of the the book is seeing 'through a glass darkly,' it is also 'Ask and you shall receive.'This book touched me deeply."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I read this book when it first came out in hardcover over 20 years ago...I don't remember much of the details now but I do remember that I could NOT put it down and stayed up the entire night reading it. It was a remarkable beginning for a new author, and now that I know it has become a saga I will read it again and the following volumes as well. One of the best I've ever read."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"The book started out promising enough, but then it became more and more annoying. Especially the second part. It became boring too.I agree with one of the earlier reviews. She is just killing off too many people in that book. It becomes really annoying, almost ridiculous. In the end everybody is dead and all we read is how sad the main caracter is over and over. She is pretty much crying for half of the book anyway. Again: Annoying. For the last couple of chapters I wasn't interest enough anymore and just flew over the pages to get to the end. And that was annoying too.There are far, far better historical novels out there."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"First off, the historical aspects of this book are perfect. Barbara's Grandmother is a wonderful gem. Would have enjoyed reading her story rather than her granddaughter's. The depiction of stock market manipulation, cleaning recipes and the plague are perfect and accurate.The rest of it was boring and dragged. When the novel was done I chucked it. If you must read this, get it from the library don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Although this book received many good reviews, I found it to be lacking in the dashing, compelling qualities so many have claimed to enjoy upon reading \\"Through a Glass, Darkly.\\" Yes, it seems as though Koen exerted a great deal of effort in creating a historically accurate portrayal of England and France during the 1700s, however there are massive swaths of certain transitional scenes that become bogged down with the weight of Koen's didactic prose (not to mention the fact that it did not strike me as British in the least...I later researched the author's bio and discovered that she is American). I believe this was her debut novel, which may offer an explanation as to why her writing was so self-consciously laden with excessive descriptions. At times I even felt insulted by the author, because it seemed as though she didn't have faith that her readers would understand what was (very clearly) happening.Also, I had hoped for a story with more substance and less of the cliched phrasing that can be found in a cheap romance novel. I thought this book would be special because it has been advertised as a sweeping, whimsical family drama. It is certainly dramatic...but the characters are hackneyed...I've seen them all before, except they had different names and were much more developed. I completed nearly two thirds of the book and still felt as though the characters had remained static...There is no depth there to satisfy me, or compell me to become attached to any of them. Even Tony, who is the rather \\"dull\\" \\"dolt\\" of the family...who seems to be endearing because of his sensitive and hoplessly devoted characteristics...He became 2 dimensional because of the way his dialogue was written. Omitting pronouns does not an idiot make. His lack of intelligence was handled very poorly, in my opinion. I've never heard a person speak exclusively in fragments like that...no matter how unintelligent that person may be.There's a hat for every head and I'm happy that this novel has been enjoyed by others, but I've regretfully realized that this one's not for me. I would sooner recommend a book called \\"Cashelmara\\", by Susan Howatch. It is very similar in almost every respect. It also includes a relationship with a significant disparity in age...Marriages that face opposition, fortunes that are lost, skeletons in people's respective closets, people who are reluctant to come out of the closet...Etc. I read it when I was a teenager, so my perception of it may have been the result of my immaturity...but I still remember it being of a higher caliber. The rather poor quality of the writing is what really disappointed me here. Try that book out...I'm almost positive you'll find it just as, if not more satisfying."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I have to disagree with the majority of the other reviewers and say that I really don't think much of this book! I expected to enjoy it since my favourite genre is historical romance and I had heard 'Through a Glass Darkly' was similar to Gone With The Wind, but in my opinion it doesn't compare. The research and background were good but the characterisation emphatically was not. The characters were one-dimensional, especially the heroine. She was weak and childish and did not seem to mature as the book progressed. I felt the book could have been much better as it had an interesting theme of marriage between an older man to a much younger woman, and a fascinating setting. But the novel did not fulfil its potential. It also contained explicit sex scenes which were superfluous to the plot and seemed only to be there to make the book sell. As opinions have differed widely on it and the sequel, I would advise anyone thinking about reading it to get it out of the library before deciding whether to buy it!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I really love this genre, but I could do without the sex scenes. Otherwise it was a great book and I so desperately wanted to get the sequel, but didn't want the torrid sex scenes (plus it wasn't reviewed that well). But a great read if that stuff doesn't bother you."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I did not like this book. Now, there is something to be said about a book that makes you feel passionately and I certainly felt passionate about my distaste of this book. I think the author has talent but this story was just terrible.The beginning got my attention and helped convince me to purchase this. I was actually excited at the page length because I adore a good long book as I can normally read a great book in a day or two because I get so wrapped up into the story. What a disappointment.This story will crash you into the deep despair of this poor girls life. Get ready to read the destruction of an innocent youth, watch her heart be shattered. The biggest annoyance was after pushing through the first half of this book, it leads up into this high story arch that has you, kind of, on the edge of your seat. Then, the book skips ahead a few months and leaves you picking up the aftermath of what happened during that time. You miss everything. You miss the main characters reaction and how she becomes what she does. Instead, you're left with a completely different version of her but you are left wondering what happened over that time. It was a huge disappointment and then the second half was just as terrible as the first but I felt myself caring less about the main characters because I felt like the author ripped away time of getting to know her and understand her."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"As far as romance fiction goes, 'Through a Glass Darkly' should get five stars out of five. The wealth of heart-warming cliches and mind-numbing descriptive minutiae (replete with navel-gazing, philosophical extractions from the Bible and various English poets of the period) will satisfy the pickiest reader in that genre.If, however, you're looking for well-written historical fiction, this novel shouldn't get more than two stars, one for being fairly accurate in its description of the period, and the other one for ambition (that and the effort it took to type the manuscript.)"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"It was slow to get into... You can't help but fall in love with Barbara's spirit and determination. A very good read!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Through A Glass Darkly will take you to the splendors of a lost time!! Like all great historical fiction it is full of characters so compelling they create their own world!! This is a story of a great family ruled by a woman of extraordinary charms, beauty, power!! Do not miss this book or its sequel Now Face to Face!!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I bought the book for 99 cents at a variety store, taking a chance that it might be good (when good books are really long, I love it). I didn't read it for a while, but when I finally picked it up, I couldn't stop reading it. It completely drew me in, and the different twists it took suprised me, horrified me, saddened me, and made me totally fall in love with it. I sympathized with the antagonists (even the vicious, plotting Diana) and Barbara's Grandmama was so endearing. The heroine, Barbara, was real: silly and unlikeable at times, heartbreakingly honest and real at others. The subplots, such as Therese's own tumultuous life beneath Barbara, added so many dimensions to the story. Much better than the classic, fluffy romance novels. So much historical information, character development, and real emotion from me. I was sad when it ended, and can't wait to track down the sequel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is very well written, I cried almost throughout the whole book. I have read many historical romance novels and this one seem to have it all. Romance, betrayal, love and more!I could not put this book down. Story line and characters are very good the only thing that I did not particularly like is the side stories of dreams or flashbacks that don't really pertain to the story or if they did they went to deep and off subject."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"The first two chapters were hard for me, but I stuck with it and WOW! This book was wonderful! I had a hard time putting it down. I loved the main character Barbara and the details in the book made you feel like you were there. TAGD is defiantly going on my favorites list."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Each character is craftily composed and unique in voice and detail. The story rings with classic telling and is reminiscent and ambitiously echoes the possible influences of the Bronte sisters and Austen. I found myself emerged in the story and attached to the various characters. Koen does a beautiful job of chronicling the life of Barbara while presenting the realities of marriage, money, title and hardships. Whereas in some historical fiction, the plot becomes secondary to the research, Koen uses history to drive the plot and coincidentally carry her main character towards a journey to the new world. In addition, the inclusion of the story (read by the characters) of Robinson Crusoe works to foreshadow the tale and adds thematic depth. It contributes a pleasant opposition to the idea of domesticity and the lure of a fresh start in a new land. It also represents the individual dreams and spirit of the youth in the household, including the desire to escape through adventure rather than sit idly praying in a chapel in the country. It is the old way or tradition, verses the new generation and idealized hope of promise.The first half of the story might seem a bit disjointed and although it gives a historical background to the scandalous sexual exploits of the elite at the time, it really is not terribly important to the core plot of the story. However, it does provide a basis for what was acceptable. Some readers might be discouraged by the length of the novel, but in defense, the meandering scenic descriptions are in step with the classic authors and possible influences mentioned above."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Richly Detailed, Slightly Melodramatic...and SpicyI'm rounding up from 3.5 starsI found 'Through a Glass Darkly' to be an engaging well paced story with likeable characters woven into a rich fabric of English traditions, mores, fashion and sexual intrigues.I would have liked Karleen Koen to focus on a few of my favorite characters a little more but over all I thought it was an enjoyable and easy read.The setting, England and France from 1715 until the early 1720s includes the conflicts between Whigs, Tories and Jacobites as well as the economic devastation of the South Sea Bubble. The history is not the focus of the story but rather a backdrop for the events in the life of the main character Barbara Alderly Devane.Barbara is a headstrong young girl who's father has disgraced her family by supporting the Jacobites and deserting her mother and his country. Finding a prosperous husband to marry her maybe difficult. Her overbearing mother who is constantly conniving and looking for the best opportunity has begun negotiating a deal for her daughter's future. She nearly secures the marriage contract with Lord Devane, Roger Montgeoffry, a man who has always been close with their family. But as with all things Barbara's mother seems to have pushed too hard.I enjoyed the relationship between the main characters Roger and Barbara, even though I didn't feel satisfied by the course their lives take. I thought Koen painted a realistic picture of the aftermath of the economic ruin of the South Sea Bubble and how it personally impacted people and their lives.There were many gardening, harvesting and seasonal traditions woven into the background of the story which I found interesting and I thought added to the story.The first one hundred pages or so are spent getting to know the cast of characters and the story begins in earnest after that. The ending is an ending obviously made for a sequel. The story in between was enjoyable, interesting and emotionally moving. I think readers who are fans of love stories and historical fictions will enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I don't review things often, but I couldn't help it with this book. It is one of the best books I've ever read. The characters are fantastic and I find the story emotionally compelling. The economic turmoil of the South Sea scandal is quite relevant to our own recent economic slump.In spite of the book's length, it was over too quickly! (Just realized there is a sequel!)"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I ordered this book to replace a book that had been stolen. The story is historical fiction. The author has done a wonderful job of creating a story that will wrap one in the description of the setting so well that you can almost believe you are there. The story is interesting and the characters come alive in ones imagination. I would recommend this book to any one, and especially someone who is looking for a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This afternoon I finished listening to an audio version of this book, narrated by Rosalyn Landor. The novel was tragic in its own way, but deeply enthralling. It revolves around the character of Barbara Alderley, a 15-year-old headstrong, beautiful noblewoman whose love for a man 27 years her senior pushes the plot line forward. From that infatuation a world of passion and sorrow comes forth - beginning with her mother's self-serving attempt to arrange their marriage, then pausing in lascivious life of the Paris courts, then careening into the national chaos of the South Sea Company's financial failure. Barbara weathers it all with the help of her clear-sighted grandmother, and though I felt like Barbara's character could have matured more I nevertheless enjoyed reading about her. I can see why this book has so many 5 star reviews on Amazon and will be checking Karleen Koen's other novels out from the library."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Seriously...if it wasn't for needing to care for my children, I would've read this book 24/7. It is THAT good.The begining starts out simple enough: Fifteen year old Barbara's scheming mother has arranged for her to marry a much older (and rich) man. From there, the plot contains all sorts of twists and turns...some that you typically wouldn't expect from a historical fiction novel. Which makes it all so much more interesting.I also liked how realistic this books seemed. Like real life, things don't always turn out how the characters would like them to. And people die, left and right, of all sorts of things. Not always pleasant, but a true indication of what life back then would've really been like.This is such a full, rich book. I highly recommend it for anyone, especially historical fiction fans."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I am at a loss (ok, nearly) as to how to write a review for this rich and marvelous novel. Here is what I know:I fell in love with all the characters and though 20 years have passed since I first read this book I am still as much in love with them as ever. Karleen Koen delivers characters so real and moving and gorgeous that it is difficult to believe they did not, in fact, truly exist.This is, mostly, the story of Barbara Alderley Devane and her life amidst the Hanoverian court in England in the early 1700's. I wasn't particularly interested in that time period before reading this novel and it is a real testament to the author that I could be so engrossed in the goings-on of the court. There is passion and love and heartbreak aplenty in Through a Glass Darkly. I still read a certain death scene and bawl like my heart is breaking. Wicked and cruel and cutting dialogue. Splendor and glamour and fleeting glory. I just loved every single minute of reading this masterpiece and if you enjoy your books with an edge of sophistication I think you'll devour it, too."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I am not usually into perod dramas and I have tried to read many others only to last a few chapters....not this book. This book I literally couldn't put it down. I have neglected my family and ended up extremley sleep deprived as I spent any \\"sitting chance\\" reading this wonderful book. It has been a very long time a book has done this to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it. (I have a large pile of half read books needing to be finished!)The story is wonderfully written centering on a generation of fiesty women, The Duchess of Tamworth, Diana and Barbara. It was so hard to develop an opinon of the characters as they changed throught the course of the book and this made the story all the more unpredicable and enjoyable. I do have to agree with other reviewers regarding \\"killing off of the characters\\" issue. It seemed that all the characters Lady Devane had a relationship with, ended up in the Tamworth Vault. Plus the missing years in the book, through me off a little, trying to decipher what exactly happened. In my opinion the Dark Secret wasn't so dark - it was pretty obvious in the begining- and I thought wasn't what the whole book was about.I just loved the detail of London and Paris, and to me it was fantastic, even it may not historically correct. I think sometimes readers forget that this is a fictional novel and a great one at that. My only recommedation is that you be prepared to spend your waking hours reading this book. Can't wait to read the sequal and the prequal."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I had high hopes for this novel, but was left feeling depressed and unsatisfied. I like a book with characters that are more realistic and less perfect, but this book took it way to far; every character was corrupt. Even the young heroine gives up by the end. If you were as disappointed as I was, try reading The Bronze Horseman or Redeeming Love. Both historical novels are full of suffering and anguish, similar to this novel, but have better endings."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"With the publication this fall of Koen's Dark Angels, I looked forward to reading the book that started it all, Through A Glass Darkly. While this book is a fast, easy read, I didn't see what a lot of the other reviewers saw in this book.Not that it isn't entertaining. TAGD is a historical romance, but when comparing Koen to writers such as Phillipa Gregory and even Jean Plaidy, Koen's book seems transparent and fluffy. Her characters are somewhat unsympathetic and seem to lack basic common sense at times. Its hard to like anybody in this book as many of the characters seem to fall into stereotypes, i.e. the wronged woman, the doting matriarch, the wicked mother. Also, some of the plot twists are so obvious in coming, i.e. \\"one man's dark secret.\\"Yes, the book is a fun beach read type of work. But, don't be disappointed if you come to this book and realize that it just doesn't have the emotional connectivity to character like other books, such as The Constant Princess or The Other Boleyn Girl. Read it for the intrigues, like an episode of Dynasty, but don't expect to come away feeling for the main character."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I adored this book and was thrilled to find after finishing it that there is both a prequel and sequel which I have yet to read. As a historian and decorative arts specialist, I appreciated the attention to detail in the setting and costumes. I found the characters entertaining and believable and largely likeable. I was torn as the character was torn and in love as the main character loved. The ending was a bit hokey, but I will forgive it after such a lovely effort the rest of the book.I definitely recommend. I look forward to reading more by this author!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"It is definitely a great read, but you might become angry with the author if you are expecting some grand love story. This book doesn't have a happy ending, but life doesn't always have a happy ending, does it? I would describe Through a Glass Darkly as a story about life. I was worried about some of the bad reviews before I read it, but now that I finished it, I understand why some people didn't really care for this book. The first two chapters were really terrible, lots of raunchy sex scenes, children die, the author skips 4 years ahead, and the readers don't get the ending they will want. Not to mention, Roger's big secret will make your jaw drop. Still, all this is what made this book so intriguing to me. Trust me, it's definitely worth it.Also, Mrs Koen does a wonderful job at expressing grief. You just want to cry along with the characters. Everytime Barbara said \\"I will not cry.\\" It just broke my heart. Most of the characters in this book are very well developed. Barbara's grandmother, is just delightful. You will wish she was your grandmother. She is strong and wise, and you just might come away with some words of wisdom for yourself!I am definitely buying the next book, Face to Face. I just have to know what Barbara is up to."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"i was at the thrift store compiling summer pleasure reading...i do not waste time with \\"romance novels,\\" mind you...but i liked the cover of this book and was drawn to it...i flipped to the middle and read a few paragraphs...i did that twice...and i decided to give it a chance...my expecatations were not high for this novel...but the author is a superb writer...she uses words that i had to look up (which i LOVE to do)...her character development is enthralling...and i was quickly swept up in the time period and woulnd into the lives of the characters...several hundred pages in,i did have to admit that it was a \\"trashy romance\\" novel, after all...but, i was hooked and loved everry minute of my wellinvested time...i look forward, with great zeal to the sequel \\"Now Face to Face\\""},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This book took me longer than I thought it would. I didn't truly get into it until I'd read about 100 pages, and then I found that I cared about the characters and the situations said characters found themselves in when they steadfastly refused, time and again, to see what was in front of them. The story itself flows along nicely and I especially appreciated the nice historical detail. I confess I don't know a lot about this era and so if there are any glaring errors in the author's research, I cannot catch them. But from the point of view of someone who really doesn't know better, the descriptions of the time and the people were interesting. The minutiae of 18th century life was described particularly well, I thought.HOWEVER, this book was edited very badly. I found a grammatical/spelling/anything error about every three pages. I don't have the same edition that Amazon is selling, though, so I don't know if these errors have been fixed. I have the copy with a light blue border and a painting of two lovers on the front. If you happen to be someone who gets easily annoyed with typos, this book might give you a stroke.The characterizations in this book were, I thought, done fairly well. There were a few cardboard-type characters, but I was often pleasantly surprised when some character I thought I had pegged showed a new facet to their personality.**SPOILERS**I absolutely could not believe the number of deaths that this novel contains. The second part of the book was just tiresome because almost every loose end was tied up with a death. I felt cheated because nothing came to a conclusion, nothing really happened with a lot of the characters I was interested in. They just... died. And you know, I like a death at the end of a novel because it usually adds some emotion or poignancy or whatever. These deaths just seemed trite and unnecessary, like the author didn't want to come up with anything else. And as for Barbara... it was like every horrible thing that could possibly happen to her, happened. After a while she wasn't even a person to me anymore; she was a receptacle for miseries and nothing else. But then, to be fair, I shot myself in the foot because I couldn't help but read ahead a few times. That's probably part of the reason why the deaths seemed so annoying.**END**Overall, this book is good. I'd recommend it to a friend interested in historical fiction or in the period. I got a good bit of entertainment from reading Barbara's story. But it's not a favorite of mine."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is the story of Barbara...a young girl right on the cusp of womanhood during the early 1700s.

When Barbara finds that a marriage is possibly being arranged between her and Roger, a man she thought only to get close to in her dreams...she is ecstatic and determined to do anything and everything in her power to see that the marriage takes place. Oh, but there is sooo much more to this book!! It covers years...it spans across both England and Paris and is peppered with an amazing array of characters...characters I both loved and wanted to strangle. Through a Glass Darkly had so many ups and downs..it was happy, and romantic, and exciting, and so so sad. Rarely do books make me cry, but this one not only had me in tears, it had me in a dazed fog for several hours after finishing...when a book moves me like that, even after Im done reading..I know it was a good one. I have only one real complaint with this book and that was that I wanted more from the ending...but overall, I loved this story so much I couldnt possibly rate it at lower than 5 stars. It swept me along and I happily devoured all 700 some pages...dont let the size of this book intimidate you...it is so entertaining you wont even notice its length.

A definite keeper."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This grand, sweeping drama follows a grand family in the 18th century. All the characters are vividly drawn. None some like a characture. It follows a young girl, virtually abandoned by her parents, living with her grandmother. The only unbelievable part is how \\"in love\\" Barbara is with the much older Roger who she has met a few times as a child.Barbara's mother, Diana is very well done, with just the right touch of believability done to her \\"heartless\\" mother role. The grandmother, the Duchess is my favorite. The servants are even a great, at times humorous touch.This was a great historical read. I think the romance in this book is mostly tragic. I would highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This book was the first written by Houston TX housewife (and former editor of a local magazine). It's an impressive first outing.Innocent, young and pretty Barbara Anderley has led a sheltered life. When she and her sister and brothers were abandoned by her courtesan mother, they were taken in by a doting grandmother. Life on their 18th century country estate was a somewhat isolated and protected one.Barbara's father has recently fled to support a pretender to the British throne. Her mother, a flamboyant libertine, arranges a marriage between Barbara and Roger Montgeoffrey, Count of Devane. Barbara is thrilled, for she has known -- and loved -- the Count since childhood. Devane marries her for her dowry, admitting that he doesn't love her but she vows to win his love. (Names keep reminding me of DuMaurier's REBECCA -- Anderley for Manderley, Devane and Dewinter...look for more similarities.)As they move among the courts of France and England, Barbara becomes beautiful, worldly and sought-after as she falls more and more deeply in love with her husband. Then she discovers his terrible secret and her world falls apart.This is a fast-moving story with interesting, if predictable, characters. Readers of historical romance expect certain characters (beautiful heroines and handsome heroes, for example) and they want the story to develop certain ways. This one falls right along those lines. Don't look for lilting prose and surprising plot here but if you enjoy historical romances, you'll love THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Set in the opulent 18th Century, _Through a Glass Darkly_ is the story of an English noblewoman named Barbara Alderley. As the story begins she is fifteen, ready to be married, and coping with a father who has run from persecution as a Jacobite and thrown her family into financial ruin and a mother whose rather 'unsavory' reputation has brought her ridicule and disgrace in the royal court of King George. At the same time she is coming to realize that, as a woman, her own desires and dreams are largely unimportant and instead, her future is in the hands of her family and her future husband.Through countless plot twists and turns, Barbara eventually marries the man that she loves but is later forced to learn things about him that she could have never imagined and her life is changed forever.In many ways this book reads like a history lesson, but one that truly whisks the reader to the early 18th Century, a time when England's bubble economy is about to burst, the aristocracy still reigns supreme, and no one goes out without being properly powdered, rouged, and patched.Each detail (and there are many) truly makes this period of time come alive. However, though the setting is rich, it is the characters in this story that are absolutely unforgettable. Readers of historical fiction will be enthralled by this book, and there is enough suspense and romance to appeal to many other kinds of readers too. Highly recommended and a title I constantly display at my library."},{"Title":"The Dalai Lama's Secret Temple: Tantric Wall Paintings from Tibet","review":"Beautifuly done!

The temple is like the Sistine Chapel of Tibet, intended, as the Sistine Chapel was, originally for the eyes of the spiritual leaders alone, but has now been opened.Images are breathtakingly beautiful and quite unusual.Another great book to get, if you like this kind of book, is the book Alchi, from a temple in Ladakh (published by Shambhala) which shows a temple from several centuries earlier than the Tibetan one. An interesting contrast.Also recommended in the spiritual coffee table book genre is Richard Lannoy's Benares book, about the holiest of cities in India, where the Tibetans got their Tantric yogis from originally around the year 1000 or so."},{"Title":"The Dalai Lama's Secret Temple: Tantric Wall Paintings from Tibet","review":"In addition to being a meticulously executed illustrated art book, The Dalai Lama's Secret Temple: Tantric Wall Paintings from Tibet by Ian A. Baker, et al. guides the reader through some lesser known biographical details of Tibet's greatest Dalai Lamas and of the history of Tibetan Buddhist culture as a whole. The amazing drawings, many of which painted in an almost feverish surrealistic style, are accompanied by insights into the lore of the Dalai Lamas, with thoughtful excerpts from their writings. I am also much obliged as a book shopper to show my appreciation to the book's publisher, Thames &amp; Hudson, for the excellent printing quality and overall layout and binding of this book, details which for me always work to enhance the message of a book and to demonstrate the seriousness and loving care with which the authors themselves have treated their creation."},{"Title":"The Dalai Lama's Secret Temple: Tantric Wall Paintings from Tibet","review":"The Dala Lama's Secret Temple is a wonderful and insightful look into one of the most spectacular temples in Lhasa.

Better than I could have photographed myself, this book presents each of the walls paintings in the highest quality plates. Descriptions of the historical significance of the temple mirror the detail works of the painting. A nice addition to a library of Tibetan Art and Buddhism."},{"Title":"The Dalai Lama's Secret Temple: Tantric Wall Paintings from Tibet","review":"A really beautiful book: pictures are magnificents, thanks to the anonymous ancient painter and to the modern photographer, with many pictures of the details of the paintings. But the book is worthy not only to see. The first chapter tells a short but interesting history of the temple and of the Dalai Lamas, and at the beginning of each of the three main sections (as there are three walls painted in the temple, corresponding to the three pillars of Dzogchen teaching: base, path and fruit) a short but careful explanation of the principles of Dzogchen, in connection with the painted teachings of the secret temple.

But, the essays are enlightening on tibetan buddhist art. I'm not sure that the comparisons to Bosch and Breughal hold up to anyone who knows anything about european art, but that aside, it gives a fascinating overview of the history of the dali lamas and their relaitonship to art. i'd recommend this to anyone interested in art, buddhism or tibet. also, excellent page stock, photographs and binding."},{"Title":"The Dalai Lama's Secret Temple: Tantric Wall Paintings from Tibet","review":"Best books, have been there and study the wall painting for a long time! wonderful photos!just luck person could have it!"},{"Title":"The Dalai Lama's Secret Temple: Tantric Wall Paintings from Tibet","review":"The art captured within this book is much more than just beautiful, and has been helpful in my practice and understanding - going beyond verbal and written instruction."},{"Title":"The Dalai Lama's Secret Temple: Tantric Wall Paintings from Tibet","review":"In Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, just below the Potala Palace where the Dalai Lamas used to dwell, there is a small temple known as the Lukhang. It's built on a lake island and is used for worship of nagas (a kind of snake-spirits).The temple also has a secret top floor...The upper room of the Lukhang temple is decorated with mysterious mural paintings. These paintings were used by the Dalai Lamas as objects of meditation and contemplation. However, they were kept secret from ordinary believers. The temple was erected during the 17th century, but nobody knows exactly when the paintings were made. The present Dalai Lama never had the opportunity to see them in person, but he's familiar with their symbolism.\\"The Dalai Lama's Secret Temple\\" by Ian Baker and Thomas Laird is a colourful book showing and analyzing the wall paintings in some detail. The two authors are obviously supportive of Tibetan Buddhism, and it's not clear how they convinced the Chinese authorities to grant them access to the temple. The Dalai Lama himself has written the foreword to their book, and much of the interpretation is presumably based on his teachings.In many ways, the book is thus propaganda for Tibetan Buddhism, and it has a typically Western tendency to interpret the more mythological parts figuratively. Thus, nagas are said to symbolize the forces of nature, while (of course) Buddhists and Hindus tend to see them as real, supernatural beings. Even \\"the rainbow body\\", a supernatural and luminous body attained by accomplished masters after their physical death, is interpreted symbolically.Despite this, \\"The Dalai Lama's Secret Temple\\" is nevertheless quite interesting, and gives a glimpse of Tibetan religion usually not talked about in Western media. The upper room of the Lukhang temple was apparently use for a secret practice known as Dzogchen, a kind of meditation supposedly leading to instant Buddhahood. The practice seems to have included meditation on hallucinatory visions induced by sensory deprivation, and was considered extremely dangerous. The authors point out that Dzogchen was associated with the Nyingma sect of Tibetan Buddhism, which was persecuted by the dominant Geluk sect of the Dalai Lamas. Yet, an inner group of Geluk-pas nevertheless practiced Dzogchen in secret, including some of the Dalai Lamas themselves! Other secret practices included ritual sex with a female consort. The aim was to become a siddha, a perfected master who has reached complete enlightenment and attained supernatural powers. The siddhas are said to be masters of compassion, leading other creatures to liberation. At their deaths, they attain the previously mentioned \\"rainbow body\\".The various stages in this esoteric process to enlightenment are pictured on the temple walls. My initial reaction on seeing the mural paintings was that they are truly bizarre. The characters (mostly men, by the way) all look \\"stoned\\" or \\"high\\". Perhaps they are meant to look that way. The most humorous part of the book is a statement by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, laughingly denying that he ever had ritual sex!I guess he'll never be a siddha, then.\\"The Dalai Lama's Secret Temple\\" is interesting both as a (admittedly partisan) look at Tibetan religion, and as a travelogue about the distant land of Tibet. One star off for the allegorizing of the nagas, though."},{"Title":"The Dalai Lama's Secret Temple: Tantric Wall Paintings from Tibet","review":"In a visionary landscape worthy of Hieronymus Bosch, the murals at Lukhang depict spiritual adepts engaged in contemplative practices which were traditionally concealed even from ordained Tibetan monks. The murals' surreal, dream-like settings and esoteric symbolism defy easy access even to initiates. A visual analogue of the \\"twilight language\\" in which much Tantric literature is encoded, the paintings are often obscure and suggestive, urging the viewer beyond literal interpretations. Sections of the murals are accompanied by inscriptions which, quoting from various Tantric texts, illuminate the meaning behind specific images and serve as instructions in meditation and Tantric yoga. More than an illustrated treatise on mystical technique, however, the murals directly invoke Tibetan Buddhism's highest meditative experiences in visions that seem to anticipate the abstract art of the early 20th century. The murals fulfill a ritual function in that they seek \\"to bring about new relationships between persons and the sacred, to be a means for the transformation of the self.\\""},{"Title":"Artful Paper Dolls: New Ways To Play With a Traditional Form","review":"I waited eagerly for this book to be published, as I have been fascinated with the art paperdoll phenomenon on eBay and elsewhere (Claudine Hellmuth's \\"poppets,\\" for example). This book has more than satisfied my hopes. The author, Terry Taylor, has organized the book in an unusual way, mixing three main elements throughout - the history of paper dolls, fabulous art dolls made by himself and other artists, and projects one can do oneself at any skill level. Instead of plowing through the obligatory history chapters before getting to the inspirational part, the book slides a brief but solid history of paper dolls in with the contemporary art and the project ideas.It is lavishly illustrated, all on glossy paper, and it is astonishing that the publisher could produce the book at this low price. You'd expect a paperback, but this is a solid hardcover. Everybody I've shown it to became engrossed in paging through it, whether they were interested in paper dolls to begin with or not.Taylor has a wonderful presence, too; his voice is so friendly and funny. \\"If you never made a paper doll chain, I suggest - no, I insist - that you stop right here. Gather several sheets of paper and grab some scissors (but don't run with them)\\" he advises the reader before giving instructions on making a chain of paper dolls. You feel like you have the most fun high-school art teacher who infectiously loves his subject, and he's going to make sure you feel good about your own artistic vision, and that you learn everything you need to know as you go along.This is one of the best of the recent art how-to books that I've read, and I adore the author. I'll read his other books just to enjoy more of this talented and interesting guy."},{"Title":"Artful Paper Dolls: New Ways To Play With a Traditional Form","review":"Honestly, I have not tried any of the art projects from this book yet, but I know that someday I will. However, that said, it is still a really cool book to have! I keep it on my coffee table, and find myself flipping through the pages quite often just for fun and enjoyment. It is a must for a paperdoll collector (like me), as well as for anyone interested in altered art and/or collage. Nice book to add to your collection!"},{"Title":"Artful Paper Dolls: New Ways To Play With a Traditional Form","review":"Great book, I have recently begun creating and trading artdolls and ATC artdolls and this book is full of ideas and techniques.

I only received it a couple days ago, but can tell that I will have hours of enjoyment and inspiration. Beautiful images and stories - I truly love it!"},{"Title":"Artful Paper Dolls: New Ways To Play With a Traditional Form","review":"I adore this book. First, it was so much fun to read. Second, it made me so happy just to see the stuff. I am just starting to use paper doll images in my work and wanted a little \\"push,\\" but didn't expect so much info and inspiration. The writing was clear and concise and the photography and artwork easy to see and understand. Terry has a terrific voice and such affection for her subject. Even if you don't have a paper doll \\"thing\\", if you use images of women, or people in general, in your work, you could get some ideas from just looking at the kind of stuff featured. The work is original, and amusing. I think (being a bit sexist) that this would make a great book for a woman friend, even if she isn't an artist. Almost all of us played with paper dolls at one time and this is a sophisticated why to relive that experience."},{"Title":"Artful Paper Dolls: New Ways To Play With a Traditional Form","review":"If you love paper dolls, or are just interested in learning more about them, this is a great book for both. The author gives short history snippets at the beginning of the chapters which creates a well-rounded history of paper dolls.The book is divided into four topics: paper dolls, dresses, houses, and paper doll books. Each topic contains great ideas along with big, full-color photos. Some of the paper doll and clothes ideas are kinda weird, but hey, it's art (and it's about time people realized that paper dolls are an art form.)There are lots of ideas for creating your own paper dolls, and they range in all kinds of styles. One really cute idea deals with scanning computer parts into a computer and then using the scanned images to create a paper doll that looks like a weird, but very cute, robot paper doll. This is just one of the wonderful and highly unique ideas that the author includes in this book.Of course, these aren't all Taylor's ideas - he shares the spotlight with other skilled, paper doll artists. This gives a diversity of artwork, dolls, and paper doll \\"art books\\" for readers to examine and get inspiration and ideas from. The author also includes several paper doll templates at the back of the book.This book is so much more then just about the Ken-and-Barbie-type paper dolls you see in stores, its about REAL paper doll art. If you like making paper dolls and are looking for ways to expand your paper doll horizons, get this book."},{"Title":"Artful Paper Dolls: New Ways To Play With a Traditional Form","review":"I have always like toying in an artsy way with paper and images, and this is one of the greatest books I have seen for generating ideas and showing some techniques and approaches to paper collages, diaramas, collages.

Written with style and humor. Very informative and entertaining. I also welcomed the variety of designs. A must for every paperdoll collector."},{"Title":"Artful Paper Dolls: New Ways To Play With a Traditional Form","review":"Am I allowed to think of Terry Taylor's book as a \\"fun hodgepodge\\"? My spine usually stiffens when the noun \\"fun\\" is used as an adjective, but nowadays that probably proves what an antiquated & hopeless sense of humor I have.O.K., maybe I am jealous? What unadulterated fun it would be, dragging out about 80-years-worth of ephemera & building chapters to share with other demented collectors. My mother cut paper dolls from fashions printed in copies of \\"Godey's Lady's Book\\" ( a Civil War era magazine bound into books). These were provided by her maiden aunts; now those genes seem to be showing up in great-granddaughters who are terribly clever at \\"concocting\\" paper dolls over a century later. Reviewer mcHAIKU suggests that crafty folks in each generation might also welcome an 'artful' bibliography!Kids who grow up today without being overdosed with TV are the lucky ones. Their imaginations thrive & they don't clamor for store-bought \\"embellishments\\" either - they just scan images from their computers, or cut out the most amazing creatures & objects from slick magazine ads . . . or, better yet, create their own from an array of crayons, markers & color pencils. (These are made available by amazon.com in a great variety of departments: House & Garden, Tools & Hardware, Office products, Toys & Games!)\\"Artful Paper Dolls\\" is a useful springboard for those not overly blessed with imagination. For me, its purchase was definitely an indulgence, and cleverly tempts me to take many detours - dragging out what should normally be boxed up to give away: Cracker Jack 'prizes' & milagros, old postcard & stamp collections, buttons, ribbons, lace & other 'furbelows' - you name it.Terry Taylor sub-titled his book \\"new ways to play with a traditional form\\". I appreciate his being 'up front' as a male who grew up loving paper dolls. His other titles show his success at a variety of crafts, so why shouldn't he employ his ebullience and also encourage many amateurs to have fun? Tom Tierney's paper dolls of historical figures are well-researched & while the economy cannot support hundreds of creators of paper dolls, most of us could be adventuresome and create cards & dolls that radiate humor - the \\"attitude\\" I alluded to in the title of this review, and which I think Terry Taylor encourages."},{"Title":"Artful Paper Dolls: New Ways To Play With a Traditional Form","review":"Artful Paper Dolls was ordered via computer and promptly delivered within a week.

The idea of creating paper doll images by using different items such as photos,magazine cutouts,newspaper clips,feathers, etc. seemed like fun - but then he gets into jointed paper dolls that look more like marionettes with limbs way out of proportion, using exotic bird heads on top of female bodies, sad and angry childrens photo faces on magazine bodies and finally let's not forget the skeletons 'dressed up' in clothes and the 'ever so mirthful' shrine dolls. Some of the book is good and I'm sure the artists showcased are well respected in their fields.. but I'm involved with this type of collage art to create 'happy' or 'contemplative'designs - not stuff that makes me wince when I see it"},{"Title":"Academic Legal Writing: Law Review Articles, Student Notes, Seminar Papers, and Getting on Law Review, Second Edition (University Casebook Series)","review":"Former clerk to the Supreme Court and Professor at UCLA Eugene Volokh has given a remarkable gift to the legal community that would be a bargain at twice the price. It delivers pragmatic and thoughtful advice in a remarkably clear and lucid style. Moreover, it is not simply clear for law books--frankly, a low bar to pass--Volokh writes for the ordinary public daily on his eponymous blog (where you can read the first chapter of this book), and the skills required for that task manifest themselves in this work.Academic Legal Writing is also extremely systematic. Every aspect of the paper is taken into consideration, from the approach to research, to avoiding off-putting humor or politically charged language, time tables for submissions, and so on, even including how to draft letters to professors and law reviews asking them to look over your work and to consider it for publication.Academic Legal Writing is really in a class by itself. That said, perhaps I can indicate its greatness by invoking a few other names. Academic Legal Writing is a perfect companion volume to Bryan Gardner's The Elements of Legal Style. It is as clear and concise and accessible as Marvin Chirelstein's Concepts and Case Analysis in the Law of Contracts, and it deserves to be as ubiquitous and is certainly as valuable, thoughtful, and comprehensive as Joseph Glannon's E&E; Civil Procedure and Erwin Chemerinsky's Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies. If you know these books, you should be going \\"wow.\\" If you don't, and you are going to law school, I advise reading all of them. (Also Getting to Maybe, which I never found compelling, but am in the distinct minority view on.)I read Elizabeth Fajans and Mary R. Falk's Scholarly Writing for Law Students, which is also good and which Volokh recommends. Academic Legal Writing appears to be a very conscious next step beyond that book. In a perfect world, buying and reading both would be advisable. In the real world, I read Scholarly Writing once, Academic Legal Writing many, many times. Academic Legal Writing is your desert island pick.Please do yourself a favor and read this book. If you don't, you will simply be doing all of your competitors a likely unrequited kindness.One final note: Professor Volokh is a conservative of the thoughtful and sober variety. I am a liberal of the sort who avidly studies the Endangered Species List to see if \\"Thoughtful Conservatives\\" have been listed yet. This is not an issue: Professor Volokh's political beliefs are discernible in this book only by the most careful parsing: in some of his examples, he points out the misleading use of statistics in gun violence, an academic preoccupation of his. You could then do the math and figure out that he has at least one conservative leaning. Otherwise, his politics would be utterly inscrutable. And, frankly, this book would be on my bookshelf even if Professor Volokh had say, written a memo arguing that the Geneva Conventions were outdated and pointless. John Yoo, your path to redemption is clear."},{"Title":"Academic Legal Writing: Law Review Articles, Student Notes, Seminar Papers, and Getting on Law Review, Second Edition (University Casebook Series)","review":"Last year I learned that Professor Eugene Volokh, a prolific and superb acamedician and author, had written a book with a blueprint for writing in law school and beyond. My expectation was that the book would be good, but I was awed by just how good it was. Prof. Volokh (pronounced \\"Volk\\" I am told) has done an enormous service for academics like myself who struggle to help students and young colleagues to learn the art of writing in the legal domain. That means papers for law school, articles for student publication, and beyond, when a person enters the profession and seeks to enhance his or her name. Now he has a second edition, adding two chaper: one on getting on to law review (a major benefit for law students), and the other advice on how to enter writing competitions.Let me tell you how much I love this book. I bought ten copies of the first edition and distributed it to some of my students who I thought could benefit from it (although all can). My first choice to give one to was a protege of mine who was my research assistant, a moot court competitor (interscolastic), and a candidate for the law review board at the time. She advised me when I handed her the book, that it was required by all law review candidates--the board of editors run a program at my school and require the text.Next, I have a colleague who had not been writiing. I gave a copy of the book to him and he seems to have moved on to produce a publishable piece. My wife, who went back to law school to get an LLM degree had to engage in some serious writing. I gave her a copy of the book and she got very high grades on her work and is considering turning one of them into an article.So, when the new edition came out last week, I ordered 10 copies of it to spread the word again this year. I have been a professor of law for 37 years. I am thrilled that Professor Volokh saw fit to share his wisdom and insight into academic legal writing. Not since the original writing book that I learned from, Strunk and White's Elements of Style, has there been a book that I could recommend so heartily. If you are considering writing for law school or after, buy this book."},{"Title":"Academic Legal Writing: Law Review Articles, Student Notes, Seminar Papers, and Getting on Law Review, Second Edition (University Casebook Series)","review":"I didn't participate in law review or any other extracurricular activities. Since I didn't want to work for a big firm or a judge, I figured my time would be more rationally allocated by reading books on trial and appellate advocacy. I've read most of F. Lee Bailey's books on how to investigate and try various cases, I've attended several trial skills CLEs, and I've studied the closing arguments of the greats. I've also read just about everything by Bryan A. Garner.Thus, going into my last semester of law school, I knew a lot about persuasive and analytical writing, but almost nothing about scholarly writing. I had avoided \\"paper classes.\\"Unfortunately, my desire to take a certain class was outweighed by my aversion to academic writing: I was in a class where the entire grade would be based on one paper. Thus, I turned to Volokh's Academic Legal Writing.The date my paper was due severe formatting glitches caused me to lose 4 - 5 pages of text - the guts of one of my \\"Roman numeral\\" arguments. I spend several hours fixing the formatting that could have been spent doing final polishing. Although able to fix the footnotes, I never recovered that lost text.Nevertheless, I earned the second-highest grade, missing the top score by only 2 points. In earning this grade I bested several law review editors, and many of the top 10 students.Had I not read and employed the principles in Academic Legal Writing, I am confident I would not have done so well.One principle I learned was to demonstrate to the reader early in the paper why the paper is necessary. The best way to do this is to show that your paper picks up where another article left off, or that your paper covers an issue previously ignored. Thus, I began:\\"Although the federal bribery statute's scope is sweeping, covering conduct well beyond the \\"the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action,\\" it has been given scant attention. Legal scholars and political scientists are, in Professor Lowenstein's words, guilty of \\"sins of omission\\" for ignoring bribery. Little has changed since Professor Lowenstein's 1985 article. Thus, this Article seeks to fill one of the many gaps.\\"To those of you familiar with scholarly writing, making this point would seem obvious. But it was not obvious to me. Volokh's book taught me many things I did not know, and I suspect even experienced writers will learn something worth the investment of time and money in his book.It's also likely that those of you fluent with academic legal writing learned things piecemeal. Volokh's work is systematic: You will fill in gaps of our own knowledge.Go buy a book here."},{"Title":"Academic Legal Writing: Law Review Articles, Student Notes, Seminar Papers, and Getting on Law Review, Second Edition (University Casebook Series)","review":"It would be foolish to attempt the daunting and complex feat of writing a publishable law review article without frequent reference to Professor Volokh's excellent book. Unlike many how-to books in any field, Academic Legal Writing doesn't waste time recycling conventional wisdom or dabbling too much in abstract talk of standards. It is full of fresh insights and eminently practical advice about the whole process of academic legal writing, from thesis selection to publication. An under-praised but no less valuable advantage of Volokh's book is that it channels a genuine enthusiasm for legal scholarship that I found completely contagious. Writing a law review article is a grueling, difficult, and sometimes tedious process. I can be sure that the quality of my article improved drastically simply because Academic Legal Writing kept me motivated by holding up the image of a superb article and its value to the writer and to the scholarly community. This book should be required reading for every member of the nation's law reviews, and if I felt uppity enough, I might even recommend it to my law professors."},{"Title":"Academic Legal Writing: Law Review Articles, Student Notes, Seminar Papers, and Getting on Law Review, Second Edition (University Casebook Series)","review":"Volokh's book has many helpful tips about submitting articles to law journals. My co-author and I found the last portion of the book useful in timing our submissions. Also, the book was a great aide with how to negotiate with law reviews to get favorable terms, etc. As a side note, our paper was accepted by the UCLA Law Review and will be published in Feb. of 2005."},{"Title":"Academic Legal Writing: Law Review Articles, Student Notes, Seminar Papers, and Getting on Law Review, Second Edition (University Casebook Series)","review":"[Note: I wrote this review of the 1st Edition. It applies to the 2nd ed. too.]This book is one of the most useful tools you can buy to help you succeed in law school. Sure, there are plenty of study guides and study aids out there for law school - teaching you the ins-and-outs of proximate causation, useless stuff like the meaning of \\"possibility of reverter,\\" and how to say if a statement is hearsay. But success in law school involves much more than getting good grades in Contracts, Property, or Evidence. The key to distinguish yourself in law school (and immediately after) is your writing ability: Are you on law review? Have you written a note/article worthy of being published? Do you have a stellar writing sample for that clerkship application? Until this book, there was not a practical guide teaching academic legal writing. Every 1L should buy this book and read it before they attempt to take a seminar class or write a law review note. It will make a difference.My only complaint about Prof. Volokh's book is that it was not available until my last year of law school. Had it been published earlier, its lessons would have drastically improved my seminar papers and law review note. But if you're like me and no longer in law school, still check this book out. It isn't solely for law students. It is an extremely useful guide for new attorneys who hope to write publishable articles after law school.To borrow from the \\"give a man a fish...teach a man to fish\\" clich&eacute; (and thus horribly violate a lesson of Chapter 4), Prof. Volokh teaches law students and lawyers to \\"fish\\" by showing them how to write their own scholarly works."},{"Title":"Academic Legal Writing: Law Review Articles, Student Notes, Seminar Papers, and Getting on Law Review, Second Edition (University Casebook Series)","review":"Succinct, straightforward, info not available elsewhere (as easily), time-tested advice. Clearly worth having."},{"Title":"Academic Legal Writing: Law Review Articles, Student Notes, Seminar Papers, and Getting on Law Review, Second Edition (University Casebook Series)","review":"Professor Volokh's book has been invaluable to me as a writing guide. Relying on the guidance of this book, another student and I co-wrote a 2nd year independent study paper which received a high grade. Then we used his strategies to submit our work for publication offers--and received multiple offers! Prof. Volokh's tips and pointers are exactly the information no one else seems to teach you--particularly how to strategize sending out your work. Note that even his own writing style serves to inform readers what clear, concise, straightforward writing sounds like. It's not some airy-fairy, heavy treatise on what writing ought to be like with boring exercises--it's a compact, tight book on how to get it done efficiently and excellently. Best book purchase I've made in law school."},{"Title":"Academic Legal Writing: Law Review Articles, Student Notes, Seminar Papers, and Getting on Law Review, Second Edition (University Casebook Series)","review":"My law review assigned as required reading an essay that Professor Volokh later expanded on when he published this book. I benefited greatly by reading the essay as a law student, and I have again benefited by reading the book (first edition) as an attorney publishing in law reviews. The writing advice is superb, but what might get missed are helpful hints on how to publish in law reviews beyond your own, and how to publicize yourself afterward. All in all, it is a fantastic A-Z on how to engage in legal scholarship and make a name in doing so."},{"Title":"Academic Legal Writing: Law Review Articles, Student Notes, Seminar Papers, and Getting on Law Review, Second Edition (University Casebook Series)","review":"I highly recommend Professor Volokh's new book, Academic Legal Writing: Law Review Articles, Student Notes, and Seminar Papers.As the title suggests, it focuses primarily on legal writing, especially for aspiring and current law school students. However, anyone who wants to improve his/her writing and critical thinking skills should read this book. The book--which is only 189 pages--abounds in smart advice on how to write better and avoid common errors such as wordiness, unduly harsh criticism, overly technical language, etc.Speaking as someone who starts law school in a month and a half, I am glad I read this book. It gave me a nice view about what type of writing is expected in law school. And unlike some academic books, it is affordable and highly readable.Volokh addresses every possible question that a pre-law student could have about academic legal writing--how to choose a topic, how to test its claim or hypothesis, how to research it, how to use evidence (i.e., cases, law review articles, statistics, surveys, etc) correctly, and how even to publish and market your work.To take one example: Volokh advises that in the process of conducting research always check the original source. In other words, do not simply assume that a secondary source will correctly represent the original article or case. For example, even the most revered Courts (such as the Supreme Court of the United States) sometimes misstate facts, arguments, and holdings in cases.I can personally attest to the soundness of this advice. I once cited an article by a political science professor of mine in a paper I wrote for him. I relied on a secondary source to summarize his main thesis. When my professor graded the paper, he circled in red ink the citation of his work and wrote, This is not the argument I made. Did you bother to read the article?Again, this is a great book for anyone considering law school. It should be on every pre-law student's must-read list."},{"Title":"88 Secrets to Selling & Publishing Your Photography (88 Secrets)","review":"This book does just one thing for a person hoping to derive income from the sale of photographs. It tells you how to sell photographs.It doesn't tell you anything about equipment, or picture taking, or processing, or even how to run a photography business. It doesn't even take a comprehensive approach to marketing. Instead it provides useful tips on marketing photography, period. Moreover, Bourne doesn't just limit himself to one market, like stock photography. He covers all the markets and if one secret isn't applicable to you, the next one may be right up your alley.Calling it \\"88 Secrets\\" is a misnomer, because many of the ideas contained are simple common sense that someone interested in selling pictures could figure out for him or herself. Secondly, there are far more than 88 secrets because many of sections called secrets contain more than one idea for marketing.The reader will sometimes say, I knew that, sometimes say, I should have known that, and sometimes say, I never thought of that. But if you read the book and you follow some of the tips, you will increase sales of your pictures. Although the book is quite short, it's also inexpensive and the person willing to follow Bourne's advice will soon amortize the cost of the book. It probably won't put you in direct competition with Art Wolfe, but it will increase your photographic income if you have the will power to follow the tips.For example, the author discusses a traditional subject, query letters to editors to whom one hopes to sell pictures. He tells you what has to go into a letter if you want to get the editor's attention. He even provides a sample letter.In the very next paragraph, Bourne discusses something relatively new, e-books and how to go about publishing them. He even suggests software that will ease the work, and even how to structure an e-book. He says photography e-books are most popular if they take a how-to, travel, or adventure approach. \\"It will be easier to sell an e-book that features pictures of Yellowstone National Park if it is written as a travelogue rather than an attractive Yellowstone picture book.\\"I've read a few books on marketing pictures and sometimes find reasonable marketing advice buried in the verbiage.

The last two sections provide valuable information on who to contact for sales and all the issues that need to be considered to complete a successful business transaction."},{"Title":"88 Secrets to Selling & Publishing Your Photography (88 Secrets)","review":"I was thinking this would be a book about places to sell your photography like post cards and bookmarkers or stuff like that. I guess I just didn't look it over enough. It is pretty much just basic stuff about how to run a business in photography. Some I thought were a little simple, like it says you should have a seperate phone for your business. Also, you should tell family members to not use that phone for anything other than business. That would be true of any business be it photography or selling comic books. Some of it is good business practices that many would not think of but I think you could get a book on operating a home business or small business from the library and learn most of this stuff. It is not an expensive book so I'm not going to complain much. I would suggest though that a person that is going to do photography work might think of staying with one or two areas and get books on those. For example, wedding photography and stock photography and learn how to make it in those areas. Go ahead and buy it, if you don't like it you are not out much."},{"Title":"Minnesota Trivia (Trivia Fun)","review":"I enjoy Minnesota Trivia and am glad I bought it.

My kids and their kids take it off the shelf to see if I can answer the questions (1,296 of them) about Kettle Falls, Prince, Red River ox carts, Laura Ingalls Wilder, Bronko Nagurski, or Sister Elizabeth Kenny.

First, the text and the exercises lack mathematical depth. There are entire chapters, such as the one on AES, which add hardly anything to the official standard, and the book explanation is often harder to understand, and especially more ambiguous than the official standard of the protocols it is supposed to explain.On the other hand, it is a relatively \\"polished\\" book, without too many errors or typos. Most of the time, it gives gives enough information to implement the algorithms it talks about. But it certainly doesn't give you enough to become a cryptographer, or to evaluate the security of a new algorithm, or things like that."},{"Title":"Cryptography and Network Security (4th Edition)","review":"Stallings presents an updated education on cryptography. With a secondary emphasis on network security. In the cryptographic sections, there is a strong mathematical flavour. The narrative is not a high level, management-type discussion. It favours the professional mathematician and programmer, and ideally the intersection of these two skill sets.Unlike some other books on cryptography, here considerable space is also given to hash functions. These can sometimes be used as an alternative to a full encrypt/decrypt approach. If you are designing a system, you should ponder carefully whether a hashing approach might suffice. Usually if you only need to authenticate a message or item. Since, as the book relates, for all the complexity of the various hash algorithms, hashing is far simpler and faster than public key encryption. And there is no problem with key revocation. Another great simplification.The book covers the latest work on hashing. It appears that the 160 bit hash methods, like SHA-1, can now have collisions induced, as found by researchers at Tsinghua University. (Though the text doesn't appear to credit them.) Suggesting a migration to longer bit methods or to a more intricate method.One surprising feature of this 4th edition is that PKI is mentioned here, unlike earlier editions. PKI has been around long enough and is important enough that I would've thought the 3rd edition of the book would have covered it.The last sections of the book, on network and system security, are less mathematical. But to offset this, as it were, they require somewhat of a background in understanding the Internet Protocol and in the systems administration of a subnet of computers. Maybe the simplest advice to understand and implement is for a sysadmin to install and regularly run a password checker against the users' passwords."},{"Title":"Cryptography and Network Security (4th Edition)","review":"There has never been a more poorly written book, to my knowledge. The subject matter is fascinating and it is hard to imagine a less well-executed explanation of this material. It is difficult to count how many times that concepts are introduced and explained with statements that begin \\"It is obvious that...\\" - I've got news for the author, not much of those things are obvious, and smaller books explain the same material in much clearer and accessible language. I personally prefer the writings of Bruce Schneier on the subject. The rough thing is, the professor of the class I'm taking picked this for the textbook... I've had to download errata, search out information online, and buy other books to try to cover the material. One of the exercises is to brute-force attack a misprinted encrypted message, and one has to know to go to the author's website to download the corrected ciphertext. That totally sucks in an $80 book."},{"Title":"Cryptography and Network Security (4th Edition)","review":"An easy to read book on cryptography and security. Stallings illustrates concepts well, with lots of examples. If you're after mathematical depth, this book is not for you. This book is more about high level ideas and concepts."},{"Title":"Cryptography and Network Security (4th Edition)","review":"It's the best crypto book I've read, better than Schneier's and Ferguson's. Extensive math, yet no math degree needed - it's explained that well, plus he gives further (deeper) readings in the additional web pages (Linear Algebra, Special Forces crypto., Simplified DES and AES constructions (so you can see the construction and how they work), SAGE math problems that use the free Linux SAGE program). The book's additional web (restricted the book's purchaser's account and password) downloads are worth the price of the book. That adds 16 more chapters, which is I'd say is hundreds of more pages more beyond the book. That is the book to get if you are serious about crypto. See also authors Preneel and Rogaway. I do not understand the negative reviews given here. They must have read a different edition. This one is the 5th edition, the good one."},{"Title":"Cryptography and Network Security (4th Edition)","review":"I picked up this volume at a Security User Group meeting. As a networking professional and a CISSP I found it to be a solid security reference, especially on crypto topics. This book is conveniently organized in five parts, allowing one easily to focus on the broader subject of interest, with the chapters offering further granularity.Each of the book's nineteen chapters concludes with further recommended readings and references to pertinent websites, a list of key terms used throughout the chapter, review questions, and problems. The review questions are helpful to test one's comprehension of the contents. The recap of key terms along with the additional reading & website references are a solid study aid. I don't plan, however, to solve and/or code all of the problems from each chapter. That's for a different audience, perhaps the undergraduates in Computer Science and Engineering using this volume as a textbook.It seems to me that the author targets multiple audiences with this work, which is a thankless task. Reviews are likely to vary widely. For a practitioner responsible for implementing security solutions, as opposed to coding and developing products that utilize the crypto algorithms and security protocols, this is a solid reference. Also, if you are prepping for any of the various security certifications, consider this volume as a summary as well as detailed reference on cryptography. Thank you Mr. Stallings for another fine contribution to the field of networking and computer security!"},{"Title":"Cryptography and Network Security (4th Edition)","review":"This book is terrible.

But it is not a good book for people who are new to the subject. Though this book covers a lot of material, it is written in a disjointed, inconsistent manner. This text was used for a graduate class and our study group found this book unhelpful because of shifting notation and a lack of consistently building the models in a logical sequence. In one section one type of notation is used, then a section or two later, the same notation means something different, or the same concept is notated differently. There was also a lack of explanation in how the protocols fit together. The study group unanimously agreed that this book made the topics more confusing than they needed to be. Wasting time on sorting out notation rather than focusing on the protocols themselves was irritating. The next version of this book should edit the cohesion of the topics and the notation."},{"Title":"Cryptography and Network Security (4th Edition)","review":"Received the item in a timely manner and in good condition.Received the item in a timely manner and in good condition."},{"Title":"Cryptography and Network Security (4th Edition)","review":"I found the material mostly interesting if not occassionaly difficult to read.

Just because someone might do something that wasn't nice, doesn't necessitate calling them mean. Granted, there are mean people out there, but this book leads you to believe that anytime someone makes a wrong choice, or expects obedience to rules, they are mean. True, when parents yell, they aren't being nice. But most parents aren't mean, they just lose their temper, like most other people do, at times in their life. When you expect your child to eat good food, go to bed, clean their room, etc., that is definitely not being mean. I don't think a book of mean people should be written at all (we don't need more negative in this world), but if it is going to be written, write it about truly mean people. In other words, I don't think this book ought to have been made, let alone be read."},{"Title":"The Book of Mean People","review":"The book conveys that teachers, parents and other people who try to help you learn the way of things are just as mean as people who yell for no reason. This self-indulgent bit of writing by Toni Morrison's son may be an excellent example of how blind a mother's love can be. She supported him in this publishing effort. We should not."},{"Title":"The Book of Mean People","review":"I can't believe all the negative reviews this book has recieved on this site. Have these people never looked at the world through the eyes of children? Younger children (as well as many adolescents) see discipline and authority as \\"mean\\". It's helpful as a parent to be reminded of this and take the opportunities when we have to be \\"mean\\" (in their eyes) to explain why we do the things we do. \\"You have to eat your veggies because they help you stay healthy\\". \\"You have to obey because I want you to be safe\\". Etc, etc. I see this as a great book to be read to and with kids! It opens the door for discussions on the difference between behaviors that are truly mean (physical or emotional harm), things that annoy us (pesky little brothers), and things those in authority have us do for our own good (eating right, getting plenty of rest, etc.). Many, if not most children believe that adults live in a world where they can do anything they want. This book also creates a perfect opportunity for parents to talk about things we don't like to do and how we deal positively with the \\"mean\\" people we come in contact with. All in all a helpful book for those who chose to use it in a positive way."},{"Title":"The Book of Mean People","review":"i enjoyed this book. preschoolers deal in literal interpetations of what adults do and say. they have a hard time understanding \\"frowning people that smile\\". This book reminded me of some of Fred Gwynne's work on the same subject. how many times have you had a preschoolers to tell you \\"you're mean\\" because things don't go they way they plan or you do something they don't like. I think this book is for adults too. It gives us the child's possible perspective of the actions of the adults in their lives and leaves the child with the question...are they really mean people?"},{"Title":"The Book of Mean People","review":"I am very disappointed in this book. It is not appropriate for children of any ages. This book portrays teachers, mothers, friends, siblings and grandparents as mean people because they have expectations of the child.When I read this book to my 4 year old son, he looked at me and said \\"Mommy you are mean because you make me eat green beans\\".(A true fact from the book). I don't think it's appropriate for children to see caring adults as mean because they are trying to guide children into making good decisions.I suggest you check this book out from the library or borrow from a friend should you think you want this book. A total disappointment!"},{"Title":"The Book of Mean People","review":"I can certainly see why some would disagree with the portrayl of parents, teachers, etc. as mean but I agreee with some of the other positive reviews. I think the Morrision's give children validation for their experience of these expectations as \\"mean\\". As a parent it reminds me to not take it so personally or explain why it's not mean to make my son eat his breakfast but instead to acknowledge that in his experience it is mean. That doesn't make me change my decision but it does let me honor his feelings too. As a family therapist I think it can be a nice opening for parents and children to talk about how our feelings don't always match others intentions. And even more importantly it can be a chance to encourage children to talk about how to deal with feeling like they are being treated unfairly (a common complaint among children of almost any age). I would say that you should give it a chance, if nothing else it's a cute little book that gives your kid someone (even if they're fictional) who really understands their feelings."},{"Title":"The Book of Mean People","review":"I cannot believe how much negativity people put out. First of all this is supposed to be a cute and humorous book about what is considered mean. Children feel so many people in their lives are mean, because they can't understand everything just yet. This is not a book to teach children the differences between someone who is mean, and someone who is not!! This book validates children's feelings, and as an adult you can take the time to explain that people who tell you what to do are not really mean.Is this book meant for a toddler with very limited experiences and understanding. OF COURSE NOT!!! So stop reading it to toddlers. This is meant for children who can clearly understand the tongue-in-cheek. That is the target audience. I read this book to my second grade classes every year. Do they truly believe everyone that tells them what to do is mean? NO. But it does help them deal with other mean children. It helps them feel like they can cope when people are really mean to them. I tell them that you will always find mean people around you, how you react is more important. I also believe that they can even reflect and understand that not all the people in their lives are really not mean afterall. However children need to be old enough to be able to make that connection.This is an excellent book, it flows like poetry, the illustrations are great, and children enjoy it. My students could hear it everyday. It is short and sweet."},{"Title":"The Book of Mean People","review":"The is a terrific way for children to express their anger and fears about people who frustrate, control, threaten, tease, or ignore them - all with a sense of humor. I am a child/family psychologist and often provide this journal to my young clients as we work to process negative emotions."},{"Title":"The Book of Mean People","review":"Last night I was browsing the children's book section at a local bookstore and I came across a book for very young children entitled \\"The Book of Mean People.\\"I couldn't believe what I was reading! Page after page, the story told of how people who yell or tell you what to do, whether it is your teacher, your parents or your grandparents are mean. As I was reading, I was hoping that at some point in the book, the authors would make it clear to the children reading the book or having it read to them the difference between people actually being mean and parents caring for them.The message I got from this book was to defy authority and withdraw into your own world to escape \\"mean people.\\" If the authors were trying to be subtle about what was mean and what was caring, they failed miserably. One should not write books for very young children with subtle messages, it is indeed very careless.It is not only important to filter what your children watch on television and what music they listen to, but also what they read. Bad, or misguided messages lurk in books as well."},{"Title":"The Book of Mean People","review":"I borrowed this book from the library and after one reading, I put it away so that my kids couldn't find it. I agree with the other reviewers that the definition of \\"mean\\" used in this book is too broad. Maybe it was written so that you could discuss whether something was truly mean with your children, but try discussing subtleties such as that with a three-year-old. My six-year-old saw it as vindication of her calling me mean when I get her out of bed in the morning to go to school. I kept waiting for a page to come up saying that just because someone asks us to do something we don't want to do, that doesn't make them mean. That page never came."},{"Title":"The Book of Mean People","review":"I bought this book for my 5 year old daughter hoping it would help with the bully issue, but after reading it, I hid it. I showed the book to three other adults who also thought it was somewhat frightening and depressing for a child. An adult might think the book is somewhat humorous as to how a child labels people who set limits, babies who pull hair, teachers who correct homework etc. all as being mean. A child sees this book as justification that mom is mean if she makes me eat vegetables. It seems to say to the child that everyone in the whole world is mean. A somewhat pessimistic and dark look at humanity. Not cool for kids! Save your money!!!(...)"},{"Title":"The Book of Mean People","review":"I am sadly dissapointed by this book. Toni Morrison is one of my favorite authors--for adults. As a children's librarian, I think this book has missed the mark.

The ending appears to quickly close a book that seems to have had no real point from it's inception."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"In the previous, I thought information architecture (IA) is just about organizing the content, defining the labels and designing the navigation schemes. After reading this book, I understand IA is much much broader and useful than I can imagine.This book explains why we need IA and shows us steps and examples of how to do it well.The first few chapters of the book are about some basic user experience design and usability knowledge. They are useful if you are new to this field.After that few chapters, the book becomes more and more exciting. The author started to teach us the foundation of many IA techniques including user interviews, card sort exercise, meta data, controlled vocabulary, personas and scenarios, task analysis, web UI design and diagramming.Personally, I love chapter 9 - &quot;Making It All Up, Writing It All Down&quot; so much. It is about diagramming and documentation. It makes me understand that there are a lot of stuffs I have to prepare before I really build a web site.The example on re-organizing the Digital Web Magazine in chapter 10 also opens my eyes.Thank you, Christina!"},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"The ergonomically correct design of a web page is a very difficult task. The placement of information on pages and links to other pages is a very inexact, yet necessary science. However, great strides have been made in understanding how humans follow the flow of web pages, what attracts us and what sends us scurrying away in frustration. Many of the results of this ongoing research are summarized in this book.Information architecture is a new area and it is defined as the overall structure of a web presence. It starts at the initial idea of what you expect the web page to offer, continues through to the expectations that the user will have, passing through every facet of what the web page presents to the world. If there is one thing that the dot-bomb phenomena should have taught all of us it is that creating high quality web pages that work is a very hard thing to do. Subtle clues such as proximity, a slight difference in a color or font, location on the page from top to bottom and left to right all communicate something to the user. While those messages are very soft-spoken, they are very real and powerful, so it is necessary to learn them to be successful. The expenses of doing a quality job are much higher than almost everyone realized, so anything that can reduce the difficulty is appreciated.This book will do that for you. It will show you how to start the project by expanding the original idea, how to storyboard the page and how to refine it at the end. It can save you a lot of money and also is an excellent choice as a text for courses in how to design web pages."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"In this book, Wodtke presents a no-nonsense design methodology. Initial words condemn the shallowness of a &quot;design-by-guru&quot; methodology, and the rest of the book follows this up by giving plenty of hooks for thought and reflective design.

This book is an easy read with many valuable lessons, both burned and learned.Christina's no nonsense approaches culled from a rich experience in print and digital media make this book a must read for IA's, and the people that IA's want to influence, to start making them think differently about not making people think at all and inspiring interfaces that allow people to just DO.The most exciting thing about &quot;Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web&quot; is the way it begins to hint that there may just be life after the web for IAs who still have hope. Thanks for the affirmation that Information Architecture is still very alive and well, and most important, more necessary than ever.Nice Pants!"},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"Written in a clear, informal and humorous style, Christina takes on the challenge of explaining what Information architecture (IA) is all about and walks us step by step through the IA process and is descriptive and instructional instead of theoretical. This book doesn't give reader rigid rules such as \\"navigation bars should have only seven links\\" or some fixed methodology or which software to use for developing websites. Instead, this book is focused on the big picture of building a website: the big picture about the business's needs, the end user's needs, and what needs to go into the site and how to present information in a clear, easy to find format. Just like planning a skyscraper, a website needs its blueprint before choosing building materials or worry about the actual construction of the building.Personally, I find the chapter on \\"Making it all up, writing it all down\\" particularly helpful. Christina provides us with a set of tools to try out as part of the IA process. As she stated at the introduction, she didn't give us a set of rules but instead, developed a toolbox with a collection of techniques and principles for readers to pick and choose based on their needs. Tools that will actually make us think, make us work harder on formulating a better site structure rather than applying simple rules to all your problems.If you are involved in the web development process, regardless your role as the business managers, project planner, web designer, programmer, etc, and you need to buy any book on planning and organizing your website, this should be it."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"I was a young thing when I wrote this first edition, all fired up about all the silly gurus and rules based on bad science. As well, there were very very few books on usability or web design in general, and I felt I had an obligation to cover everything one had to know to practice IA, from user research to brainstorming. But in 1999, that seemed appropriate!But the second edition has a greater focus, many more years of my learnings PLUS the wisdom of my great friend Austin Govella (and even better pictures and diagrams.) It's focused on what you need to do IA, even if you aren't an IA. And if you are an IA, I guarantee you'll learn something you didn't know. I added in a rich nerdtastic chapter on search and a rocking one on social web architecture.Plus I'm really proud of answering some questions I'd never seen in print (or web, for that matter) before, such as how to move from a site architecture to a page architecture. You know, the gritty questions you run into when you are trying to make a website design work. The evergreen stuff from the first edition was kept and refined-- I challenge you to find better short coverage on effectively developing personas, for example (for long thorough coverage, there is always the marvelous About Face.)As of today the 2nd edition is 2 bucks more, but let me tell you it's worth 10 times that, as it's a significantly better book."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"I have to ask you a question - \\"Are you just starting yours studies at IA now?\\". If yes, probably this book will help you. It's easy to read, small and fun. A really nice overview about IA and even usability. You could spend a lot of time reading the polar bear book, and I recommend that, but start reading this book is a nice idea too.Unfortunely, if you have a little more experience on the subject, you won't get such surprising insights like the beginners readers. Christina has writen good things about the creation of personas and scenarios, one entire chapter, and that's all. Sometimes she mixes usability, IA and design in a strange way, losing focus. Even worst is how the book begin and over, very bad, with sad and ingenuous recommendations.Simplifying... if you looks at a nice overview about IA, you'll enjoy reading this book. Otherwise, search for another book, more consistent, with more focus and better ideas, not only common."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"This is a clear, concise guide to Web site architecture written with a sense of humor and whimsy that makes it an entertaining read.Christina brushes aside pat answers and offers an extraordinarily sharp analysis of Web architecture based on what counts most: helping users find what they want.Here's a book that offers important basic information on everything from organizing your content (she's exceptional at approaching a complex concept analytically) to deciding where on the page the links should go. And it's illustrated with loads of screen shots and examples from Web sites to help it all make sense.I'd rank it an &quot;A&quot; or &quot;A+++++++&quot; on the eBay ranking scale."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"Although best read by practitioners of information architecture (or those who peripherally practice it) this book is like Steve Krug's book in that it's no-nonsense, witty, erudite but not dry and has a solid thesis, readably espoused, passionately argued and well presented.It should be on every web designer/ web project/ software architect's book shelf.An A+"},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"This book won't present shocking facts about IA but it puts in writing many things that come in handy when you have to work in this field.

Overall, it's worth taking the time out to read a book like this."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"There ain't much to say about web-building that doesn't boil down to Jared Spool's motto: &quot;It depends...&quot;Does this book fill a real need?Does it clarify the challenges that face designers who have to be business people? Not really.Does it present research in a way that goes beyond what's out there? No, it just uses jargon and gets tangled in terminological quibbles."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"When reading the book I was briefly enthralled by her critical take on the standard (guru) guidelines for good site design - but it should have been a warning on what was to come: a mixing of usability, design and information architecture. Off course the three disciplines mingle in every site development, but in a book called Information Architecture it should dedicate all its pages to that subject - but all too often I find myself halfway through a chapter before realizing that it is mainly about design and usability (or even project management) and only secondly about information architecture.Another thing that seriously degrades the focus is what I see as a shameless attempt to make the book thicker by including non relevant material. On pages describing the organizing of content she manages to use up half a page with a picture of her husband with the caption \\"Looks cold, doesn't he?\\".She could also have spent more time organizing the book's content. With chapters named \\"Making It All Up, Writing It All Down\\", \\"All Together Now\\" and \\"Eat Me, Drink Me, Push Me\\" it is impossible to navigate in, impossible to look for some kind of principle behind the organizing of the content.The book should have been called \\"Site Development: IA, Design and Usability for the newcomer\\"."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"While well written and entertaining, the author fails in this book to present a volume with any real depth. If one is in search of a book that explains information architecture and provides some really good guidelines, this is, however, such a book.The reader is directed to carefully plan the Web site, to commit it to paper first and to do a prototype which should then be shown to others for their input as users.All this is fine. But she seems to thumb her nose at credible usability experts (while not naming them one senses one is Jakob Nielsen) by attempting to prove that the rules don't really matter all that much.That would be obvious when you visit her personal Web site, ... You'll find locating links a considerable task.I am sure she's very professional and very good at what she does. But this book did not speak to my desire to better understand usability and information architecture in a manner that I could adapt to my own work immediately. It was more of a survey of IA.I much prefer the work and exhaustive studies of Jakob Nielson and others who provide workable ideas that have proven themselves over time. The author of this book doesn't seem to hold with their findings. And indeed, one must know the rules and then set about to improve on them. So I have no argument with her here.My argument is that she puts no stock in the \\"rules\\" yet she fails to offer any alternatives. Had she done so, the book would have been a breakthrough read. It was not.Susanna K.

Any half decent editor could take a hundred pages out of this book in an hour, ending up with a much better read."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"Christina Wodtke has done for Information Architecture what Steve Krug did for usability - produce a practical and accessible introduction to the field. 'Blueprints' provides a pragmatic look at the practice of information architecture, illustrating a solid &quot;toolbox&quot; of techniques and methods useful for web designers, producers, developers, and others involved in the creation and evolution of web sites.Wodtke's quirky humor and light tone make the book an easy read, but don't let the fresh style convince you that the content is lightweight. Behind the breezy prose is solid instruction in methods that hit the sweet spot of effective tools that still work with limited budgets. The &quot;How-to&quot; coaching is coupled with reasonable explanations about why and when to apply the techniques...Ms. Wodtke doesn't just prescribe methodology, she informs the reader with enough theory behind the practice to explain and justify it to management, clients, or other team members.The tools taught in the book all center on creating a web site with great usability and findability - where things are easy to use and content is easy to find. While the &quot;toolbox&quot; isn't complete, it's a great foundation for pursuing a user-centered approach to creating web sites.The book's biggest shortcoming is inevitable - IA is a complex field, and there could be so much more detail on some of the topics. Sometimes I felt that I wanted more on a particular subject, and it wasn't there. But to keep the book readable and accessible, some things have to be left out. The book's recommended reading list does go into more depth on many of the topics, providing an avenue for people to learn more once they've absorbed the lessons here.Overall, this is a great debut and a valuable addition to the field of information architecture and the broader practice of web design and development. Experienced information architects will find little new here, but it's great to have a book that acts as a gentle on-ramp to IA and puts so much into one package. If you're new to the field, work in a related discipline like graphic design, or want to have a quick explanation of various IA methods for colleagues, I highly recommend Blueprints for the Web."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"I'm a web developer and have always been fascinated with the interaction of humans and web sites, and this book does an excellent job of explaining the subject in simple terms while addressing more complex issues, as well. I read this book back in 2003 when it was first published and, not being an information architect, was happy to find it spoke to my level of knowledge.With chapter titles like \\"First Principles: Some rules of thumb, and some thumbing of the rules\\" and \\"Gurus and Rules: In which some people like to boss you around, when we know that's my job,\\" the book entertains as it educates, and leaves you with a comrehensive set of steps & guidelines when designing a site from scratch or improving an existing one. Numerous case studies, screen shots and diagrams also break up the monotony of what could otherwise be a boring subject.If you're new to IA or are looking to expand your knowledge of architecting user interfaces for the web, this book belongs on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"This book is full of that kind of energy that makes it hard to stop reading. You can tell that Christina Wodke takes IA as something very personal, and has placed all that passion into these pages.She starts by making a solid case for IA, then proceeds to ditch the gurus and their hard rules with braveness and wit. Next, she opens her toolbox, and starts showing you an impressive set of tools which are exhaustively described, with all the secrets you need to use them effectively and great examples. It's the most practical book on Information Architecture that I've read so far.It doesn't matter if you are new to the discipline or an experienced architect, you'll still learn lots of useful stuff. The traditional subjects of IA are presented in a refreshing point of view, and it explains subjects that nobody before had revealed, with clarity and detail. For example: best practices for developing user research, how to build a good taxonomy, a great chapter on interaction design, and all you need to know about documentation - just to mention sample topics that were particularly relevant to me.Then she wraps it all up into an exercise project, and as if that wasn't enough the goes on to give you greats bits of advice on how to be a better professional, like how to get out of a creativity block and how to win the respect of the people you work with. Prof. Norman is best as describing it in the back cover: \\"what else can you ask for?\\"Within the first pages she says it's a small book, I'd say that's not quite precise. She also says she's put her whole brain into this book, she surely did. So my recommendation would be: don't waste the chance to feed on a really bright brain."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"As a professional Information Architect (IA), I try to read as many design books as I can, and this is one I will recommend again and again, mainly for it's refreshing lack of pretense and it's easy-to-follow style.For the Non-IA, read this book because it &quot;demystifies&quot; IA on many levels. It explains what an Information Architect does, why you might need one, and does a great job of discussing all of the possible deliverables an IA might produce and why. If you're overwhelmed with design &quot;buzzword bingo&quot;, this book explains a lot, and in easy-to-understand terms.For the IA, read this book for the up-to-the-minute tools and techniques. She doesn't dictate a fixed methodology or hard-and-fast rules, instead, she presents a toolbox and guidelines for using them. I found the chapters on Personas and Taxonomies/Controlled Vocabularies especially helpful. She demonstrates that she's been out there working in the real word when she offers advice on overcoming creative blocks, working with people, and how to get your ideas across to (not always supportive) groups of people.Many IAs will see themselves in this book (&quot;I've created wireframes that look just like that&quot; or &quot;Yes, I've found that too!&quot;), but the real value here might be recommending this book to your favorite Project Manager or Developer so they can gain a little more insight into what you do and go to bat for you on the next collaborative project."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"This book is a pretty quick read and a very good overview/introduction to the field of information architecture and HCI methods in general. Wodtke covers wireframes, content inventories, usability testing, interviewing users, heuristics, metadata, personas/scenarios, human memory, the concept of recall vs. recognition, and many other topics. After having a year of graduate coursework in HCI, I'm not sure I really learned anything new from this book but it was a really good refresher. Moreover, there's a diagramming chapter that is excellent. It included examples of some diagrams that I had never tried before and wasn't familiar with. Overall, I would highly recommend this book. It was fun and easy to read and very useful. For me, it will serve as a nice handy \\"all-in-one\\" reference guide."},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"When I read the following, I knew I'd purchased the right book:&quot;You are going to do it. You might be the project or product manager, the designer, the engineer, or the marketing guy. You're not really sure why it landed on your desk; heck, you're looking around to see if there is another desk you could slide onto. But as your hope for getting someone else to do it fades, you realize it has to be done. And this is the book I wrote for you.&quot;I am a software engineer (primarily web application development) and I spend most of my time writing &quot;backend&quot; code to query databases, apply business logic and generate server driven web pages (much like the one you are viewing right now).As these applications grow more sophisticated it becomes more and more important to organize the which, how and what of content. This comes up in many ways: the order in which the user sees information, the navigation from screen to screen, the amount of data being display and so on.This book begins with a description and basis for information architecture and then introduces a variety of principles that one can employ in creating an information architecture for a web site. Some examples of topics include wayfinding, navigation, organization, interviewing and mapping content.The author's voice maintains an informal tone - it's obvious the author did not want to sound pedantic. However, the content is rich and well developed so one doesn't feel patronized.The hidden value of this book is that it gives many examples when a principle is asserted. Just by touring the websites given with these principles in mind will make one a better information architect, be it formal or informal.So my rating is 5 stars; loved it, loved it, loved it!"},{"Title":"Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web","review":"Christina Wodtke says she doesn't like rules, so she calls them principals. Whats the difference? She says she won't recommend software. So why does she give us a click-by-click review of Adobe InDesign, her &quot;program of choice&quot;? She even recommends a tall triple latte if you need a caffine high. Hello? In between, she also says some relevant stuff (and takes a lot of time saying it), but the true nuggets of wisdom are easy to miss in this hodge-podge of opinion spiced with California-webchic. Blueprints for the Web reads more like a blog than a book, which is to say it's pretty badly organized for a book that's supposed to teach organization."},{"Title":"Eleven Short Stories/Undici Novelle (A Dual-Language Book) (English and Italian Edition)","review":"In my opinion, if you can read this book in Italian, you are an advanced student. If you can read the English side, you are probably reading at a college level.Here is a sentence from the first page: \\"La bimba andava sbadatamente, ed ecco ... diradandosi a poco a poco una piccola collina che a destra s'innalzava le si sciorina davanti allo sguardo l'immensit&agrave; delle acque del mare.\\"If you can't read that, don't buy the book.This book has a lot of long sentences, 20 word sentences are common. It also has a large vocabulary. Words repeat infrequently so reading didn't get easier as the story continued. Also, some of the words weren't in my 15,000-word dictionary.If you're already comfortable reading Italian, you might find this book useful, otherwise look somewhere else."},{"Title":"Eleven Short Stories/Undici Novelle (A Dual-Language Book) (English and Italian Edition)","review":"Yeah, its fun to study this way, and you will not even realize how much italian you have learned until you go back to read the book again or go read another book in italian and you will be like &quot;Holy cow I can understand some of this&quot;...I am reading this book for a second time now...my feelings on the actual stories themselves is really kinda hit or miss...some of them I thought were really cool, like Una Voce, it is a story about a blind man who is engaged to this woman. A doctor thinks he can cure the man's blindness. What happens? You have to read to find out but it was very interesting (Yeah I know it sounds like that movie with Val Kilmer but trust me, it's different). But honestly, for a lot of the other stories I was like please let this end. Maybe something was lost in the translation, and I'm not fluent in Italian, but Pirandello reminds me of a guy who takes 2 hours to set up a joke and then has no punchline. He writes like at the end there is going to be some really big catch like &quot;Woah I can't believe this happened!&quot; but then he just ends it before that catch ever takes place. So I guess what I am trying to sayis that this book is a great tool for learning italian, I just didn't find most of the stories very interesting. Still, I am glad I bought it. I thought &quot;Italian Stories&quot; were a lot more interesting.

Pirandello's descriptive language was choicely flamboyant and sonorous, especially in his early stories, and the pleasure of reading those stories comes more from the style than from the content. I can read Pirandello's plays in Italian easily enough, and better yet I can usually follow them on stage. So why would I want a Dual-Language edition? Here's why:\\"\\"Il cameriere, ancora in miniche di camicia, ma gi&agrave; impiccato in un altissimo colletto, coi radi capelli ben lisciati e disposti sul cranio, inarcando le folte ciglia giunte che parevan due baffi spostati, rasi dal labbro e appiccicati l&igrave; per non perderli, squadr&ograve; da capo ai piedi di giovanotto che gli stava sul pianerottolo della scala: campagnolo all'aspetto, col bavero del pastrano ruvido rialzato fin su gli orrechi e le mani paonazze. grocnchie dal freddo, che reggevano un sacchetto sudicio di qua, una vecchia valigetta di l&agrave;, a contrappeso.Yes, that is all one sentence, and yes, I can decipher the sense of it without much grief, and yes, the five words I'd never encountered before are all somewhat archaic, the sort of words one has to slide past in any 19th C English novel ... so, if you can handle that sentence, you certainly don't NEED this dual-language crutch. On the other hand, it's cheap, it's an interesting selection of eleven stories, and once in a while, when your brain boggles at prolixity, it's convenient."},{"Title":"Eleven Short Stories/Undici Novelle (A Dual-Language Book) (English and Italian Edition)","review":"There is a little bit of a chicken-or-egg paradox in reviewing a book such as this, in that I would probably have to be at a more advanced level of Italian study than the level of the book, in order to really appraise it properly. As it is, with the book representing a learning tool, I have to assume that the translator is accurate in his efforts. Indeed, where I know the proper Italian and English, it appears to be correct, thus I am giving 4 stars.

Anyone who prays the Rosary regularly knows that sometimes you really need some &quot;meat&quot; for your meditation. And most of the Rosary booklets out there are just that - booklets, which are fine in their way but don't really give you much to think about. I prefer to have LOTS of material to chew over while I'm meditating on each mystery, so much that I can't possibly finish it all in one sitting. There is an average of 15 pages devoted to EACH mystery, which provides a very substantial meal!

I highly recommend this book to anyone (not just Catholics) seeking an enhanced prayer experience or wanting to learn more about the life of Christ as revealed through and in the context of the mysteries of the rosary. This is a book I will return to again and again."},{"Title":"Mystery Stories: A Journey Through the Rosary","review":"James L. Carney's &quot;Mystery Stories: A Journey through the Rosary&quot; is an important work. There is nothing else like it on the market -- no one has made such a devoted effort to bring the mysteries of the Rosary to life in such a meaningful, genuine, and spiritually-uplifting manner. His book has given me new insights into the real people that populate Scripture -- from Jesus, Mary, and Peter to smaller characters such as Elizabeth or Pontius Pilate. So often in the past I viewed these figures as two-dimensional, &quot;holier than holy&quot; characters that lived in a &quot;different&quot; world than my own -- and I subsequently found myself struggling with my Scriptural readings. Mr. Carney's book has helped me bridge this gap.The author's research is meticulous, his prose clear, and his passion evident. His reflection questions at the end of each chapter are great aids for personal meditation, small faith communities, or catechesis. The Sorrowful Mysteries are particularly powerful as meditative reflections for the Lenten season -- I would recommend these for Christians of all stripes.This book has expanded my appreciation and understanding of the Rosary, of Scripture, and of my own relationship with Christ. &quot;Mystery Stories&quot; will remain an essential element of my prayer life for years to come. I commend Mr. Carney for his inspired effort, and encourage readers to take a chance on this book."},{"Title":"Mystery Stories: A Journey Through the Rosary","review":"I found Jim Carney's &quot;Mystery Stories&quot; a fruitful source for prayer and meditation. In the past, some authors tended to make their reflections on the life of Jesus and Mary so pietistic and saccharine that they were unpalatable. Thankfully, Carney's writing is based on scripture and on real true humanity as we experience it. Whether the rosary is your favorite devotion or not, Carney's &quot;Mystery Stories&quot; are such that I found myself becoming part of the scenes and conversations between Jesus, Mary and the people, both good and bad, who filled their lives. He treats the joyful, sorrowful and glorious mysteries not as devotional treastises but as real life experiences of Jesus and Mary as they walked this earth, the same one you and I journey on as we live out our own personal salvation history."},{"Title":"Mystery Stories: A Journey Through the Rosary","review":"This profoundly moving book is really more than a book; it is an experience in the humanizing of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, their family and friends as well as Jesus' enemies and detractors. All of these individuals become very real, and very much alive. The author's docudrama approach realistically fills in historical gaps with skill and imagination.The power of the 15 stories, as told by Carney, and the emotions they bring forth in the reader, require some time to pause for reflection and settling in. They wrench your emotions with both their beauty and their pain. At once, this book will fill your spirit and nurture your soul.Friends who do not read very much could not put the book down. Mystery Stories: A Journey Through the Rosary, is nothing short of inspired."},{"Title":"Mystery Stories: A Journey Through the Rosary","review":"This book if full of information to make the mysteries of the rosary come alive.

On the other hand, their recommendation to try Akershus in the Norwegian pavilion at Epcot was right on the money--excellent, very fresh food; charming service and nice surroundings. I don't know as we would have dined there without the detailed description and recommendation in this book.I don't agree that this guide only gives approval to the luxury locations. Bubbalou's Bodacious BBQ was a little joint in Winter Park that was very inexpensive and delicious, and I'm sure we would never have tried it (or even known about it, for that matter) if they hadn't highlighted it as a &quot;find.&quot; We also tried an Italian restaurant on 192 that we probably would have ignored as being one of the many &quot;lots of so-so food + tourist hype&quot; restaurants on that strip had Frommer's not recommended it. The food was excellent, the service very helpful and attentive, and it was a nice meal all around for a moderate (not inexpensive) cost.I appreciated the candor and detail of this guide; the lack of photos didn't concern me as I could find all the pictures I needed for almost everything on the internet."},{"Title":"Frommer's(r) Walt Disney World and Orlando 2003","review":"An excellent source of comprehensive information for those planning a vacation to Walt Disney World. I appreciated the detail as well as the recommendations. Anyone heading for Central Florida should definitely pick up a copy. It is the perfect size to take along with you so you can refer back to it while on your trip. The fold out map was a definite bonus in addition to the numerous and detailed locator maps found throughout the book. I would definitely recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Disney."},{"Title":"Frommer's(r) Walt Disney World and Orlando 2003","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. The author was so negative that the book was one great big downer. After the misery of making it through this book, it became clear that it was written by someone who just doesn't get the whole disney thing. I returned the book and purchased birnbaums and fodors guides which are about 100% better and written in a positive manner. My husband and I have been to disney world and disneyland many times over the years and are planning our first trip with our children. No one who feels that the majority of the theme parks are too \\"hokey\\" for them, has any business writing a guide for others."},{"Title":"Frommer's(r) Walt Disney World and Orlando 2003","review":"If you're planning a trip to Walt Disney World and Orlando, this is the book to guide you.Easy to use, fun to read, you'll feel like you're already there. There's a wealth of information to help you decide where to stay, where to eat and what to do.And the accuracy is astounding. So reliable in fact, that I used an earlier edition for checking facts when I worked as an editor.You won't miss a thing unless you run out of time."},{"Title":"Frommer's(r) Walt Disney World and Orlando 2003","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with another reader who stated that this book was extremely negative! While it is chuck full of helpful facts (like the weather at various times of the year) and a nice big fold out map of Orlando, it is also chuck full of sarcasm and downright negative commentary. I have been to Disney World before and had a marvelous experience at many of the locations the author refers to as &quot;overrated&quot; or restaurants the author(s) deem uneatable! I find it very interesting that the only restaurants in Disney World receiving their rave reviews were the gourmet Victoria and Alberts ($200 for a meal!) and other restaurants at high-end resorts. Some of us people enjoy comfort foods and meals during our vacations (at the highest in the $15 price range). Note that the gourment Victoria and Albert's are fabulous (they are!), but many of the other locations are great for the atmosphere. For example, the drive-in restaurant at MGM-Studios was a fabulous time for us...the food was great (think a step above Denny's for food...not gourmet, but not bad) and the atmosphere was SO wonderfully Walt Disney! Every attention to theme you could imagine. Isn't that WHY we spend our hard earned money to go enjoy the Disney theme parks? To be immersed in the themes and stories, and child-like joy! If you're looking for that, buy another book, because this book will make you want to avoid WDW all together!"},{"Title":"Frommer's(r) Walt Disney World and Orlando 2003","review":"I agree with others that the book is quite critical, but he's just telling the truth. We had to go to this place for a family event, and the book helped us prepare. He's right. It's over-rated, over-priced and not as entertaining as many other smaller amusement parks, museums, or other attractions. The food is very average at best, and over-priced, and the rides are no better than Disneyland in the 50s. The place is basically a gift shop. We were much better prepared for the trip because of this book."},{"Title":"Frommer's(r) Walt Disney World and Orlando 2003","review":"If you are planning a trip to Walt Disney World, this book is for you. There are so many things in Disney World to do and see that if you do not have a plan, and some idea of what you want to see, you will waste your trip. Frommer's helps you make heads or tails of what there is to see and do. The reviews for everything are very honest and unbiased. I used this book to help me plan my whole trip."},{"Title":"The Phantom of the Psyche: Freeing Ourself from Inner Passivity","review":"This book and its author, Peter Michaelson, changed my life and that of my husband and two grown sons. Our inner passivity can be so elusive that we don't even realize that it's running our world. Not just personally, but politically, globally, and universally.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. My personal opinion is that our inner passivity is the deepest layer of our psyches, and without uncovering how it's running our own world, and the WHOLE world, we will continue on a road of misery.If you've read self-help books, or been to a therapist, and feel as if you merely put a big bandaid on your woes without truly experiencing a healing, read this book. It will heal you at the deepest level."},{"Title":"The Phantom of the Psyche: Freeing Ourself from Inner Passivity","review":"For anyone who wants to get to the root of self-defeating behaviors and thought patterns, this book is for you. Peter Michaelson gets to the heart of passivity and how by being present deep in our psyche, it effects everything we do. He unveils how by passivity being present, and how we are unconsciously are drawn to negativity, we repeat old, self-defeating patterns of behavior. Not pop psychology or sensationalized fluff, this thorough, thought provoking information will get to the root of whatever issues one may be having. I'm reading this book for the second time & I'm sure I will be reading it again. The wealth of knowledge contained in the book in invaluable!!"},{"Title":"The Phantom of the Psyche: Freeing Ourself from Inner Passivity","review":"the author has rendered a tremendous service to the reader by his honest and in-depth writing on the subject of Inner Passivity.The crippler Passivity has kept more people in bondage and robbed them of enjoying a happy and successful life.If only Peter Michaelson could hold teaching sessions around the country to get this VITAL message out to those that may not have the opportunity of read his book.The Phantom of the Psyche not only helps the reader to look within for self discovery, but to also look outward at others in a much more understanding way.Inner Passivity needs to be exposed and explained, this book has done thatI highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Phantom of the Psyche: Freeing Ourself from Inner Passivity","review":"bought another for my husband. and he bought one for his therapist! this is a very good piece of work and has been of tremendous assistance as we work on our healing.

Thousands of terms used by the British and American underworld are carefully explained and, in some cases, early literary references are also noted.A few examples of this strange dialect include: \\"eternity box,\\" a coffin; \\"Mahometan gruel,\\" for coffee (because it was introduced from Muslim Turkey); \\"one of us\\" or \\"one of my cousins\\" was used for a harlot; \\"quill driver,\\" a scribe or hackney writer; \\"Friday face,\\" a dismal countenace (because Fridays were fast days in The Roman Church); \\"goloshes\\" comes from \\"Goliath's shoes,\\" so-called because these outer shoes are very large; \\"Bo-Peep,\\" one who sometimes hides and sometimes shows himself in public.

Whether you are already familiar with the extraordinary life and career of Coach Wooden, or you are looking for a quick biography-like synopsis of Coach Wooden's incredible story, or even if you have never heard about Coach Wooden, this book can inform, inspire, and entertain you.This book contains over 200 quotes by and about John Wooden, the greatest college basketball coach of all time (10 national championships in 12 years, including 7 in-a-row and an 88-game winning streak), and, more importantly, one of the greatest teachers of morals, character, and life values. As a long-time fan of Coach Wooden, I was impressed with how the selected quotes accurately captured the essence of Wooden the Coach, and Wooden the Man. The chapter titles provided a great working outline of Wooden's life and the teaching environments from which he has taught, and continues to teach, so many life lessons to so many people over the last 60+ years: Indiana Years, Early Westwood Days, Practices, Games, Dynasty, Teacher, Pupils, Philosophy, Retirement, Tributes, The Game Today, and Family.Although best known for his accomplishments on the basketball court, by far Wooden's greatest contributions have been made off the court. Reger's skillful selection of personal snapshots and anecdotes from and for Coach Wooden truly show how positively influential one person can be in the lives of others. Reger accurately assessed Coach Wooden's character and influence and paid the ultimate compliment to Wooden the Man when he wrote, \\"This world would be a better place if there were more human beings like John Wooden.\\""},{"Title":"Quotable Wooden (Potent Quotables)","review":"I did not know much about John Wooden, but a friend gave me a copy, since I read alot, and I absolutely loved this book. It was well formatted, starting with his early years through his wife's passing, and the quotes used reveal so much about his work and personal ethics. You really begin to admire him for much more than his basketball legacy. I felt like I had a sort of personal brush with John Wooden when I was done, it stayed with me for quite a while. I highly recommend this book for anyone who admires or aspires to simple, yet strong ethics."},{"Title":"Quotable Wooden (Potent Quotables)","review":"John Reger has done a masterful job in collecting a wonderful variety of John Wooden quotes and organizing them in a way that gives the reader doses of Wooden's wisdom on a variety of subjects. The book is a quick, easy read and the only negative thing about it is that it comes to an end so soon. After reading Reger's book, it makes it easy to understand part of what made Wooden such a great coach. He was also a teacher, a motivator and a man who believed and stood behind his principals. He taught about life as much as about basketball."},{"Title":"Quotable Wooden (Potent Quotables)","review":"The product was exactly as described. I ordered it for a Christmas present, so I was very happy with the shape that the book was in and the super fast shipping. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Quotable Wooden (Potent Quotables)","review":"Being a regular reader of Mr. Reger's newspaper column, I was excited to get my hands on his new book to see what he would select from Coach Wooden's vast collection of quotes and insights on life and basketball. As a UCLA graduate who unfortunately missed seeing Wooden coach, Mr. Reger has made it easy to imagine being at Pauley Pavilion during the Wooden era, cheering for the Bruins and taking in life lessons that have changed my personal outlook in many areas. I wholeheartedly suggest this book as an easy, casual read that will leave you feeling good and thinking positively."},{"Title":"A World In Debt","review":"One of the great and forgotten economic classics.Those who ignore history are bound to repeat its mistakes.Mandatory reading for Mr Greenspan, Bernanke and all bankers, let alone Central ones.What they propelled up must come crashing down.

Believe me, these will knock your socks off!"},{"Title":"A World In Debt","review":"When I hear experts discussing the economy these days, I think of this book by Freeman Tilden.

Published in 1838, Poe's fictionalized narrative, supposedly penned by Pym, a young man from Nantucket, describes Pym's experiences beginning in July, 1827. Stowed away in the hold of the ship and aided by his friend Augustus Barnard, whose father is captain of the Grampus, Pym endures more than a week alone and in almost total darkness before he discovers that a mutiny has occurred onboard.Macabre details of ghastly deaths and unrelieved bloodlust, the massacre of the crew, and the casting adrift of the captain presage even more gory events. A countermutiny, equally bloody, leaves only four men alive on the Grampus. A gale, a gruesome death ship which passes them, circling sharks, and additional deaths leave only two men alive when the brig capsizes.The second half of the account details the trip of discovery taken by Pym and the other survivor, along with an English crew from a passing ship, south to the \\"Antarctic Sea,\\" a voyage in which they go \\"more than eight degrees farther south than any previous navigators.\\" On this journey they encounter a monstrous \\"Arctic bear,\\" more than 15 feet long, a cat-like animal with red teeth and claws, warm water with Galapagos tortoises, a series of islands inhabited by canoe-paddling natives, the Aurora Borealis, hot and milky water, white ashy showers, and a huge human figure in white, not the sights reported by later Antarctic explorers.Poe's only novel, in the romantic tradition of sea adventures, presages the publication of Melville's Typee, which is a true story. In this case, Poe plays with the reader's sense of reality, claiming that his fictional narrative is true and that the fictional Pym had \\"refused\\" to publish it because he thought no one would believe his tale. Ironies abound, matched only by the romantic embellishments and imaginative \\"discoveries\\" in Antarctica that make this fast-paced narrative as full of tense drama as any soap opera. The abrupt \\"conclusion\\" remains ironically inconclusive. Breathless excitement and near death experiences, combined with mystical visions and inexplicable events, make this exciting narrative fun to read. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, and Related Tales (The World's Classics)","review":"This story, Poe's only novel, is an endurance test for both reader and characters. I believe it was originally serialized, and reads like a collection of incidents rather than a complete story. However, it is a captivating tale, astounding in it's detail and casual horror. Arthur Gordon Pym was born under an unlucky star. He survives in the most inconceivable circumstances, from a drifting, overturned hulk to the frozen waters of the Antarctic. Each page turned piles more horror in his path, described with a growing clinical distance. Pym himself becomes more desensitized to each incident, until he views the irrational with a casual curiosity. The language is beautifully detailed, and some feel this story is the inspiration for \\"Moby Dick.\\"Altogether, a delightfully disturbing story. One of the best I have read."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, and Related Tales (The World's Classics)","review":"At 150 pages or so, Arthur Gordon Pym is the closest Poe came to a novel. Rife with his characteristic polarization and dreamscape plots, this stands, in my opinion, as one of Poe's best. The short stories included only add to the mainstay, and it's a great value."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, and Related Tales (The World's Classics)","review":"In this novel I had the same feeling I used to have watching or reading Treasure Island. It is one of the best adventure novels I have ever read.It speaks about an adventure seeker, a Mr. A. Gordon Pym. He tries to leave the luxury of his little city Nantucket, where he used to live with his father. One friend of his convinces him to travel. The first voyage was a total disaster. But he did not quit his dream. He went on yet another ... Man, it was the most chilling experience I ever had. It is not like anything you dream, it is even stranger. No goblins nor trolls appear hear, yet still, Poe can really bring the horror to your heart.A mutiny is added to the singular experience Pym had, and then Cannibalism. And after you thought the story finished, you see that Poe starts a new story which not as impressive as the first, yet turns the attention to some other direction.The end was a bit shaky. I did not like it at all. I usually do not like open endings. That was the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars.Overall, I would recommend you to read it in the middle of the night (if you do not have anything else to do), with a cup of tea, and with no one else around! You would enjoy it even more."},{"Title":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, and Related Tales (The World's Classics)","review":"I do not love novels really and mostly I only get turned on by classics, but this is by far the masterpiece of all novels in that genre! 100% must have if you are a fan of ALL of Poe or just want to read a very special novel!"},{"Title":"Animal Snackers","review":"Using colorful pictures and text, this updated children's book for readers age 4-8 is sure to captivate adults and children alike. Everyone knows what humans eat. But what do the animals eat? As the author puts it in rhyme at the beginning:\\"Just ImagineImagine if we all could eat/nothing but our favorite treat, /eating where and when we're able, / never seated at a table.\\"From learning that Gorillas prefer bamboo, that Koala's will only eat eucalyptus leave, to the tickbird that eats pests off the Rhino's back, we find out some of the items that various birds and animals like to eat. The information is present in small rhyming poems of four lines using simple words that children can understand.At the same time, with the rhyming text on one side, there are colorful illustrations on the facing pages featuring the animal or bird described in text. Painted by the author, the illustrations are vibrant and colorful in a friendly way with no creatures being depicted in a frightening way. Like the text, which is cheerful and bright, so are the illustrations.To further enhance the reading experience for the young child, there are small definitions of the twelve creatures covered in the book at the back. Listed in alphabetical order, each animal or bird is briefly described as it its natural habitat and some characteristics.

The focus of this book is not a mysterious murder. In this volume Hamish is trying to figure out what is going on in a strange village in which all of the residents seem to be under a spell. Nobody is willing to talk about the strange things that have been happening in the village of Stoyre. With Elspeth's help Hamish is determined to uncover the village's secret.Did I find the solution to the mystery believable? Absolutely not. Still, a bit of a change of pace is nice. The books in which Hamish is outside Lochdubh are never quite as good as those on home turf, but this is a quality series, and all of the books are fun to read."},{"Title":"Death of a Village (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 19)","review":"This is a M.C.

At the start, Hamish gains the district police some good publicity by solving a major insurance scam and a nursing home scheme to defraud people of their houses. Fearing the likelihood of a promotion, Hamish fakes a drunk driving episode to quash any thoughts of his superiors advancing his career - he likes it just fine where he works solo in his little village and surrounding environs. But something hinky is going on in a nearby village on his beat - the townsfolk seem caught up in some sort of religious stupor and are being uncharacteristically quiet about what's happening. What evolves is a more suspenseful and complicated plot than usual that puts Hamish in a fair degree of bodily risk. His exploits with newspaper reporter and on-again, off-again girlfriend Elspeth only add to the fun. All told, another entertaining entry in this dependable set."},{"Title":"Death of a Village (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 19)","review":"Enjoyable, as always.

His on again/off again romance with Priscilla seems to be definitely, and permanently off now that she is soon to marry someone else. The village is convinced that Elpeth, the pretty, young reporter for the local paper, is much better suited to their favorite policeman but Hamish and Elspeth are not so sure. And once again Hamish's desire for peaceful village life is ignored. He is a victim of his own success, every time he solves a village puzzle and gains the attention of the press and his superiors he is in danger of being promoted and moved out of his comfortable home.In this volume Hamish outdoes himself, solving not just one or two problems but several mysteries including locating a missing child, resolving a case of domestic abuse, exposing an insurance fraud scheme to name just a few. It seems that the more Hamish trys to keep his life simple, to maybe find a lady to settle down in Lochdubh and raise a family, the more complicated things become.Fans of this series will definitely want to see what Hamish has been up to lately. Cozy fans who are not familiar with this series will enjoy this delightful trip to the Highlands although they will probably do better to begin at the start of the series and work their was forward. Anyone looking for more realistic or deeply challenging mysteries will probably want to look elsewhere because the true appeal of this series lies in the characters and not the crimes."},{"Title":"Death of a Village (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 19)","review":"every other bit of dialog is missing a new paragraph. makes it hard to know who is speaking. e.e.cummings"},{"Title":"Death of a Village (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 19)","review":"Another delightful read!

Of course our canny policeman isn't having any of this. Of course persuading his superiors to leave him where he is at his current rank is going to take some very quick and devious thinking. But can he pull it off? For in between trying to ensure that he is not transferred from Lochdubh, Hamish also gets entangled with a number of perplexing cases that deal with everything from a suspected domestic abuse to murder at a retirement home. And there is the mystery of the atmosphere at Stoyre, a fishing village on Hamish's patch. Even for the normally unfriendly and dour Highland villagers, the closed and cagey behaviour of the people of Stoyre has Hamish suspecting that something untoward is up. But what? No matter what, Hamish is determined to get to the bottom of what's going on at Stoyre...Not every Hamish MacBeth mystery novel makes for a completely enjoyable and worthwhile read. But I thought that \\"Death of a Village\\" was a particularly good installment in the series. M. C. Beaton's dry humour and gentle irony was evident, and was what made this book so very very readable and fun. Filled with quirky and eccentric characters that are not always likeable, beautiful and atmospheric descriptions of the Highlands and more than a few humourous episodes, this light, fast paced mystery novel was just what I needed to help me unwind at the day's end."},{"Title":"Death of a Village (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 19)","review":"\\"Visions o' God, Holy Grail, shipwreck, murder and mayhem, and all you lot can find to talk about is a mythical affair.\\" -- An exasperated HamishHighland charm and humor make for another winner from M.C. Beaton. Visiting Hamish Macbeth in his beloved Lochdubh is the cure for whatever ails you, its quirky residents and their strange ways sure to bring a smile and a laugh. Cleverly squirming out of the promotion Daviot wants to give our favorite village bobby so he can remain in Lochdubh, Hamish keeps finding ways to be a hero and calling unwanted attention to himself, prompting more schemes to avoid the city life.Still pining for Priscilla and in a state of irritation with Elspeth, Hamish and his dog Lugs have a lot on their plate. A husband beater and dog killer who may be escalating in violence and an entire village with a very strange atmosphere, even for the Highlands, add to his list of duties. A more pressing concern, however, is the nursing home on his beat which might be helping the patients who've signed over their homes cross over prematurely. Mrs. Docherty checks in, and together with Mr. Jefferson, help a very worried Hamish discover what's afoot.Before this one ends, a house blows up, someone is frightened to death by a ghostly apparition, Lugs is conked on the noggin, and Hamish tangles with pirates during a hurricane! But, not to worry. Lugs still finds time to stretch out by the fire and, in spite of his heroic deeds, Hamish manages to remain in Lochdubh so that we can come for another visit. This one is great fun, with a near perfect ending. A fine entry in this most marvelous and charming of mystery series."},{"Title":"Death of a Village (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 19)","review":"I thought that this latest installment of the Hamish Macbeth series is far better than the last few. Finally Hamish is starting to stop wallowing over Priscilla Halliburton Smythe (a character that became less interesting in each progressing installment)and has found new interest with the local astrologer/mystic/psychic/whateveryouwanttocallher Elspeth. She seems to be much more abitious than Priscilla and much more suited to Hamish. Another plus in this book is that the majority of action takes place outside of Lochdubh. The inhabitants of Lochdubh are wonderful but sometimes their quirks can be a bit stiffling, so these new characters were a welcome change of pace."},{"Title":"Death of a Village (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 19)","review":"No our highland hero doesn't don a cape and tights, but with as many crimes as he's solving he is achieving superhero status, with his devoted LUGS as his faithful sidekick.

And how to prevent a promotion that would send him away from his beloved Lochduh? With cunning, an offbeat attitude and a willingness for unorthodox methods, he dances about the plodding Blair and Anderson and pulls numerous surprising solutions out of his hat.

As always, the book is laced with sly humor throughout that is engaging, and the dialogue creates a feeling of authenticity of place, making the book highly enjoyable. One does not read these books for their literary value. One reads them purely for the fun of it.This time, Hamish is called to the isolated village of Storye, where something is just not quite right, as the normally god fearing, Calvinist population has seemingly taken fear of the Almighty to new heights, and are now seemingly fearful of everything. Just what is going on in Storye? Well, that is what Hamish tries to discover, that is, when he is not daydreaming about his ex-fianc&eacute;e Priscilla, who is now engaged to be married to someone else, or sparring with local news reporter Elspeth Grant, who seems to have taken a shine to our local constable.As with all cozy mysteries, it is not so much the mystery that is of import but the characters that revolve around the mystery, and the characters are certainly quirky and entertaining, adding to the charm of the series. With the oddly endearing Hamish Macbeth, the author has created a character that is a winner. I love this series of cozy mysteries!"},{"Title":"Death of a Village (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 19)","review":"Did television fame change Hamish? Or did it change the nature of his creator's storytelling about him? In any case, it seems to me that this book is more a collection of scripts they decided not to use in the TV series than a single, unified mystery. The stories fit together well enough, but no single story pulls the book through its beginning, middle, and end.Still, I like Hamish and M.C. Beaton always seems to get the dialog just right. The sentimental bits about Lugs the dog have a humorous undertone (is Lugs actually jealous of the new woman on the scene?) and the gossipy aspects of village life play fresh and funny again.It's tricky for a book serial to outlive its television counterpart, I think, especially when the television finale wrapped up so many loose ends. Maybe when we're all a little further away from BBC Lochdubh, it'll be possible for Hamish to return to the ordinarily extraordinary business of life as a village constable."},{"Title":"Death of a Village (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 19)","review":"MC Beaton pens another winner with \\"Death of a Village\\". No one can write a village mystery like her, and her Hamish is a wonderful character. I like him more each time out. In this book Hamish is on a winning crusade against crime in his patch. He cracks open a fraud ring, a nursing home scam, saves a little girl's life in a catastropic flood and uncovers a salvaging ring that is stripping a German submarine from World War II that had been downed somewhere near the village of Storye which is a village on his patch. Usually nothing much goes on in Storye, but when Hamish makes a routine visit there, he finds that the villagers are secretive and scared. He and his young reporter friend Elspeth try to determine what is going on in the tiny village. Hamish is hard pressed to keep his good deeds \\"off the radar screen\\" so to speak because the last thing he wants is promotion to a larger police station.

That was enough reason to continue on in this series.Hamish is my type of hero. I warmed right into M.C. Beaton's drawing of his character to appear, and be called, lazy, while she subtly portrayed him, through sauntering village vignettes as the best type of hero. He's a man who gets done whatever needs doing; a constable who gets to the bottom of issues, corruption, and life's daily problems of his constituents. During all that, he unravels mysteries of deep malice and cooks for his dog, Lugs. At the end of the day, or at sunrise or noon, I wouldn't call that lazy.Ironically (or maybe sanely), Hamish accomplishes all this because of, rather than in spite of his methodical sleuthing, his stepping around the maniacal push of wheel spinning, which we humans have come in recent decades to see as being award-winningly purposeful. The term \\"looking busy\\" didn't get coined for nothing. And it can't pay dues for anything, though it is sometimes a necessary (and wise) maneuver.The easy ways Hamish repeatedly gets around the faultless facades of Detective Chief Inspector Blair, and the ale-bubbling, bumbling boot-dragging of cohort-friend Jimmy Anderson is genius, endearing and simple.If most people are like me, they read escape fiction of this type to regain and remember what Hamish has never forgotten, never lost; an ability, more like a stubborn commitment, to live in the moment, to see (not flit through, or slide/slither around) what's going on in his world. And based on his slowly, carefully gathered observations, he repairs the off-base while he ferrets and flounders the bountiful wrongs in life. He's not only a true hero; he's a true man and a true village constable. What a guy.My favorite vignettes were the shenanigans of the geriatric couple sleuthing around on their knees in the wet grass outside the window of their nursing home rooms, struggling to catch, tie, and disable the red hands of evil. Beaton's characterization of this mix-matched pair was as heartwarming and cheer inducing as a fiction world can get. Move over Cocoon, step aside Cuckoo's Nest, we're flying over the Highlands with one (actually a couple of Energizer Bunny oldies in this case) of the best.Beaton's resolutions are pondering-ly, somewhat playfully, poignant, rather than being painted in over-the-rainbow, Kansas type sunset hues. But, as Hamish sets down his pipe (does he actually smoke one?) and pampers his dog at the end of a day or at the summing of a saga, solitude may twinge with a lonely edge, but the rightness of personal space never felt so cozy. Of course Hamish's spicy, feisty relationship with Elspeth may not have lost its embers.Throughout the story I wondered WHY Lugs disliked Elspeth with such growling gusto. Was he chust jealous? Or was there something deep, dark and sinister running through her DNA? (Loved the way Hamish scowled and said so in observation of Elspeth's garish dress code, which changed styles subtly yet blatantly through the plots and subplots.)I feel literally blessed to know that any time I need to settle for a while into a sane, slow, sensual world, and share a mystery beside a roaring, steady fire in a Highland's hearth, I can pick up another novel from MC Beaton's Hamish-Macbeth-Gateway-to-Ireland.One of the best parts? I don't have to toss my fingernail clippers out of my purse to get through security checks at airports, don't have to slug through jet-lag, and don't have to drag dead-on-my-feet a few days to get there and back.Easy chair, stay poofed. Lamp be clicked. We are soooo lucky to have these types of books.Linda G. ShelnuttP.S.

Then I read the flap note that mentions a BBC series.Gone Hollywood: written in short episodes for readers with a short attention span; lots of ready-to-film violent scenes with little characterization or connecting plot; plenty of stuff for the special effects people; mean and nasty in tone; way too many murders for the locality; little charm or local color; anti-religious and anti-rural cliches; hero of infinite strength and endurance; and of course, a major role for a girl with a bare midriff.In other words, Superman transported to the Highlands with less sex.Hard on the reader -- several sympathetic characters are needlessly killed or seriously injured. A little more work on the plot could have avoided that.Read an earlier one in the series -- or read \\"Evans Above\\" by Rhys Bowen."},{"Title":"Death of a Village (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 19)","review":"Fans of Hamish Macbeth will rejoice! Hamish is back, slightly perturbed by stories that his adored Priscilla will be marrying someone else. He knows they're unsuitable -- but he misses her.Tall, red-headed Hamish continues to attract women, however, and the local reporter Elspeth has been showing some interest. With her help, he digs into a series of cases that only loosely relate to one another.A nearby village seems caught up in a sinister spell. A lovely young wife seems to be abused. Residents check into a local nursing home and some seem to check out awfully fast. And villagers report some mysterious action along the jagged coastline.Hamish loves a mystery but this time his skill may get him the reward he doesn't want: a promotion to a big-city police force, where he'll be lost in the crowd.Nearly every character in the series -- as well as the reviewers -- call Hamish unambitious, but I think he's a man who's got everything he wants, and he knows it. And on some level, he seems to know he's not destined for marriage (thankfully -- the series would never be the same) and takes comfort in his beloved dog, Lugs.It's easy to dismiss M.C. Beaton's books as light -- and they are -- but she's a solid writer. She creates characters in a sentence or two and even gives them some depth. Her characters have self-defeating flaws as well as heroic virtues. Her books are small but you get a real sense of people and place -- the result of tight, careful writing. On page 233, we learn how Hamish acquired Lugs -- in 3 sentences.

He doesn't drink. He seems to like women, but somehow doesn't seem to handle it well. He is good at his job, but likes it so much he fears promotion more than anything in the world. Maybe apart from girls who don't dress properly. So he manages to avoid promotion by artful screw-ups, which don't damage the cases. His cases come at us by the half dozen.Frankly speaking, that is why I deduct a star: the cases are too brief. Hamish hardly settles down to working at them and thinking them through, and there, bingo, they are solved already. Like the murderous nursing home, which is a case that probably interests a few people: it should have been developed more carefully, not with the short attention span approach of a pre-prime-time episodical. Or the insurance fraud case: Beaton doesn't even try to let us watch Hamish solve it; we just have to believe it, there is no indication of what kind of proof he found in the safe of the dealer.But it is fun. Pity for Elspeth, had she worn different shoes, it might have worked."},{"Title":"Death of a Village (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 19)","review":"Death of a Village by M.C. Beaton is another great addition of the wonderful Hamish Macbeth Mysteries. Beaton has given us a bit of a different serving with this one though. Don't worry though, Hamish is still Hamish and Beaton's Highlands are still the wonderful, character filled place we always find in the world around Lochdubh.In Death of a Village Hamish is faced with a series of crimes, some small, some not so small, that must be solved and the flawed Hamish is up to them all. The author does deviate from her usual formula in this one, although I suppose you could count the one village in the book as the traditional one obnoxious character that sort of gets knocked off. Be that as it may, the story runs smoothly and there are few pages in the entire book where something is not happening.Like the rest of the Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, this one is light reading and fun reading. For those who are not familiar with these books, it should be noted that while they are indeed, \\"light\\" reading, they are not by any means \\"bad\\" reading. Beaton can say more in four or five sentences than most authors can say in a chapter. These are very well crafted stories meant to entertain and they certainly get the job done. I am one of those that feel many of our newer authors could take some lessons from Beaton as to story telling methods and story telling skills. I mean when the author has our hero frying a trout, he does just that...fries a trout! We really do not need five pages of filler telling us step by step how to cook a fish. That is what cook books are for. On the other hand, with a minimum number of words, Beaton can perfectly describe a Highland storm, or a mountain meadow.I was delighted to find in this work as to where and how Hamish obtained his wonder dog, Lugs. The personality of Lugs is so like that of Hamish, the author must be a great lover and observer of dogs. It was also interesting to read of the twists and turns our red headed hero took in order to avoid being promoted again. Now this is not meant to be a spoiler, but do not get your hopes up that Macbeth's love live will take a turn for the better....although it does take an interesting turn in this work. This poor guy just has no luck with woman...I wonder why? The author also, via Hamish, gives even more lesions on how to receive endless cups of coffee and tea and goodies at absolutely no cost to him self. This is actually quite useful information!Short, easy reads which are simply fun is the best way to describe these books. I still have several to go as I think there are about twenty of them, but I must admit to looking forward to the next and am sort of worried that I will eventually catch up with the author! Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Death of a Village (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 19)","review":"Rather than reading this book, I listened to the unabridged version. Perhaps that affected my reaction to the book, but the Hamesh MacBeth formula just seemed to be getting stale -- brilliant but much-maligned Hamesh solves cases despite interference from colleagues at head office. There were a lot of subplots going on in this mystery so there were a lot of mini-cases being solved. Because of this, there were a number of plots, but the main plot (from which the title comes) involves a very out of the way Scottish coastal town where some sort of religious revival is underway. Hamesh MacBeth, unambitious but brilliant police constable for the area, has a hunch that something sinister is going on, and starts trying to figure out what it is in between solving various cases despite the handicap of having to deal with the rest of the police force -- there is, for example, an insurance fraud case that has no bearing on the central plot, as nearly as I can figure out.I think the book would have been better if the author had adhered more closely to a central mystery (as she has in previous books). At times, this book seemed like a collection of stories -- each entertaining, but hearing one after another story of clever Hamesh didn't work for me. I preferred Hamesh when he was a little less heroic and more down to earth.That said, on the whole, this is a great series. And I love the Highland Scottish setting."},{"Title":"Death of a Village (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 19)","review":"Police constable Hamish Macbeth loves living in the small Scottish Highland village of Lochdubh because he knows and likes most of the residents who in turn trusts him.

Hamish can be annoying--both to Elspeth and the reader--by his judgemental attitude and his thoughtlessness to Elspeth's feelings, but Beaton's stories are strongly written and intriguing.In DEATH OF A VILLAGE, more than in some of the other Macbeth stories, Hamish seems to be going through the motions--his emotions don't feel quite real.

In all of the other titles, there's a reference to a death of a single person . . . who can be spotted in the first few pages of the book. In this case, you'll have a strong suspicion which village is doomed . . . but you won't know what's coming until it happens.Normally, Hamish Macbeth manages to solve one major crime during the course of a book. Well, in Death of a Village, Hamish is a positive crime-stopping superman . . . with a little help from his friends.The book opens in an odd fashion: Hamish makes a rare visit to off-the-beaten-path Stoyre and finds a curious quiet and reticence in the town. But he's even more amazed to find that the church is full for services during the day on a Monday. That's some religious revival!Intrigued by the change, Hamish recruits local reporter, horoscope writer, and frustrated Hamish-chaser, Elspeth Grant, to help him find out what's going on. Nosing around and taking in Sunday services reveals nothing out of the ordinary . . . except to confirm the curious quiet and reticence that Hamish spotted on the first visit. But, before long, there's a surprise in Stoyre. Hamish eventually decides to take a holiday and spend it in Stoyre to get the lay of the land.His concern is quickly distracted by a break-in at the grocery in Braikie, where all the wine and spirits have been taken. But Hamish senses that something funny is going on. Using his initiative, Hamish checks out the records of the grocer's supplier and makes several surprising finds. But the success backfires when Hamish adds to his local reputation as a woman chaser.Before the first case is done, he gets a call from a frightened Bella Comyn and her fear of her husband. Pretty soon, the husband is missing and Hamish is puzzled by odds and ends of the case. Sleuthing again leads to unexpected evidence.A visit to a Lochdubh widow, Mrs. Annie Docherty, leads Hamish to hear a surprising accusation which he decides to investigate with Mrs. Docherty's help. It quickly becomes curiouser and curiouser.Through all of these investigations, Hamish achieves successes that are quite impressive. Once again, promotion threatens and Hamish has to pull out all the stops to derail being uprooted from his beloved Lochdubh.M. C.

They are silent, avoidant, and are inexplicably flocking to religious revivals led by a suprisingly uncharismatic minister. In addition, a cottage in the village belonging to a retired Army Major has been blown up and nobody in the town claims to have seen or heard anything, nor do they have any interest in the matter.Hamish realizes something is very \\"off\\" and, with the help of Elspeth Grant, a local reporter, starts to get to the bottom of it. There is more than one mystery in this book (the village of Storye isn't the only thing that's weird) and the plots intertwine very nicely. There is a very good twist towards the end that I did not see coming.Hamish is the same guy we all know and love: he still has lousy luck with women, he's still treated terribly by boorish Inspector Blair who's still jealous of him, and he's still content to lead a simple and quiet life with his dog, Lugs.

Fuller's \\"It's a Wrap\\" is an engrossingly delectible journey that deftly weaves a tale of love, career, cuisine and culture through the mean streets of Boston to the glorious sunrises of the coastal New England seaboard, with stops in Providence, NY, and the Indian subcontinent (by proxy)along the way . It is a literary feast for the eyes and for the stomach.Thoughout the story, we are treated to the inner workings, musings, and adventures of a gonzo cameraman/A1 chef/lover/hero/antihero, Bart, who finds himself leaping from near death assaults, to sumptuous meals with an exquisite poetess, to a hard day's work with a ramshackle film crew at a moment's notice. On the way, though finding himself everywhere and nowhere at the same time, Bart comes to know the truth that to love and be loved is worth everything, no matter how twisted and troublesome the journey.H.H.

Fuller's \\"It's a Wrap\\" is an engrossingly delectible journey that deftly weaves a tale of love, career, cuisine and culture through the mean streets of Boston to the glorious sunrises of the coastal New England seaboard, with stops in Providence, NY, and the Indian subcontinent (by proxy)along the way . It is a literary feast for the eyes and for the stomach.Thoughout the story, we are treated to the inner workings, musings, and adventures of a gonzo cameraman/A1 chef/lover/hero/antihero, Bart, who finds himself leaping from near death assaults, to sumptuous meals with an exquisite poetess, to a hard day's work with a ramshackle film crew at a moment's notice. On the way, though finding himself everywhere and nowhere at the same time, Bart comes to know the truth that to love and be loved is worth everything, no matter how twisted and troublesome the journey.H.H.

It's a witty post-modern version of the Raymond Chandler style, full of first person impressions and wry musings shot full of clever similes. The suspense of being pursued by a vengeful pimp takes a back seat to the cameraman /protagonist's savy ways of getting just the right shot at each location, just in time before something bad starts to happen. I enjoyed it for that reason, and for the pleasure of being placed at the center of the action of a movie in production, seeing how much resourcefulness is required of a good cameraman---in the face of uncooperative weather, daily screwups by inexperienced crew members and takes ruined when gawkers get in the way of an action scene in progress.

However, no prior knowledge of Greek is required. The authors lead the reader through step-by-step basics, as each chapter builds skills and knowledge. The volume is not intended to make scholars out of neophytes. However, Kysar and Webb do a very admirable job of equipping the preacher to mine the many riches of the New Testament. Sample sermons are provided, as well. Various cautions and encouragements are candidly described. This book may well turn out to be a modern standard for the worthy challenge of preaching the Christian Scripture."},{"Title":"Urban Transit - Operations, Planning, and Economics","review":"How to plan an urban transit system of buses and trains? Vuchic offers a text suitable to accompany an undergraduate course in urban planning. It describes many aspects of transit. Like the ability to have articulated buses that have capacities 50% greater than standard buses. By using these on dedicated bus lanes, overall transit capacity can be enhanced. We see how multiple public agencies need to cooperate, to let such methods achieve optimal potential.Rail transit is extensively studied. Including the all-important aspect of scheduling. There is some maths required of the student. But the text is not a fully fledged foray into scheduling theory. Chapters have numerous exercises that help the reader gain some fluency in understanding scheduling.Another related aspect is the geometry of transit lines. How to best lay out these lines. We see that there are systematic mathematical ideas that can be applied. It's not just some qualitative handwaving."},{"Title":"Giants Of Ragtime","review":"Max Morath has been a prominent figure in Ragtime Revival since the late 1950s, and is still doing shows in the new century. He was among the first to really present a somewhat comprehensive portfolio of ragtime that we need to know about. In this case, the inclusion of Eubie Blakes 'Dictys on Seventh Avenue' and James Europe's 'Castle House Rag' help complete that picture, and are hard to find elsewhere. However, there have since been many more complete portfolios published that provide a better picture of the era, and better selections. This does not downgrade the attempt that Max made, including his notes contained within, and which Edward B. Marks continues to publish. The two aforementioned pieces are likely worth the purchase alone. But if you are looking for more mainstream ragtime with historical value, the Dover series might provide you with a more varietal library of great performance pieces. You can listen to Dictys on my site, then decide if this fascinating piece is worth obtaining this addition to your library."},{"Title":"Unlocking the Doors: A Woman's Struggle Against Intolerance","review":"We read the novel Unlocking the Doors: A Woman's Struggle Against Intolerance in our grade 10 history class after Mrs. Olsson visited our school.

This is the setting for Douglas Reeman's fourth book, as a special Royal Navy team is detailed into the Adriatic to destroy a Nazi floating drydock.The pressures and tensions of undersea warfare make this book more of a psychological thriller than some of Reeman's other titles.

This book is a synopsis of the surgery specialty around 1920s. The book is unexpectedly modern in terms of surgical diseases it describes but much outdated when it comes to pathophysiology and treatment. The reason I highly recommend reading this book is best stated in the foreword by Dr. Pestana: \\"[The book] puts our profession [surgery] in perspective. We have indeed come a long way. But let's not get too proud of our surgical practice in the first decade of the 21st century. When our textbooks are reprinted a hundred years from now, their pages will look as quaint and dated as those that you now hold in your hands.

If you're a fan of Motoyama's perspective, this book is a must as it more thoroughly examines both cases and the theory of reincarnation that are secondary in his other works.In this book, Motoyama thoroughly explains the function of karma; how it is formed and how we must deal with it. What ever karma we leave unresolved is then that which leads us to our next incarnation. Motoyama explains that karma exists at many levels, expanding the traditional definition of the term to personal karma, familial, karma, racial karma, geographical karma, national karma and even global karma.As with his other works, he supplies ample evidence from his experiences in satori to elucidate his theory. For example, he tells the story of a family who came to him seeking the cure of an incurable illness. When Motoyama entered satori, he found that the land that they lived on used to be owned by a famous saki brewer long ago and that their wells were blessed by a powerful spirit. Sadly, the brewery closed, the wells were blocked and an apartment complex was put up in its place. Motoyama concluded that the illness was due to this forgotten spirit's rage. This is one example of geographic karma, where generations of a family were bound to one place for centuries, but then did not have the foresight to compassionately separate themselves from the giving land and their geographical karmic bonds."},{"Title":"Play Baseball the Ripken Way: The Complete Illustrated Guide to the Fundamentals","review":"Good effort by Cal and he adds some very good values when being a teammate.I would like to have seen some of the hitting skills broken up to even more basic elements.Youth Baseball DrillsAlso consider one of Amazon's top selling Little League books by Marty Schupak."},{"Title":"Play Baseball the Ripken Way: The Complete Illustrated Guide to the Fundamentals","review":"This book isn't bad.

Fortunately, that is not the case with this book. The Ripkens have obviously thought deeply about the fundamentals of baseball and how to teach them to young players. They boil the instruction down to the essence, and explain why. For example, I have always heard \\"get your butt down,\\" to field a ground ball. The Ripkens explain that's so you can see the ball better as it comes to you. How many times have you heard coaches tell young players to \\"get the back elbow up\\" when hitting? I know that's wrong - now I know why it's wrong.All in all, this a great instructional book.

Look no further, because this book has everything you will need and a whole lot more. The Ripkens have put together a baseball book that tells the how to, in an approach easy to understand and not only the how to but the why, which as Cal points out, all kids ask.

I played as a kid and go to seem MLB games in my home town of Toronto. We are in the same conference as the Baltimore Orioles (American League East), Cal's old team so I saw him play quite a bit. He is a graceful and thoughtful player. His four trademarks were a love of the game, natural ability, a lot of practice, a thinking player, and he has a lot of experience. Also he comes from a baseball family. In short he is among the best all round players to have ever played the games and to our benefit he stayed late after every game signing autographs - a rarity today.If I was going to pick one recent player to write a book an learning baseball he would be the man. He has intelligence, experience and the love for the game. Many other players might be faster, or better hitters, etc. but he was the total package, a guy that could pace himself on and off the field and a person that really loved the game and cared for the fans.So that brings us to the book. It is impressive! It is a work of love by the authors. It is well laid out with a chapter by chapter review of the game with lots and lots of bright color photographs, some in a time sequence so they show how the action evolves. He and the other authors appear in the photos wearing simple black and white uniforms demonstrating baseball fundamentals. He tries to explain some of the more subtle yet important parts of the game. He covers all the basic aspects such as pitching, how to hold the pitched ball, catching, playing the infield, the outfield, hitting, etc.Excellent for all levels of baseball, playing or a fan. Highly recommend. Everyone will learn something new, even old fans like me."},{"Title":"Play Baseball the Ripken Way: The Complete Illustrated Guide to the Fundamentals","review":"I picked up this book at the local sporting goods store while I was buying gloves, bats, socks, pants, and etc. for my two sons who were starting little league baseball.Just a few weeks earlier, I had declined a spot as an assistant coach due to not being \\"athletic\\", and I saw Ripken's book as an opportunity to learn some of the things that other dads had learned as kids.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have not read it cover-to-cover, but have browsed and spot-read it throughout the season.As a result, I now understand more of the things other dads are yelling out. For example, for those in the field, \\"keep your eye on the ball\\" means watch the ball from the beginning of the pitch, all the way to the bat, as it connects with and leaves the bat, then all the way to the glove.Chapters are given for each of the aspects of the game, pitching, fielding, hitting, catching, running, and so forth. Text narratives are easily understood, avoiding or explaining the sports \\"jargon\\" that confuses many beginning players (e.g. \\"choke up on the bat\\", \\"take two\\"). Pictures explicitly illustrate concepts such as batting and fielding stances.Ripken's narrative also provides fun training excercises used by coaches (both major and little leagues) to develop baseball skills.I have kept this book within an arm's reach in my office all summer long.

Just about to start again with a 4 year old next season so figured I'd buy a few books to do a better job. Got some personal validation when I found out that I have much of the same philosophy as the Ripkens, and also got some great new drills and coaching advice to go along with that. I bought two books, Play Baseball The Ripken Way, and Coaching the Ripken Way, and both have great tips from dealing with parents and then going on to cover just about every aspect of youth baseball coaching and playing that you will need to know, including illustrated drills. I'm a slow reader, these books are interesting and very easy to read, I had no trouble at all getting through them and will definitely continue to use them once the practices start up again.

Dr. Luther elequently examines Paul's epistle to the Galations with one sole question on his mind: What does this verse mean? His notes on the verses are structured to answer that very question throughout Paul's book.I have in my ownership...one of the old editions translated into English - dated 1796. On the inside cover there is a quote from John Bunyan (the infamous writer of \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" and \\"Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners\\") which reads as follows: \\"I do prefer this book of MARTIN LUTHER upon the Galatians, excepting the Holy Bible, before all books that I have ever seen.\\" That there speaks volumes of the value of this commentary.It is considered by many theologians to be Dr. Luther's greatest work. It is a valued book on this Protestant's bookshelf and would highly recommend it to any believer. Sola Scriptura!"},{"Title":"A commentary on St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians,","review":"This is, in my estimation, the greatest non-canonical book ever written.Luther expounds Paul's epistle to the Galatians with an insight, power and depth of emotion which is sorely lacking in modern commentaries. He is not concerned with the various potential interpretations of \\"problematic passages\\" that fill the pages of other commentaries. From the very first page Luther cuts to the heart of the epistle-the doctrine of justification-in the way that only he can. His bold words and plain-sense interpretations result in a work filled with much of the same force and passion that characterized the epistle itself. The grace of God and the love of Jesus Christ cling to every word like the scent of a precious perfume. I cannot recommend this work highly enough.This is the very essence of the gospel as understood by the one who \\"rediscovered\\" the doctrines of faith and grace as he teaches us from the words of the one to whom God first revealed those doctrines. If you are looking for an up-to-date critical commentary or a greek-focused exegetical work then you will not find it here, but if you would hear a plain declaration of the power and wisdom of God then you will not find a better treatise apart from the Bible."},{"Title":"A commentary on St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians,","review":"This review covers the Flemming H. Revell Commentary on St. Paul's Epistle to The Galations. This version is based upon Luther's lectures at the University of Wittenberg in 1531 and the translation is based upon the \\"Middleton\\" edition of 1575. This is the best version to my knowledge, but it is written in King James english. On the positive side, it reads very poetic, but on the negative, it is harder to follow. I personally like this writing as it is closer to the language of the 16th Century. This book was considered by Luther to be his favorite, and history rates it highly. To summarize, it has a number of messages, (1) Galations shows that a person who is in true faith can fall away if they are negatively influenced by false teaching - a real problem in today's world. (2) That Biblical teaching must be solely based upon Bible scripture, and anyone who teaches man's doctrines using random Bible passages to support his/her sermons is most likely not a trustworthy preacher. (3) That even faith is a gift of God, and not a decision that a person makes. (4) That \\"Justification\\" is based upon \\"faith alone. (5) That Mose's OT law condemns mankind, and that anything a person tries to add to God's grace in the way of works or self rightiousness,denies what Jesus Christ did for mankind on the cross - Galatians 5:4. (6) That good works result from heart felt faith, and that good works do not preceed or contribute to salvation when it comes to \\"Justification.\\"The world needs this teaching to be more prevalent; however, the world does not like to hear it; therefore, it is almost lost in today's religious teachings. This work is a masterpiece with few peers if any, and is highly recommended to a person familiar with the Bible who desires to grow in their faith and understanding."},{"Title":"A commentary on St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians,","review":"This edition is written in an old English style and my eyes bugged out trying to translate on the fly, so I gave up.

I found it engaging and fascinating. There were a few parts where it got a little too detailed but I just skimmed past those parts."},{"Title":"The Great Coverup: Nixon and the Scandal of Watergate","review":"Anyone who knows anything about American history probably knows at least a few things about Watergate. What was famously waived off as a \\"third-rate burglary\\" would later lead to the first and only resignation of a U.S. President. In The Great Coverup, author Barry Sussman describes the entire course of events from the burglaries, court proceedings, the Senate hearings, right to the end.What would become known as the Watergate Scandal started in June 1972 when some operatives working under the direction of the White House broke in to the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Complex in Washington, D.C. When the burglars were caught and arrested, leaders at the White House, including President Nixon, H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, and John Dean, plus those working at the President's re-election committee, began orchestrating a cover-up. From there, attempts were made to use \\"hush money\\" to prevent the burglars from talking about their connections to the White House. As time went on and more evidence of possible malfeasance cropped up, the cover-up only continued to get bigger. It was not long after Nixon's landslide victory in the 1972 presidential election that things started really heating up.The Washington Post had continued to publish articles throughout the whole affair helping to keep the scandal in the public eye. Sussman himself worked at the Post and he includes some interesting information about how reporters and others at the Post reacted to the news. The Nixon Administration, and some Republican surrogates, continued to criticize the Post for what they said was partisan attacks.In early 1973, with public pressure mounting, the Senate created a select committee, popularly known as the \\"Watergate Committee,\\" chaired by Senator Sam Ervin, to investigate Nixon's campaign activities and possible illegalities. Nixon tried to cut his losses and fired several people, like Haldeman and Dean, in late April to try to separate himself from the scandal. John Dean would testify lengthily before the Watergate Committee about what the administration had done and a surprise witness, Alexander Butterfield, testified that he knew of a taping system in the White House. From that point, the battle would become one to get the tapes.Not only did the Senate want the tapes, so did a Special Prosecutor, Archibald Cox. Nixon, knowing how damaging the tapes would be to his political career and unwilling to simply destroy them, stonewalled every way possible. He refused to release the tapes citing \\"executive privilege.\\" In what would become known as the \\"Saturday Night Massacre,\\" in October Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Cox. He refused and resigned. The Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus also refused and resigned. Only Solicitor General Robert Bork, the number three guy at the Department of Justice, followed Nixon's demand.Nixon's continued interference in these affairs only served to sour whatever support he had left as 1973 turned into 1974. In that year, the House of Representatives started looking into possible impeachment. At one point, Nixon released heavily edited transcripts of key tapes to try to satisfy investigators and the public. Almost no one was fooled and certain members of Congress, who were allowed to listened to the tapes to compare with the transcripts, were outraged at the edits. In June 1974, the Supreme Court, in a case brought to it by the new Special Prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, ruled unanimously that Nixon had to release the tapes. Some tapes, called the \\"smoking gun,\\" proved that Nixon was involved in the scandal from the very beginning and that he had lied to the public and to Congress about it. With almost no support from the public, very few allies left in Congress, and facing near certain impeachment and removal from office, Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974. His successor, Gerald Ford, issued him a complete pardon of any crimes he may have committed in office.I thought The Great Coverup was an excellent look at the Watergate Scandal and the people and events surrounding it. While I gave a short description of it here, the entirety of the events was quite complex and far-reaching, such as how the White House \\"Plumbers\\" and the early break-in of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office played into it. I would recommend this book to those interested in the Watergate Scandal and Richard Nixon."},{"Title":"The Great Coverup: Nixon and the Scandal of Watergate","review":"Sussman was the city editor on the Washington Post when the Watergate burglars were apprehended.

It comes highly recommended for music lovers of that genre."},{"Title":"The Valiant Sailors (The Phillip Hazard Novels) (Vol 1)","review":"This is the first book in the &quot;Hazard&quot; series by V.A. Stuart. It takes place during the Crimean War between Russia and the allied nations of Britain, Turkey, and France. Phillip Hazard is the 1st Lieutenant on the steam frigate _Trojan_, serving under an incompetent captain who has been on half pay too long, but who is called to active duty because of the war. A mysterious passenger is taken on board for the voyage, who happens to be young and beautiful. There is a mild love story along with the action in the Black Sea and the battle of Sevastapol. Much of the story deals with the Hazard's frustrations in dealing with his captain.Although this narrative does not have the power or elegance of Patrick O'Brian or even C.S. Forester, it is an interesting period and the story holds one's interest. It is also well written. The quality of the McBooks Press edition is very good, with beautiful paper and typeset."},{"Title":"The Valiant Sailors (The Phillip Hazard Novels) (Vol 1)","review":"V.A.Stuart has written two good series that I'm familiar with, Hazard and Sheridan. This, the introduction to Phillip Horatio Hazard of the Royal Navy, is comparable to the other greats of the genre. Stuart created a believable character, heroic but human. This book brings the Crimean War to life in a way unfamiliar to many who may only know of it as a land campaign. As a compliment to Stuart, I can say that this made me search out the others in used bookstores. I don't know if the eight I have consist the entire series. It would be great to see these be reprinted, they are great works of fiction."},{"Title":"The Valiant Sailors (The Phillip Hazard Novels) (Vol 1)","review":"While the action scenes weren't bad, there was a lot of wasted dialog on the way.

It is a fairly straightforward story, well told in a traditional way. It is not as involving as the Aubrey/Maturin stories, nor the Hornblower series. However, one definite virtue it does possess is that it is not another in the endless series of Napoleonic sailing stories. Being set during the 1850's, during the transition from sail to steam makes it a bit different, and of special interest to those of us who like a bit of history in our historical novels. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Valiant Sailors (The Phillip Hazard Novels) (Vol 1)","review":"VA Stuart knows the Crimean war and has researched it well. Her hero is believable and likeable. The love interest is a bit soapy, but the action is fine, developing a drama and a tension that makes this type of fiction (military novel). The sole fault I would have with the writing itself, which is crisp and not cliched, is with the broad scope action. VA's hero is a Lieutenant with only limited access to the action and course of the war -- VA fills in the gaps for any history-in-the-making that her Phillip Hazard cannot directly see with narration that feels like history book stuff, and can go a little dry.A good fun read, but nothing to put on your resume."},{"Title":"From Pentecost to the present: A short history of Christianity (The Bible study textbook series)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book by James North. He does an excellent job of capturing the purposes of the early church and the progression of Christian doctrine through the centuries.

If you would like a greater understanding of what brought the church to where she is today, I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Allegro: A Novel","review":"This book Allegro: a novel, I think it could've been muchmuch better if there hadn't been so many unecessary sexual scenes, and so much use of profanity.

Machlis should stick to co-writing textbooks, not novels."},{"Title":"Song of the Saurials (The Finders Stone Trilogy, Book Three)","review":"In \\"Azure Bonds\\", we met Alias the sell sword, and her \\"soul brother\\" Dragonbait. It also introduced the Nameless Bard and the only known halfling bard, the irrepressible Olive Ruskettle. In \\"The Wyvern's Spur\\", Olive helps us to learn Nameless is not nameless after all. So, what adventures call for our intrepid heroes? Only the return of the Darkbringer himself: Moander.Akabar bel Akesh, a mage of no small water, returns from his Turmish homeland to aid Alias and Dragonbait. To make matters worse, Moander has improved his minions since last he set foot on Faern. The Mouth of Moander, and its people, enslaved by the dark deity, once again seeks to control Alias, and bend her to its will.In this, the third and final book in the Finder's Stone trilogy, we are given a deeper understanding of Nameless, and of those who love him, despite their better judgment. Will the Harpers rescind the ban on Nameless from the Realms, will they return to him his name, and will Moander succeed in controlling Alias?

This is something that all to often eludes me with Fantasy trilogies. Here we have great characters, a great plot line and great pacing. With the 3rd book we find that Finder, unlike the impression that we are given at the end of the first book, is not really repentant for what he has done, and sees Alias as his greatest creation even though he calls her his &quot;daughter&quot;. It takes a small halfling and some friends to show him the destruction his vanity almost causes again. And while I am glad to see that our favorite characters from the first book are back, I am also glad to see that the focus of this book is on the redemption of Finder and the troubles he goes through to get to that point. I was also pleased to see that Dragonbait was more fully developed and the great character that he turned out to be. Too often in the fantasy genre we see Paladins as strict, unbending followers of the codes of their God's, often to detriment of everyone around them in their arrogance. Here we are given a being totally devout in his faith and yet went through some amazing trials to have that faith tempered by wisdom, and yet still has a sense of humor and common sense. I think here we see what Paladins were meant to be, and not the easy literary fundamentalists they have become. Kudos all the way around. A very easy recommendation to anyone looking for a good book."},{"Title":"Song of the Saurials (The Finders Stone Trilogy, Book Three)","review":"Song of the Saurials was in a word fantastic!

Author Stephen Darlow has meticulously interviewed eight different air crews (five RAF and three USAAF). As one might expect, their stories vary widely because each played a different role and experienced different events. Their recollections are vivid and often dramatic. Darlow supplements these accounts with recollections supplied by other crews as well as ground personnel and even French civilians. This is the first time on such a wide scale so many veterans have been interviewed for this subject, and the author presents the story smoothly and with style. Also included is a solid recounting of the tactics and strategy utilized by the Allies before, during, and after the invasion. Includes previously unpublished photographs, index.

Porter Trotty Veck has no hope for the future on New Year's Eve until he hears the spirits of the chimes.The Cricket on the Hearth (1845). John is much older than his wife Dot, but their marriage appears to be over when he finds evidence that makes him believe she cuckold him.

Doctor Jeddler is a cynic, but his daughters' sacrifices for loved ones make him reconsider his scorn.The Haunted Man and the Ghost (1848). Chemistry Professor Redlaw is tormented by his past until a ghostly twin arrives on Christmas Eve to make him forget his past; afterward any one who meets the professor also forgets their distress as he does with the Swidger and Tetterby families until Milly Swidger reverses the spell because of her goodness that comes out of a lost childThe reprint of Charles Dickens early Victorian Christmas stories will prove a delight for fans of the most famous entry, A Christmas Carol. The Cricket on the Hearth and The Haunted Man and the Ghost are somewhat similar in lessons learned to that of A Christmas Carol though with their own inspiring twists while The Chimes uses a spiritual adviser but spins quite differently. However, the most diverse is The Battle of Life, which has a rushed ending and no paranormal guru as it feels more like O'Henry's The Gift of the Magi.

Witty and scholarly, SMOM is a landmark work of Biblical criticism. Ingersoll disassembles the Pentatuch, pointing out the absurdities and barbarities contained within. While he does give the occasional bit of humor, he is serious in his conviction that the Bible is not the &quot;good book&quot; that it's often made out to be. This one is a must."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"The author makes dismantling the Pentateuch look easy. I have yet to hear or read a theologian debater or writer who is the equal of Ingersoll, or able to present any persuasive rebuttal in response to his arguments. Rather, generally, Ingersoll's detractors have either: urged the faithful to ignore his arguments; and/or heaped personal attacks upon him. Ironically, this is the same methodology that hate groups such as the KKK, the Neo-Nazi's, and others of their ilk, use in response to those who urge different views. The rationale of such strategy is that the end justifies the means. However, such conduct tacitly ackowledges that the defenders of the faith have conceded they cannot directly confront Ingersoll's arguments and ideas on the merits.Ingersoll's chapters on Noah's Ark and the flood to end all floods (pages138-168), the plagues God had Moses inflict upon Egypt (pages 190-209), the tower of Babel (pages 169-175), and the Jews flight from Pharaoh, including their forty years of wandering in the Sinai Desert (pages 210-240), render these stories fanciful and unworthy of literal belief, much less divine inspiration. This book is a must read for any thinking Christian or Jew. The author demonstrates logic, common sense,and humor. Ingersoll disects the contradictions and impossibilities of these, and other, Old Testament scriptures.I am now reading &quot;American Infidel: Robert G. Ingersoll&quot;, a biography by Orvin Larson. I recommend it as a good read too."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Robert Ingersoll has to be the most important nineteenth century figure who is now totally unknown. Ingersoll was known as the &quot;Great Agnostic&quot; and devoted his life to challenging people to rethink their preconceived notions about religion and the Bible. This book is his analysis of Genesis and over a century later it still forces you to open your mind and reconsider. Some of his arguments have been made a number of times in the intervening period but never with more punch or flare. A real eye opener!"},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Ingersoll himself stated that it was not his goal to shatter Christianity, but to shatter the complacency of blindly following fundamentalist doctrine. He was encouraging genuine reflective equilibrium on the part of the religious. At first, this may seem like a road that leads directly to atheism, but I am here to testify that this is not true.I'm glad that our Jewish friend resolved to sustain his quest and that Alexandre was strengthened in his freedom from stagnant thinking. But this is not the end. This is not all there is to say about what the mono-theistic tradition can contribute to humanity. It is not the perfect remedy for the &quot;holly bible&quot; as a whole but the perfect remedy for the fear of questioning it, which leads to seeing it clearly for what it actually is and understanding its true value.After the hilarious and witty Ingersoll, who will get you thinking, I recommend moving on to the excellent scholorship of Karen Armstrong, who will give you not only evidence to support Ingersoll's claims but a new way of understanding the tradition in question. Ready to accept the world with a God-shaped hole in it, I was floored to realize that such a perspective wasn't a clear way of understanding the situation at all. I can tell you with confidence that if Ingersoll peaked your interest that at least A History of God is worth a read (if not all of her other books as well, which I haven't read but am anxiously planning to). Another interesting argument (similar to Ingersoll's) about the nature of complacent awe of the Bible can be found in the first chapter of Who Wrote the New Testament? by Burton Mack.Another fascinating perspective is that of the scientifically-focused Gerald Schroeder. All of his books are worth a read, but The Hidden Face of God is his most lucid account."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"I was referred to this book by &quot;Losing Faith In Faith&quot;, another excellent read. Robert Ingersoll's easy to understand writing for the common person, including those not well versed in the bible, makes this book impossible to pass up. Every point and criticism of religion he made of his time still applies today. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"This book is joy to read, even if but for the literary style of Mr. Ingersoll. Though not a trained philosopher, Ingersoll points out much of the errancy and contradiction in the first books of the Bible.Better yet, he does it with a style and flair that is only comparable to Mark Twain! Most theists (especially Christians) will certainly STILL object to this book. Of course, Mr. Ingersoll used to get death threats in his day so I suspect the criticism by and large, is nothing new.Regardless, if you're a non-theist or have an open mind and appreciation for a well crafted and written book, this one is for you!"},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Wow. I thought that I knew the first 5 books of the bible fairly well, and had found most of the logical flaws that existed... but wow! Ingersoll has an incredible intellect and is quite witty as well. He goes through the first 5 books of the bible and just rips them apart. I don't see how any objective/rational person could read this and continue to believe any of it. Brilliance!"},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Mr. Ingersoll brings a number of points to the fore regarding the Pentateuch, and with a sharp eye for detail and a sharper wit, lays waste to the ridiculous claim of \`divine inspiration'. He points out absurdities, inaccuracies, and downright laugh-out-loud foolishnesses that are contained in the books attributed to Moses. The standard term for books attributed to a particular author (religious) is pseudepigrapha (which means A. Spurious writings, especially writings falsely attributed to biblical characters or times or B. body of texts written between 200 B.C. and A.D. 200 and spuriously ascribed to various prophets and kings of Hebrew Scriptures). The more laughable of these are: how did Noah collect all the animals from all corners of the earth? How did he feed them for nearly a year? Why are there two different sets of counting? Some of the more hysterical idiocies: the ten plagues; first, the Lord destroys ALL the livestock, THEN inflicts them with boils, and THEN slays the 1st born of the livestock along w/the firstborn of the population (we know now that the ten plagues are actually symptoms of volcanic eruption). Somehow, after each plague, the LORD hardens Pharaoh's heart (each time)? And THEN, the Israelites wander thru the desert for 40 years, and somehow, their garments never wear out, or their shoes (love to shop where they did). Ingersoll is especially funny here, vis-&agrave;-vis how many angels were required to maintain the decay of said molecular structures. He points out that the Chinese astronomers knew of Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn 2,449 years before Christ, and 1,000 years before Moses, and they had no direct line to heaven. Fancy that! The mathematics was obscene: there were only 70 Jews when they entered Egypt, and 215 years later (or 430, depending on what version you read: Josephus, supported by biblical scholars, says 215, but Galatians claims 430, Exodus 12:40 says 430, etc.) and upon Exodus, were 3 million. Never mind that the Egyptian have no record of this. Or the Lord sending hornets to plague the Canaanites.I could go on and on, but the book explains these absolute absurdities, obviously interpolations from some very imaginative scribes making it up as they go along, far better than I ever could. So if you are looking for a book that reinforces your faith, this is DEFINITELY not it. But if you want a sensible analysis of an absurd set of books, this is a must read. Allow me to end this w/a quote from Mr. Ingersoll: \\"If the Pentateuch is inspired, the civilization of our day is a mistake and a crime.\\""},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"It's really interesting to think about how Ingersoll would view modern politics. On the one hand he was rabidly opposed to Biblical literalism, also known as the cement shoes around the feet of the American electorate. But his opposition to the Bible wasn't due to any of the forces that get today's Bible-thumpers foaming at the mouth. He wasn't (as far as I know) a communist, hippie, satan-worshipper, or even an atheist. He was actually a family-values kind of guy, and his problems with the Bible stemmed from his hatred of slavery, murder, rape, genocide, and polygamy. Hard to argue with that, and even harder to argue that the god of the Pentateuch doesn't clearly endorse all of the above. In Some Mistakes of Moses Ingersoll reproduces the relevant Bible passages, interspersed with his own commentary, which alternates between funny and furious.I suppose if Ingersoll were around today, his writing would be more like that of his intellectual heir Sam Harris. I recently read this funny quote from Harris's new book: \\"The President of the United States has claimed, on more than one occasion, to be in dialogue with God. Now, if he said that he was talking to God through his hairdryer, this would precipitate a national emergency. I fail to see how the addition of a hairdryer makes the claim more ludicrous or more offensive.\\" Ha!"},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Robert Ingersoll wrote for the common person, using common language and common sense. In fact, he appeals to the same simplicity that people invoke when declaring that there must be a God vis-&agrave;-vis the \\"design of creation.\\" As one reads this book, it is easy to feel guilt for attributing the words of the Bible to the Creator of the Universe. And by the end of the book, one is left with the choice of (a) using common sense and common decency to absolve the Almighty from the barbarism that is contained in the Bible; or (b) continue to practice intellectual acrobatics in order to hold the Almighty responsible for every barbaric word of the Bible. Indeed, Ingersoll ensures that inerrantists are properly chastised for their continued insistence of an \\"inspired book.\\" Such a position is unjustified and insulting to the Almighty. Perhaps it is too idealistic to expect inerrantists to recognize Ingersoll's simple arguments in defense of the Almighty and for that they will perhaps one day be held accountable for insisting that God did and said all of the awful acts found in the Bible."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Beautifully written, sharp as a blade.

The book is a survey of the many inconsistencies, inaccuracies, errors, and outright absurdities contain in the Pentateuch (the Torah) - the first five books (of Moses) in the Bible.The author dissects and largely discredits the Genesis account of Creation, the Garden of Eden, and Noah's Arc; and he does so with humor and wit which made him a highly regarded public speaker in his time. Perhaps as a result of his work, Christian churches and seminaries had to restate their understandings of the Pentateuch in terms of allegories and myths, and thus stepping away from the hardline literalist traditions so popular among the less astute masses of his time.To be fair to both author and Christian alike, it should be noted that the author's issue is with the background mythology of the Old Testament, and by implication the God of Abraham, while casting no aspersions on the life or teachings of Jesus. In the course of his presentation, it becomes apparent (at least to me) that the author regards the five books fo Moses to be a slander upon the almighty, and an insult to the intelligence of man."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Robert Ingersoll's lecture, \\"Some Mistakes of Moses,\\" is as relevant today as it was in the late 19th century. The language is a bit flowery, in conformity with the period, but the thinking is clear and convincing. Ingersoll spent decades travelling the U.S. speaking to sold out houses ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands on subjects including Shakespeare, Robert Burns and, most famously, religion. His assaults on the church and the Bible, salted with good humor and eloquence, drew the fire of local clergy wherever he went. Yet, even in a time when freethinkers were held in even more contempt than they are today, the famous orator drew standing room only crowds everywhere he went.Oratory was a popular form of entertainment in the days before movies, television and radio, and Ingersoll almost certainly spoke to more people in person than anyone else in history. This was perhaps his most famous lecture, running over 2 hours in length. While one can only imagine how much more powerful it was to hear it spoken by this master of oratory, it is, nonetheless, a very good read, and extremely challenging to anyone who puts much stock in the Bible."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Reading Robert Ingersoll always leaves one amazed that he is not known as one of the greatest writers of his century. Criminally underrated for his views, his works, partially inspired by Voltaire's and Thomas Paine's literary attacks on the Church, are written more for the man-in-the-street, but behind his style hides a vast intellect and love for mankind. It's a tragedy that he was hated, and still is, by so many, the atheist infidel who dared cast doubts on, even mock, the unmockable. But there's no doubt that in centuries to come, when the world has evolved enough both spiritually and intellectually to accept Ingersoll's many truths, and his work is reappraised, his name will be held higher than many of the so-called greats we revere today.Despised as an atheist, I'll leave it to Robert to clarify just what he condemns in this book, and why:'And here let me say, once for all, that when I speak of God I mean the being described by Moses: the Jehovah of the Jews. There may be, for aught I know, somewhere in the unknown shoreless vast, some being whose dreams are constellations, and within whose thought the infinite exists. About this being, if such a one exists, I have nothing to say. He has written no books, inspired no barbarians, required no worship, and has prepared no hell in which to burn the honest seeker after truth.When I speak of God, I mean that God who prevented man from putting forth his hand and taking also of the fruit of the tree of life that he might live forever; of that God who multiplied the agonies of woman, increased the weary toil of man, and in his anger drowned a world; of that God whose altars reeked with human blood, who butchered babes, violated maidens, enslaved men, and filled the earth with cruelty and crime; of that God who made heaven for the few, hell for the many, and who will gloat for ever and ever upon the writhings of the lost and damned.'He certainly doesn't mince his words, but what intelligent person could possibly disagree with a word he says?Don't think he's always deadly serious though. The subject matter at hand certainly offers a potentially rich source of humor, and Ingersoll makes full use of it, for example:'Of course, God knew, when he made man, that he would afterwards regret it. He knew that the people would grow worse and worse until destruction would be the only remedy. He knew that he would have to kill all except Noah and his family, and it is hard to see why he did not make Noah and his family, in the first place, and leave Adam and Eve in the dust.'And towards the end he comes up with this gem:'If you find the institution of slavery upheld in a book said to have been written by God, what would you expect to find in a book inspired by the Devil?''Some Mistakes of Moses' is his longest work, but most of his other lectures and essays are worth reading too, and are as captivating today as when they were first written."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"This book is a sharp-witted, poignant and outright hilarious critique of the Old Testament. Light years ahead of his time, Ingersoll asks his readers to take the Old Testament with a large dose of salt, rather than consider it to be of divine inspiration. 'Some mistakes of Moses' is very well-written and thought provoking. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Ingersoll wrote this work in the late 19th century - his views were probably criticized at that time but are pretty close to right on in the 21st century - he takes a tongue-in-cheek look at the Book of Genesis and shows how whoever wrote it was not in touch with reality - this book should be mandatory reading for Christian fundamentalists who stand on their soap box and talk about how inerrant is the bible"},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Although none of the arguments in this book were especially profound, they were highly entertaining. It's amazing to think that such a droll and tenacious speaker was so widely regarded over a hundred years ago, yet today anyone espousing such candid opinions on the veracity of the bible would scarcely be registered by the media. Were he alive today, the poor fellow would be disheartened to see so many exhortions to prayer by the media and government; but this only underscores why this book and others like it are so relevant today.All in all, light, funny and thought provoking; a joy to read."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Some Mistakes of Moses / 978-1-58509-060-0It is difficult to remember that Robert Ingersoll wrote this eloquent argument over a hundred years ago; his impassioned arguments seem so relevant today that it's hard to believe how little has changed since then. Within his logical and cold commentary of the contradictions and problems within the Pentateuch, Ingersoll also sets forth the arguments that:* the clergy is held perpetually hostage to the traditions and beliefs of the past, for it is always safer to quote a dead predecessor than to express a new - and potentially unwelcome and unorthodox - opinion for oneself.* the politicians should be allowed to privately believe what they will, and should not be forced - as an informal religious test - to pander to every religion at once, in a contradictory political dance that reveals only a dearth of real sincerity.* the teachers may feel pressured not to divulge facts and realities that might contradict \\"Genesis geology\\", and may feel pressured to hype up possibilities - regardless of likelihood - that miracles and science may co-exist harmoniously.When, awhile back, I read \\"Why I Am Not a Christian and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects\\" by Bertrand Russell, I was struck by the eloquence and clarity of thought, such as when Russell pointed out reasonably that one's religion can often be just as much a function of where one is born as well as one's personal choices. I was surprised to see that Ingersoll's excellent book makes many of the same points, with his own style.

This book's critique of the Bible is amazingly sound considering it is 130 years old. His point of view is however as a Christian judging topics in the holy books of Moses, not as a Jew. This may sound like a silly point, but if you read any Talimud writings, stories and parables are a very Jewish way to get a point across! Hence, when discussing God, you must speak of the limits of knowledge and human existance, etc...Anyway, I wish he attended the Reform movement synagogue once in a while in his day...He would have found out the Jews consider sex a blessing, something you SHOULD do on the Sabbath, not be threatened with Hell and mope aound wishing you were outside... I suspect if his book was about the New Testament some resentful Christian would have lynched him! Good thing the Jews have a sense of humor ;)...Nuff said...This book should be read by anyone who is considers himself Christian or Jewish. And yes I am still converting too! Books like these is a breath of fresh air and puts our religous quests on firmer grounds."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Don't get me wrong, the book is extremely well written, it was a joy to read, and it even had a few arguments that I hadn't heard.However, Ingersoll makes some mistakes that I don't believe are accurate. First, he places far too much stress on the importance of a literal belief. This was probably the case when Christians were running the universities in our country, but it is not any longer. More and more liberal takes on the Bible are becoming common, and the importance of believing in contradictory accounts is less worth arguing now than it used to be.Another place that I believe he goes wrong is the assumption that the proportion of soldiers in the Exodus Judiac population is equal to the proportion of ours. A more accurate case may be made to the number of American men who were soldiers in the Civil War. That, like the exodus, was about survival.All told, his writing is a joy to read. He points out things that most people don't normally think about, and he makes a (to me at least) novel criticism of the dimensions of the ark and its ridiculous ventilation system. However, this is more of the type of book that I would rent from a library. It is fun to own and let friends read, but you will probably only read it once. It is a light read, though, and a fun criticism.A reader, but a renter.Harkius"},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"While this is one of the best and most enlightened books on the topic that I've ever read, this Kindle edition is full of mistakes.

Masquerading as scholarship, Ingersoll's disappointing book is riddled with logical fallacies and on nearly every single page makes bold and controversial statements that rely on his powerful wit rather than fact-based proofs. Moreover, Ingersoll himself makes many incredibly amateur blunders in regard to Hebrew culture and history so as to reveal his massive lack of knowledge on this whole matter. No matter if you think the Bible to be the most evil book ever, Ingersoll's work has no place in any rational person's library except perhaps as a perfect example of how to pass off bumbling tripe as timeless scholarship. The fact that so many praise this book leads me to wonder if they truly were looking for well-reasoned arguments or merely had itching ears to hear someone preach to the unbelieving choir... (2 Timothy 4:3).I openly disclose that I'm a born-again Christian who calls Christ his Saviour and believes the Bible is God's Word. But please don't discount what I've said because of this but please investigate for yourself! I completely believe everyone should examine and test every belief they hold and listen to all sides of every debate! So read his book and honestly decide if you think Ingersoll provides evidence-based research. If not, I humbly suggest you consider reasoning with God and finding peace through Him (Isaiah 1:18).I openly welcome anyone who wishes to defend this work, although I fear your task will be as impossible as it would be to convince Ingersoll of the truth of the Bible...++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Detailed Review With Quotes and Analysis:++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The first four chapters are a scathing commentary on Christianity as he sees it. In truth, he makes many good points about the hypocrisy and close-mindedness of many ministers of his day and also today. Being a Christian, I found myself agreeing with him over and over about the terrible fascism of so many religious people. However, if he is to be honest, one can find hypocrites and tyrants even among the non-religious. So it is exceedingly important to separate the actual teachings of a religion from the bad behavior of certain peoples claiming that religion.Logically, a religion can be quite true and noble even if many people do evils \\"in the name\\" of that religion. This is something Ingersoll doesn't mention, to his discredit. Moreover and most importantly, these first four opening chapters contain no actual evidence or arguments. I was surprised by this because I was hoping to get right into some serious Biblical analysis and scholarship. In fact, the first four chapters are simply rants against religion that do much to excite the anger of the already convinced and as such do a disservice to calm, rational examination of the scriptures. His animosity toward religion almost dripped from the pages.Chapter five begins by asserting that only ignorant people believe Moses wrote the Pentateuch. Sadly, he never actually delves into any scholarly research or proofs to back up this bold statement. I find it ironic that he attacks religious people so much for their insistence on blind faith, yet he fails to back up his claims. I suppose he simply assumes any rational person would agree that Moses couldn't have written the Pentateuch. He does manage to throw in one veiled attempt at supporting his argument by asking how Moses could have written his own \\"eulogy.\\" There's two views on that. One says that those final five verses weren't written by Moses. Still, if Moses wrote roughly 5,848 of the 5,853 verses in the Pentateuch, it seems quite reasonable to say he wrote it all, in general. The second view, says God gave Moses insight into the future to write those five verses. That view obviously requires belief in the supernatural. The point is Ingersoll doesn't bother mentioning any scholarly discussion on the issue, and therefore does a disservice to all people who prefer evidence based reasoning.You will note he also says, \\"As a matter of fact, it seems to be well settled that Moses had nothing to do with these books...\\" Here is another fallacious reasoning. He says we know Moses didn't write the books because it's a well established fact. Mr. Ingersoll, is that truly the best you can do? Why write a book on a matter if the whole thing is already set in stone?He likewise on page 47 claims \\"they\\" (Christians) haven't \\"informed us as to whom we should hold responsible for the evils we endure.\\" That's a very bizarre criticism to level against Christians since the Bible does quite frequently point out that both the devil and our own selves cause evil. Also, please note, this criticism of his isn't related to the mistakes of Moses. Ingersoll loves to throw in these random jabs at Christianity. I find it fairly immature and unscholarly to make off-topic jabs. At least if you are to go off-topic, read the Bible so you don't ask questions clearly answered by the Bible.On the same page he claims God fails \\"to promise heaven, and to threaten hell\\" in the Pentateuch. It is true that there are no direct references to what happens when someone dies. However, there is clear teaching that there is a heaven where God dwells and a placed called hell. I find it strange that Ingersoll uses this as a critique because he later strongly condemns the Bible's usage of heaven and hell. It seems the Bible can't win in Ingersoll's mind. If the Bible had explicitly taught these things in the Pentateuch, Ingersoll still would have found fault. One sign of a nit-pick argument is when if that thing were resolved, the position of the criticizer would remain unchanged. This is Ingersoll's case.Page 48 he claims the Bible's stories are \\"changed by numberless narrators as intelligence increases...\\" Again, is he going to actually provide evidence for this? No. He simply states this as fact. Regardless of your opinion on the Bible, hopefully you too can see how poor scholarship this is on his part. Ingersoll constantly relies on the fallacy of presumption, which means he already assumes his point is true. I want to know how he knows the intelligence of the Hebrews increased. What is his basis? His imagination? Yes.He continues with his presumption by saying religious systems are created by superstitious people. Again, no factual evidence is provided. He apparently thinks his bold assertions need no defense. And he is right that people who *already* agree with him won't mind. But is his goal to merely \\"preach to the atheistic choir?\\" Again, he exhibits horrendous scholarship.On page 50 he commits a horrendous logical fallacy by saying, \\"Now, if the account of the origin of this earth as given by Moses is substantially like that given by the Egyptians then we must conclude that he learned it from them [since he was a prince in Pharaoh's court].\\" This is a massive logical fallacy! He has fallen victim to believing correlation must mean causation! I admit I got really mad when I read this because I couldn't believe Ingersoll would reach such a ridiculously illogical conclusion as this! Dear reader, I so hope you can also see what folly this is! If I hold a similar view to another view I previously knew about, this does not necessarily mean my current view is derived from the old view! Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. To put it in modern terms Ingersoll did a \\"Epic Logic Fail.\\"Ingersoll goes on to explain on page 50 and 51 about the Egyptian views of creation. However, he doesn't bother to provide a single footnote or reference of any kind! Google \\"Egyptian creation\\" and you will find that there is no agreement on the Egyptian view of creation! There are quite a few myths with some similarities (from Wikipedia). So again, page after page he makes these controversial claims with zero evidence provided. I don't care what side of this debate you are on--we should all agree that this is very poor rhetoric.Page 55 and onward: To give a crystal clear example of Ingersoll's ignorance of basic Hebrew culture, he starts the creation on Monday and ends with God resting on Sunday. This is INCORRECT. The week begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday! The Jewish Sabbath is on Saturday, not Sunday! Now, this doesn't change the merits of his arguments, but it is important to realize that Ingersoll is clearly very unfamiliar with Jewish culture. So how he thinks he can write a book about Jewish history and Moses, is beyond me. He is simply unqualified. He still has every right in a free country to write as he sees fit, but we also have a duty to call out shoddy scholarship when we see it.On page 56 he says he cannot conceive of something being created from nothing. Well, he has this problem regardless of the Bible. All people seem to agree the universe had a starting point. Even the big bang has to be a something from nothing if there was a starting point...the problem is no explosion can happen without something already existing. So the big bang and other purely secular theories of origin also have this quite difficult hurdle of something from nothing. He is right that it would take something outside our physical powers to create something from nothing...hmm, God surely could do that.And on page 57 he says that in eternity past God \\"did not think.\\" Oh man...and what evidence does he have of this I wonder? It's just more conjecture from him. He completely fails to understand that God is able to think quite independently of his creation, at least that's what the Bible tells us! You may think my source, the Bible, is wrong, but at least I have a source! Ingersoll's only source is his own wild imaginings...Page 60: \\"Force cannot, as it appears to me, exist apart from matter.\\" And what scientific training do you have again? At least you admit it's just your opinion. As it appears to me, simply saying you cannot understand or comprehend something does NOT make it false. Yet Ingersoll's entire book consists of these types of statements. He can't understand, can't comprehend, can't believe, can't justify, ect. Alright, but I'd like to have more than just your opinions, please.Page 93: \\"a God who made mistakes.\\" So you say. Care to give specifics? Hmm, I thought not...Page 94: \\"It is impossible to think of a personal God as a spirit without form.\\" Oh really? Again, do you have evidence for this? I'm thinking of a personal God right now who is spirit...I'm not going to comment on the remaining 200 pages because it's just more of the same: bold claims presented with zero evidence or references. Ingersoll begs the question, presumes he's right, confuses correlation with causation, and commits other intellectual crimes against reason.In his conclusion on page 264, he commits the tired mistake of thinking that the laws of Israel should apply to us today if the Bible is God's Word. It would be true that we should stone idolaters IF we lived in ancient Israel. But he is ignoring the fact that the Bible clearly teaches that we as Christians are not followers of the Old Testament law. This requires more space than I want to invest here, but the point is his argument is shallow and inspires sensationalism rather than honest inquiry.On page 265-270 he lists all the \\"mistakes of Moses.\\" But again, none of these has he refuted except by claiming they are all wrong. Again, he presumes everything he says is already true.To conclude: I was honestly very, very disappointed by this book. I always enjoy reading other views and hearing well reasoned critiques of the Bible. However, I was shocked to find out that this \\"famous\\" book was actually just one big long diatribe against Christianity with zero evidence or references to support all the venom spewed forth. This book has no place in any rational person's library except perhaps as a perfect example of how to pass off tripe as timeless scholarship. I openly welcome anyone who wishes to defend this work, although I fear your task will be as impossible as it would be to convince Ingersoll of the truth of the Bible..."},{"Title":"Some mistakes of Moses","review":"Ingersoll missed all the evidence that has been found that proves that the Bible is true.

He notes that Western society is desperately searching for meaning beyond the material, and views the church as being poised to fill this need with spiritual truths. In Prepare The Way, Stearns charges that no only is that change coming, it is already upon us. He encourages Christians to embrace this change and to understand what God is doing, and how to be alight in a spiritually darkened and needy world. Prepare The Way is demanding, motivating, penetrating reading that will reward and encourage the reader to help the Christian community prepare for, and meet, the challenges of our new era."},{"Title":"Prepare the Way: Twelve Spiritual Signposts for the New Millennium","review":"Robert Stearns has written a wonderful book about the ways in which today's church is changing, and the ways in which it still needs to change. He writes in a manner that makes it very difficult not to be excited about the times we are living in as Christians. It should give all believers much hope and joy. The &quot;What Now?&quot; section at the end of every chapter is a very nice touch. It lets the reader see how one might apply the reading to one's life, as an individual, or as part of a group. Having read the book, I feel the title, &quot;Prepare the Way&quot;, is not just a commandment, but more of a simple statement. The Lord WILL prepare the way, with or without us, but how much better is it to be a part of the master plan, rather than to just sit on the sidelines, comfortable in our own salvation, watching from a distance?"},{"Title":"Prepare the Way: Twelve Spiritual Signposts for the New Millennium","review":"If one is interested in understanding the times in which we live prophetically and biblically, this book is an excellent and comprehensive resource. Robert Stearns speaks from his over 20 years of experience growing in intimate knowledge of Israel, her people, and their role in the kingdom of God. He challenges us as Christians to look beyond the obvious role (of Jesus coming again to Jerusalem) and to see them as God sees them as His children still receiving the blessings of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."},{"Title":"Prepare the Way: Twelve Spiritual Signposts for the New Millennium","review":"God wants to prepare the way for the future for us.

That part is worth reading and interesting, as it throws light on another Atlantis book, \\"Atlantis from a Geographer's Perspective\\", which pinpoints Atlantis as Ireland based on a scientific study of geography.Which brings us to the weak point in this book: Where it tries to explain why this similarity exists. The explanation is so wild that it totally destroys the credibility of the book. If the author had only refrained from those speculations, and written a shorter book, it could have gotten 5 stars from me. But now it gets 3, the average of the bad and good parts."},{"Title":"Atlantis of the West: The Case For Britain's Drowned Megalithic Civilization","review":"This was an excellent book. The vendor sent it promptly to my address. I was a little surprised to find that the first eight chapters were heavy on geo physics. The author has to build his case of the 'drowned megolithic civilization'. A very convincing story."},{"Title":"Atlantis of the West: The Case For Britain's Drowned Megalithic Civilization","review":"This book presents good evidence for the physics behind cometary impacts and for the megalithic civilization of the British Isles predating the rise of ocean levels. Where it misses the mark is in jumping to the conclusion that the latter was Atlantis. The writer ignores his own evidence that points to an asteroid impact event that submerged a large island just where and when Plato indicated. He claims multiple impact events thousands of years later, while ignoring the fact that there is no physical evidence for them then. The dendrochronological evidence he cites occurred because of major volcanic eruptions. He wrote in the mid-1990s without benefit of Ryan and Pittman's scholarly work about the flooding of the Black Sea (which resulted from rising sea level, itself a result of the end of glaciation in North America 11,000 years ago) but which likewise also ignores the same effects elsewhere in the world.It is often the case that writers develop good evidence and then extrapolate conclusions that their evidence fails to support. This is one such case, as is that of Ryan and Pittman. There are numerous books each of which claims that Atlantis resided at their pet location: the British Isles, Spain, Denmark, Peru, the Caribbean, Mexico, etc. All of them ignore some part of Plato's description to champion their alternative choice and timeframe.This book is good for two things. It explores the physical aspects of impact events, although it fails to connect them to the real one that occurred about 11,000 years ago. Also, it does a good job of identifying the state of culture in the British Isles during the megalithic culture of 5,000 years ago and how the rising ocean level affected it. For those reasons it is well worth reading. Beyond that, his conclusions are flawed and should be discarded."},{"Title":"Cauchy and the Creation of Complex Function Theory","review":"This is a great book on the life and Complex Variable Analysis work of Augustine Cauchy.Smithies brings many of the quaint, yet pertinent pieces that comprise the rich field called Complex Variables together into a mathematical jigsaw. I for one was fascinated to see the link between the CR Equations and Green's Theorem.Using copious examples, directly from Cauchy's published as well as unpublished notes, Smithies enlightens the reader of the genius of Cauchy. To the reader versed in modern representation of Complex Variable theory, Smithies insistence on sticking to Cauchy's formulation of complex functions in real terms and then using his method of separation may seem laborious at first, but it rewards the reader by giving deep insight into Cauchy's thought processes.The book covers a wide field of Complex Variables from the formulation of Cauchy's Theorem, Cauchy's Integral Formula, the Residue Theorem and Integrals between imaginary limits.Remarkable though his work was, the book shows the almost insular nature of Cauchy - by sometimes never publishing his results and being either unaware or disdainful of other results, e.g. d':Alembert, Gauss, Euler, etc.A good book to read as an accompaniment to a standard text on Complex Variables (e.g. Ablowitz and Fokas). Rich in Mathematics and History and highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Cauchy and the Creation of Complex Function Theory","review":"In chapter 1 we look at what was done before Cauchy. Euler and Laplace and others saw that complex changes of variables was a useful technique for evaluating real integrals. This is rather mysterious and it was treated with some suspicion. Cauchy set out to justify and systematise such techniques in his 1814 memoir (chapter 2), and then he kept polishing his results over the next ten years (chapter 3). Then comes his watershed 1825 memoir (chapter 4). Cauchy has now realised that all of the above should be understood in the context of path integration in the complex plane. Here integration is largely determined by the poles, prompting a calculus of residues, which he develops over the next couple of years (chapter 5). Another area of classical analysis where the complex viewpoint proved essential was the convergence of series (chapter 6). Cauchy's starting point here was the Lagrange series, first employed fifty years earlier by Lagrange, e.g. in celestial mechanics, without regard for its dubious convergence properties.Let me add some details about Cauchy's crucial 1814 paper which marked the transition from naive to systematic complex function theory and was to be the germ of all his later work in complex analysis. Laplace called the use of complex substitutions to evaluate real integrals \\"un moyen f&eacute;cond de d&eacute;couvertes\\"---a fruitful method of discovery. But by way of justifying these methods he offered little but a vague appeal to \\"la g&eacute;n&eacute;ralit&eacute; d'analyse\\"---the generality of analysis. Although his results were all correct, Poisson still found it worthwhile to rederive them by other methods, since, as he said, Laplace's reasoning was \\"une sort d'induction fond&eacute;e sur le passage des quantit&eacute;s r&eacute;elles aux imaginaires\\"---a sort of induction based on the passage from real to imaginary quantities. In a reply,Laplace agreed that the use of complex variables constituted \\"une analogie singuli&egrave;re\\"---a singular analogy---which \\"laissent toujours &agrave; d&eacute;sirer des d&eacute;monstrations directes\\"---still left a desire for direct demonstrations---and he proceeded to offer some such demonstrations himself. As a result of this debate, Laplace assigned his young and ambitious prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Cauchy, the task of investigating the foundations of complex methods in integration.The day after his 25th birthday, Cauchy presented his \\"M&eacute;moire sur les int&eacute;grales d&eacute;finies,\\" aiming to \\"&eacute;tablir le passage du r&eacute;el &agrave; l'imaginaire sur une analyse directe et rigoureuse\\"---base the passage from the real to the imaginary on a direct and rigorous analysis. His basic tool for accomplishing this is \\"Cauchy's theorem.\\" However, the form in which this theorem appears in his paper is very different from its modern statement. First of all, Cauchy never uses any geometrical language whatsoever in this paper. In particular, he never speaks of integrating along a path in the complex plane. Furthermore, he almost exclusively splits every complex expression into its real and imaginary parts and works with real integrals for each separately. In part these preferences can be explained by his stated goal of making complex methods rigorous. However, they are also a reflection of a very marked trend in French mathematics at the time, which emphasised an analytic-algebraic approach in all mathematics with almost chauvinistic determination.Rather than having to do with path integration in the complex plane, Cauchy's \\"Cauchy's theorem\\" is the double integral of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. This is the fundamental idea of Cauchy's paper. This idea enables Cauchy to systematically derive all previous results established by complex methods, as well as many new results, in a way essentially equivalent to the modern textbook approach. And, crucially, he is able to do so with only minimal reference to complex numbers. He only really needs complex numbers to derive the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which is of course a simple matter of elementary algebra that no one can doubt the validity of. From there on everything is real. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are of course expressed in terms of the real and imaginary parts, and their double integrals are, in effect, the real an imaginary parts of Cauchy's theorem. This is the way in which Cauchy is able to defuse the issues of rigour that comes with liberal uses of complex numbers in integration."},{"Title":"Flat-top,: The story of an escort carrier,","review":"This isn't a book before 1923???

Simply because they do not understand the power of the mind and how it relates to the traditional living. So, if you are looking for a book to teach you about the Tao philosophy then this is not the one for you, as the title states.However, if you are looking for a book that teaches you some of the basic beliefs in regards to the Tao philosophy for living. Then this is a great book and one you will like to have on hand.It takes the Tao philosophy beyond just belief into actual practice. Practitioners in folk traditions will note the similarities that exist between them and other traditional cultures around the world. This is what this book deals with.Because most people in the West have not grown to the level of understanding the practice of Ancestor honoring and the relationship that exists beteen God and themselves. They will not understand this book for another 20 or more years. This is because the West are very logical (left-brained) when it comes to dealing with spiritual living. After all, just recently the age of looking for God ended, when traditionalists all over the world have been saying all along, God is within and without...God is everywhere. So this book speaks from a very imaginative perspective. Most who don't understand it are usually trying to figure things out and how it relates logically instead of allowing the mind (spirit) to solve the problems.This is a great book, if you want to put the Tao philosophy into practice. It is suggested however, that you study or have learned the basics of the Tao philosophy or some other occult philosophy such as the Kabbalah. As it is not necessary but it will help you to understand and see why folk believers do what they do. When you realize what the Heavens and Earth are all about, you will start to understand truly what all traditional cultures have been talking about. This will even clarify common misconceptions about traditional African and Native American religions as well. It is that simple.Hope thisPeace"},{"Title":"Chinese Taoist Sorcery : The Art of Getting Even","review":"This book is shameful! This is not Taoism.

The place was called VETVILLE, housing for the married students. In the summer of 1947, 150 babies were born on campus. The book is a heartwarming rendition of the trials, tribulations & celebrations endured by the families, who lived a meager existence in the name of furthering their education. Everyone wanted a better life for their families and made numerous sacrifices with the help of one another. The little \\"town\\" progressed to the point of having it's own mayor and a newspaper called the Vetville Gazette. Ms. Morrow-Black was an amazing entrepeneur, who mostly got by sheerly on her own \\"moxie.\\" She entered numerous contests to win prize money to help supplement the family income. You will laugh and cry as she relates her hilarious escapades...as her husband looks on in helpless admiration!My impetus for reading this book was that I, personally, was one of the children born on campus during the summer of 1947. Much to my astonishment, as I read, I found that the Black Family had lived in Unit 35A. I had also lived in Unit 35A...as my family was the one who occupied the unit previous to the Black's. There were pictures in the book of the Black children being babysat for by members of the Notre Dame football team! So, it was a walk down memory lane to see photos of my old living room & kitchen that I knew as a child!

Vet-Villes were set up across the country to house the returning soldiers and their new families. Here we find our heroine optimistically enscounsed in South Bend, Indiana where her husband is completing his degree at Notre Dame.Every wife who ever struggled with family, finances, and moral support to help her husband get his college degree will find herself in these pages. The focus of the book is not so much her husband getting his PhD at Notre Dame, but about her earning her PhT (Putting Him Through), and the inventive and sometimes crazy things she does to earn it. This humourous and hectic book reads like an I Love Lucy comedy series. Her schemes to make ends meet are inventive and fearless.You'll find yourself chuckling out loud as visions of popcorn cakes and chairs stuck in doorways as she rents their bedroom out to weekend football fans pop off the pages.It is both nostaligic and humourous and will leave you smiling to yourself.

For example, very little mathematics is used (even though there are topics in the book which would have been better served by a more mathematical treatment), while on the other hand many terms are used as though the reader should be familiar with them already.I found the lack of a glossary frustrating, as was Mr. Smith's habit of using concepts chapters ahead of their defintion. The difficult subject matter was further obscured by numerous errors in the figures and text (such as refering to velocity as the second integral of acceleration.)In the end, the book did give me a good qualitative feel for the issues germane to geodesy, but I had to work very hard to extract that information and found myself immediately looking for a more perspicuous text."},{"Title":"Introduction to Geodesy: The History and Concepts of Modern Geodesy (Wiley Series in Surveying and Boundary Control)","review":"I bought this book to fill in knowledge gaps, not to learn geodesy as an expert.

Not bad at all.This subject by its nature requires a mathematical treatment, so although the book does not go deeply into the math, it's sometimes heavy reading.

He has a writing style that tends to skip around alot. Just hang in there and you will get the information in another chapter.

Reeves certainly deconstructs Tutankhamun in a way that very few books do; the context of the Eighteenth Dynasty and the problems that Tutankhamun inherited from his predecessor - the heretic king Akhenaten, his life and key people in his life, the tomb itself (with each chamber thoroughly examined and detailed), the mummy (of course) and the many treasures found within. The detail is impressive and the imagery superb.Reeves avoids cliched discussion and banal commentary, which you can find plenty of in many other second-rate books on Ancient Egypt. He uses his many sources intelligently and diligently - creating a clear analysis/account/reconstruction of Tutankhamun's life and death.Reeves is also astute enough to examine evidence other than the tomb itself regarding Tutankhamun - important evidence often overlooked but that which tells us much about the boy-king, particularly when cross-referenced with the evidence of the tomb. He also looks at the lives of the men who uncovered the tomb of the boy-king, Howard Carter and Lord Carnavon, and the archaeology behind the uncovering of the tomb - the story in itself is rivetting.Reeves' book reads a little academic at times but don't let that restrict you from purchasing it. Overall, it is an excellent read - informative, entertaining and an excellent resource for student, teacher or history buff. I certainly use it in my Ancient History classroom and it has proved one of the best buys I have made in terms of history books.I bought my copy in Egypt,from the bookshop just outside the main gate to the Cairo Museum - which certainly added another dimension to my trip there. Travelling down the Nile River, I sat on deck and immersed myself in Reeves' book, occasionally looking up to look at the amazing scene before my eyes and appreciating that this land I was looking at was once ruled by the subject of the book I was holding in my hands.

The books vary greatly in quality but I have to say that Nicholas Reeves' 1990 work on the subject \\"The Complete Tutankhamun: The King, the Tomb, the Royal Treasure\\", is without a doubt one of the very best on the subject and is full of informative information and historical background, and beautifully presented colour and black and white photographs on the subject all displayed in an easy to read format that has a logical flow to it. Indeed \\"The Complete Tutankhamun\\", is a small jewel box in itself and is essential reading for all budding Egyptologists or people interested in the customs and religious beliefs of ancient civilisations such as Egypt.Beginning with a highly appropriate forward written by the present Seventh Earl of Carnarvon the format of the book is very well thought out and takes the reader firstly through the time that Tutankhamun lived in which of course was the controversial Amarna period created by the \\"Heretic Pharaoh\\", Akhenaten. This section provides much needed information on Tutankhamun's life much of which is still largely unknown to us. It deals with the Pharaoh's childhood and his eventual succession to the throne of Egypt as a 8 year old God and most interestingly looks at other monuments that Tutankhamun was responsible for creating during his short 9 year reign, most of which were usurped by later rulers. Later sections explore in detail the search for the tomb of the mysterious boy Pharaoh and its eventual discovery and excavation by Howard Carter. The tomb itself , small and largely undecorated compared to other Pharaoh's tombs is examined in an often interesting manner using three dimensional drawings to show its layout and side views. Finally the burial and the tomb's magnificent treasures encompassing golden shrines, jewellery, solid gold coffins, exotic animal figurines, and clothing are examined in detail. This section of the book is in particular a treat as the stunning colour photography really shows each piece described to its best advantage.When one thinks of Tutankhamun's tomb one always thinks of gold and jewels however one of the great strengths of \\"The Complete Tutankhamun\\", is that good coverage is given to the myriad of personal and domestic objects that accompanied a Pharaoh on his journey to his new life. Interesting examinations of food stuffs, clothing, board games, and even touching family heirlooms like a boyhood bow and arrow belonging to Tutankhamun's childhood and a lock of Tutankhamun's Grandmother Queen Tiye's hair are examined and it is these less spectacular items that go a long way towards showing the reader more about just who Tutankhamun was as both boy and Pharaoh. Each section of the book is accompanied by a huge selection of photographs that are both from the time of the discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamun and more recent ones photographed at the Cairo Museum. Those photos that are contemporary with the discovery of the tomb are of great interest and reveal the painstaking work involved in the clearing and cataloguing of even a small tomb such as Tutankhmaun's. Rarely has a book on this subject managed to incorporate photos of so many of the items from Tutankhamun's tomb which helps make \\"The Complete Tutankhamun\\", one of the definitive sources of information for the modern reader about a Pharaoh's burial and of Tutankhamun and Egypt near the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty.\\"The Complete Tutankhamun\\", is one of my most cherished books on Ancient Egypt and I strongly recommend it to history and art lovers as one of the best sources of information on the Egypt of the glorious Eighteenth Dynasty. Egpyt of the time of the Pharaohs always seems to have a real attraction to even those people not greatly interested in history and this beautiful book is just the thing to satisfy anyone curious with this fascinating young ruler during Egypt's golden age.

Although I have had this book for some years now (1995 - Soft cover) and many more on the same king have been subsequently published, The Complete Tutankhamen still ranks as my favourite source of reference.

The book covers the history surrounding Tutankhamun during his time and the reasoning why his tomb was overlooked. But the book centered around Howard Carter whose tireless efforts finally paid off and his parton, Lord Carnarvon who financed and supported Carter. There are sections for each part of the tomb and what treasures were found there. There is a lot of information in this book on the content of the treasures that have gained so much attention since it revealation. The coverage of the book is pretty complete although as one previous reviewer wrote that there isn't much in terms of analysis or insight in this book But I thought that part may be left to other books since this book is your basic but very complete coverage of the discoveries of Tomb of Tutankhamun.The book proves to be well written and easy to read for any one who may be interested in this subject. The author obviously have great command of the subject matter and wrote in a matter that is easy to understand. There are enough photos and illustrations in this book to dazzled most readers although I wished there were more color photos. The book was published in 1990 so it doesn't includes some of the new insights into the real Tutankhamun or his treasures that came out in the past 17 years.

There was a brief chapter toward the beginning that dealt with the history of the boy king, followed by approximately two hundred pages detailing every little artifact found in the tomb. While this was interesting at times, it quickly began to feel like a list rather than a commentary.This book is a perfect for the reader who is exploring the tomb to a great deal of depth. That is, if a reader has read several other books on the life of the king and is thoroughly familiar with Egyptian art and culture, then this book could provide an excellent means through which he or she could become more acquainted with the particulars.This book is not, however, for people who want a \\"one-stop\\" book to read and come away with a brief understanding of the key points of the reign of the king, Egyptian society, and the artifacts of the tomb."},{"Title":"The Complete Tutankhamun: The King, the Tomb, the Royal Treasure (King Tut)","review":"This is a treasure trove of information for those who wish to know more about the artifacts found in the Tomb.

I've visited the Plainview, Nebraska, cemetery where some of the victims of this storm are buried. As a teacher, of course, I was most affected by the vignette of the young schoolteacher who tried to save her little students.

From historic records and eye witness accounts, Kooser uses the voices of men and women to tell the chilling tale. The event was also called the Schoolchildren's Blizzard because of the many children and teachers who were trapped in rural schools during the bitterly cold days of the blizzard.Here are the haunting voices of the men and women who were teaching school, working the land and tending the house when the storm arrived and changed their lives forever.A woman's voice: \\"...The wind/was so bad the men took turns/at the driving [mules] while others/laid in the wagon boxes./None of them died, but some lost/fingers and toes that day...\\"These are the remembrances of a hearty people who faced a terrible winter storm that seemed to come from nowhere.

It is a richly sensuous account of Durrell's years in the British civil service just after the end of WWII and just before the island is handed back to Greece. The eye is feted with descriptions of fields, hills, oranges and lemons, and flowers of every form and color. Sounds range from the rhythm of the sea (alternately savage and soothing) to Greek folk songs to sparkling conversation with Brit expatriates (including Gideon the half-sighted wonder). The author even offers a neat summation of a Greek picnic in tems of smells: petrol, garlic, wine and goat. Intermingled with these delicious attacks on the senses there is the play of light over the island as the sun moves across the sky and its rays are filtered through sea mist, mythology and the grim reality of having to rebuild a nation and an island after Nazi cruelty has left it a shambles. Like it or not, the reader is filled in on some mildly interesting points in the author's understanding of ancient history and the medieval Knights of St. John, who came into possession of the island for a time. The last section is about an enormous cookout in honor of a saint at whose shrine miracles have been know to occur, even raising the dead. It is a stroke of irony that during the festivities a young child is run over by a truck and dies the following day despite the best efforts of Mills, a good hearted but overextended British doctor. All in all, this is a delightful book, highly recommendable for those who enjoy travel writing. But Durrell is no Rebecca West, and this is not an example of the best Durrell. But it isn't bad Durrell, either."},{"Title":"Reflections on a Marine Venus","review":"Lawrence Durrell wrote this little book based on his life on Rhodes after World War II. This a more mature and settled Durrell than the young man who first brought us \\"Prospero's Cell\\" about Corfu or who wrote the \\"Alexandria Quartet\\" from Egypt during the war. Durrell's work is a time machine, taking the reader back to recovering Rhodes amidst poverty, sunshine, vibrant villages, and sparkling seas. His eye is fresh and clear, and his descriptions transport the reader to a place and time that are ageless and real. Another small classic!Reviewed by David Lundberg, author ofOlympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece"},{"Title":"Reflections on a Marine Venus","review":"...to see them after many years and in different circumstances.\\" So wrote Lawrence Durrell, in his epilogue to this marvelous account of the island of Rhodes specifically, and more generally, the Dodecanese Islands, which are in the Aegean Sea, off the southwest coast of Turkey. Durrell arrived at Rhodes, from Egypt, within a month of V-E day, 1945. He was (loosely) attached to the British forces which occupied the island, as a Press Attach&eacute;, and, as he rather wryly notes, a \\"censor.\\" Rhodes had been part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912, when it was seized, and to some degree colonized by Italy. The Germans took it from their one-time ally in 1943. Rhodes sustained substantial war damage in World War II, including numerous aerial bombardments. The harbor was littered with sunken ships, and unmarked mine fields deterred casual wanderings. Such a mine field would take the life of his friend, Gideon. This book is an account of these islands, from the perspective of his two-year stay there, 1945-47, when the British authorities returned the islands to Greece.Even though I had previously read Durrell'sBitter Lemons of CyprusandProvence, I was stunned by the display of erudition in this book. He is also an acute and sensitive observer, and there are passages that are pure poetry. He displays a deep love for Rhodes (he calls himself an \\"Islomane,\\" that is, a lover of islands), and one of his tributes is as follows: \\"...the landscape put her nymph's arms about human habits, beliefs, styles of minds so that imperceptibly they are overgrown by the fine net of her caresses... the island's green and gentle self...\\" I grew up reading the columns of the naturalist, Joseph Wood Krutch, in the NY Times, and have subsequently readThe Desert YearandTwelve Seasons (Essay index reprint series). Durrell is Krutch's equal, in his ability to render deeply descriptive passages of the natural world, and in the appendix, he \\"walks\\" you through the seasons, just like Krutch would.Durrell is fluent in Greek, and thus is able to enjoy the islanders on their own terms. He, and a couple of his English friends, tour Rhodes, by car when necessary, by foot by preference. Early in his stay, they manage a tour of the other islands by boat, and that includes a visit with the abbot of the monastery at Padmos, purportedly the island where St. John wrote the Apocalypse. In alternating chapters he relates the present and the past. Rhodes was a base for part of the Crusades (I didn't know that 70,000 humans were slaughtered when Jerusalem fell to the Crusaders in 1099). The Knights Templar was a strong force on the island for centuries. The author also devotes an entire chapter to one of the \\"wonders of the ancient world,\\" the Colossus. It really did exist, for 56 years, until it was destroyed by an earthquake in 227 BC. As for the title, it was a statue that was raised from the harbor during the clearing of the wartime detritus. He says of her: \\"She sits in the Museum of the island now, focused intently upon her own inner life, gravely meditating upon the works of time...the preoccupation of a stone woman inherited from a past whose greatest hopes and ideals fell to ruins. Behind and through her the whole idea of Greece glows sadly, like some broken capital, like the shattered pieces of a graceful jar, like the torso of a statue to hope.\\"Durrell was a good friend of Henry Miller, and greatly admired his first work,Tropic of Cancer, which has prompted a desire in me to re-read it. And, of course, Miller, who spent time on the beaches of Rhodes with Durrell, was also influenced, writingThe Colossus of Maroussi (Second Edition).I've been thinking a lot about the Mediterranean lately. The \\"inland sea\\" that nurtured those who laid the foundation for Western civilization. As Durrell sees it: \\"Italy and Greece, if you like, the lovers: the Italy of the domestic arts, the passionate feeling for husbandry and family order, the feeling of a vineyard built with the fingers, pinch by pinch, into terraces of household wine: Italy that conquers as a wife or nurse, encroaching on nature with the arts of love. Then Greece: the vertical, masculine, adventurous consciousness of the archipelago, with its mental anarchy and indiscipline touched everywhere with the taste for agnosticism and spare living: Greece born into the sexual intoxication of the light...\\"Ah, how fortunate Durrell was, to see and appreciate where \\"the story truly all began.\\" To have a balcony, and be able to gaze out on the Med, would be true happiness. Going home to one's roots is long overdue, and Durrell is such an excellent guide. 5-stars, plus."},{"Title":"Reflections on a Marine Venus","review":"The \`marine Venus' of the title is a statue which was found by sailors in their nets at the bottom of Rhodes harbor and which much appealed to Durrell, who thought of her as the 'presiding genius' of the place. He began this book while assigned to Rhodes as an information officer in 1945, and finally finished it in Belgrade in 1952 while working as a press attach&eacute; for the British Embassy. Before publication, it was chopped almost in half by his editor, Anne Ridler. She excised most of the passages dealing with the recent war, and \\"left the descriptions of the landscape and people....She oriented the book to sunlight, blue skies, and clear sea.\\" [quoted from the introduction David Roessel].War still clings like a gray film to the bright fabric of \`Venus.' Durrell writes intense, brilliant descriptions of Mediterranean skies and dazzling Greek villages, but as in all of his works that I've read, there is also a submerged longing for past love, past history, past glory.Some of his most beautiful passages, both in this book, in \\"Prospero's Cell,\\" and in the books of \\"The Alexandria Quartet\\" take place under water. Here, the author goes for a midnight swim in the final chapter of \\"Reflections on a Marine Venus\\"---\\"The [moon]light filters down a full fathom or more to where, on the dark blackboard of weed, broken here and there by dazzling areas of milk-white sand, the fish float as if dazed by their own violet shadows which follow them back and forth, sprawling across the sea's floor.\\"Bright surfaces. Submerged longings. There is even a ghost story floating just below the surface of a trip to the Island of Patmos. This chapter has some of the most powerful and eerie descriptions in the book. It brings together the storms of the \`little summer of Saint Demetrius', a lost, lingering voice from the war, and an Abbot who presides over a monastery where St. John was said to have composed the Books of the Apocalypse.\\"Reflections on a Marine Venus\\" is one of a series of travelogues that Durrell wrote about his pre- and post-war experiences in and around the Mediterranean. The other books in this series are \\"Prospero's Cell\\", \\"Spirit of Place,\\" \\"Bitter Lemons,\\" and \\"Sicilian Carousel.\\"Ultimately, these books defy the description \`travelogue'. Durrell wrote about the peculiar genius of a place, not bound by any moment in time, but for all time."},{"Title":"Reflections on a Marine Venus","review":"REFLECTIONS ON A MARINE VENUS is the second of Lawrence Durrell's \\"travelogues\\", for want of a more precise word. His books on exotic Mediterranean isles -- for example, Corfu, Rhodes, Cyprus, and Sicily -- are sui generis blends of memoir, history, myth, philosophy, and prose poetry. The subject of REFLECTIONS ON A MARINE VENUS is the isle of Rhodes, where Durrell spent about two years (1945-1947) as the head of the Information Office during the time that Great Britain administered Rhodes, after defeat and expulsion of the Germans and before turning responsibility for its governance back to Greece.The \\"Marine Venus\\" was an ancient statue of a naked woman that some fishermen had dragged up in their nets from the bottom of Rhodes harbor; the statue was placed in a museum on the island where \\"she sits * * * gravely meditating upon the works of time.\\" For Durrell, the statue symbolizes not only the island, but \\"the whole idea of Greece\\" and \\"a past whose greatest hopes and ideals fell to ruins.\\"The book proceeds in a leisurely and relaxed fashion, as did life on Rhodes. When it comes to describing a landscape (or seascape) or conveying a sense of place, Durrell is a master, and a poet. He also is a highly literate instructor on the history (stretching back to the mythology) of a place, although for him it is a somewhat idiosyncratic history. As he explains, \\"history as chronology is woefully misleading; for the history of a place, dispersed by time, lives on in fable, gesture, intonation, raw habit.\\"Rhodes of 1945-1947 was not quite the island paradise it probably was before WWII and maybe again in the 50s and 60s (before affluent Europeans began flocking to it for their vacations and second homes). When Durrell was there, the scars of war -- including mine fields, shell casings, and burned-out bunkers and gun placements -- were still fresh and almost ubiquitous. Nor had the economy recovered: for example, the daily newspaper that Durrell superintended publication of was issued for a penny but was worth two cents locally as wrapping paper, so that the paper made much more money from scrapped issues than from current sales.Perhaps it is because the War had not yet abandoned Rhodes that REFLECTIONS ON A MARINE VENUS is not quite the magical and lyrical tour de force that I found Durrell's earlier travelogue \\"Prospero's Cell\\" (about Corfu, circa 1937-1938) to be. Perhaps it is because Corfu simply was more magical and lyrical than Rhodes. Likely it also has something to do with the genius of Durrell's literary efforts. In any event, \\"Prospero's Cell\\" is clearly the superior work, but REFLECTIONS ON A MARINE VENUS nonetheless warrants a readership and, therefore, remaining in print."},{"Title":"Horses by Email","review":"by Kir DevonKaren is an ardent lover of horses, who would dearly love to have one.

A number of questions go unanswered, especially a critical one that ends up being the elephant in the living room for the rest of the book (unfortunately, disclosing the nature of the question would constitute a major spoiler).

Should a technology question arise, this is an excellent quick reference that gets you started with enough detail to learn what related subjects to search.The book is organized into 21 broad subject chapters which give an indication of the breadth of coverage: Materials: Non-ferrous Metals, Ferrous Metals, Chemicals; Power: Water, Wind, Animal, Steam, Internal Combustion, Electricity, Engineering; Transport: Roads, Bridges, Vehicles, Inland Waterways, Ports, Shipping, Rail, Aeronautics, Spaceflight; Communications: Language, Writing, Printing, Information, Timekeeping, Computing, Telecommunications; Technology: Agriculture, Textiles, Clothing, Building, Domestic Interiors, Public Utilities, Weapons, Armor.I was especially impressed with the detail of the metallurgy section, which includes processing aluminum and magnesium as well as iron and steel. The coverage seemed thorough and surprisingly clearly written. Numerous illustrations help make the points. I noticed there are a few limits to coverage. Silicon is not included. Plastics are covered too briefly for a chemist. Integrated circuits are mentioned and get one paragraph, but there is no discussion of fabrication technologies. Gold mining is mentioned, but there is no discussion of ore processing. Germanium is not mentioned. One concludes that coverage is best of ancient technologies that led to the 19th Century industrial revolution, i.e., the machine age. Coverage of 20th Century topics is hit or miss, with some topics incomplete or absent.A second limitation is that the book is British in origin and most examples are chosen from UK. US inventions are also described when appropriate, but the examples are often to foreign, unknown (to us) places. Plus, European construction details make those descriptions not applicable to the US situation.This is an excellent desk reference which history and technology buffs will find fascinating. Indexed.

A duffel bag, one hundred dollars in a jacket pocket, and a picture of a old jazz musician puts her and her new conquest on the search, and somehow leads her to the missing relative, along with the drama and danger that comes along. Straight to the point and humerous, Nanette is a heroine that will charm you and a story that will keep you turning the pages."},{"Title":"Coq Au Vin","review":"Move over Kinsey and V.I--here comes Nanette Hayes, the most interesting female protagonist in a mystery I've come across in a long time! Charlotte Carter has a razor-sharp ear for dialogue, and many lines had me laughing out loud. Nanette is sharp, witty, and, like the rest of us, screwed up--and a heck of a sax player to boot! Mark my words--Charlotte Carter is definitely a talent to watch."},{"Title":"Coq Au Vin","review":"In the disco seventies, Aunt Viv was saxophonist Nanette Hayes role model and heroine. Before disappearing in Paris, Viv taught Nan that life was worth living to the fullest. So when her mother asks her to find her missing aunt after receiving a telegram pleading for help, Nan rushes to Paris on a quest.However, Nan seems to have vanished, leaving behind a suitcase filled with clues including a con and a murder. Meanwhile, Viv relishes her tour of her favorite city. Making it even more fun for Viv is her meeting with fellow musician and American expatriate Andre. The twosome plays a mean &quot;You Took Advantage of Me.&quot; Though her love life has picked up, Nan's work as an amateur sleuth seems to be going no where except into danger.Readers will be singing the praise of the second appearance of Nanette Hayes. Like RHODE ISLAND RED before it, COQ AU VIN is a fun mystery because of the enthusiastic Nan. Jazz and Paris feel like characters as they add much to the moving plot. Crafty Charlotte Carter proves that her debut was no fluke as she is a major talent.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Coq Au Vin","review":"Charlotte Carter's absorbing Coq au Vin is a witty, erotic and moving love song to Paris and its &quot;glamorous black past&quot; of jazz musicians, singers, and artists. Sax-playing New Yorker Nanette Hayes is on a mission in her beloved Paris to find her missing free-spirited aunt. Nanette finds hot sex and romance first, and big trouble second, confirming her fear that she brings doom to those she cares about. While the mystery is slight, Coq au Vin's romantic comedy is the real deal, and so is the serious heartbreak."},{"Title":"Coq Au Vin","review":"Coq Au Vin, the second of four mysteries featuring the young and talented Francophone saxophonist, Nannette Hayes, took the mystery genre in an interesting direction. While most mysteries feature a tough-guy protagonist who is usually enamored with fisticuffs maybe even an intellectual passion or two to soften his rough edges, this leading lady sleuth is soft, a little on the sassy side and is very, very talented musically. Charlotte Carter has created quite a unique character, one that's in her mid- to late-twenties, and as such is in the midst of still finding her true self and her rightful place in the world. It was interesting to see how her personal relationships, especially her love life, intersected and often clashed with her sleuthing.I especially liked how the author weaved into the story, which takes place both in New York and Paris, a lot of African-American musical lore, ranging from the African-American expatriate community of the late twenties to the early sixties to the 'genealogy' of blues music in twentieth century America through the late thirties or thereabouts. I also liked how the character thoroughly lived in the moment, and while I had some objection to some aspects of her chosen lifestyle, I do recognize that for many, it makes the character relate-able in that many people have made the very bone-headed choices in their youth. Of special note is how the author makes the character literally evolve right in front of the reader's eyes.This lovely little Parisian romp features plenty of action, suspense, steamy romance and intrigue. It also has an ending that will catch many readers off-guard. A story filled with both love and loss, as well as a bit of intro-spection, Coq Au Vin is true original and a very worthwhile use of a lazy Saturday afternoon or two. I plan on getting all the books in the series, starting with the first one, and reading each while consuming a glass of my favorite Cabernet and nibbling on a baguette and cheese."},{"Title":"Coq Au Vin","review":"Nanette Hayes is a young, free-spirited, artist. As far as her mother knows she is a teacher, but really Nanette floats by as a musician surviving off of the gigs that she has acquired. All of her life Nanette has admired her aunt Vivian, who has lived the \\"free\\" lifestyle that Nan so desires. One day Nan receives a disturbing phone call from her mother and finds out that her aunt Vivian may be in Paris, in serious trouble. Nan's mother has the brilliant idea that Nan should take off of \\"work\\" to go and rescue her aunt. Despite the circumstances, this is probably the best news that Nan has heard in a long time.Initially, the book began a little slow. It was a little difficult to determine the direction that the story would take. My interest was piqued once Nan landed in Paris and began her adventure. It was exciting how the same man that Nan had a disagreement with turned out to be the love of her life, even if only for a moment. The romance that they shared seemed to overshadow Nan's purpose for traveling, but it made for an enjoyable read. Most of the action took place when Nan and Andre, her love interest, searched together for Nan's aunt and anyone she may have been associated with. The characters they met along the way were interesting to say the least. While neither the book, nor Nan's romance ended the way that I would have desired, the book was a true mystery. Complete with murder, motive, and money this is definitely a page turner for the sleuth in you."},{"Title":"All the Secrets of Magic Revealed: The Tricks and Illusions of the World's Greatest Magicians","review":"Mr. Becker offer us a collection of inept so called secrets of popular illusions.

There is simply to much junk about the underground. I found myself skipping page after page looking for Barrett material, but instead found the first 3/4 of the novel about 90% about the underground.

Not just for Floyd fans who lost all of the potential that Syd's music held, but for his family and close friends who lost a genuinely unique, loving person. The book is fascinating, delving deep into the life of Roger &quot;Syd&quot; Barrett while chronicaling his rapid descent into madness due to a combination of the pressures of being a &quot;pop&quot; star and the consumption of mass quantities of LSD. &quot;Syd blew his mind&quot;, a line from this book is probably the easiest way to sum up his tragedy, but that is way too easy to swallow. The author examines various external pressures Syd faced such as the having to come up with new &quot;hit&quot; 45's for radio play and dealing with a record business which he loathed. Syd's first love was art, he began as an artist and remains an artist to this day. Music took hold of Syd's life in the early sixties, stole his mind and left him by the mid 70's. Always putting the aspect of music as art first Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd broke new ground in music. As Syd to this day remains a recluse, I found it very refreshing that the author as well as Barrett's nephew URGE all fans to not try to contact Syd in any way, as he goes into deep depressions when reminded of the Floyd in anyway. Syd Barrett made spontaneous music in the sixties that was groundbreaking, he rarely if ever played the same song in the same way twice. It is somewhat fitting that now Roger Barrett still in someways is the same person, as he destroys every piece of art that he produces once it is finished. Syd is still in the body of Roger Barrett but his mind remains lost in the woods."},{"Title":"Lost in the Woods - Syd Barrett & the Pink Floyd","review":"This highly interesting book chronicles the saga of one Roger Keith &quot;Syd&quot; Barret, founder and early lifeblood of the ground-breaking musical group Pink Floyd. It tells of Barret's early days, his influences, his non-musical interests, and how, when and why the Floyd came to be. Of course, it also chronicles his immiment decline. It is interesting to see the downward spiral that Syd rode. Not just the drugs; but the pressure of fame and success and all else. It is a very sad story. So sad indeed, that it times it can be quite unsettling. First-hand accounts from those close to Barret serve to illustrate these definite points. Of course, it also shows that Syd is still here, and we all must realize that. I recommend this book to all major fans of Pink Floyd (along with Schaffner's &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;) and particularly ones of their early work and that of Syd's."},{"Title":"Lost in the Woods - Syd Barrett & the Pink Floyd","review":"The author, Julian Palacios, focuses on the tragedy of Syd Barrett. Instead of the innumerable &quot;funny&quot; anectodes about what a nutter Syd was, Palacios presents Barrett in a very human light. While the book does present Barrettt's artistic triumphs, it also delves into the reasons surrounding the Syd's demise. Interestingly enough, his downfall was brought upon in part by his success, not just overindulgence in LSD.I found some of the descriptions of Syd's mental illness very overwhelming, leaving me quite unsettled. First-hand accounts from Syd's friends lent the stories immediate power.Palacios also presents some of Syd's influences, both literary and musically. Presenting Syd within the framework of the London Underground was also much appreciated. It showed how special Barrett's music was, but also how reliant it was upon a certain time and place. There will never been another Syd Barrett, because the origins of his particular muse was the pastoral idylls of his childhood filtered through London '66.There are numerous typos in the book, which tend to be distracting. Also uncalled for is Palacios' final page, which is strict conjecture of what Syd MIGHT be thinking 30 years after the demise of Floyd. Much appreciated, though, is the fact that Palacios does not worship slavishly at the alter of Syd Barrett. When a song stinks, such as &quot;Maise,&quot; the author pulls no punches in saying so.This book is a fine companion piece of Nicholas Schaffner's book on Syd and Floyd, &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets.&quot; It is more rewarding, however, in the indepth look at Syd's childhood and schooling. Kudos to Palacios to presenting the most humane look at the music and life of Syd Barrett."},{"Title":"Lost in the Woods - Syd Barrett & the Pink Floyd","review":"Julian Palacios' book &quot;Lost In The Woods&quot; is a comprehensive tale of a talented and troubled young man. Exhaustively researched, its only flaw is that it sometimes reads like a textbook. These moments are rare and overcome by the genuine empathy the author has for his subject. Syd Barrett's story is a sad but important tale in the evolution of modern music. He influenced the likes of Hendrix and the Beatles, and argument could be made that every album the Pink Floyd released after his ouster was about Syd.Wish You Were Here."},{"Title":"Lost in the Woods - Syd Barrett & the Pink Floyd","review":"A thorough yet digestable bio of the late Syd Barrett.

The all too familiar grandoise 70's tours that gave thier audiences experiences of a lifetime. They recognize the string of lyrically and musically woven work that is considered some of the finest productions ever. This is the stuff which \\"legendary\\" is all about. The stuff of Meddle, Wish You were Here, Animals. The Wall. The sonic Dark Side of The Moon.Beyond this, few rock novices know about the groups early history. This was a very different Pink Floyd. One that was controlled by Syd Barrett.Roger \\"Syd\\" Barrett grew up like any normal post world war II english boy. Originally yearning to become a painter, an exposure to Elvis and Little Richard provoked him to take an interest in music as well. Being an art student in England within the early to mid sixties was an experience. Influences were abundant everywhere; American R&B; and Jazz. The Blues. Also abundant was the uncontrolled avialability of pot. Syd, always wanting fresh, new experiences took thatin as well. Eventually his guitar playing bcame better than his artwork. He hooked up with the son of one of his teachers, Roger Waters. Together they formed bands and played small venues for a little more than a year and a half. Then came the infamous \\"First Trip\\" where Syd experiences LSD for the first time through magic mushrooms (this is forever immortalized on the celluoid \\"Syds First Trip\\", a sought after tape of himself being filmed by the student buddy showing Syd completely on his magic swirling ship. Syd liked this so much that he continued to use it on a regular basis, knowing that the more he could ingest, the more his development as an artist would blossom. He eventually got the acid in its most available form. Soon these Physedelic experiences reflected in his playing and concept. Lighting Display, which was almost unheard of for a pop act became a central focus for the band-now named The Pink Floyd by Syd-the philosphy being that what you cannot make in your playing you can make up for with a visual experience. It was this, and not the Floyds early music that made the band so sucessful in the early going.Syd in those days ws considered a visionary. On LSD he...sure was. His musical ideas and concepts were fresh and uncharted-eventually his wirting skills developed as well as his bands presentation. The first sinle \\"Arnold Layne\\" made top 20 in England, but it was the second record, \\"See Emily Play\\" that established the Floyd as THE trip band. The formula was there; crazy lyrics, studio effects, unusual sounds and a tight arrangement-all completely orchestrated by Syd. Thier first album The Piper at The Gates Of Dawn (which includes uncanny songs such as \\"chapter 24\\", \\"Lucifer Sam\\", The Scarecrow, the phenomenal \\"Bike\\" and the extended space jam \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\") captured not only the essence of Syd Barretts Pink Floyd, but the London Underground as well. Soon it was Top of the Pops. Top 10 single and album. The Beatles visits, The UFO club. It was wall coming together rapidly for Syd.Then came the fall.Syd was still on a steady diet of LSD. His behavior was rapidly getting out of hand. The once focused and vibrant musician/songwriter was slowly but surely turning into an acid casualty. Acid didn't effect Syd's performance, it effected his actual functionality in life itself.His mental state becoming more eratic, his behavior was even more intolerable. Add thhe responsibilities of writing music and touring,it became to obvious it was too much to bear (see aural evidence with the single \\"Apples and Oranges\\" and the still unreleased \\"Scream thy Last Scream\\" and visual evidence of the infamous American Bandstand appearance on thier first American tour)and became clear that he was basically incoherent-the proverbial \\"lights on but nobody home\\" scenario. Eventually the band discharged Syd altogether-replacing him with David Gilmour. It was Gilmours-not Syds-guitar style that became most identifiable with Pink Floyd.Syd lived in a flat in London after this ouster and grew worse; outta touch with his music and the world. He managed to produc (with the help of the Floyd) two solo albums The Madcap Laughs and Barrett (both 1970). Though it was music, with some notable exceptions, they were clearly an unfocused and disjointed affairs. (highlights include \\"Terrapin\\",\\"Octopus\\",\\"Golden Hair\\", Gigolo Aunt\\" and one of syd's first written songs,\\"Effervescing Elephant\\").His deterioration continued well into the mid-seventies. Chronically usntable and mentally challanged due to prolonged ingestion of drugs he wound up being institutionalized. Released later to the daily care of his family, he shacked up in his mothers basement where he lives comfortably and carefree to this day almost unrecognizable from his prime, but suffers from a diabetic condition.One of the most brightest and gifted artists to come out of the rock era, Syd Barrett became one of the first burned-out rock stars, a physical toll being monumental, an emotional one being inmeasurable. Syd today eschews his past. Wordly known as the founder of Pink Floyd, he received entry to the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame(did not attend)and is held in reverence to numerous young musicians worldwide.For one shining moment, albeit brief, Syd Barrett became the darling of The London Underground and one of England's brightest Pop stars before it all came crashing down. Syds story is nothing sort of tragic, a chronicled tale of drug abuse and the troughs of the Rock N Roll lifestyle. His price that he paid for entering that arena reserved for those of groundbreaking visionary status. The book documents this expertly, and doesn't leave too much detail out, in fact I feel there is too much detail. Syd will forever remain a footnote in the bands history. To this day Pink Floyd cannot denounce (or shake off) the influence and original vision he had for the band.One might ask oneself, \\"What could have been\\"?"},{"Title":"Lost in the Woods - Syd Barrett & the Pink Floyd","review":"Syd Barrett will be greatly missed.

Throughout the class, the professor rarely made mention of the book except to give us homework problems to work through on our own. If you ever had a question, the textbook was not the source you wanted to rely on. The way they organize the examples doesn't truly make sense; it's more of a maze of numbers and decimals. Most will buy this book because it's required for their class, but if using this book as a personal reference there are better sources than this. Only reason I did well in the class was because the professor took his time to explain a lot of things the book barely glanced over, or just threw at you without mention of an explanation.Overall, if you're forced to use this book then talk to your professor. Don't hope that this book will be able to fill in any blanks that the professor may have missed. You will find them, but it'll take you at least 20-30 minutes to identify precisely what they are referring to.

Meyer's Matrix Analysis and Applied Linear Algebra) are the best books I have seen on the subject (as an introduction). This book had much clearer explanations than the textbook required for the class and, it included most of the topics covered during that semester. Looking back at the book, the properties of matrices, transpose, inner product, determinants, eigenvalue/vectors ect.. all come back up in applied engineering later on. All I have to do is, turn back to the pages as a quick refreshers (\\"oh yeah now I remember\\")... and continue on with an applied problems I have now in later clases from say, finite elements. The book includes a lot of examples which definitely helps you to consolidate the information when first taking the class. Later, the properties and definitions of things are more important, which may be a reason some professors choose to use other books. The scope of this book is like most linear algebra textbook and the order that it is presented is similiar. The clarity of explantion is what sets it apart. It may be difficult to see this if just browsing through without much thought. However when you are the student and have to get in the trenches and dig in to find details you need to prove something or solve a problem, this presentation here is much better that most. When I took this class, I actually decided to get this book due to the reviews on amazon because I was struggling to learn the material from the required text and I was glad I did. I was able to cover more ground and grasp the subject much better in less time. This lead me to do very well in the class (A) and more importantly to have a much better grasp on the subject, which in my opinion should be the intent of the class rather that to have the perfect bell curve distribution. All in all a great book, from a great teacher."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"This book gets more infuriating with each chapter. It starts off explaining things well enough, then it leaves you behind as it obviously thinks things are clear when they're not. This just piles up as you go along and by the middle of the book, this thing starts becoming a detriment to learning rather than an aide. An example - the book makes a point, then adds to the point, then brings it all together... not by explaining it, but by asking you \\"why?.\\" Why?? Here's a great point to be made and you don't explain it, you just ask the reader to figure it out on their own? Why??? And Poole averages one why a page, no joke. For someone who thinks the material is dead simple, that's just a nuisance. For the rest of us, its no help at all. Lazy even. Given the price, this is not a book I'd recommend for anyone, not even as a reference. If you've been assigned this book for a class, ask around for a good backup. Texts shouldn't be a drag on learning, this one is."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"(...) This is a really great book. Very clearly written with TONS of excellent examples. I really liked the diverse selection of applications too. Poole goes to great lengths to make linear algebra fun and I think he succeeds brilliantly! If you're looking for a linear algebra textbook that explains the subject clearly and makes it relevant, this is the book for you. (But where did Amazon.com get the cover photo? That's not the cover of the actual book!?)"},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"The true test of a math book is whether or not you keep it around for future reference, and this has been on my bookshelf for the last two years.Unlike some other math books (and, heaven forbid, higher level physics books) that I have had the dubious pleasure of slogging through during my time at a math and science college, you actually know where the problems are coming from in this LinAl book. They provide copious examples, examples upon examples, and the problems in each chapter are drawn from them, mostly verbatim, with a few numbers changed. A few might find this tedious, but I was so goddam happy to finally know where to find the information that would help me learn the material and finish my homework that I didn't care.Pros: Lots of examples, LinAl is taught competently, if not excitingly.Cons: Price. This book was assigned the year it was published, so no used copies existed. I think the college system and the book publishing industry are in cahoots."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"This textbook has very clear explanations as well as plenty of examples to help the reader learn linear algebra. I actually taught myself linear algebra using this textbook. The explanations in the book were much more helpful than my professor's lectures. Unlike most other math textbooks, this one includes plenty of applications and modern applications of linear algebra. That and the interesting and problems (of varying difficulties) in the textbook kept me interested in the subject. The problems are actually very instructive and helpful to my understanding. Whether you are buying this textbook to teach yourself linear algebra, or for a class, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"What a terrific book! I recently finished taking a linear algebra course using a different textbook. If only Poole's book could have been the text for my course. The author is clearly an outstanding teacher and he writes with students in mind. The exposition is crystal clear and he actually makes linear algebra fun! Wow! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"Having read a couple of books on the subject, I really think this is an ideal choice for any introductory Linear Algebra course. Poole's emphasis is clearly on readability for a range of students and building intuitive understanding on a vector-based foundation (where other texts have you lose sight of this through endless computations and sets of matrices). He provides intermittent examples of appropriately rigorous proofs without inundating you (lets you fill in the details in a few exercises) and always offers techniques to help you practically approach types of problems. I'm not a hardcore mathematics person - mostly taking these courses to fill my requirements for teaching high school physics - but I can honestly say that you can carefully read through a section once, and blaze through many problems that are on par with most other texts' (Poole, thankfully, is very generous with # of medium-level practice exercises, and carefully selects challenge problems that are enlightening but still in the scope of the book!). Just as a heads-up, this book doesn't always use the \\"classical\\" LA terminology (example: Chapter 5 doesn't emphasize that it is actually dealing with \\"the Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra\\"). However, it doesn't skimp on any vital intuitive/conceptual implications these theorems bring to light...Ultimately, this book retains value even after you finish the course (keeping it, when I have the time to go through the entertaining professional applications of LA the author shows in detail). I would seriously consider buying books by this man if he published on other subjects, even if I didn't necessarily need the course!"},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"Just to let you know, this is the only Linear Algebra text that I've actually been exposed to yet, I feel that it's a pretty good introduction to the subject since I learned quite a lot from it. This is the textbook that my professor used for my linear algebra class last semester. My professor wasn't very good at teaching the subject, but I feel he did well by choosing this title. Having read most of the pages in the book, I say that the text is fairly readable. Most of the time, the book actually gave better examples and explanations then the professor. One could probably teach themselves linear algebra with it."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"The description for the book is &#34;like new&#34; yet the binding of the book is held together by tape. The detail descriptions mentions this, but why then would the book be categorized &#34;like new&#34;? Seems like false advertising to me."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"I think there are many factors that make this a great book. First of all, it is easy to read and understand. Topics are organized in a logical way. Every chapter begins with a problem that introduces informally the concepts that will be addressed in the sections. This helps the students, especially those who, like me, are new to the subject, to get familiar with the concepts through visualization and examples. Theorems are stated clearly and proofs are rigorous and concise. Each chapter contains an \\"Exploration\\" section where real-life application from a wide variety of sciences are presented. These include coding, Markov chains, LU factorization among others.The author has accomplished the most difficult task: write a book that is rigorous enough for someone with interest in the mathematical aspects of linear algebra, and interesting enough for someone who is more concerned with the applications of it in the sciences.There is something else that makes this book exceptional. The author's passion. For instance, in chapter 3, after proving a theorem on the composite of linear transformations, the author exclaims with joy:\\"Isn't it a great result? Say it in words:'The matrix of the composite is the product of the matrices.' What a lovely formula!\\"Linear algebra is definitely not among my mathematical strengths, but Professor Poole made it interesting and challenging."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"This is an excellent linear algebra textbook. Even if you just wanted to learn more about the subject, I can't imagine a better introduction. I've taken many math courses and saw this book when I was tutoring a first year student. My reaction was \\"I wish this had been the text when I took linear algebra.\\" I am familiar with Lay, Anton, Strang, Nicholson, and Kolman but Poole beats them all in my opinion. Here's why: clear writing, lots of excellent examples, very good exercises, interesting examples, and extras (like independent study projects and real-world applications) that other books don't have.At first I thought this book was pretty low-level. But after careful reflection, I realize this is not the case: it is easy to read but not a watered-down version of the subject: it's kind of sneaky that way.All in all I give it thumbs way up."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"As a computer science graduate student without the proper math background, I've been cramming mathematical concepts into my brain for the last few years. And this book, every time, has provided the most lucid, digestable and yet usefully rigorous explanation I have found for whatever concept I'm learning. The four-page explanation of Markov chains, pp. 217-220, e.g., seems very hard to top. The thing is, in CS especially perhaps, you learn to use math as a tool when you have that \\"ah-hah\\" moment of intuition. When you get the idea of what *the point* of the particular mathematical tool is. Then you can apply it and use it to think about other problems you might want to solve. Math as a way of thinking. Which is where the clarity of writing and explanation in this book comes through for you. Which is not to say the problems aren't excellent as well, because they are, and you have plenty of opportunity to practice the manipulations associated with a given concept as well. I can't recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"I am a control systems engineer and deal with the design of physical systems, both linear as well as non-linear. I constantly use this text to refresh material related to linear systems and find it an indispensable resource. Here's why.The text is very clearly written and the exercises are excellent. Dr Poole does not obfuscate core issues with lengthy proofs. Which is not to say proofs are not presented - they are, but in a very accessible (read \\"geometric\\") form. I would strongly urge serious students of the subject to work through the problem sets - they will bring a deeper level of understanding.Highly recommended to students as well as professionals.Update: Jul-2009I would also recommend checking out Prof Gilbert Strang's MIT OCW lecture on Linear Algebra. Also get Strang's book of the same name - work through the video lectures and the book problems and you will end up with a first class background in the subject."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"I'm a junior majoring in computer science and I had to take a linear algebra course to satisfy my degree requirements. I put off taking the course until this semester since I had heard bad things about the course. Like one of the other reviewers, I learned that the prof changed texts and would be using Poole's Linear Algebra instead of the previous semester's book (which I won't name!)Poole's book is absolutely fantastic. He starts slowly and gives a good concrete foundation before introducing the more abstract concepts - I really liked this approach. There are examples and applications galore, including lots of stuff on codes. (Even though my prof didn't cover all of these applications, I read them all - this book has changed my opinion of the usefullness of linear algebra.)I really recommend this book. If you want to learn linear algebra and have it explained in a clear way, this is the book for you. If you know a prof who is using a different book, get her/him to check this one out. Your fellow students will thank you!"},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"I'm going to make this simple: This book saved me!I'we been studying linear algebra past semister, and the book the teacher assigned to us really wasn't explaining things well enough. I got this book one week before the final exam, and I can surely say that it is the only reason why I passed this class!The book is very well written, and the author always seems to be ahead of your head, in knowing what parts might get you confused or what questions you might have in mind. It seems like every time I stumbled on something, the next sentence exactly explained what I was wondering about.Buy this book, you will not regret it!"},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"OK.

Not really very well written.But I signed up anyway and - surprise!! - new textbook! Linear Algebra by David Poole - what a HUGE relief! As other reviewers have said this is a GREAT LA textbook - well written, clear, good examples and pictures and fun! (really!) It's like having your prof give you his personal lecture notes with extra comments. I loved the book and loved the course.If Prof. Poole is thinking of writing other textbooks, I'll be first in line to buy them - and can suggest what he should write next :)"},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"I am in my second year of university. In pursuit of a degree in math, I?ve been through several books but this one beats them all. The author has made an extra effort to make this very complicated subject understandable.

The book starts from the very basic topics and fundamental concepts and covers advanced topics in glorious detail. I?ve had the pleasure of attending some of the author?s lectures and his vast knowledge of this subject in as evident in this book as was in his lectures. If you plan to buy one linear algebra book this definitely the one to get!"},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"Besides copious amounts of unnecessary jargon and run-on sentences, the listed solutions (both in the appendix and separate [$$$] solutions manual) for problems in this book are frequently incorrect. BIG INCONVENIENCE AND WHOLLY UNACCEPTABLE; given that few problems in linear algebra are quickly processed by hand. If you use this text, expect to spend an hour on one problem attempting to find errors in your approach when in fact there are none, and the listed solution was just wrong.Instructors and students agree that the frequency of incorrect answers is the biggest problem with this text.Thou art warned."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"Having been away from academics for a while, I thought I could use a bit of a referesher in some of the basics. Having learned Linear Algebra using Hugh Campbell's text, I was in for quite a surprise when I began using both Poole's and Lay's texts as refreshers. Both treat the theory of matrices the same. However, Poole introduces the notions of vector spaces early on with clear explanations. The one failing of this text is the treatment of determinants as an afterthought. Rather than have its own chapter, as in Lay, this is a subsection treated more as a curiosity. The development and power of determinants is downplayed all around, but especially in Poole. Overall, however, it is a very good beginners text on a very powerful math subject."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction","review":"This is the only textbook I have encountered, which is able to combine mathematical rigor with never-before-seen clarity in an almost flawless presentational style. But it goes beyond just being an almost perfect linear algebra textbook; its presentation is a singular, paramount example that should be the standard for the entire academic system.While everyone was complaining about the poor textbook assigned by the instructor in my linear algebra class, I aced the exams just by the help of this textbook - completely disregarding the assigned readings and problems in the assigned text. This alternative turned out to be an exceptional helper.I can't put into words how much I appreciate this text - it is the best teacher I could have ever had. Poole doesn't try to make things more complicated than they are; he makes the concepts easier/straightforward to understand - unlike other authors in his field."},{"Title":"Rituales Para El Amor, LA Belleza Y LA Prosperidad/Rituals to Adquire Love Beauty and Prosperity (Spanish Edition)","review":"Its a nice book, i actually bought for my mother in law and she likes it.

While pointing out the many differences between Latinos and long-standing conflicts, Morales offers hope about the possibility of finding common ground. The book empowers Latinos by alllowing us to see how, historically, we have taken advantage of our mixed-race background, while painting a detailed picture about our presence in America for non-Latinos. The writing is first-rate--I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Living in Spanglish: The Search for Latino Identity in America","review":"As a latino who has enjoyed occasional plays or songs that used Spanglish as a gimmick, I was curious to read this book that claimed that our entire culture should be re-labeled as Spanglish.But within a few pages, I realized that the author engages in a self-congratulatory &quot;deconstructionist&quot; style designed to impress a) his writing professor in college, b) his less-educated peers, c) not sure whom? Frequent references to Jack Kerouac, Dubois and others seems more of a last-minute thought to fluff-out or &quot;fatten&quot; the book for press time.I would not recommend this book for anyone needing to learn about the current Latino culture or our issues; a much better bargain is the free pdf download at Lulac.org website."},{"Title":"Living in Spanglish: The Search for Latino Identity in America","review":"As a fellow writer of books on ethnicity, I became curious of other viewpoints. Since Latinos/Hispanics are a rapidly growing segment of the U.S. population, I felt a responsibility to examine some of the issues in the Latino community. I found many similarities between the Black and Latino communities when it comes to stereotypes and Race. 1. What do we call ourselves? 2. Stereotypical treatment in Hollywood. 3.

This book rocks my world, and I hope to share it with my family and friends."},{"Title":"Living in Spanglish: The Search for Latino Identity in America","review":"With the virtually simultaneous release of Rodriguez's Brown and Morales' Living in Spanglish one gets to see the virtues of Morales' urbane and grounded Latino odyssey compared to the self-indulgent vacuousness of Rodriguez's efforts to make Latinos acceptable to the American mainstream. Morales takes us into places where most don't normally see Latinos from the perspective of a generation forced to absorb a numbing sociocultural ambiguousness. Living in Spanglish is a refreshing tour of the current Latino moment he describes as &quot;Spanglish.&quot; This is a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Living in Spanglish: The Search for Latino Identity in America","review":"Bought this book because I am the parent of a young man who is struggling to accept his dual identity as the son of a Mexican immigrant and a basic white American woman (me). He feels fully accepted by neither group, though we tried to give him pride in both halves. This book was so all-over-the-place that neither my son nor I could get through it. We are both avid readers and each came to the conclusion independently. The book is poorly written, poorly edited. There is no thesis, no cohesion, no development of thoughts or support for generalizations. I don't know why a publisher thought this was worth publishing, other than perhaps that this author has achieved some notoriety and that there is a market niche for Latino authors and subjects.The author purports to know a lot about the diverse subcultures in the Spanish-speaking world. He knows zip about Mexicans. His exposure to Mexican culture seems to have been very brief, yet he feels he can make sweeping assessments about the people.Just because something is in print does not make it valuable. Just because you \\"are\\" something does not mean you know anything worth sharing about the group you belong to. Anyone could have written this. I am sorry to have spent my hard-earned money on this book, and it is sad because there is a dearth of positive role models and credible, uplifting reading material for young Latino men and women in America."},{"Title":"Living in Spanglish: The Search for Latino Identity in America","review":"Wait to check out the paperback from the library. Ed Morales' best writing was at the beginning of his career in the Village Voice, where he displayed a passion for writing.

Five years later Noel has not really responded to his brother due to his disability. Jacob now understands autism but sometimes is embarrassed to bring friend's over because his friends will think that Noel does things on purpose. Noel prefers to sit for hours rocking back and forth on the floor or watching a train move about without even moving a muscle.As noted in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Autism chapter, a team of professionals such as a speech therapist, a child psychiatrist, a psychologist or a social worker will be the ones making the diagnosis of autism. It is not mentioned but I would also add that nursery school teachers, assistants, relatives and other school settings autistic tendencies or behaviors/symptoms can be prevalent and any of these individuals might make the suggestion of having an assessment done on the child.The book explores what it is like to be a teenager with a sibling who is autistic and the feelings of isolation, guilt, pressure and resentment. There is also a list of what you need to know about autism and what you as a sibling can do to help. Autistic individuals tend to be visual learners and seek out the computer or television screen. A sibling can encourage the abilities the autistic child has by reading to them and speaking in a softer tone.It is mentioned that the siblings have the longest relationship within the family unit. The older sibling could benefit from a support group at this time and learn from other siblings at \\"sibshops\\".Other disabilities were mentioned, but Tourette's Syndrome was overlooked. This is a well suited book for those in the middle school years and entering teenaged years to help them deal with having a sibling who is autistic."},{"Title":"Coping When a Brother or Sister Is Autistic","review":"Unfortunately, the factual book includes some parody material cribbed from the Internet about \\"Neurotypical Syndrome\\" listing it as fact. (\\"Neurotypical\\" simply applies to all who do not have autism.) There are a couple of hilarious online parodies penned by people on the spectrum about \\"Neurotypical Syndrome\\" and unfortunately, this book's author or someone else included it in the list. Sadly, the fact that the author and publisher would use Internet material without a factcheck means all the book's info must be viewed as suspect. Don't know about you, but I do not have time to perform a line by line fact-check... a job, BTW, the publisher's editorial department should have performed."},{"Title":"Coping When a Brother or Sister Is Autistic","review":"I've read many of the books out there on autism. I found this book to be a fairly good, informative little book. I thought this would be suitable for my 5-year old, but the 4-8 year old rating is not accurate. I would put it closer to a pre-teen level. The author has condensed a good overview of autism, related disorders, treatment options, (suspected) causes and more. I have considered purchasing this book to loan out to friends, relatives and aides that want to know a little more about autism but could not handle reading a thick, complicated book. I would not recommend this book, however, for the parent or professional that wants more in-depth reading. Those parents should check out Overcoming Autism, Could it be Autism?, Autistic Spectrum Disorders (Mitzi Waltz), Pivotal Response Treatments, More Than Words by Fern Sussman, Teaching Individuals with Developmental Delays, Behavioral Intervention for Young Children with Autism and Biological Treatments for Autism and PDD as good starting points."},{"Title":"Coping When a Brother or Sister Is Autistic","review":"The numbers she quotes are extremely low in the rates of Autism affected children.When my son was diagnosed we immediately started therapy (ST, PT, OT) and in the first month, I met 4 other affected families who's children were born in the same year of my son.

It addresses the stigma of abortion in the church, speaking to those who might erroneously feel it is \\"the unforgivable sin\\".This book is practical (advocates more crisis pregnancy centers), scientific (includes statistical & medical information), theological (contains interesting evidence against abortion from the Bible and early church writings), compassionate (this is an appeal to pastors and lay people for sensitivity), and very interesting. It has galvanized me to be more informed and more active in reaching out to vulnerable women and men who have been faced with the spectre of abortion."},{"Title":"Answering The Call: Saving Innocent Lives, One Woman At A Time","review":"This is a powerful little book published by Focus on the Family and written by a former student of John Piper, calling the church to pro-life evangelism.

I guess I secretly wanted to read it myself, but it was lost in the shuffle of things before either of us was given the chance to read it. Recently, I went to New Hampshire, and found it in my family's cabin. If you're someone who, like me, does in fact judge a book by it's cover, you would have been drawn to this book immediately. The 1969 edition that I have (I guess my mother didn't want it after all) has a painting on the cover of a girl standing on a cliff over the waves smashing into the rocks below. This scene was what persuaded me into reading the first page.What a mystery. A widow works incognito as a piano teacher to solve the mystery of her sister's disappearance. The title may give it away, but throughout the book, the reader is given many chances to figure out who, how, and why before it is actually revealed. There is an eerie &quot;haunted&quot; mansion, lots of shocking secrets, desire, and many disturbing encounters. This was a perfect introduction to Victoria Holt. Read it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"The Shivering Sands","review":"This review is for the Doubleday & Company hardback edition, undated but probably 1969 312 pages of story. THE SHIVERING SANDS did not make the USA Today's Top 150 Best-Selling books list, as USA Today did not begin tracking book sales until October 1993. Victoria Holt has two later novels on this best-seller list.Carolina Verlaine suffered tragedies. Her parents, both archeologists, died in a train crash in route to a dig. She forfeited a promising career as a pianist in deference to her husband Pietro who was more talented, but he dies, leaving Carolina a widow at age 28. Then Carolina's only sister, Roma Brandon, also an archeologist, disappears just as her team finishes excavating Roman ruins at the Lovat Stacy estate in eastern England. Carolina's former piano teacher who is teaching four young women at Lovat Stacy decides to retire and recommends Carolina to replace her, but without mentioning to her employer that Carolina is Roma's sister. Carolina, determined to learn what happened to her Roma, accepts the position without revealing her relationship to Roma.The story, in the 1880s, is set in near Deal on the eastern shores of the United Kingdom. Four to six miles east of Deal, across the Downs channel, lays the Goodwin Sands, shifting quicksand. Over the past couple centuries, the Goodwin Sands became the graveyard for an estimated 2000 vessels. Although Lovat Stacy and the nearby village, Lovat Mill, are fictional, the actual village Martin Mill appears to be close to the fictional setting between the exiting Walmer and Dover castles.The story gradually reveals the tragedies of the Stacy household over the past several decades leading to the conflicts and intrigues in the narrative present. SHIVERING SANDS is well written in the first person, giving Carolina the only point of view, which keeps the reader engaged in trying to solve the mysteries of Lovat Stacy along with her.After reading three best selling contemporary romance thrillers, which I rated three stars, I found THE SHIVERING SANDS without a dust jacket amongst our books of unknown origin. I began reading it without knowing the genre. What a nice surprise. This is a five-star historical, romance, mystery, psychological thriller."},{"Title":"The Shivering Sands","review":"Caroline Verlaine was alone in the world, her husband Pietro, a brilliant concert pianist had died soon after their marriage, but not before Caroline had given up her own chances as a performer. Her only sister, Roma, had now disappeared mysteriously while working on an archeological dig of Roman ruins in the English countryside. Roma had followed in their late parents footsteps and studied archeology, Caroline had always been the outsider in the family and pursued music. When an opportunity arose for Caroline to take a post as music teacher to the children of the estate where Roma had been working Caroline took it with the idea to find out what happened to Roma.Caroline soon found herself enmeshed in the lives and scandals of estate and village of Lovat Stacey, including her students - shy Edith soon to wed Napier, the heir, quiet Alice, the housekeepers daughter, lively Allegra, Napier's illegitimate child and Sylvia, the vicar's daughter and the rest of the household - Sir William the patriarch of the family, his ne'er-do-well son Napier, Mrs. Lincroft, the housekeeper and Sybil, Sir William's sister as well as the ever present ghosts of Sir William's dead wife, Isabel and favorite son Beau. As Caroline began to sort out the truth from the lies and gradually uncover what had happened to Roma new complications arose in the unwanted attentions of Napier and the comforting ones of the new curate.This is a romance novel in the finest tradition, young heroine with a sad past finds herself in a romantic isolated spot as teacher/governess/companion to a wealthy family swept into danger complicated by old scandals and pursued by two handsome men. The formula never varies, the appeal is the variations on the theme, the clever twists and turns the author inserts into the story. Few do this better than Holt, her heroines come to life, the twists in the plot come as a total surprise, keeping the reader guessing until the end."},{"Title":"The Shivering Sands","review":"Victoria Holt does it again in yet another spectcular Gothic romance, full of suspense and chilling atmosphere.

She creates so many interesting characters in her books that one gets confused and must reread parts. In this story, two characters disappear. Finally on the last few pages one discovers who is the mysterious evil one (one never suspects he/she). I wanted to skip ahead but I refrained myself. Mrs. Hibbert makes each page so realistic. I could reread the book again tonight - since I have been buying as many of her books as I can afford, I must keep reading another and another. Wish I could afford the $400.00 ones, c.1941. What a shame she died;however, she left an indelible signature for generations. I have a list of all the books she wrote. If anyone would like my 9 page (small print) list, I would send it to them.

The end is so surprising, I had to look back in the book a few times to make sure everything added up correctly.

I think almost everyone will find nuggets to take away from this book to help with their daily walk and, while this book is short and could be read in a sitting or two, I think it is better read in short spurts and then pondered on. There is also a Readers Guide with questions to prompt further thought about each chapter along with bible verses to direct further study.Much like the other book of Mr. Lucado's that I have read, Facing Your Giants, it might be a good book to put on your nightstand to read a few chapters each evening."},{"Title":"And the Angels Were Silent: Walking with Christ toward the Cross (Chronicles of the Cross)","review":"Perfect for a morning devotional.

It goes much further than the typical Von Reissewitz - Wells story. There is almost no mention of miniature wargaming. Only board-wargaming and 'serious' army wargaming are described, but these parts are covered in great detail. Definitely worth reading if your interested in the history of wargaming."},{"Title":"The Art of Wargaming: A Guide for Professionals and Hobbyists","review":"This book focuses on the history of wargames. It focuses mainly on war games use by the militaries, with only token coverage of the hobby. To say it only discusses board games, though, is inaccurate. It discusses games from a military viewpoint, without discussing much in the way of game mechanics, in a specific manner. Dr. Perla does discuss the abstraction of game design, and the level of details. He discusses the purposes of a particlur game design, and how this is used to explore a particular set of criteria for a military operation. If that sounds complicated, it is. This book is not terribly complex or difficult to read, but the design of military war games, for the professional militaries, is. He does not go into detail for professional designs, but he does discuss the overall concepts well.This book is aimed at discussing how war games are designed, applied, and used. It discusses what can be learned from such exercises, and what cannot be learned in a simulation. If you are a game designer, you will learn from this book, but perhaps not as much as you would like. He does not discuss details, but rather concepts, and focus level: is this game designed for a tactical level, or strategic level? What do the designers hope to learn from this simulation?While this book accomplishes its tasks well, if you are looking for a book on the hobby of war games, it may leave you unsatisfied. It is primarily aimed towards professionals, in my opinion, and those who wish to know the history of &quot;professional&quot; war games."},{"Title":"The Art of Wargaming: A Guide for Professionals and Hobbyists","review":"The most comprehensive book on the subject Wargaming from an insider -- Dr. Peter Perla. His theoretical approach to the making of this book combines with actual practices make this book an immensely useful and thought-provoking reference as to historical development, principles of designing and analyzing wargames. Mr. Perla is a naval guy and so there is much coverage on the naval game simulation at the start and in the end part of predicting the future use of wargames. If you can pass these rather technical materials drawn from his extensive experience in the Center for naval Analyses since 1977 where he works as a naval operations research analyst, you can find a vibrant, knowledgeable and insightful as to the modern commercial wargames. A lot of these games are covered especially those from SPI, Avalon Hill and Victory Games. You may jump to read Chapter 3 onwards to Chapter 9 if you are a hobbyist yourselves. Perla's book is more scholarlistic and hard to chew on than James Dunnigan's &quot;The Complete Wargame Handbook&quot;. But at the same time, this book offers more depth and breadth on the subject. Highly recommended. The book was first published in 1990. Grab a copy of it before it goes out-of-print."},{"Title":"The Art of Wargaming: A Guide for Professionals and Hobbyists","review":"The first half of the book focuses on the history of wargaming, and is quite informative.

It gives an excellent history of wargaming through the ages, and covers the 70's period extremely well (taking me for a walk down memory lane). I agree with the other esteemed reviewers on the rest of the book, it's worth a read."},{"Title":"The Art of Wargaming: A Guide for Professionals and Hobbyists","review":"Peter Perla, based upon his experience as a hobby wargamer and then as a naval operations research analyst, has written a book on wargaming entitled The Art of Wargaming. Perla's objective in writing this book is to give the reader an understanding of wargaming and the important role it has in the military (professional wargamers). Perla claims wargames offer a \\"unique learning experience that leads to a deeper and more personal understanding and appreciation of warfare than can be attained by any other method short of actual participation on the field of battle.\\" Therefore, wargaming becomes an important tool for training those who may go into harm's way in the future.Perla divided his book into three different sections, which contribute to one's understanding of where wargaming originated (history), what wargames actually entail and finally what role wargames will have in the future. When Perla considers the beginning of wargaming, he not only considers the military's perspective, he also addresses the role hobbyist have had in wargaming. In looking at what wargames entail, Perla tries to clarify the differences in what a wargame is and what it is not, thereby showing the potential role it has with professionals. When considering the future, Perla ties the \\"historical perspective and the theoretical principles...to project into the future of wargaming.\\" Basically, Perla seems to find a balance between playability and realism to achieve some means by what one can achieve in playing wargames.Perla defines a wargame as \\"an exercise in human interaction, and the interplay of human decisions and the simulated outcomes of those decisions.\\" He recognized that wargames, while short of the actual physical impacts of war, provide a means for learning the \\"dynamics of warfare.\\" They provide a means by which \\"questions of strategy, human decision making, and war-fighting trends\\" can be analyzed. In comparison, James Dunnigan, author of The Complete Wargames Handbook, describes a wargame as \\"a combination of game, history and science.\\"Since every wargame has objectives, whether it is designed for a hobbyist or a professional, the more clearly the objectives are stated beforehand, the more likely a wargame will be successful. In hobby wargames, the designer usually determines the objectives of a wargame. Their ultimate goal is \\"intellectual entertainment.\\" In a professional wargame, the objectives are usually determined by a sponsor (who sets up the goals of the wargame). The professional wargames are usually designed for educational or research reasons.Perla distinguishes those games played by hobbyists and those played by professionals as those that are \\"played to meet educational or training objectives, or to conduct research about specific issues or concepts.\\" Due to that, the design of each wargame is different. When designing wargames, Dunnigan believes that a wargame must accurately simulate a historical event (realism) while ensuring playability. According to Perla, those who help to create professional wargames have to ensure that the players will not only be able to learn something from playing a wargame, they have to ensure that they are also instructional tools. Both Dunnigan and Perla share fundamental principles though in designing games, as there are specific objectives, players, information tools and documents needed in both a hobby and professional wargame. In each case, the designers need to ensure that the wargamers (hobbyists and professionals) actually want to play the wargame.Perla delves into the designing, development, playing, and analysis of wargames. Based upon his experience, he is able to provide a lot of information though it is done in a rather technical format. Perhaps, what is most evident when reading through this section is Perla's belief that wargaming has a significant, if not a very important role, in teaching, educating, and evaluating military leaders. While there may be some limitations in using wargames, the benefits of using wargames is significant.Perla clearly is well versed on the subject of wargaming, however one must be able to read through all of his technical views/details of wargaming to learn about professional wargames. Perla appears to have targeted a different audience than Dunnigan, whose book has a lot more detail for the hobbyist. Perla's book seems to be written for the professional wargamer, especially those who may have an interest in the history of professional wargames, the design of wargames and the potential that wargames have to offer in our understanding of potential future conflicts. Based upon my review (as a hobbyist), I don't believe a hobbyist will enjoy reading this book as much as Dunnigan's book, unless they have an interest in understanding the difference between the two different types of wargamers."},{"Title":"The Art of Wargaming: A Guide for Professionals and Hobbyists","review":"Perla's extensive research into the background and history of wargames, along with the books acceptional chapters on designing and playing wargames make it a comprehensive guide for both the FNG (the NG part stands for new guy, the F yu can figure out) and the professional.

What a headache, then, if you're looking for help on the shelves of the library and all the management resources seem to just miss the aesthetic mark, skirting the very issues that are at the core of the cultural businesses you represent. In Dag Bj&ouml;rkegren's The Culture Business: Management Strategies for the Arts-Related Business, we at last have a book on management that is useful with in the context of the arts. --- In a way, The Culture Business is a wake-up call for arts managers and consultants who still espouse traditional, broad-sweeping management strategies for cultural businesses. Cultural products, Bj&ouml;rkegren insists, require a different frame of reference altogether, one that has been largely ignored in management circles so far. --- Bj&ouml;rkegren's position is that most research available in the field of business management is so clinical, so methodological and so 'set in its ways,' that it can ultimately only establish well-known facts. He affirms that typical organization and management theory has little bearing on the everyday business of selling of aesthetic experiences and he warns companies to beware of highly structured management strategies that place unfair expectations on arts-producing organizations. --- The Culture Business describes two strategies for cultural industries - one aesthetic, the other commercial - used by arts decision-makers to reduce uncertainty. The book features comprehensive case studies that delve into the specific ways these approaches are used, offering practical solutions and lessons that might be learned. --- According to Bj&ouml;rkegren, the million-dollar conundrum in the arts is that there is no way to define how the art product should or will be used. The audience transforms the meaning of the product so much, he writes, that 'the production of art becomes the production of meaning.' In this way, he suggests, arts companies are actually in the business of selling potential meanings, and not finished products. Further, what works for one type of cultural product or company won't necessarily work for another, and some types of culture business are only successful using a combination of aesthetic and commercial considerations. --- The Culture Business responds to a recognized need for situation-specific and firm-adjusted theories for arts management. Bj&ouml;rkegren sets the stage for further research in this discipline and provides the reader with the tools to approach business challenges in the arts without fear. The limitation of the book lies in the fact that his examples exclude, for the most part, the specifics of the performing arts. --- Ironically, the omission actually supports Bj&ouml;rkegren's core assertion, that you can't paint all industries with the same brush, even within the cultural industries. His choice to focus on the publishing, film and recording industries was likely because of the availability of information or the fact that performing arts is even an less tangible (ie - more complicated) than products like CDs or books, but there are similarities. Be warned though (performing arts managers): you still might get that 'hey what about me' feeling while reading this book since its bulk is in three middle chapters devoted in detail to each of the industries studied. Still, The Culture Business represents an approximation far better than most in its genre and it is, quite admittedly, a beginning. Now that the culture cat is out of the closet, hopefully, a proper framework for performing arts business specifically will be established soon."},{"Title":"The Wicked Marquis (The Bantam Barbara Cartland Library #10)","review":"Orelia Stanyon is a country girl with little family, only a dying uncle and a wild cousin. One day as she returns from a visit to an ill woman, she is rescued by a mysterious stranger whom she is unable to forget.Months later, her cousin Caroline returns home, announcing an engagement to the Marquis of Ryde. Soon Orelia finds herself on the way to London as a companion to her cousin until the wedding. Upon arriving at the home of the marquis, she is startled to find that her cousin is to marry the very stranger that had rescued her! With being thrown into high society, a plotting Dowager, and her cousin's engagement, the road to love seems lost.This is a wonderful story by Barbara Cartland. There is danger and suspense, love and hate. But as in any Barbara Cartland novel, you know that love will win in the end and order will return to the world."},{"Title":"The Wicked Marquis (The Bantam Barbara Cartland Library #10)","review":"The Wicked Marquis is simply the best book Barbara Cartland has written. It lies on my book shelve held together by tape; worn out from the many hundreds of times I have read it.To put it simply, as in all Barbara Cartland books, girl meets boy, they fall in love and the live happily ever after--Period.It is hard nowdays to find a romance novel that deals with just that-Romance. We, as women know that the best part of love is the getting there. Some would call it the chase, I would call it old fashioned courting...its the magical feeling of falling in love with someone. I think that is what I like most about Barbara Cartland's books. She doesn't concentrate on the sexual encounters, she focuses on the actual romance that sends the heart to all levels of emotion. For me, once a modern day romance novel hits a sexual level, the heart-dropping, butterflies in your stomach feeling of romance ends and it is all down hill from there.A good read, but probably a little old fashioned for some."},{"Title":"The Wicked Marquis (The Bantam Barbara Cartland Library #10)","review":"Saved from drunks by a handsome gentleman, he demands a reward and kisses Orelia, our gentle innocent heroine. Both go on their separate ways yet Orelia cannot forget her savior. Months later, Orelia travels to London with her cousin Caroline. Caroline has lived a rather wild life due to the unhappiness of unrequited love. But Caroline tells Orelia that she is now engaged to a wealthy Marquis of Ryde! Once in London, they remain in the Marquis's home with his mother as their chaperone. The Dowager Duchess turns out to be a nasty villain who really never gets her due in the end.Of course the Marquis turns out to be the man who saved Orelia. But he does not appear to even remember the kiss, as Orelia finds herself falling in love with him. She begins to understand why he has a cold nature, yet is unafraid of him. She expresses her feelings to him and in turn the Marquis begins to open up to her. He eventually tells her the kiss meant everything to him but he must honor his betrothal to her cousin even though neither is in love. It appears to be an unhappy marriage in the making as the wedding day approaches.Although you either love Cartland books or not, I was pleased to find this heroine had a little backbone. Orelia fought for the people she came in contact with, whether it was the Marquis's nephew or just a servant. She stood up for what was right and I think astonished the Marquis with her knowledge and convincing arguments. There are some frightening situations involving a kidnapping and other assorted adventures. This longer Cartland novel allowed for some more situations than are normally in her books.Truly enjoyable and memorable characters."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution","review":"This book is written in a style similar to \\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\", \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" and \\"The Origin of Species\\"--That manner is the machine gun-like statement of fact after fact. Stampp intends to and does limit his discussion to the impact of Black slavery upon Blacks in anAnglo-Saxon world. He does not venture much into arguments that slavery or serfdom existed until the 19th century in Eastern Europe as well as in Africa itself and some of the Arab world. Nor does Stampp tell anything of the great harm done the greater society. He does go into the economics of slavery a bit- enough to see the future. It is quite evident that slavery was on the way out and the Civil War pushed up the date perhaps 10 or 20 years. He does not go much into the moral ambiguity among the White civilization. Thomas Jefferson believed the presence of the Blacks in North America was a mortal danger.Perhaps Stampp has done the best thing in leaving unsaid thetragedy visited upon Western civilization in favor of the tragedy visited upon the slaves, with some small discussion of the \\"why\\" of Black presence and the \\"why\\" of Black slavery.His attention placed as it is lends greater purity to the history. The weakness of the book is any attention to happiness which slaves, perhaps a minority of slaves, enjoyed.This absence tends the book toward a work of propaganda rather than an history. Stampp's book is worth reading. It should not be taken as the whole story, not by a long shot!"},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this book is good. Good, but not to be taken, in my opinion, as the final authority on the subject. Prof. Stampp does not give enough detail concerning his credentials on this subject, and the other thing I object to in general is not that this book exists, but that, like so many others, it concentrates on the institution in the South, and glosses over the role played by our Northern brethren (who btw had much more racist opinions of blacks than southerners at that time as evidenced by their restrictive laws - and why the underground railway ended in Canada and not in a northern state) in buying and transporting these poor souls for profit and fortunes (all of which they and their heirs got to KEEP, not like in the South where all was lost), and the roles played by just about every nation at the time, not to mention the 500 years of slavery the black man suffered under the Islamic rule.Anyone really interested in the subject should be required to read Rawick's 'The American Slave' based on the Slave Narratives which are interviews taken from actual former slaves during the 1930's. This is hearing it from the horses' mouth, so to speak, for the good and bad aspects.Personally, my studies have brought me to believe that if handed the situation of slavery (which of course I would never have permitted in the first place), that immediate freedom ultimately was a great injustice to blacks. Given the situation at hand, blacks today would be much better off had slavery first been regulated so that it could have been gradually phased out in an organized and deliberate manner instead of people being 'turned out to pasture like cattle' with no education, no way of livelihood, and at a time when the entire South (even whites) were hard pressed to make a living. I, myself, could write a book on this subject, but suffice it to say that this is why I believe we have suffering today among blacks that are the result of parentless or fatherless homes, lack of education, lack of respect, and lack of culture. It has only been about 4 or 5 generations since the end of slavery, and the first 3 of these not much progress was made because everyone was living poorly. This is not that long of time to right such a terrible wrong, and the correct and best way of righting it might not have necessarily been to seek the fastest and most immediate."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution","review":"Kenneth Stamp's work demarcates a position in Black and White Studies regarding the efficacies of American slavery. The problem with this book is that it does exactly what slavery did which supposed to be rational and pragmatic but the Enlightenment made more problems than it ever solved.Slavery is one such problem and while Stamp examines the necessity of slavery, suggestions that it \\"evolved\\" rather than was consciously constructed to maximize profit regardless of human consequences to slavers or the enslaved are a complete msireading of what the book and slavery suggests. Stamp's book is a useful piece in the total picture of slavery but it is by NO MEANS the most significant or even the most current.Everything in a canon is not there because it's good. This book is in the canon because of it's succinct economic examination of slavery. As such, Stamp completely neglects to examine racism, the thinking that justified slavery and still exists depsite the fact that plantation slavery no longer exists!"},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution","review":"Stampp's aim in writing this book was not to provide the complete and comprehensive last word on the subject of the American enslavement of Africans and their American descendents, nor to empathize with the oppressed slaves, nor to apologize for slavery, nor to echo the \\"voices\\" of slaves, nor to place it in the context of slavery around the world throughout human history (all of which are worthy topics which have been (and continue to be) addressed by other historians.Stampp's aim was to provide information lacking (in 1955, and still scant fifty years later) as to the nature of the institution itself, AS an American institution (which it certainly was up until its final (and sloppily inefficient) dismantling beginning 1863 (in the midst of the civil war). The \\"Peculiar\\" Insitution (so dubbed by slave owners themselves, in secret (and embarrassed) acknowledgement of the sheer hypocrisy of this institution. Stampp does not attack the morality of slavery, nor does he \\"witness\\" the evils of slavery through statements of slaves or abolitionists (he is not writing a polemic); instead he provides us with something far more useful: empirical data on just what the institution was, how it worked, what its practices were and what putative justifications were offered by its proponents for its existence and nature. In doing so, Stampp gives his readers a far more damning criticism of slavery than any other writer I have encountered since reading Stampp's book for a high school history class in 1969. Stampp expertly strips the subject of the emotion and bias (on both sides) that has obscured the facts (history is distinct from myth and propaganda to the extent that it is about *facts* assembled through valid inferences) about slavery.Some trite but persisting claims about slavery debunked by Stampp are:(1) the myth that all (or even a majority) of Southern whites owned slaves. [A white family had to be fairly well off even to afford owning even one slave; a huge proportion of whites were scarcely better off financially or in terms of workload than were many slaves.](2) the myth that the institution of slavery was in fact predicated upon \\"bettering\\" the lot of Africans, or even \\"taking care of them\\"(the view that blacks were incurably biologically, poltically, socially or otherwise \\"inferior\\" to whites. [Even thoough these arguments for various policies concerning the treatment of slaves were often argued by defenders of the Peculiar Institution, the facts of the actual practice of slave belie both of these claims. Adding up the actual \\"benefits\\" slaveowners offered blacks, the fact is that blacks were not subjected to any sort of \\"improvement\\". (Bible study, as Mark Twain -- still a key observer of the *realities* of slavery! -- served to entertain and enculturate slaves -- even subjugate them as a \\"lower class\\", NOT as moral or social improvement. Policies (actual practices, whatever the rhetoric) toward slaves did NOT lead towards freedom or citizenship at all. (Facts may be cold, as one review pointed out -- but they tend to outweigh rhetoric or sentiment) -- and they are far harder to dismiss or impeach. ](3) in connnection with (2), Stampp's collection of data belies the claim that the typical slaveowner had any education or insight into the \\"care and feeding\\" -- much less mental and moral development -- of Africans. The chapter on the theory and practice of diet and health as applied to slaves alone (a section guaranteed to make the reader physically queasy) says more about not only the awfulness of the institution slavery, but the incredible -- beyond incredible -- ignorance and poor (one could say \\"inferior\\") judgment of slave owners. The myth that slaves were \\"bred\\" (or even captured or bought (usually bought) in Africa) and \\"fed\\" and cared for with even the insight one needed to raise cattle is dispelled by Stampp. An typcial African in Africa, left to fend for his food and health in \\"the uncivilized jungles\\" of the \\"dark continent\\" stood a far bettter chance of living healthily and to a ripe age than the typical American slave (I am not even considering the most highly exploited slaves of the very deep south (or in the \\"island\\") who were literally worked to death -- even \\"well treated slaves\\" were raised and fed and cared in compliance with white superstituions that rivaled any African mystical practices.(4) One of the biggest myths addressed by Stampp is the myth that the slave economy was even a viable alternative to free enterprise (even in the most rudimentary and primitive sense of 'free enterprise' in which the free worker struggled to get work, do work, and earn enough to stay alive. Even if one writes off slaves as having absolutely NO value whatsoever as human beings to society (a direct and flagrant contradiction to the claims of pro-slave moralists -- but that's one of the many \\"peculiarities\\" of the Peculiar Institution!) Stampp provide data to show that as far as economic develop in America was concerned, slavery could be considered at best a poor alternative to other economic systems (not only \\"free enterprise, but even to \\"utopian closed-and-regulated societies, of which there were many then as now), a crutch to be abandoned at the earliest opportunity possible, not a \\"way of life\\", even for white slave owners, much less poor whites (who did NOT benefit from slavery economically, and only generated a sort of class resentment against African-American slaves.)And there are plenty of other insights to be found in this half-century-old book that make it still worth purchasing and reading. This book is rich with balanced, documented facts -- conspicuously missing or undervalued in today's \\"subjective viewpoint historian\\" arguments. A subjective viewpoint -- even one as twisted as that of the advocates and defenders of \\"the Peculiar Institution\\" -- is not easily or effective refuted by another subjective viewpoint. Facts speak for themselves, and Stampp does an excellent job of providing facts which completely undermine the romantic notions (pro and con) of slavery, and showe it for what it was, an inept, ill-conceived, irrational, contradictory, absurd, manifestly unproductive and unfair institution which, if subject to the sort of review institutions these days are accountable to, would never have passed the initial blueprint stage.Two final comments:(1) RE comments other reviewers have made about this book. The use of the word \\"negro\\" (critized by one reviewer as antiquated) in Stampp's 1955 preface, was NOT antiquated in 1955, but a term accepted (even preferred) by most African Americans. Given Stampp's meaning and use of the term, it is still acceptable by all but those persons (of any race) who can some how manage to read through the account of one of the most unbelievably sickening, savage and idiotic institutions in human history and only take offense at the use of the term \\"negro\\", and at a writer who has portrayed a remarkably faithful, accurate, insightful and *useful* look at \\"the land of the free\\" 's most infamous institution, the negative effects of which we (all of us) still feel today.(2) For the would-be reader still not convinced a book of this nature (neither a polemic now an apology, but an empirically based handbook on the pathology of slavery) is good or useful, I highly recommend this book as a useful good in examining the claims of modern-day oppressors (a large number, even if one restricts one's scope to the continent of Africa and the mid-East alone(!) ) that their nations or subcultures are \\"for the greater good\\", despite their differences from present-day American \\"culture\\". Stampp's book provides a methodology for evaluating such spurious claims the would-be sociologist, political scientist, anthropologist or other \\"critic\\" of contemporary human culture is seriously and truthfully and conscientiously attempting to evaluate.RDB"},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution","review":"Professor Stampp's book on American Slavery was published in 1956-- two years after the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v Board of Education and at the beginning of the American Civil Rights Movement. At the time of its publication, the book was recognized as a seminal study of America's &quot;peculiar institution&quot;. Time has not changed the value of the book.The book attacks a picture of the Old South that attained wide currency after Reconstruction and was carried through American culture in works such as, for example, Gone With the Wind-- that plantation slavery was a benign institution, part of an agrarian way of life, that was accepted by both slave and master. Professor Stampp shows that slavery had an economic, commercial basis, that it was resisted by slaves overtly and covertly, and that led to squalor, cruelty and suffering by the slaves. The peculiar institution does not merit sentimintality in any form.In reading the book a half-century after its publication, and with some benefit of having read subsequent studies, I was struck with the moderate tone of the book. Yes, there were humane masters in an inhumane system and yes,there were variants in time and place. Stampp gives these variants their due, perhaps more than modern students would be inclined to do.I was stuck with the tone of slavery's defenders, pre Civil War and thereafter, describing the institution as &quot;patriarchal&quot;. Not only is that description in error, as Stampp shows, but for readers in a time beyond the mid 1950s, it is hardly a compliment to call a society &quot;patriarchal&quot;, even if it deserved this characterization.There has been a great deal of writing since the publication of this book on matters such as the nature of the slave trade, the presence, or lack of it, of an indigenous culture among the slaves, and the economic viability of slavery. These studies add to the picture that Professor Stampp has drawn.This is an essential book for the understanding of our Nation's history. Those looking for an introduction to the Ante-Bellum South could not do better than to read this book."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution","review":"This is a fabulous resource for educators. It is a straight to the point account of slavery. I use it often to teach the Civil War era. It is one of those books that reads like fiction. Super!"},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution","review":"The Peculiar Institution is a detailed, logical book but it does not hold one's interest well. It is difficult to stay focused when attempting to wade through the details. Stampp addresses every issue, including the food eaten by slaves and how they ate it.There is not much prior knowledge expected of the reader. Stampp addresses the information he intends to disprove. For example, he shows that not all slaves wanted to escape their chains since many believed God wanted them to serve their masters.The sources used not only maintained Stampp's credibility, it added perspective. The slave owner's diaries and the diaries of the slaves were utilized and helped project everyone involved as human instead of the monsters they are depicted as in elementary school.It is interesting to take into account the time period in which this book was written, right after Brown v. Board and at the beginning of the civil rights movement. In a time when Gone With the Wind's pro-South sentiment was a popular way to remember the Civil War, Stampp's book must have changed many opinions.Overall, this is a useful history of slavery."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution","review":"In the mid-1950s, Jim Crow was still commonplace in the South, Brown vs. Board of Education made integration mandatory, and blacks refused to move to the \\"back of the bus,\\" leading the United States Supreme Court to condemn Alabama's segregated public transportation. Morrison Professor of History Emeritus at the University of California at Berkeley, and a specialist in nineteenth-century history, Kenneth M. Stampp wrote The Peculiar Institution; Slavery in the Ante-bellum South during the infancy of the civil rights movement. Stampp's book refutes the Gone With the Wind view of the paternalistic slaveowner and his \\"cheerful and acquiescent\\" bondsmen. (86)Southern slaveowners rationalized the ownership of black human beings for more than a century, and with greater vigor as the institution increasingly fell from acceptance in more liberal societies. Pro-slavery writers used \\"religious, historical, scientific, and sociological arguments to demonstrate that slavery was a positive good for both Negroes and whites.\\" (383) Stampp assumes the burden of proof, and meets each of these arguments head-on with irrefutable evidence taken from first person sources: inventories, diaries, newspaper advertisements and editorials, slave narratives, and the personal letters of slaveowners. He finds an \\"important form of protest\\" in the advertisements for runaway slaves, (110) \\"managerial inefficiency\\" not \\"evidence of the unprofitability of slavery\\" in the account books of debt-ridden planters, (391) and heartrending humanity in the letter of one slavewoman who, sold away, begged for her daughter, Jennie, to be restored to her, after their separation. (242)While debaters might quibble about the respective benefits slaves and slaveowners derived from slavery, there can be little debate about the mercenary benefits of the system. Stampp reserves his strongest arguments for his penultimate chapter, Profit and Loss. Slavery's defenders protested that slavery was unprofitable, in an effort to strengthen their claims of benevolent paternalism. The author's careful review of \\"the business records which many masters kept, and in the reports which some prepared for various publications,\\" he finds slave labor produced handsome profits, even for the small owners with just one or two slaves. The average slaveholder had moderate expenses, \\"the annual tax on able-bodied slaves was usually between fifty and seventy-five cents,\\" and with necessary items, such as \\"Negro shoes,\\" selling for a dollar or less, and annual food costs of between $7.50 and $15.00 per slave, the maintenance of a captive labor force seldom exceeded $35.00 a year per slave to the plantation owner. (405-406) Profits ranged from a very comfortable $250 a year per hand in the thriving southwest of the 1850s, to the Deep South where slaveholders seldom failed to reap returns of seven to ten percent annually. The bottom line is slavery was profitable, and continued to be profitable until emancipation. If free labor, or divestment of slaves and land, had proven itself to be a more profitable venture, surely the \\"peculiar institution\\" would have found few adherents.A more honest book on the slave experience had likely never been written when Kenneth Stampp took up the task. In his well-written and exhaustive history, he re-affirms the historian's \\"article of faith that knowledge of the past is a key to understanding the present.\\" In the preface, written in 1955, Stampp acknowledges that \\"American Negroes . . . still strive to break what remains of the caste barriers first imposed upon them in slavery days.\\" (vii) More than fifty years later this book is still relevant, and deserves to be called a classic of antebellum American History."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution","review":"One of the main reasons I picked up The Peculiar Institution was to learn why a nation that was founded on the basis of a popular government would then turn around and aggressively import African slaves. The book tells of the creation of the institution of slavery in the New World as something that evolved, rather than something that European settlers consciously constructed.It also does a good job of discussing the demographics and economics of slavery. Only a small number of white people in the south owned slaves, and those that did usually owned just one. Yet, because ownership of the vast majority of slaves was concentrated in the hands of a few, most slaves lived on huge plantations. Because slave labor was so cheap, business managers would frequently choose to buy or lease out slaves for work. This forced free labor to compete with the slaves for jobs and wages declined.These portions of the book are utterly fascinating, and I couldn't put the book down. However, there was a bit more than I really cared to know about the average diet of slaves, and it seemed to belabor the rather obvious fact that free whites were usually able to commit violent crimes against black slaves with impunity. In these sections the book dragged a bit, and I felt that the author would have done the reader a favor by cutting a few of the 400+ pages."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution","review":"If you are a \\"lay reader\\" first venturing into a study of Southern slavery, then this may not be the place to start. However, for scholars, students, and those with a foundation in the topic, Stampp's \\"Peculiar Institution\\" is a must-read.Admittedly, his writing is deep, yet it is vital and relevant. Stamp is a myth-buster busting myths with first-hand quotes, statistics, and primary sources.

The controversial line in the Preface, \\"...Negroes are, after all, only white men with black skins\\" obviously falls short in terms of culture, identity and power relations. But back in 1956, asserting equality among peoples was a big advance in understanding compared to Ulrich Phillips' work. Exhaustively using the same kinds of plantation sources as Phillips, Stampp revived the neo-abolitionist interpretation and reshaped our view of US slavery, crafting a book that remains the essential starting point for all later work. Further advances built upon this achievement, notably by using direct slave testimony (personal narratives, the WPA oral histories), but the perspective of later studies such as J. Blassingame, \\"The Slave Community\\" and E. Genovese, \\"Roll Jordan Roll\\" is similarly sympathetic to those held in bondage. The other main shortcoming is that Stampp deals mostly with the 1830-60 period while assuming it represented the overall experience of American enslavement, which it did not. It is still a monument of 20th-century historiography by any standard."},{"Title":"The Peculiar Institution","review":"This work was a turning point in historiography of slavery in America.

While there are some other good works out there, theya re few and far between, and many are not translated into English-which is a shame.I realize that there may some material for scholars to pick at, but I do feel that the author has sourced her material well, and does offer alternative viewpoints, as well as mention when there are difficulties in proving certian theories. The fact that she is apparently a feminist as some sort of come down for the book doesn't hold water with me. The same could be said for many male historians, as the roles of women and their significance is often ignored.The book does cover a very large time period-about 1500 years, but I feel does an excellent job in looking at the social, cultural, and legal expectations for women, and how those roles changed over time, and between societies. In some ways it is darker than imagined, and others far more hopeful, as demonstrated by some of her focus on the women of Pompeii, and the evidence of their wealth, independence, and individuality. Some of the more famous women are covered, and their activites placed into context.Perosnally, if there was a book that belong in all Ancient Civ/Western Civ surveys or introductory classes, I beleiev unequivocally that this is one of them. I felt that way in highschool, and I feel that way today."},{"Title":"Goddesses, Whores, Wives and Slaves","review":"Grim picture of the status of women in Greek and Roman society. A scientific exploration based on classical marriage contracts, legal and medical texts, demographic data (on female infanticide) and philosophical and literary works (Plato, Aristoteles, Homeros and others).The status of Aspasia (Pericles' hetaera) was an exception. Women were confined to the domestic sphere, totally inferior to men and the subject of systematic misogyny by poets and philosophers.The author also elucidates why the Isis cult was persecuted by emperor Tiberius.This is a model study. A necessary work not to be missed by readers interested in classical history. It is a look at that section of ancient culture that didn't take part in philosophical discussions or political decision making, but that composed the majority on which the first democracy - for a minority - was built. Work by Catherine Salles and Bettina Eva Stumpp on the same subject is also a compelling read."},{"Title":"Goddesses, Whores, Wives and Slaves","review":"The author does provide good information on the status of women in the ancient world, but has some completely baseless theories. She tries to juxtapose the masculine Persian god Mithras with the feminine god Isis, claiming Isis was supressed and Mithras welcomed. The problem is, Mithrism, after Christianity and Judaism, was persecuted heaviest because it was though to indicate loyalty to Persia, Rome's enemy. Isis, on the other hand, after some early initial efforts to ban all foreign religions, was fully tolerated. It saw nothing like the persecution the other three religions saw. Also, she overstates Isis as a feminist figure. Most papyrus quotes from ancient Egypt have her worshiped as a traditional wife and mother goddess. All she has as proof of her contention that wasn't so is one Oxyrhyncus papyrus quote and a quote from the always unreliable Diodorus."},{"Title":"Goddesses, Whores, Wives and Slaves","review":"_Goddess, Whores, Wives and Slaves_ was originally written because, in Pomeroy's words, \\"most of the standard references in the field of Classics did not include women in their purview.... major works ... (had) splendidly detailed indexes, but (none of them had) an entry for 'Women.'\\" It is precisely because of works such as this - and the efforts of professors like Pomeroy, this is no longer the case. The discipline of history and its students are richer and better for it.In examining the role of women in ancient Greece and Rome, the historian faces a number of challenges, not the least being the relative lack of primary work by women, but also the relative dearth of women as the subject of classical authors. As a result, much must be inferred (albeit historically and textually supported) from what works we have. Pomeroy does a magnificent job of examining the roles, social mores and attitudes of ancient Greeks and Romans from a wide variety of sources: myths, art, literature and polemical tracts.Pomeroy begins her study by closely considering the way in which female deities were portrayed in Greek myths. This fascinated me. For example, I had never thought of the creation story of Athena as significant or telling in terms of gender. That Athena was born out of Zeus' head (without any participation of woman), that she is the most \\"masculine\\" of female dieties (as goddess of both wisdom and warfare), and also the most prominent female deity in ancient Greece - perhaps as a result of all this - got me to see and think about issues of gender in the ancient world in a new and different way.Similarly, the role and place of women as reinforced through literature was explored, from the portrayal of Helen inThe Iliad (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)and Penelope inThe Odyssey (Penguin Classics Deluxe Editio), to Socrates' banishment of Xanthippe at his execution, and Plato's consideration of women inThe Republic.Her analysis of role of hetairia, often seen as the most \\"liberated\\" of ancient Greek women, (If Not, Winter: Fragments of Sappho) also caused me to reconsider their place for, as Pomeroy put it, \\"The hetaira had access to the intellectual life of Athens, which we nowadays treasure ... but the fact that we know of some courtesans who attempted to live as respectable wives, while we know of no citizen wives who wished to be courtesans should make us reconsider the question of which was the preferrable role in Classical Athens.\\"Turning her attention to women in Rome, Pomeroy spends a great deal of time examining women of the upper classes (the sisters and wives of Emperors in particualr) - primarily because of the wealth of information about themThe Satyricon and The Apocolocyntosis of the Divine Claudius (Penguin Classics),Cicero: Ancient Classics for English Readers,The Twelve Caesars (Penguin Classics)); this was of less interest to me than her discussion of women of the lower classes, but it was fascinating nonetheless. The only point I could take issue with was that I wish she had explored the role of women in the early Church in her chapter on \\"Women in the Religion of the Romans.\\" Where the Classical period ends and the early middle ages begins, however, is grey, so I cannot fault her for that.Given that women are half of the population, it has long been a disservice that their role and place in history has not been explored, taught and celebrated to the extent that it should be. Pomeroy's book is one of the seminal works that has reversed this trend (as any cursory look in the index of a history text under \\"women\\" will show). It is tremendous scholarship, well written. For any student of history, I would recommend it. For those studying the Classics, this is a \\"must have\\" text."},{"Title":"Goddesses, Whores, Wives and Slaves","review":"I think this book opens up a lot of questions for further discussion.

It really gets you thinking."},{"Title":"Stars fell on Alabama","review":"Before Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, Carl Carmer took a train from New York to Alabama to become a college professor, writing of a strange country he visited and returned from, as different as another planet for his known world. He roamed and wrote of the cornwhisky- swilling backwatersof Alabama and the rough-hewn urban centers like Birmingham during the 20s and early 30s -- the time of the Scottsboro boys, the Klux Klan in its first great revival, deep oral and cultural traditions among Alabama African Americans including the title, inspiration for the 30s pop song about a meteor shower more than a century before.. The Civil War veteran turned murderer of U.S. marshals and religious zealot -- lynched to avoid a trial and certain execution -- before Jim Jones and Waco.The great outlaws and train robbers, Rube Burrow and Railroad Bill, one white, the other black and so feared his body was displayed in several cities to prove he was dead. A period piece -- the N word is used-- it also paints a picture of a complex and diverse black community, its cultural and folk roots, its white relationships. Many Alabama natives, including this expatriate, would not know these tales but for Carmer who returned to New York to write about that state and area for decades more But his Alabama is Sleepy Hollow with a bite like &quot;Two-toed Tom&quot; the 15 foot gator trapped in a pond by stalkers only to find him surfacing in a nearby pond, devouring a 12 year old child, decades before scientists learned of the ancient underwater tunnels of the reptiles. Tom moved on to become a legend in Florida where he's still talked about just as Carmer's retelling of the great tales lives on in Alabama, too often without his name attached. Sometimes a bizarre mixture of charm and horror, and perhaps a bit of hyperbole, Stars Fell on Alabama is one of those Academic reprints that reminds us the past is never so simple as we might dream and that the man with manners is to be as feared as the trainrobber with a gun"},{"Title":"Stars fell on Alabama","review":"Reading \\"Stars Fell on Alabama\\" brings to mind lines from the opening scenes of \\"Gone With The Wind,\\" lines that said something like \\"look for them (these days)no more because they are gone with the wind...\\" The same could be said of the Alabama described in Carl Carmer's book.The days of Margaret Mitchell's classic \\"Gone With the Wind\\" never really existed, at least not in the romanticized way in which she wrote about them, but the days described in \\"Stars Fell on Alabama\\" did happen. They did, unfortunately, exist, but thankfully, for the most part, they, too, are noe \\"gone with the wind...\\"This book is about life, a cross section of real life in the terribly rural South from about 1921 through 1927. It was not a pretty time or an easy time, and these are not quaint, pretty sketches of life during that time. The innocent, naive and politically correct reader of today might find parts of this book, most of it actually, quite offensive. And rightly so. But these times, these days and these ways, did exist. And they put life in today's Alabama into perspective.It is clear to a reader living in Alabama that the state has progressed far more in the last 75 years (1930-2005) than it did in the 75 years immediately after the Civil War (1865-1940). That may be true for the country as a whole, but it is especially true for Alabama. Many intellectuals and scholars cite this book as one of the points at which this progress began. As Howell Raines writes in his introduction (added in 1990) this book was one of the first times Alabamians read about themselves as others saw them. It was not a pretty picture, not all bad not all ugly, but for the most part, it was not how Alabamians felt about themselves and not how they wanted their state--and themselves--to be perceived by those outside the state. To be sure, there was some beauty among the thorns, but it was a racist time and the thorns greatly outnumbered the rosebuds. There are no memories of the grand and glorious \\"Lost Cause\\" in these pages. Any and everything but.Speaking of Howell Raines' introduction, it would be far more useful and appropriate as an Afterword or Epilogue. In this book it would be better to put what you have read in perspective than to write about what you are going to read. That's not true for all books, but it is true for this book.In the hours after finishing \\"Stars Fell on Alabama,\\" two thoughts come to mind again and again:--\\"We may not be where we ought to be, but, thank God and by the grace of God, we aren't where we used to be...\\"--And this book was obviously written before football took over the University of Alabama (where Carmer taught for six years) and the state as a whole. Football is never mentionied, either during his time in Tuscaloosa, or in his travels around the state. Not once. In that respect, life in Alabama has certainly changed. But even now, there are racial overtones in the rivalry between Alabama and Auburn. But that is another story for another time.If you are from Alabama, live in Alabama,or want to learn about the rural South as it was in the twenties and thirties, read the book. You will learn from it and you will enjoy it. Parts of it will make you cringe but it will be a learning experience. And learning is good, even if you don't appreciate and agree with all that you learn or are exposed to."},{"Title":"Stars fell on Alabama","review":"To properly understand history, you must be able to accept all aspects of your topic, good, bad, and all shadings in between, as sources of information and for enrichment of your knowledge. History rarely conforms to our personal view of the world, for there are so many factors which are beyond our control. So it is with Stars Fell on Alabama. The South was no friend to anyone but itself, and this book gives the reader, no matter what their background, an honest, sometimes raw, sometimes fantastic, sometimes poignant, picture of what a part of the South was like for everyone, black and white, and that is its value to anyone who read it and especially to anyone who uses it to teach about the South."},{"Title":"Stars fell on Alabama","review":"As someone who grew up in western New York, I had been aware of Carl Carmer's other books like Listen for a Lonesome Drum, The Hudson, and The Farm Boy and the Angel. However, I had never heard of Stars Fell on Alabama until I saw the license plates that the state of Alabama put out in the beginning years of the new century. It was only when I did some digging around that I found out that it was based on Carmer's book. It was only recently that I finally got around to buying it and reading it. I had tried reading some of his material before and found it to be rather boring. Thus, I was expecting the same. Not necessarily with this one.The book deals quite a bit with what the former University of Alabama professor had experienced during his time in the state of Alabama. Even though he lived down there for six years and eventually returned to his native New York State, he saw much during his time. He witnessed a Ku Klux Klan meeting (off in the distance), a fiddler's contest, a lynching, and the treatment (both good and bad) of what were called Negroes back in that day and age. At the same time, he also came into contact with legends and folklore from both blacks and whites. His descriptions of places like Birmingham and Mobile were quite fascinating - even in that day and age.I have to wonder what his thoughts of Alabama would have been in the 1960's and beyond. What has probably been burned in people's minds is the struggle that blacks for with regard to civil rights. However, I would not be surprised if there were instances where people were colorblind and got along with each other side by side - contrary to the stereotypes we've been told.Overall, Carmer's book was quite fascinating. Folklore is not exactly my cup of tea, but Carmer did manage to hold my attention with this book. Whether one agrees with the way he wrote the book or not, it still is worth reading to get a taste of the culture and events going on in everyday Alabama back when he lived there."},{"Title":"Stars fell on Alabama","review":"I often wondered why falling stars appeared on Alabama license plates and why Dylan sang about the same. Ultimately I found my way to this book, written by Carl Carmer over 60 years ago. The answer to my original questions are within the book. The forward is perhaps more interesting and revealing, exposing the strength and Achilles heal of Carmer's work. Carmer was writing about the Alabama he experienced at the time he resided there. It is a snapshot of history and was very controversial when originally printed. So, it has some literary and historical value. However, many of the characters and incidents are composed of amalgamated individuals and conglomerated incidents. So, it is more representational like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn than an accurate recounting of actual events. Allegedly, Carmer was trying to mask actual places and people to protect their privacy but it left me questioning the authenticity and veracity of the whole. It took the edge off, making the book much less appealing and leaving me disinterested in places. Is it fiction or non-fiction? Is it exaggerated or not? How much to rely on this thin ice is what the reader will have to consider and that will be a distraction throughout."},{"Title":"Stars fell on Alabama","review":"The author apparently spent six years in Alabama in the late twenties and early thirties. He made various trips around Alabama and relates stories he heard from people. He was at Decatur, Ala., at the time the second Scottsboro trial was about to be held. He relates comments by people he talked to about the trial and the comments are a sad picture into the racism rampant in Alabama in those years. The book uses the n word without any qualms, and tho the author does not appear to approve of the Jim Crow way of life his condemnation is absent. I did not appreciate this dated book, which in 1934 was a best seller."},{"Title":"The Unofficial Guide to Minding Your Money","review":"17 Chapters of pure financial literacy at its best.The focus of this book is to offer the reader options that they can use to assist them in becoming financially free.Included in the book is a great resource guide, and recommended reading list.Get this book if your interested in the following:Vital information on examining your own financial habits, patterns, and attitudes.Insider secrets on turning back the tide of debt as quickly as and painlessly as possible.Money saving techniques on maintaining financial freedom through all of the stages of life.Time saving tips on spending wisely, saving smartly, and investing safely.The latest trends in how to survive financial setbacks and stay financially free.Handy checklists and charts for organizing your debts, scheduling payments, avoiding late fees, and much more.I strongly recommend this book for the person wanting a manual on their finances."},{"Title":"Unprintable songs from the Ozarks (Photoduplication of original manuscript)","review":"This book will capture your interest and will leave you hanging with more questions. If your interest is in the field of archaeology, etc, you will probably want to \\"pass by, Horseman.\\" However, if you're like me and you just want to know what was happening to the average peasant and believer on the banks of the River of history, then this book is for you. G. Moorehouse, does a smash up job of bringing to life the spirit of the Celtic monks who changed the world. The book is divided into two parts: the first being a \\"faction\\", that is a historically accurate fictional account of day to day life in the monastery of Sceilig Michail. In this section, he attempts to penetrate the Celtic mind and I have to give him credit for this. If in any way, he failed, it is only because the truly Celtic Christian mind was lost to us after the Great Schism of 1054 and after their valiant and heroic resistance, Eire finally fell to the Roman church. (We should all mourn what might have been contributed to Byzantium because it is the less for all that!)The second section deals in the facts, insofar as they are known, and as cold as the stones that pious Celtic hands pressed into service, to build the monasteries of Iona, Lindisfarne, Sceilig Michail. The bibliography alone is worth every penny, the price of the book and I highly recommend it as much for Mr. Moorehouse's attempt to plumb the depths of the celtic Christian heart, as for it's more scholarly attributes.If you're looking for new age nonsense about \\"Celtic\\" spirituality, move on. If you are looking for the Orthodoxy (big O intended) of the Celts, you've come to the right place. Moorehouse skirts the issue, and never directly says it outright, but the message of this book is loud and clear: The origin of Celtic Christianity lies in the East, with Eastern Orthodoxy and not with Roman pontiffs. Nobody, with any knowledge will fail to recognize the obvious: St. John Cassian's prayer and method of use (pre-cursor of the Jesus prayer), the monastic cell rules, the ascetism of St. Anthony and other Desert Fathers.In the end, what one is left with is this: Iona, Lindisfarne, and Sceilig Michail are not so far away as they may appear in the mist. They may, and must, be re-built each day in our own hearts with a Christianity that is Orthodox and that is lived each day, without fail."},{"Title":"Unprintable songs from the Ozarks (Photoduplication of original manuscript)","review":"If you've ever stood on the rocks of Skellig Michael, or peered at them from safe ground across the tossing waves, you've thought to yourself, &quot;only crazy people and seagulls would live there&quot;. You would be wrong - passionate maybe, maybe not crazy. This story of the monks on Skellig Michael, part history, part fiction, speaks of the loneliness and of being alone - which are not the same things - and the astonishing strength that can come from the most unexpected places when one person or a group of people who share a focus come together. Even the early pages that detail the types of ink used in the glorious illuminated manuscripts of Clanmacnoise draw you into this passion and this focus. It's an incredible story of life on a rock in the middle of nowhere that provided a continuous line of education and religion (like it or not) in a time beyond our imagination."},{"Title":"Unprintable songs from the Ozarks (Photoduplication of original manuscript)","review":"Sun Dancing is a fascinating look at this period of Irish history. The arrangment of the fictionalized account, backed by in-depth commentaries in the second half is novel and a joyful way to present the materials gathered.

This gave me a fundamental problem in getting into the book. The first half is decently written and attempts to get in the heads of various Irish monks in the Middle Ages, the second half provides the facts to back up the conjecture of the first. I preferred the second half, though that may be because I tend to enjoy my history a bit harder than most. I just didn't like the structure of the book. To me, what this book really is is a novella about an Irish Monastery on a rocky island with a novella-sized end note section. The end notes were more relevant for research. I don't question the scholarship of the work, just the presentation. Overall, not bad, but if you can get past the strange way it's put together (unlike me) you'll probably enjoy it."},{"Title":"Unprintable songs from the Ozarks (Photoduplication of original manuscript)","review":"Skellig Michael (Michael's Rock) is a tiny, steep, pinnacle of an island off the coast of Ireland. For 600 years during the early middle ages, it served as a Celtic Monastery. Travel writer Geoffrey Moorhouse tells of the rigors of the isolated lives of the monks, via an imaginative, partly fictional reconstruction of key experiences such as surviving Viking raids, existence in a bare stone beehive hut, and preserving the essence of Celtic Christianity, away from the tentacles of Rome.The second half of the book is more scholarly but drier and less engaging. Nevertheless, Skellig Michael by its remoteness has remained relatively unchanged, and the evidence that researchers have been gathering from it has been aptly elucidated by Moorhouse; a valuable snapshot of Christianity in one of its variant early forms."},{"Title":"Unprintable songs from the Ozarks (Photoduplication of original manuscript)","review":"This book's best quality is that it lacks the pretension of Cahill's &quot;How the Irish Saved Civilization.&quot; We see the Irish monks' lives at close range, in much detail and with sympathy. The monks are not portrayed as kooks but as devotees of Christ who expected His return at any minute."},{"Title":"Unprintable songs from the Ozarks (Photoduplication of original manuscript)","review":"Anyone who visits Ireland's haunting Skellig Islands asks themselves the same question: What have life must have been like for the incredibly dedicated monks who, for hundreds of years, inhabited one of the most isolated, forbidding, harshest, difficult places on earth?Moorhouse answers this question well with a brilliantly conceived historical novel, which explores not only how these men lived, but also why they chose such a difficult life. The picture Moorhouse paints of daily life is detailed and, one has to conclude, highly accurate. Even more moving, though, are the characters he develops and the insights into what must have been in the minds of men who sacrificed all for a faith that was tested 24 hours a day.Unlike many historical novels, Sun Dancing is not overly simplistic, its characters are not flat and transparent. What could possibly drive men to survive near starvation, Viking raids, a brutal climate, and isolation that would drive many mad? Read this book, and you will begin to understand.It is not a book about Ireland; it is a book about what human beings will do--and endure--in the name of their faith. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Unprintable songs from the Ozarks (Photoduplication of original manuscript)","review":"Who would ever connect the title SUN DANCING with Irish Monasticism lived out on what has the be one of the bleakest, most forbidding islands in the world? The book is a riveting story of how monks lived on that island and the scholarly evidence to prove that the story is pretty much what happened at that time. It was a much more severe type of monasticism that developed independently of traditional Western monasticism based on the Rule of St. Benedict.A must read for those looking for heroes that live by deep faith."},{"Title":"Unprintable songs from the Ozarks (Photoduplication of original manuscript)","review":"After visiting Skellig Michael, I wanted to know why!

Even now, with children of my own, I find this book very readable. Serenity Ross is nineteen years old, a college student majoring in elementary ed (but longing to major in art history) who is engaged to be married to Peter Holland, a fellow student who is seeking to better understand the world into which he will become a man. Serenity's parents, middle-aged middle-class suburbanites, hide their true feelings about their daughter's marriage by planning a real dog-and-pony show; but the bride herself feels a yearning for something more meaningful than a big church wedding and country-club reception. This yearning leads her on a weekend visit to Oliver Otis, her father's cousin, and his wife, Daphne, in rural Rhode Island. The visit is only the first step for Serenity on a journey -- of self-discovery, and an exploration of her family's spiritual roots --on which she is joined by Peter and, eventually, her parents as well. The Otises are members of the Society of Friends, better known as the Quakers, and it is their ability to look honestly at life and see the good in it that guides Serenity and Peter on their way. But don't think that these are two-dimensional characters, oozing with saccharine sweetness and dispensing glib advice; Daisy Newman, the author and herself a member of the Society of Friends, draws them with loving but unflinching honesty. Oliver is a bit of a neat freak who likes things to be just so, and Daphne -- left unable to speak by a stroke -- struggles with anger when her eyes and her expressions are not enough to convey her thoughts to those around her. Their relationship with their daughter, Heather, who is married and lives a life of urban sophistication in London, is a lesson in miscommunication, and reminds us that even those we look up to in life are capable of making mistakes and handling things badly. If you know young people who are trying to find and express their genuine selves in this crazy, fast, shallow world, this book is terrific. Heck, if you're no longer young but looking for a good read to remind you that the best things in life are free, you won't go wrong here. (Be aware, however, that one of the issues Serenity and Peter confront is pre-marital sex -- definitely PG rated, no details or graphic descriptions, but it does occur and the question of &quot;Should we, shouldn't we?&quot; is a key component of the theme of the book. Kids 12 and older should be able to handle it very well.)"},{"Title":"I Take Thee Serenity","review":"Quite a few years ago, I discovered the Daisy Newman when I picked up a copy of \\"Diligence in Love\\" at a flea market or library book sale. This story of a driven businesswoman who encounters Quakers while researching an advertising campaign impressed me. I had heard of Quakers but never really knew anything about them or their religion. This gentle way of life appealed to me and I made it a point to search out other titles by this author. I just recently happened across \\"I Take Thee, Serenity\\" in my bookcase and re-read it, to be touched anew.Written in 1975, the premise of this book would now be considered old-fashioned. Serenity Ross is an independent 19-year-old in love with Peter Holland and quite content to have a sexual relationship with him while away at college. Suspecting this, her parents decide that it is best to have the two young people get married. Feeling pushed into a wedding that is taking on circus-like proportions and inspired by the picture of a Quaker wedding hanging in her parents' home, Serenity flees to her father's old family home near Kendal, Rhode Island to step back and take stock. There, she meets her elderly Quaker cousin, Oliver Otis, and his wife, Daphne, who help her to look into herself and her relationship with Peter and realize that their marriage will effect not only them but all of the people who love them.This journey of self-discovery can't help but touch the reader.

Although different characters appear in each tale, the collection as a whole is unified by style and by theme. Each story deals with an encounter or ongoing relationship between a human being and one or more non-human animals. Since the book is only 81 pages long, each tale is quite brief.This is a gentle, moving book. Rylant has a gift for capturing resonant details. She also writes with great compassion for both her human and non-human characters. Her non-human characters come in many different species: a turtle, dogs, a parrot, squirrels, and more. Her human characters are also diverse: both adults and children, both male and female. I found one of the most memorable characters to be an alcoholic wartime veteran (from \\"Drying Out\\").My overall favorite story in the collection, \\"A Pet,\\" is about a girl who becomes the owner of a blind old goldfish.

These stories will capture the interest of my students while I use them as a fabulous teaching tool."},{"Title":"Every living thing","review":"Have you ever loved your pet even if you had to let it go? In the story \\"A Pet\\" by Cynthia Rylant, Emma begged so hard for a Christmas pet but it was old blind and used. On other days he lazily, barely moved his fins. He became ill and Emma tried to help him by giving him two pills and would whisper please. One day she woke up and he was...I had a pet that was a goldfish but it was sick because it was old. In the story Emma's pet was sick. It was Christmas and it almost but tried to keep going but it couldn't .I also tried to get medicine and in the story Emma got medicine for her goldfish too.I give it 10 out of 10 because I love this and I have lots of connection with it. I also love how they feel because Emma started crying and was happy when she got her pet. I also love how it used a lot of detail in the story. They showed how Emma had an old, blind, and used goldfish. By: JazminIf you like puppies you would like this story \\"Stray\\" by Cynthia Rylant. It has lots of detail and shows you how a puppy suffers when it has no shelter. Stray is just like a homeless person but only a dog.The story Stray is about a stray dog looking for food . One day a girl named Doris found a little dog out in the cold and that little dog was freezing. So the little girl took the puppy inside and asked her father if she could keep him and guess what he said, \\"NO!\\". The only thing he said was that the puppy was going straight to the pound tomorrow...The heart of the story was love your pet even if it has to go to the pound.This story reminds me of when I was in the car and I saw a stray dog. Doris was outside scraping out the snow and she saw a stray dog trapped in the snow.I give this story a ten out of ten because you could visualize how the puppy was trapped in the snow and how Doris was scraping off the sidewalk from the snow. By JulyssaHave you ever seen a stray? Well in the story \\"Stray\\" by Cythia Rylant, it all started on a cold day shoveling out snow and this girl saw a dog walking down the road toward the Lacey's small house. It's ears tucked, it's tail between it's legs shivering and she called it and took it inside . Her parents decided that ...This story reminds me of when I got my first dog.I like this story because it's a great story and I have memories of me and my dog . I give this story a 10 out of 10 because it reminds me of my dog playing together and she's really playful all the time! She loves playing fetch and her favorite toy is a rope to play tug of war! Some people may think she's mad but I think she's a great dog and I love her . Just like Doris loved her stray.

For what this book can accomplish, it is excellent.WARNING: This is not a beginning grammar for our generation; it presupposes a knowledge of Latin. It is also not a \\"self-teaching\\" text. Don't buy this if a) you are a teacher and it is the only book you want to use in the classroom or b) you want to teach yourself Greek. It is not ideal for either of these.That said, it is a great book for two main purposes.The first is for the student who wants to brush up on grammar and paradigms as well as get an introduction to an anthology of Ancient Greek. The majority of the book consists of short excerpts from Greek Literature. There are several other sections in the back. The first is a short set of lessons and exercises to enable the student to brush up on his/her grammar. The second section is a concise Greek Grammar. Then there is a section with the principle parts of common irregular verbs. Finally there is a short vocabulary including all the words used in all the stories.The second is for a teacher at a high school level who wants to switch texts in the second or third year of Greek. I'll speak from experience. I teach from \\"Athenaze\\" and we go through chapters 1-24 in the first two years. But then, in the third year, my goal is to get students 1) a review of grammar 2) a basic vocabulary and 3) a reading knowledge of authentic Greek. By their third year, many students have trouble remembering some of the vocabulary in chapters 1-24 in Greek. To remedy this, I plan on using the vocabulary lists from the exercises of \\"Greek through Reading\\", review the grammatical concepts introduced, and read/write the Greek exercises. Then, as we have time, I plan on reading the excerpts, starting from easiest to most difficult and discussing the grammar.Using this book requires a lot of planning and it is not (except in rare instances) useful as an introduction to Greek. Nevertheless, I highly recommend it.Other suggestions for an Intermediate Greek class:\\"Colson's Greek Reader\\" [as a supplement of graded reading]Vis-Ed's Blank Flashcards [for keeping students' vocabulary organized]Oxford Grammar of Classical Greek [the best \\"pocket\\" Greek Grammar]"},{"Title":"Peacemakers","review":": Very interesting story as are all of J.

It is simply a wonderful read. From the telling of this story, I have learned about the Jewish faith and it's Passover and also about the belief they have in the coming of their &quot;Messiah&quot; which is prophesized throughout the Torah. After being a Sunday School teacher for 17 years, this says alot for the Thoene's. However, I did not just read this for it's biblical sense alone, I read it for it's characters too.

I was disappointed.I had a difficult time finishing it."},{"Title":"Jerusalem's Hope (Zion Legacy)","review":"The sixth volume in the series picks up exactly where the last (STONES OF JERUSALEM) left off. Yeshua sends the three &quot;Sparrows,&quot; Emet, Ha-or, and Avel, off with a message for Zadok, who takes them in and begins to teach them the ways of a shepherd in Bethlehem. Meanwhile, the political situation in Jerusalem over the use of temple money to build a Roman aqueduct heats up, trapping the shepherds as well as Marcus and Nakdimon in the cross fire. Will the situation erupt during Passover? Will Yeshua show up? If so, will he be in danger? And exactly who is he anyway?This is the third break in the 1948 storyline in the series. While I've enjoyed the look at 1st century Israel, I still want to know more about Moshe, Rachel, and the other characters we started the series with. But that's my only complaint.The books set in the 1st century are different from normal Thoene books because the focus is more on emotional struggles and the political battles take a back seat. As always, the historical research is outstanding, transporting the reader completely to another time and place. The Thoene's once again weave powerful word pictures from the story that clearly show what Jesus did for us.While I'm sorry to leave the 1948 storyline behind, I'm anxious for their new series to start as it continues the story of Yeshua and his followers."},{"Title":"Jerusalem's Hope (Zion Legacy)","review":"The Thoenes have done it again with another superb book. Although Yeshua does not appear as often in this book as he does in the previous books, the message that the authors are trying to convey is still clear: to show why the picture of Christ as a lamb was so important to the Israelites. The point at which little Emet realizes that the lamb must die to atone for sins is amazing, and again brought tears to my eyes, as have so many passages in the previous books. This book does leave the reader hanging at the end, because not much mention is made of what is going to happen to Yeshua. Yet, I think this provides an excellent segue for the next series which the Thoenes will be writing, the A.D. Chronicles, which will tell the story of the last year of Yeshua's ministry here on earth.

The scroll contains a story about ancient Jerusalem during the reign of Rome. Pontius Pilate is governor of the area and has sent Marcus the centurion to oversee the water aqueduct that is being built for Jerusalem's benefit. The people in Jerusalem are against this aqueduct because of use of the Korban money (used to support the temple in Jerusalem). Nakdamion is on the Sanhedrin council but was asked to research the claims of Yeshua and whether they are true or not? He meets three orphans Emet, Avel, and H-or Tov who are sent to Zadok. They have a special message for him. Will the events that are about to occur keep them from giving Zadok the message? Will events escalate with the aqueduct?My Thoughts:I felt this book was okay and kept my interest. I did read it a little out of order in the series. This story takes place in ancient past. I would recommend using this series to study for daily quiet time study. The authors of this series are known for seamlessly going from one series to the next. This whole series is to prepare you for the one of their current series The AD Chronicles. Once you have read this book you will understand the purpose of The AD Chronicles.What would you do to protect what you believe? Would you step out in faith to deliver a message?

Addressing the reader in personable Victorian fashion, his prose is clear and beautiful. Consider this sample:&quot;Within the verge of the wood there were columbines, looking more pale than red, because they were so modest, and had thought proper to seclude themselves too anxiously from the sun. There were wild geraniums, too, and a thousand white blossoms of the strawberry. The trailing arbutus was not yet quite out of bloom; but it hid its precious flowers under the last year's withered forest-leaves, as carefully as a mother-bird hides its little young ones.&quot;But Hawthorne is also equal to the task of less genteel, more vigorous images:&quot;At this sound the three heads reared themselves erect, and belched out great flashes of flame. Before Bellerophon had time to consider what to do next, the monster flung itself out of the cavern and sprung straight toward him, with its immense claws extended, and its snaky tail twisting itself venomously behind.&quot;Adding to the pleasure of these retold tales is the gorgeous art of Arthur Rackham, both in black-and-white drawings and full-color plates, which captures the unearthly beauty and the unexpectedly surprising humor of Hawthorne's work. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys","review":"Once upon a time (I was about 8), a family friend handed down his Collier's Junior Classic series to me - each volume is a glorious hodgepodge of short stories from here, there, and everywhere. I got to be very fond of Greek mythology, especially \\"The Chimaera\\" and \\"The Miraculous Pitcher\\", since the Collier retellings of their respective legends were much more lively than the ordinary.Alas, I forgot the name of the author of \\"The Chimaera\\", and even that my favourite versions of the myths were all written by the same person. Some talented guy writing for the series, no doubt, I would have said, if I'd thought about it. A couple of years ago, I started browsing through an impressive-looking illustrated volume of mythology in a bookstore (which you now see before you). Whoa. \\"Scarlet Letter\\" Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote *THESE*?His retellings of Greek myths were originally spread over 2 volumes (the other being _Tanglewood Tales_), but they can be obtained in a single volume these days. I can personally do without the gang of Tanglewood kids providing the official audience for the stories-within-a-story, or the defense against critics put into the mouth of the storyteller Eustace Bright, but then I want more space for more myths. :) Each myth in _A Wonder Book_ has an Introductory and After the Story section where the storyteller leads up to the tale, then fends off any awkward questions from his young audience.\\"The Gorgon's Head\\" - The story of Perseus, from his infancy through the quest for Medusa's head. Hawthorne skates delicately past the question of who put Perseus and his mother, Danae, in a chest and abandoned them on the sea, let alone why (toned down for kids, and all that), and of course doesn't go into detail about what mischief Polydectes might intend if Perseus can be got out of the way.Hawthorne is otherwise thorough about details: he even includes the Three Gray Women, who share the use of a single eye, who had to be persuaded to reveal the location of the monsters whose gaze turns living creatures to stone.\\"The Golden Touch\\" - The Midas legend, of how a king, blinded by a love of gold, foolishly asked Apollo that he be given the gift of turning things into gold with a touch. Be careful what you ask for...\\"The Paradise of Children\\" - The story of Pandora's box. Hawthorne's version, much as I like his other mythological tales, has been prettified a little too much: everyone in the world was a child who never grew up, before the box arrived.\\"The Three Golden Apples\\" - The 11th labour of Hercules, wherein the king sent him to fetch the apples of the Hesperides. The tale begins with Hercules meeting a band of nymphs, who hear his account (only briefly summarized, alas) of his preceding labours before directing him to the one person who can direct him to the garden: the Old Man of the Sea...\\"The Miraculous Pitcher\\" - Philemon and his wife Bauchis have grown old together - the only kindly folk living for a good way around a prosperous village, whose inhabitants delight in tormenting vagabonds (although they'll fawn on wealthy-looking strangers). Then one day a ragged youth called Quicksilver and a taciturn man with an appearance of great wisdom are driven out of the village...\\"The Chimaera\\" - Bellerophon's pursuit of Pegasus, whom he seeks because only in the air does he have a chance of killing the monstrous chimaera. Bellerophon's long wait beside the fountain of Pirene, where Pegasus descends to drink, is enlivened by several characters living round about: an old man who can't even remember his glory days, an overly timid maiden who'd run from anything unusual, a yokel who only appreciates plowhorses, and a little boy (the only one who really believes in Pegasus)."},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys","review":"In the spring of 1851 Hawthorne wrote to his publisher, James Fields (of the renowned Ticknor and Fields), proposing a children's book retelling six well-known stories from Greek mythology. He planned to adopt \\"a tone in some degree Gothic or romantic.\\" In addition, he wanted to make the fables suitable for young Christian children: \\"of course, I shall purge all the old heathen wickedness, and put in a moral wherever practicable.\\"I am usually not a fan of sanitized tales--even when written by someone the status of Nathaniel Hawthorne. But, in spite of their overt preachiness and their occasional preciousness, there's something charming and original about these adaptations. Even adults might enjoy these six tales: Perseus's slaughter of Medusa, Midas and his golden touch, Pandora's box (stripped of Prometheus's role), the apples of the Hesperides (or Hercules's Eleventh Labor), Baucis and Philemon and the magic pitcher (which, in my opinion, is the best of the lot), and Bellerophon and Pegasus's battle with the monster Chimaera.Threading these stories together is Eustace Bright, Hawthorne's college-age narrator, who relates his versions to a gaggle of local children (a couple of whom taunt him for his bumptiousness). Hawthorne uses this framing device to insert himself as his own critic. Overhearing one of the stories, the father of one of the children is not amused, finding Eustace's taste \\"altogether Gothic\\" and advising him \\"never more to meddle with a classical myth.\\" To this critique, Eustace petulantly responds that \\"an old Greek had no more right to them, than a modern Yankee has,\\" and he accuses classical writers of forming these tales \\"into shapes of indestructible beauty, indeed, but cold and heartless.\\" If anything, Hawthorne has certainly brought warmth to these old stories.Still, the reading level might be a tall order for many children under 8 (although an adult can adapt them for reading out loud). Hawthorne sprinkles his prose with salutatory references to his real-life neighbors in the Berkshires (there's even a line about Melville writing \\"Moby Dick\\") and with puns and quips that have lost their context. And he gets carried away with his descriptions of the countryside. Hawthorne's evocative passages will surely strike modern readers as hopelessly old-fashioned, although the author realized that he was trying the patience of children even from his own day. After three florid and nearly insufferable paragraphs describing a meadow, for example, Hawthorne apologetically interrupts himself that \\"we must not waste our valuable pages with any more talk about the spring-time and the wild flowers. There is something, we hope, more interesting to be talked about.\\"What's more interesting, of course, are the stories of Greek gods and monsters and flying horses. Fortunately for readers young and old, Hawthorne mostly stays away from the scenery and sticks to the legends."},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys","review":"One day last week, I could not, even after hours of deliberation (the snow had made engagements scarce), decide what book to read next. I finally came upon this little volume on the end of my parent's bookshelf and decided to give it try. How could I have known what charms were in store? I felt like a little girl again, and as Eustace Bright, the ambitious college student who narrates these tales, held his little auditors in awe, my eyes, too, were wide with wonder. It truly is a &quot;wonder book,&quot; full of high fantasy, thrilling action, and the inimitable imagery of a master. Though geared towards &quot;boys and girls,&quot; Hawthorne explains in his introduction that &quot;children possess an unestimated sensibility to whatever is deep or high, in imagination or feeling, so long as it is simple . . . It is only the artificial and complex that bewilder them.&quot; Indeed; the book hardly condescends, and so will gently stretch the middle-grader's vocabulary. But readers -- or listeners -- of all ages will delight in this collection of tales, for I was equally, if not more, entertained by the introductories and postludes to each story, which relate the antics and dialogue of Eustace and the little children he entertains. These interludes also expand the stories by slipping in commentary and interpretation.Don't pass this one by; it will truly win your heart, whoever you may be!"},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys","review":"I ordered this book as part of a third grade curriculum for my son. These Everyman titles are really wonderful-- beautiful binding, heavy pages, amazing illustrations. I was not disappointed with this book. It is the kind of book we will read again and again and hopefully pass on to the next generation. Hawthorne's rendition of the myths and fables is classic and engaging, and Rackham's illustrations are worth the price on their own."},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys","review":"If you've read Hawthorne's longer works, you might be surprised by the storytelling fun and energy he puts into this shorter book aimed at boys and girls of all ages, 8 to 80, who love a good yarn. Imagine yourself on a whispery, wintery day, sledding on the hillsides with friends. Or imagine yourself gathered with the kids on the front porch on a golden, summery afternoon. Now add to these settings Hawthorne's inventive narrator, Eustace Bright, who gathers the children round on that hillside or porch and gives them the classic myths with his own unique spins.If you think you know the stories of King Midas and his golden touch, of Hercules' exploits, of Medusa, you have here the chance to rediscover them in child-friendly, yet fully adventurous form, through the skills of Mr. Nathaniel Hawthorne. He gives the old tales a lot of charm, makes them palatable for younger kids, and weaves in lessons of ethics and morality and courage. I have always appreciated Hawthorne's more thought-provoking writings, but here I find another side to the man and the writer that is magical and light. To add to the wonder, I not only have the paperback version but also read this in an e-book format, enjoying the beautiful drawings of Arthur Rackham.I've long been a fan of Hawthorne's short stories. While he plays out some amazing themes and characters in \\"A Scarlet Letter,\\" \\"House of the Seven Gables,\\" and even \\"The Blithedale Romance,\\" he excels in his shorter tales, where the prose has less room to run off track and the themes are better addressed. He seems serious in most of his writing, with only hints of his humor and playfulness, but in \\"A Wonder Book for Boys and Girls,\\" we find a side of Hawthorne that's hard not to adore."},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys","review":"As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate."},{"Title":"The Glass Bees","review":"How do you even begin to do justice to a novel like this? I would imagine that this could very well be a polarizing novel. (Keep in mind my personal philosophy is largely derived from Rene Guenon, et al.) However, I don't think anyone could doubt the quality of the prose itself.As stated, very little actually happens. Actually, the &quot;action&quot; herein is probably a mere tenth or so of the length, but don't be fooled - Junger will string you along for a few pages, and then hit you with a philosophical passage that begs reading and re-reading. This is a science fiction novel by technical definition, although there is little actual emphasis on the technology; it is presented more as an allegory for the modern age.The plot is very simple. Captain Richard, an aging war veteran, is given a job interview by the &quot;great Zapparoni&quot; (who is sort of mixture between Walt Disney and Rupert Murdoch). Richard, despite having no short amount of noblisse oblige (nurtured in an earlier, more noble era) nevertheless has cultivated an identity based on failure, largely resulting from being out of step with the current age. He is a man caught between two worlds - he cannot bear to destroy himself even in lieu of the pointlessness of modern existence, yet is unwilling to sacrifice himself to the new technological gods, who demand little more than technical efficiency and blind obedience at the expense of human perfection.When I was reading this novel, I was reminded of Spengler's introduction to _The Decline of the West_, in which he differentiated between &quot;men of action&quot; and &quot;men of contemplation&quot;. Men of action, Spengler said, are the logical result of the particular era they live in (sadly, the figures of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush probably exemplify our own era.) Richard, on the other hand, is a man of contemplation, if perhaps not a great one. He paradoxically realizes that he is trapped in circumstances beyond his control while the &quot;men of action&quot; - who can do little but mirror the values of the modern age - do not stop even for a second to consider anything at all.Richard knows that Zapparoni, who has built an empire based upon animatronic robots, is little more than the logical product of his age. Richard must come to terms with Zapparoni - who is less a figure than a representation of the modern industrial age. It is a world where &quot;efficiency&quot; and predictable order take precedence over any mere human interest, and &quot;progress&quot; is little more than the continual play of technological novelty.Richard realizes that no reads Herodotus any more; he pontificates on the nature of the man who is infinitely adaptible. In a telling scene, a former horseman and comrade-in-arms is now a petty bureaucrat in the public transportation system of his city, and elicits little more than disdain for their old days in the army.I won't give the conclusion away, but the end result isn't a happy one - and it will doubtlessly not sit well with those of us who simply &quot;do what we have to do to get by&quot; in lieu of overwhelming feelings of powerlessness and anomie that characterize the modern age (even as Americans possess the highest standard of living of any people in the history of planet.) This novel poses many questions: to what degree do we limit the possibility of human perfection by striving for technical perfection? Is it possible for the person inherently out of touch with the values of the modern age to find meaning in existence? And most importantly: do human values have any place in the modern era at all?In the end, I believe Junger has created perhaps the most succinct testimony to modern spiritual death yet written."},{"Title":"The Glass Bees","review":"A couple of decades ago The Washington Post interviewed a number of illustious writers and asked each of them to name the 10 best books they had ever read. I read the lists, mentally judging whether or not I would have selected the same books and noting the books I had not read that I might. The lists included the usual references to MOBY DICK, HUCKLEBERRY FINN, and the BIBLE, but one list included THE GLASS BEES by Ernst Junger.For reasons unknown to me, I am attracted to any book with the word bees or honey in the title, but the fact that the protagonist Captain Richard was a German veteran also caught my interest. I had read many books, articles, etc. by and about U.S. soldiers and veterans, but had not read anything by or about German veterans and I wanted to know more. Also, at the time I discovered THE GLASS BEES the newspapers were filled with articles about unemployed Vietnam veterans, so the fact that Captian Richard was also unemployed further intrigued me.Now I don't like science fiction, but, by the time I realized THE GLASS BEES was science fiction (at least it was when the book was written), I found myself hooked on a book I would never have gone out of my way to read, about things I did not want to know. I am a gardener, and I love nature, but this book presents a terrifying look into a world anyone who loves nature will abhor.THE GLASS BEES is about the war technological forces are waging against nature. Have you read THE MACHINE IN THE GARDEN by Leo Marx? This is the next step. Forget the locomotive engine crashing through the underbrush, the technology in this book makes the locomotive engine look positively benign. Siegfried Mandel wrote in a New York Times review that THE GLASS BEES presents &quot;scenes as harrowing and thought-disturbing as any created by Karel Capek, George Orwell or Aldous Huxley.&quot;When Junger wrote THE GLASS BEES he was aware of the tecnological improvisations of the Nazis including the crematoriums and rockets. The Nuremburg trials had uncovered one scientific horror after another. Junger could foresee the future when capitalistic forces would rule and everything would be artificial. Unfortunately, he was a prophet. Today our food, houses, clothing, medicines, you name it are all artificial. And, we are ruled by a dozen international corporations.THE GLASS BEES is one of the top ten books I have ever read and it ought to be mandatory reading for high school students. I think of Junger's book everyday. And, just in case I might forget, over my patio, next to the wind chimes, I've hung a glass bee."},{"Title":"The Glass Bees","review":"Captain Richard trained as a swashbuckling cavalry officer, but increasingly mechanised forms of warfare forced him to become a tank technician. Now, down on his luck after a life that reads like a radically compressed history of the twentieth century, he approaches the industrialist Zapparoni for a job. As the book came out in the 1950s and its author was born before the turn of the century, Zapparoni's products are called \\"robots\\" or \\"automata\\"; but they're a far cry from Asimov's Robots and Mechanical Men. As Bruce Sterling points out in his intriguing introduction, some passages from The Glass Bees, taken out of context, might easily have come from a computer magazine of the 1990s, blaring the wonders of miniaturisation and CD-ROM. The bulk of the novel comprises Richard's meditations before, during and after his interview with Zapparoni, and Junger's prescience is impressive not only in terms of the technology he envisages, but also in terms of its effect. Richard notes, for example, that the artificial bees' total efficiency in collecting nectar - not a drop left inside - will simply cause the flowers to die off through lack of cross-pollination. Written with brilliant and chilly clarity, and climaxing in an episode of restrained horror and terrifying ambiguity, The Glass Bees is an examination of the moral and cultural price of technology, from the perspective of a man who had seen plenty. However, although Sterling compares him with Celine, Junger is neither rancorous nor misanthropic. Indeed, despite the fact that Richard's wife is mentioned only a few times and never appears in person, the book is also a rather touching affirmation of human love."},{"Title":"The Glass Bees","review":"Many people in Europe consider Juenger a cultural Titan of the XX's century, some sort of new Goethe who has crossed the whole century ( he lived 102 years dying just two years ago).

Unfortunaly we still don't have his main work. his Journals from the second world war, translated into English"},{"Title":"The Glass Bees","review":"The Glass Bees is a short novel about power, technology and nature. It's also the story of a life; the life of a veteran german captain that has lived in two very different worlds: the &quot;old&quot; world where words like &quot;courage&quot; or &quot;pride&quot; still meant something and a &quot;new&quot; world where the words have lost their meaning, where the power of the State has almost been surrended to huge high-tech transnational firms and where efficency criteria leads the behaviour of most of the peolple. The story tells the way in which the old world's man tries (unsuccsesfully most of the times)to fit himself in the new world.In my opinion The Glass Bees is an outstanding novel althoug -I have to say it- not one of the 10 best books I have ever read as another reviewer says."},{"Title":"The Glass Bees","review":"Ernst Junger died at the age of 102 in 1997. However interest in The Glass Bees (originally published in 1957) is more a credit to the book's prescience than its extraordinarily long-lived author. In the novel, the head of a multinational animation studio develops a new variety of movies using lifelike automatons indistinguishable from real actors. The glass bees of the title are his newest gizmos, as small as bees yet outperforming what they mimic, recreating and specializing themselves until their evolution races past their creators' control. More a meditation than a novel, this work airs the views of its narrator, a former cavalry officer obsessed with the ravages of modernity, specifically the way it makes our lives easier and more unpleasant. More ease, the old soldier says, has made us more prone to complain instead of less. While it's impossible to outline all the ideas in the officer's heady ruminations, they have a common theme: he was better off when his work was real."},{"Title":"The Glass Bees","review":"This review contains plot spoilers.Ernst Junger is best-known for his \\"In Stahlgewittern\\" (\\"Storm of Steel\\"), a literary account of the time he spent serving in World War I. Almost four decades later in 1957, he published this novel, one of the dozens he wrote during his life, and one of the better pieces of dystopian fiction I've read. The translation by Louise Bogan deserves special praise for its effortlessness and attention to detail. So often translating pieces like this can produce something derivative, banal, and tasteless, but the opposite is true here. Her work as a poet (she was the Poet Laureate from 1945-1946) brought its subtlety to bear on this wonderful novel.\\"The Glass Bees\\" isn't what you'd call action-packed: its entire plot consists of a down-and-out man named Richard trying to find a job, speaking with his friend who might have an inside lead, and the job interview that results, interspersed with quite a few flashbacks to Richard's military days. The central character, however, is neither Richard nor his friend, but the magus-like Zapparoni who runs the factory where Richard goes for his interview. Zapparoni lives in seclusion and runs his operations, including the production of anthropomorphic robots that star in the films that he produces, and the titular glass bees of the title. Everything Zapparoni makes require such skill, attention to detail, and artisanship that he stocks his factory with hundreds of workers who are utterly devoted to him. He has a charismatic ability to manipulate the people who work for him and perhaps a demonic desire to change the world through the transformative power of technology.While waiting for Zapparoni to conduct his interview, he waits in a garden outside the factory, and his senses are gradually overwhelmed by Zapparoni's meticulously constructed glass bees, replete with hundreds of infinitely complex miniscule parts. They put him in a trance that renders him unable to tell anything about his surroundings. After this bizarre experience, Richard resolves to not take a job at Zapparoni's factory, thinking that he might use his power for something other than good, but ends up changing his mind and taking a position as a sort of ombudsman, helping the often querulous workers get over their artistic differences. In the end, though, we are left hanging. We never find out whether Richard would live to regret his decision, or whether retains his personal integrity and freedom of conscience.Junger was often accused of being a fascist, and it's really no surprise reading this book, but not for the reasons one might think: other than his sweet, evocative remembrances of military life before Zapparoni, Junger never recommends authoritarianism, antiparliamentarianism, or the cult of the leader. But some fascists were known for their deep, agonistic mistrust of technology and innovation, so far that they idealized the pastoral, rustic idyll of life before industrialization. There are so such idylls here, but Junger does have a distinctly suspicious stance toward technology and the mesmeric power that it can exert over people. He probably would have seen the advent of people simultaneously attached to their Blackberry, iPhone, iPod, and Bluetooth as unfortunate but inevitable. For being over half a century old, Junger's technological anxieties are brilliantly articulated. His bees and his robots are progenitors of the nanotechnology that is so inescapable today. \\"A happy century does not exist,\\" Junger write. As someone who saw World War I and almost the entire twentieth century - he died in 1998 about a month before his 103rd birthday. But, he adds with a humane caution, \\"But there are moments of happiness, and there is freedom in the moment.\\" Words to dulcify a looming Technopolis."},{"Title":"The Glass Bees","review":"THE GLASS BEES is an interesting, even fascinating book. It isn't necessarily an easy one to read, but then again, Ernst J&uuml;nger isn't known for his light touch with a pen. Like a lot of German authors, he writes in the \\"romantisch-pathetisch\\" style that translates into English rather clumsily, and makes frequent, somewhat rambling digressions which often go on for many pages and challenge the reader's patience. Unlike many of his countrymen, however, he is also capable of writing outbursts of prose so beautifully put together they sound like poetry and remain stuck in the mind forevermore. For this reason, and for his keen observations on life and the human condition, I am always willing to wade into J&uuml;nger's works, even when I know it will be heavy going.THE GLASS BEES is something of a prophetic book, straddling the line between science-fiction and alternate history. Written in the mid-1950s, it foretold many aspects of modern life, most notably the rise of super-corporations led by brilliant but morally ambiguous men, the life-changing effects of technology, and the shift in moral climate that come about as a result of these things. The protagonist, Richards, is an ex-officer looking for work in a postwar economy that views him as something of an anachronism. Instilled with the classic military virtues, but lacking the ruthlessness and unscrupulousness which seems to define the modern man, Richards is practically starving when an old comrade sets up with a job interview with Zapparoni, a sort of cross between Howard Hughes, Henry Ford, Bill Gates and Walt Dinsney. Zapparoni is the brain of a corporate empire whose artificially intelligent, labor-saving machines have revolutionized both everyday life and the concept of entertainment, and his public image is of a charitable, child-loving, benificent old man. Richards, however, has heard more ominous things about Zapparoni: to wit, that he is really a monomaniacal control freak who crushes his corporate rivals into paste and terrorizes his own employees into slavelike obedience, \\"disappearing\\" anyone who becomes inconvenient. Richards, however, is desperate to provide for his beloved wife and marches grimly into Zapparoni's compound, reflecting as he tours the facilities on the tectonic changes in society which have occurred in his lifetime. Between audiences with the coldly enigmatic titan, Richards makes a number of jarring discoveries , not the least of which is that he cannot outrun the values instilled in him by his military academy training. The question then becomes twofold: will he leave the compound alive after what he has discovered, and if he does, can he find a place in a world where profit-motive, amorality and lust for power have replaced duty, honor and tradition?THE GLASS BEES is undoubtedly a strange book, and it is arguable that if J&uuml;nger's prose style were less digressive and turgid his observations and questions would have been clearer and easier to understand. However, this does not change the fact that those observations and questions, penned fifty years ago, are not only relevant in today's world but actually crucial. The increasing power of corporations, ominous as that may be, is nothing compared to the way their \\"values\\" of Machiavellianism, greed and amorality have become the values of countless millions of people. On the other hand, the desire of scientists to play god just for the sake of it, which J&uuml;nger alludes to by showing us Zapparoni's mechanical bees, is not merely a warning about the threat technology poses to the ordinary man (who increasingly finds himself redundant in the workplace) but of the dangers of doing things simply because they can be done, without ever stopping to ask if they should be."},{"Title":"The Glass Bees","review":"Captain Richard, black listed by the armed services, is desperate for a job and approaches an influential ex cavalry comrade,Twinning's, to intercede. He sends him to Zapparoni,a leviathan of not only robotic technology but also the childrens entertainment industry. At Zapparoni's huge compound-a kind of area 51-Richard shares a brief exchange with the enigmatic man before being ushered out into the garden with a warning to \\"Beware of the bees.\\" Zapparoni is testing him....Absolutely breath taking. Richard Wright once said; \\"Books are my drug\\" and like all avid readers you read book after book waiting for highs such as \\"Glass Bees\\" gives the mind.A cross between Robert Musil and George Orwell (mixed with a hint of F Scott Fitzgerald's 'Diamond as big as the Ritz're the paranoia of extreme wealth and power)Junger considers a world that constantly changes and renders the past obsolete; these changes being falsely labeled as progress when the true reason for constant change is power; who has it and what they have that gives this.Now-faster than ever before-people's lives are being rendered obsolete by technology-(the humble printer now outdated by e-tech?!)Whereas it took centuries before the longbow was superceded by gunpowder and the accompanying power shift that entailed,Junger looks at and accurately forsees the huge and accellerating changes that went on in the 20th century. He is frighteningly accurate about technology and power, and that the absurd sums of money poured into it have everything to do with power and little to do with the much feted 'progress'. His quote that the most absurd economics are followed when it comes to power is matched by many other quotables in this book; \\"We cling to our theories and fit phenomena to them\\"works for me on so many levels I've burned it into my brain to bring forth when needed!Classed as Sci-Fi by some (certainly it predicts the future and the technologies it aims for) this book fits any definition of classic and great must read literature. Brilliant!"},{"Title":"The Glass Bees","review":"I gather when this novel came out, it was widely dismissed as irrelevant. It was probably out of sync with the contemporary German political sensibility with political parties that assured everyone that they were democratic and centrist.Given Jungers political history, I suspect a lot of people weren't all that eager to hear his reflections on contemporary society.Part of the books power comes from the fact that while you can see it as a withering critique of the shallowness of contemporary society ,it's calm and rather good natured.This is no Celine style screed.Mostly , Captain Richard tells you about himself and meditates on the way we live now.It is very German with a romantic fixation on authenticity and alienation.Yet it manages to be \\"light\\".That is the key to it's success.You are reading a philosophical novel of some real depth, yet you never feel your being hit over the head with poorly digested philosophy.Junger was an amazing man ( if you doubt that read STORM OF STEEL as well).It's apparent from this novel that he was also a remarkably subtle writer."},{"Title":"The Glass Bees","review":"This is certainly a fascinating read. Junger's vision of the future feels possible, there is a world weariness about his character's views, ideas and memories. The narrator mourns the simpler world, the world in which the calvary charged into battle, when men fought a known enemy. The war of our modern age, as written about by Junger in this philosophical novel, is just a war of distances, pressing buttons, eliminating your opponent without seeing them.The novel essentially takes place in a day. We follow the thoughts, memories, dreams of a man long discharged from the army, searching for employment in a world filled with robots and other inventions. The world is strongly amoral, these robots entertain, have replaced actors and become the world's source of entertainment. The soldier, through the help of a former colleague, has an interview with a brilliant businessman - a Bill Gates meets Warren Buffet-like character named Zapparoni. Richard, the war veteran is needed to be head of security. This Zapparoni fears his inventors will give away his secrets.This is more a novel of ideas as opposed to situations. Richard recalls men he went to school with, former soldiers he knew and hung around with after the wars. He reflects on the past and the present. It is not plot-driven and much of the interview between the narrator and the business men happen between the memories and thoughts of Richard. It is a reflective novel, pensive, melancholic but hopeful in some sense.If you enjoy the Orwell or Huxley, bear in mind this is not a story of scenes, there is no real plot other than a man going to an interview. It is more of a snapshot of a man's life in a possible future world. Considering Junger lived to the age of 102, and this novel was written in the '50s', one wonders what he thought about the world on his deathbed in the late 1990's."},{"Title":"The Glass Bees","review":"A wonderful work by Junger. An interesting contrast to his On Pain. I see three basic themes running through the work. First is what Man is doing to himself through ever increasing technological improvements. Junger first points out the beauty of the accomplishments, but then emphasizes their sinister destructiveness. The second theme is that of how this has changed the very essence of mankind. The former cavalryman, imbued with honor and humaneness, becomes a mere mechanic with the advent of the tank and has little use in the new age. Finally, Junger seems to really emphasize the importance of our formative experiences in shaping our selves. Again and again, he comes back to the education given by the cavalry instructor to his young charges and this helps the protagonist through the puzzles set forth by Zapparoni. While not a science-fiction work, it does have hints of Philip K. Dick or the Asimov robot stories . Not the easiest of reads, but still accessible and relevant. Beautifully translated."},{"Title":"The Glass Bees","review":"Ernst J&uuml;nger wrote what he thought in a time when free thinking led to imprisonment. But how could the Nazi's lock up one of their greatest and most decorated war heroes?The Glass Bees is short and to the point.

Actors are replaced by simulacra that perform within artificially natural scenery.For a fresh view point, read this book and be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Glass Bees","review":"This is an interesting but not very rewarding book, part satire of capitalism, part psychological novel. The protagonist, Captain Richard, is a cashiered Army officer, a former cavalryman quite out of place in his time. The structure of the book is the cavalryman's job interview with a visionary capitalist, the latter supposedly looking for someone willing to do his dirty work. Most of the book is taken up with the recollections and reflections of the cavalryman on his life. I suspect this is partly autobiographical. We are left to infer that Richard is a veteran of the First World War, appears to have served in the Spanish Civil War (on the Fascist side), and had some type of military administrative position during the Second World War. He is now jobless and without prospects in prosperous post-war Germany. Junger makes some shrewd jabs at the materialism and what he regards as the inauthenticity of post-war German life. This is cleverly done but relatively conventional in spirit. The real defect of the book is that Richard and his recollections are not sufficiently vivid to give a really good sense of the dislocations of German history, which is what I suspect Junger wished to convey. An interesting failure. As an aside, whatever his literary talents, Junger is not a very attractive character. He was one of those vociferous right wing critics of democracy who contributed, in a small way, to the demise of the Weimar state."},{"Title":"Suho and the White Horse : A Legend of Mongolia","review":"This Mongolian legend illustrates the unique bond between a boy and his white horse and tells the story of a struggle that the boy and the horse face.

You decided based on your own knowledge you decided based on your traditions. If we are naked poor and blind what makes you think you can see on your own? A blind man knows he is blind and humbly accepts assistance from others. A spiritually blind man thinks he is self sufficient and eats and devours anyone who attempts to love him - even the Lord himself (he then rationalizes it was not the Lord - that that man was not sent of the Lord and thus he too kills the prophets).Is this not what they tried to say of Jesus? He came against their traditional interpretations - so they sought to kill him!I had issues with things in this book. I have also had issues with things the still small voice of God has said to me.
