I could not see renting the books when I could purchase them and keep them for future use."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Wow, I can't even put into words how good this book was, and so much better the second time around. The classic tale of Hester Pryne, forced to wear The Scarlet Letter as a sign to all of her adultery, but she refuses to name her lover who is then forced to bear his guilt in silence.Enough reviewers have recounted the story better than I could. Suffice it to say I loved Hawthorne's prose, it was very dense and lyrical at the same time, and you have to pay close attention or you might have to backup and reread a paragraph or two. His descriptions of the scenery and people came alive, especially the character of young Pearl. And I very much enjoyed the scenes in the forest -- it was amazing how Hawthorne brought it all to life, even the sounds of the babbling brook.Highly recommended to anyone looking to discover (or rediscover) an old classic. Side note to some of the young misses who clearly weren't happy at having this book as required reading in school -- you really really should try to work harder on your spelling, punctuation and grammar when criticizing a great masterpiece such as this."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne became one of my favorite classic writers, after I read The Scarlet Letter. Hawthorne writes with passionate emotion and depth, as he tells how the minister, Arthur Dimmesdale, and the beautiful young, Hester Prynne share a secret which causes Hester, who is the mother of a young daughter, the impish energetic Pearl, to be condemned to wearing the scarlet-colored letter \\"A\\" stitched to her dress. Even though the language is written in 17 century Puritan New England style, the story addresses issues that are still prevalant today in our modern society.I love this novel. This hardcover edition is the best one to have if you want to keep it for years to come. I've had my hardcover edition for years, and it is still in perfect condition."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Contrary to what several reviewers have stated this collection does have the Sunday pages for the last few segments. The early Sunday pages couldn't be reproduced due to technical difficulties at the time of publication. Monday dailies usually gave a summary of what happened on Sunday. This was done as some newspapers did not have Sunday comics."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Wow, this was another high school required reading book for me, and while I really like the story - I walked away from it thinking \\"It's not fair that women get the burden of blame and the man walks away free!\\" Which got me to thinking about whether or not society's attitudes about infidelity or pre-marital relations have really changed all that much. I love a book that sparks me thinking about things like this one did as well as having a great story to it too. I recommend this book, although, not for younger children, in my opinion, but high school level and beyond would probably appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I had to read this book this past school year (junior year), so I might be slightly biased against it. I'm generally a very avid reader, sitting down to devour books for hours at a time, but for this book (as short as it actually is), I'd have to force myself to sit down and read one chapter a day, which still took over an hour because it's easy for one's mind to wander when reading this. The sentences are excessively lengthy (although Hawthorne pulls this off quite well), and you'll probably need a dictionary a few times. My vocabulary felt much improved upon completing this novel.I think the storyline, once it is understood, was interesting and I think that the author did do a good job of expressing the vast array of emotions Hester Prynne and Dimmesdale go through. Sometimes I almost felt is was overly dramatic (i.e. Dimmesdale screaming into the night), but sometimes it might have been necessary. The intense feelings the main characters are experiencing form a nice contrast to the drab Puritan setting.Another one of the book's downfalls is the dialogue. The book was actually written a considerable time after the early colonies (I didn't know this until reading the book), and it seems Hawthorne was attempting to duplicate the manner of oral language he believed the Puritans used. He created a Shakespearean like dialect, using words such as 'thee' and 'thy,' which made it not so very--enjoyable. There isn't a lot of speaking going on in the book, so that's a relief.All in all, I'm glad to say that I was one of the few (maybe three-ish) students whom actually read the entirety of this book. It was fun to analyze because it actually made me appreciate it more. I think I'd prefer to wait and re-read when I'm an adult, so that it won't be quite as difficult a read and I can fully appreciate the author's message. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in a challenging read with some enlightening insight to the effects of sin upon mankind. To anyone forced against their will to read it--I'd say at least give it a try (skip over \\"The Custom-House\\" though, it'll bore you to tears and you'll never even begin on the first chapter), and know that SparkNotes are always good to help you grasp parts of the plot you don't quite comprehend."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book is definitely a classic, contrary to some reviewer's opinions. The virtues of it have been already told by other reviews, so I won't repeat them. Let it suffice to say that this book changed the way I look at the world, the Hereafter, and my fellow immortals.I would also like to briefly point out a bit of irony. Many of the negative reviews here say that the book was to long, and that all those pages would better be summarized like this: The irony is that what follows if different for each person! There is no \\"true\\" summery of this book. Each person pulls what is important to them from a true classic, and each of us is different. I encourage you, therefore to read this for yourself.I also have to warn you NOT to use Cliff's Notes. I think they would find symbolism in the placement of commas! I read a few chapters of Cliff's Notes and immediately the pure discourse of the author and me through the medium of this wonderful tale was corrupted."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"After recently re-reading The Scarlet Letter in this edition, one passage stuck out:\\"One day, leaning his forehead on his hand, and his elbow on the sill of the open window, that looked towards the grave-yard, he talked with Roger Chillingworth, while the old man was examining a bundle of unsightly plants.'Where,' asked he, with a look askance at them,-for it was the clergyman's peculiarity that he seldom, now-a-days, looked straightforth at any object, whether human or inanimate,-'where, my kind doctor, did you gather those herbs, with such a dark, flabby leaf?''Even in the grave-yard here at hand,' answered the physician, continuing his employment. \\"They are new to me. I found them growing on a grave, which bore no tombstone, no other memorial of the dead man, save these ugly weeds that have taken upon themselves to keep him in remembrance. They grew out of his heart, and typify, it may be, some hideous secret that was buried with him, and which he had done better to confess during his lifetime.''Perchance,' said Mr. Dimmesdale, 'he earnestly desired it, but could not.''And wherefore?' rejoined the physician. 'Wherefore not; since all the powers of nature call so earnestly for the confession of sin, that these black weeds have sprung up out of a buried heart to make manifest, an outspoken crime?''That, good Sir, is but a fantasy of yours,' replied the minister. 'There can be, if I forbode aright, no power, short of the Divine mercy, to disclose, whether by uttered words, or by type or emblem, the secrets that may be buried with a human heart. The heart, making itself guilty of such secrets, must perforce hold them, until the day when all hidden things shall be revealed. Nor have I so read or interpreted Holy Writ, as to understand that the disclosure of human thoughts and deeds, then to be made, is intended as a part of the retribution. That, surely, were a shallow view of it. No; these revelations, unless I greatly err, are meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfaction of all intelligent beings, who will stand waiting, on that day, to see the dark problem of this life made plain. A knowledge of men's hearts will be needful to the completest solution of that problem. And I conceive, moreover, that the hearts holding such miserable secrets as you speak of will yield them up, at that last day, not with reluctance, but with a joy unutterable.'\\"It recalled a recent conversation with an old friend. We got to talking (writing, actually) about whether truly private experience is possible. My friend recounted many experiences in which he had intimations of things which we might term \\"private\\": intimations of the death of loved ones, clairvoyant or telepathic experiences, and that sort of thing. One of the things that Hawthorne keeps coming back to is the social and personal skirmishes across the public/private border. A woman has a private affair that bears public fruit in the birth of her child and results in her being very publicly humiliated. Her husband abandons his public claims and ties to her and assumes a new identity. He attaches himself to her lover, a minister, who holds the knowledge of his sinful affair deep within his own heart, where it nonetheless becomes known and visible to the husband. Throughout, the public and private have a way of bleeding into one another.In the passage above, Dimmesdale is blind to those workings of Divine mercy which may have effects that are broader than the confines of a purely solitary heart. He seeks to make his sin purely an issue between him and his God, not realizing that by seeking to restrict sin and guilt, he is equally seeking to confine God and his action to the merely private realm. The novel turns on the futility of this task.Never really saw this before. Of course that's not surprising. You don't see much the first time around, especially when this is assigned reading for a high school student. It may seem like a book of merely historical interest, but it's a pertinent read on the human heart and its transformations through desire, shame, and guilt. While some of it may be overly allegorical for modern tastes, the sheer force of its insights is pretty remarkable. Kathryn Harrison's introduction is fine, and the work itself is truly stunning."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter presents to the reader a classic story of man, in this case, woman versus society. The reader is presented with the infamous Hester Prynne who, according to the laws of Puritan society, has committed a sin of adultery. She is forever condemned for this sin, by wearing a scarlet letter \\"A\\" on her chest to signify that she is an adulterer. When Hester came to Boston as a young woman, she was by herself. To questioning townsfolk she had said that she moved there alone because her husband was traveling for work purposes. However, after she becomes pregnant and gives birth, she's sent to jail and later publicly shamed for her adultery. Throughout the novel she serves as a cautionary tale to the rest of the world. As time passes, Hester's alienation from society makes her realize that their opinion isn't worth her pains. She will use this realization to free herself from the stigma that taunts her because of the scarlet letter that she'd been forced to wear. This novel is an excellent peace of work for anyone who is fascinated by stories in which an individual is facing society alone and experiences a personal awakening. The introduction chapter is very difficult to pay attention to, due to the excessive language which Nathaniel Hawthorne uses. Nonetheless, the subsequent chapters, although adorned by Hawthorne's redundant language, are interesting. The novel is filled with metaphorical diction. Hawthorne is a master of ornamenting his writing with figurative language. All in all, the novel is an excellent read and I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I have a vague recollection of being forced to read this in High School many years ago. I just finished re-reading the Scarlet Letter. In my opinion, the Scarlet Letter would be out of reach for many teenagers - like it was for me. Now I'm older and wiser and have been reading classic literature in my bookclub for 15+ years. I have a greater respect for the SL and the new ground it was breaking in literature and I can appreciate the impact it had on future writers. In fact, the reason I picked up SL again was that I had learned that 'Moby Dick' - by Herman Melville - was was dedicated to Hawthorne. So that peaked my interest as I think MB is likely the best American novel ever written.I think adultry is still a big issue. Anything that's on the list of 10 commandments has pretty well served the test of time. Adultry is probably one of the commandments that many people have somekind of firsthand experience. So even though the story and characters seem archiac at times, many readers of SL can (or will) be able to identify with the guilt and angst at some time in their lives.So what about the guilt and angst? The parts of the story most interesting to me were the one's having to do with nature and the woods surrounding the small colonial village. The villagers were surrounded by nature along with the fear of the unknown. The Puritan settlers had brought with them their beliefs and systems into a new world that 'shielded' them to an unnecessary extent to nature and the laws of nature. It seemed like the Puritans carried a very heavy moral burden that most were nor equipped to handle. Hester turned to nature to get direction as the village had shunned her and left her with no options. One of best line's (I'm paraphrasing) is \\"Let God be the judge, people need to learn to forgive each other and get along.\\" Hawthorne was in fact saying to the readers that these old 17th century Puritan beliefs were largely irrelevant by the late 1800's.So toward the end of the SL I found a connection that I was seeking between Scarlet Letter and Moby Dick - namely the scenes with the sailors and ship merchants - how they were not morally bound to the land - as were the settlers - and enjoyed a freer existence - and it was accepted by most people. I think this became a point of departure for Melville and his many books on ocean adventures.If you didn't like SL today, don't give up in literature as some of this stuff only gets better with time."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Anyone who suffered through this book in high school, but has since developed a more mature intellectual curiosity and is willing to put in a little effort, will here find one of the most incredible rereading experiences the English language has to offer.A government official, his imaginative faculties deadened by years of dreary work in a Salem custom-house, shuts out the modern world and travels back in time two hundred years, using an old piece of emboidered fabric as a portal. Behold: a different world, the Puritan world, a dusky twilight zone between the Celestial City and the fires of Hell, where witches ride with Satan through the night air and the sky is a heavenly scroll with which God sends his chosen people messages via shooting stars. Here we become privy to a grim secret drama, a matter of life and death between three characters: Hester Prynne, beautiful, impulsive, conscious of her guilt and her mistakes, dutiful to her daughter and to the community who condemns her, and an expansive visionary amid the most closed-minded of people; Arthur Dimmesdale, the falsest person in the community, yet a devout religionist and believer in truth, who punishes himself with brutal acts of self-abasement; and Roger Chillingworth, the quiet man of learning whose devotion to scholarship does not prevent him from turning into a vengeful fiend.The Scarlet Letter is amazingly germane to our world: sexual transgression, single parenting, rebellious children, abusive authority, the importance of community and family, the clash of cultures, gender issues, etc. Yet it is as sometimes as weird as anything David Lynch or Thomas Pynchon could come up with: reality and fantasy, mirrors and hallucinations, sadism, masochism, witchcraft, dementia, UFOs, weird mystical symbols, nocturnal vigils, silent Indians, drunken sailors, ridiculous parades. A thoughtful reader will laugh hysterically at the dancing ape mentioned in Chapter 21. The narration is wordy but stylistically appropriate for Hawthorne's purposes; it finds a perfect balance between tongue-in-cheek irony and the seriousness of life-and-death issues. The book's reputation as grave and ponderous is the result of our inability--or more accurately, our unwillingness to take the time--to detect Hawthorne's subtly ironic tone toward his well-intentioned but sadly misled ancestors. His sentences are also longer than our diminished attention can sometimes handle, which is our flaw, not his.It is true that this story \\"tells\\" rather than \\"shows,\\" violating the \\"show, don't tell\\" rule of creative writing. Our interior worlds don't follow linear plots, and a writer like Hawthorne doesn't have to abide by such formulaic rules. This is a book for the ages, magic via the written word. Read it again, and slowly this time. Preferably by moonlight."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I was introduced to Hawthorne rather late in life, having shunned the classics and literature during my high-school and college years as impractical and not relevant. Now almost twenty years removed high-school, I recently started reading some classics, on my own terms, to find out what I had missed.The Scarlett Letter, on its face, is about the impact that an adulterous liason has on Hester Prynne and the small Puritan community she resides. Hester, as punishment for breaking the moral code of the era, is sentenced to wear the scarlett letter A - signifying her as an adulteress. Hawthorne, through this short tale ,seems also to be making a statement about the self-righteous hypocrisy of the Puritans. While Hester is portrayed as the scourge of the community for having been caught in a moral lapse, the scarlett letter seems to endow her with the power to see the hidden transgressions of her accusers: &quot;She shuddered to believe, yet could not help believing that it gave her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts. She was terrorstricken by the revelations that were thus made.&quot;Although a very dark tale, allowing us a glimpse into the darkside of zealotry and revenge, I thoroughly enjoyed Hawthorne's depiction of it. His style, which I initially found to be ponderous and wordy, especially in the introductory piece The Custom House, grew on me as I progressed and at the end found myself enjoying."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book was mediocre. I think Hawthorne is a good writer, but sometimes his works are too Romantic for me. There are defiantly worse classics that I have read, but the Scarlet Letter is not among the best.The symbolism in this book is quite good, I must say. Hawthorne manages to achieve subtlety without not getting his point across. Although I thought the things his characters stand for are overwrought, he does a good job of presenting the story as an allegory.It's easy to get frustrated with Hawthorne's characters, however, (especially the Reverend Dimmesdale, whose pithy whining gets boring half-way through), and sometimes the heavy moral overtones can be a chore to wade through. The ending is not particularly brilliant and Hawthorne's characters are, for the most part, not well-rounded (although this serves a purpose).In the end, my favorite character was Chillingworth, even though he is 'evil', because at least he brings some variety to the story. One gets awfully sick of hearing endless descriptions of Hester's bravery and Dimmesdale's moral plights, so that any diversion, be it twisted or not, is welcome."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Forcing students to read novels such as this could be considered one of the primary obstacles to promoting reading as an independently pursued hobby. The story, I'll admit, was a good idea. However, the moody overromanticized method of telling it stifled what was a good idea. Hawthorne was a victim of the style of the times--not a victim of bad writing. In short, a great book to have read, but a miserable book to read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I recently purchased a copy of Modern Library's edition of Scarlet Letter. The introduction was very helpful in situating the book in its time, and also in showing how relevant it is to our world. Besides the helpful introduction, this edition has the nicest cover of all those on the shelf. Keep up the good work Modern Library!!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Few novels capture the essence of a different time like The Scarlet Letter. Yet reading this novel about strict moral rules leaves one with a difference sense about today's society. Very often a woman who has a child out of wedlock experiences severe judgments from those around her. Yet the man involved will often stay hidden and not be subject to the same sanctions. Perhaps less changes than we think.Reading this book also provides an uplifting view of the potential for goodness in how well Hester Prynne bears her shame and raises her child. You will also come away with a renewed appreciation for the strength that women often bring to tough situations. The courage to face a disapproving society with little in the way of emotional support is probably greater than the courage needed to face physical danger. You cannot help but appreciate Hester as a symbol of true courage.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the Puritan beginnings of our modern American culture."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I too was forced to read this book in my Literature class, but I do have to say that I am a bit surprised that people my age did not like and understand this book. If anyone remembers there history, they would have known that Hawthorne nailed the Puritan ways with this book, and Hawthorne being a descendent of one of the Judges in the witch trials makes this book even better to read. The way he has written it shows that he is ashamed with his ancestors' ways. This book was shorter then most I have read and simply to the point. Although it's not my usual style of reading, I do have to say it was enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I guess I should have read the last review or even the fact that the description says Landscape. I didn't think it was necessary, it's just a book right?I guess it's supposed to be easier to read in bed. I just thought it would be cool to have the Scarlet Letter be a red book.If you buy this book you will be holding the book like a wall calendar and reading in two columns; first the two columns on the top page and then two columns on the bottom. This just seems really irritating to me."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"Scarlet Letter\\" may be an old book, but its themes are as applicable today as they were when the book was first written. It tells the story of a young woman, Hester, who gives birth to a child, Pearl, that is the daughter of the preacher, Arthur Dimmsdale. Hester's cold and calculating husband, Roger Chillingsworth, concocts ways of discovering the truth about Arthur and Hester's relationship, which taxes the young preacher's health greatly and ultimately leads to his demise. This classic of literature examines love, relationships, perceptions, and human actions. It proves that Hawthorne was a keen observer of human nature and was able to use his observations to write a legendary novel that is certain to retain its outstanding status far into the future."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This version (Modern Library) gets two stars because it is very well annotated. The book itself only deserves one star.Having now made it just more than halfway through this book, I have a theory as to why \\"no one reads the classics\\" anymore. It is probably because they were subjected to this turgid, boring book in high school, and came to the erroneous conclusion that all old books are this slow, long-winded, and tedious. How sad. Because of all the classics I have read (several hundred now), this is by far the slowest, windiest, and most tedious of them all.One of the first rules of writing is \\"show, don't tell.\\" This rule has applied as far back as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Book of Genesis. Well, Hawthorne is of the \\"tell until you are about to lose your reader--then show you a bit to string you along\\" school. He is wordy beyond description. His paragraphs are constructed of endless run-on sentences that have more side trips than a sorority girl's recounting of her weekend in Fort Lauderdale. In the first 43-page chapter, only three paragraphs have anything to do with the story (I'm not kidding).Once we get into the story, the pace picks up--but only slightly. We are presented with a series of long and endlessly wordy \\"sketches\\" that DESCRIBE the characters, their environment, and how they feel, and that bludgeon you with overt symbolism. We are TOLD all about the characters' internal and external conflicts, but we are SHOWN none of it. Again and again, I find myself thinking, \\"This boring description could have been made into a really great scene.\\" Instead, I find my mind numbly wandering as I wade through deep rivers of slow moving prose.Just when I am about to give up all hope of action or plot and throw the book down in disgust, Hawthorne injects a brief snippet of dialog that (barely) keeps me interested. But sadly, he uses these moments to make his characters melodramatic and cartoonish.Some examples:The evil physician is twisted, misshapen, and deformed; his face is dark, and a fire burns in his eyes. He speaks friendly words with sinister, hidden motives. (I'm surprised he doesn't twirl his mustache, too).Or, the tortured preacher is wasting away under his own inner conflict over some sin he has committed. He is weakening and clutches at a pain in his breast. (Gee, which sin could it be? Care to guess? Hawthorne pretty well telegraphs it so you won't be surprised when it's unveiled).Or, Hester feels a searing heat beneath her scarlet letter, and her daughter shows impish, devilish behavior-the living embodiment of Hester's sin.Okay, okay -- we get the point.In short, this book sucks.If you want to read a great American novel that is loaded with symbolism, read Moby Dick. While it, at times, is also challenging, slow, and meandering; it is also deep, layered, complex, and structurally interesting, and it actually delivers the money shot at the end. Oh, Lord, how it delivers. With this turkey, the journey is so painfully slow and uneventful I'll never find out if it delivers. I just don't care enough to finish. I guess I'll have to watch the movie...If this is your first classic and you are getting discouraged, don't. Quit reading it and try another one. There are hundreds of great books out there. This isn't one of them."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I read this book on my first year of college, as a student of English Language and Literature in the Universidade Cl&aacute;ssica de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal). To better understand the writer I also did a &quot;little&quot; research on him. That investigation gave me enough evidences to conclude that (as you can see in the SL) Hawthorne is better at creating ambiencies that at creating a solid, appealing plot, and more successful conceiving brief sketches of people and caricatures than at developing complete three-dimensional characters (since in the SL, the subconsious is well explicit to the reader, nothing being left to the reader to imagine). And why is this? Because even though Hawthorne is more commonly known as a novelist (due to his latter work, after the success of the SL), most of his legacy is composed of numerous short stories, and if you have the opportunity to read them, you will agree they are truly bewitching pieces of literature. But the fact is the literary &quot;establishment&quot; as always deemed short stories (as well as detective fiction)as lesser forms of literature. Hence, the focus given to this work of his, which may not be his better (but which evokes that &quot;ahead of its time&quot; aura some people seem to valorize so much in a book). So if you want to read Hawthorne at his best try his short stories (like &quot;The hands&quot;). But if you &quot;have&quot; to read this book, try to ignore its chronical lack of pace and the unevenness of the plot, whilst enjoing the little portraits of puritan life and those magical descriptive paragraphs where Hawthorne's imagination really soars high."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The classic book that is read by virtually every high school student in America ; and at a bargian price"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book is quite a great read, love it, and you can read the book in one sitting, it is quite interesting."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I did not remember how good this classic was until I read it again.

I remember reading it in high school and yeap, still almost as drawn out as it was back then. We both think the same thing. But, a good read nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter weaves a tale about the implications of sin and how we deal with the past. In an early colonial Puritan setting, Hester Pryne, the main character, must overcome extreme adversity to raise her child while persecuted by her community. Her struggle to cope mirrors that of another character: Arthur Dimmesdale. However, the introductory section of this book was repetitive, horrendous, and did not contribute any additional background to this book. Hawthorne's style, particularly the introductory section, is difficult to read because he expands his sentences until they seem only long complicated strands of words. It is confusing to understand. The sentences are protracted to the point that the readers are thrown off from the immense length of a single sentence. The plot drags very slowly and is not very exciting throughout the entire book. Though it has its moments, this book is difficult and extremely lacks flavor and uniqueness that distinguishes other books.The beginning of the book, excluding the introduction, seems typical of most books. The author sets up the settings and introduces Hester Pryne and her child. While setting up the situation, the book was remarkably easier to read than the introduction. Already, Hawthorne starts to weave out the theme of sin that consistently stays with this novel. The opening of the book was intriguing enough to continue reading as Hester's life unfolds. Hawthorne details the reasons why she is condemned and marked with the Letter A. Her encounter with Chillingworth is an impressive moment as he administers draughts and does greatly contribute to the plot. Hawthorne, indeed, has his redeeming qualities. However, by the end of the novel, his language and style wear down the reader's interest in the novel. Through a third-person view, Hawthorne distances Hester Pryne and her situation away from readers. It is this distance that hurts how readers interpret this book. Hawthorne's style seems to not stir any emotions. Hester's actions and her conflicts do not seem engaging. There is a general lack of emotional appeal.His style is another issue. His sentence structure is quite complicated due to his long sentences. He enjoys describing certain moments with symbolism. With Hester's departure from the jail, he points out to certain religious groups how saint-like she appears. Although this enriches the book, he continues to tag on additional references that eventually are overwhelming. With engorged sentences, he blandly creates 228 pages that are confusing, choppy, but occasionally entertaining and understandable.Overall, the book was quite interesting but was extremely complicated in its style as a whole. The plot does not stimulate readers to continue reading because of Hawthorne's complicated and distant style but the story itself is quite amusing. Hester and Arthur's struggle with their inner secrets and sins evokes sympathy. Though Hawthorne has a very complicated style of writing, he successfully manages to convey his main points. This book does not meet the specifications of being strong but neither is it weak. Though difficult to understand Hawthorne's style, the main theme and plot are easily understood. It would require some conviction to read this book but it is worth it. Readers will be able to enjoy this book based on their background experiences and though Hawthorne is a great writer, this book was occasionally too dull to excite many readers."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In general, I enjoy how Nathaniel Hawthorne singles Hester out and makes this book about psychological isolation, rather than a physical isolation. He sheds light on society, unafraid to advocate the cause of free thought and humanism, whether it be mankind's feats or flaws.The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne explores the human flaws of an intricate Puritan society, in which Hester Prynne is victimized; however, through a different point of view, she is actually fortunate to gain great insight and wisdom, as she triumphs over societal expectations. The Puritan community requires its citizens to act proper with decorum. When Hester violates that very belief, she becomes shunned from society. Devastated in the beginning, but she is quick to realize that it is not she that is odd, when in fact, it is the whole community that is at fault for treating her with malice. Instead of perishing in despair, like the town expects, she actually grows stronger everyday mentally. Contrary to what the town believes, Hester boldly opposes the norm, which in this case is a subtle flaw. As a result, Hester gains insight and wisdom, a gift that the town will never be able to attain. Thus, Nathaniel Hawthorne takes a stab at human flaws in the Puritan society, by revealing its foolishness through the eyes of Hester Prynne.In my opinion, Hawthorne is adept at pointing out society's flaws, and he writes what he truly believes so his audience would see the obscured flaws of society. Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter investigates the human flaws of a Puritan Society through the eyes of Hester, who ultimately triumphs over societal expectations; Hawthorne argues that in order for one to truly perceive flaws of an entity, one has to be boldly detached and thus objective of that entity. Hester is the epitome of a bold individual, who cares less about societal expectations, when she learns that it is not she that is peculiar, but it is the town that is unusual. It is not until then that she truly takes an objective stance and explores and studies the Puritan community. Able to overcome the initial despairs of desolation, Hester ultimately prevails through her eventual apathy towards the town's views. She does exactly what society does not expect her to do. Instead of diminishing, she stands even stronger than before, an attitude that annoys the rest. It is then that an individual truly defies the norm and understands societal flaws.I find that Hawthorne's theme in this book is much like that of The Catcher in the Rye. The idea of completely transforming a weakness into a strength is illustrated in both The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne and Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger demonstrated by Hester Prynne and Holden Caulfield, respectively. Both protagonists are shunned from society because of their inability to demonstrate \\"normal\\" behaviors; however, it is that very individuality that rewards them wisdom and insight of the societal flaws."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"It's important to realize that Hawthorne grew up in the same atmosphere as his protagonist Hester does in The Scarlet Letter. In this powerful novel, Hester is forced to wear an emblem of shame after having an affair with an unknown. Out of suffering the town's hatred and ridicule, Hester isolates herself and her new child away from the intolerant town. Yes, Hawthorne condemns the ignorant nature of the town as Hester is a walking symbol of strength. Hawthorne depicts the towns members of doing evil things against her such as conspiring to take away her child in response to her refusing to reveal her lover's name. But then, the novel takes an interesting turn as Hester questions the eternal state of her soul. Is she a true sinner for having this child out of honest love? Would a higher being punish Hester for such a thing? The characters in the plot will all beg for your sympathy, and you will want to give each character as much as you can. Hester's husband may be sadistic and completely unsympathetic, but he has nevertheless been a victim of her affair. Hester's lover is constantly in a pitiful state. In addition to garnering sympathy, it's interesting how Hawthorne manipulates the roles of each character in the plot so that they serve as symbols of Hawthorne's greater purpose. This is the case particularly with Hester's child, Pearl. As you read this, pay close attention to her role as the catalyst for all of what happens in the plot and the transformations she causes all the characters to experience towards the end. This was an extremely moving tale, though not completely perfect. It lagged on after the beginning to a point where the reader wasn't that active in the plot anymore. For me, I felt that the focus was shifted away from certain aspects I thought were more important. Overall, I've read Hawthorne's other short stories and this wasn't his best but he had a fascinating obession with religion and its impact on American society."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"wow, this book was a hard one to start, but in the end it was rewarding.Many of the scenes drag on forever and it seems like there are descriptions of every little speck of dust flying in the air but trust me. You'll get throught it. The worst part is the beginning when all the scenes seem to be one long monotonous picture that won't change. Nothing seems to happen.But, actually something does. The understanding of this book starts at the beginning and for the reasons above, that can be easily missed. As Hesther walks down with everyone watching her carry her baby, her ties to her husband as well as the father of the child are revealed. There is symbolism with every element of nature that is examined and this all completes the story. Without this you will suffer much confusion or you might just feel like you are left out of something in the story.both authors reveal the effect original sin has on one's soul and the different ways of dealing with that sin.My advice to you...read the book to understand it and to cherish, not just to get it done. This book doesn't deserve that. It teaches many morals, such as the struggle within one's self over sin as Hawthorne reveals the effect original sin has on one's soul and the different ways of dealing with that sin."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hester Prynne is a young woman who has committed adultery. As punishment for what her Puritan religion considers being a crime, Hester is branded with the letter \`A'. Hester must wear the letter, which has been beautifully embroidered in scarlet onto her gown, to remind her of the burdens she carries because of her sin; a second husband, Mr. Dimmesdale, a daughter, Pearl, and a town full of enemies who consider her irrational. The commotion that Hester's affair caused was not pleasant. Many shunned and abandoned poor Hester. She was left to fend for herself and newborn daughter with no help from her husband or anyone else. Even Mr. Dimmesdale, the local Puritan church leader who was involved in Hester's affair, turns against her by charging her of the crime! Dimmesdale tries his hardest to cover up his mistake but Hester endures more sorrow and feels even more damaged than him. Although Hester Prynne's decision to betray her husband and her religion may not have been a good one, Hawthorne proves that she is not the only one who deserves to be punished. He criticizes the Puritan ways and shows that sometimes punishment isn't necessary; when the person being punished has learned a lesson.Pearl is in a way punished as well, for something she does not know about. Although the young girl grows up happy and almost carefree, she really isn't. Her mother learns to love her even though she was born by a sin and eventually she meets her father who loves her as well.Even after Hester has showed her town she can raise a child \\"the Puritan way\\" without any trouble, it takes them awhile to realize that Hester really shouldn't have had to suffer so much pain and sorrow for something that was not any different from things they had done. Hawthorne's novel is stunningly well written and teaches a valuable lesson to the reader; be true to everyone, even yourself. \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is a timely classic that should be remembered always and forever. The last sentence of Nathaniel Hawthorne's amazing novel sums up the entire book perfectly: \\"On a field sable, the letter \`A' gules.\\" This is a great book for anyone who loves suspense, drama, love, and authors who write with a passion that allows the reader to visualize what's happening and feel the heartache that Hester felt."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I was very pleased. I received exactly what I wanted in a timely manner."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The scarlet letter is a very nice book. I have to admit that it is written in old fashioned English, what made it a little bit difficult to read. The author kept the story catchy by telling al the details about the characters. So finally I liked the book very well and recommend this book to everyone who likes to read and learn something from a book. It shows the reader what kind of trouble lying brings."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I read this book when I was 16 and I totally fell in love with it. I love the power it hands over to women. Hawthorne does a great job in illustrating the kind of prejudice society extends to women for actions that can be equally distributed to men but even more so he shows the determination of a woman to overcome whatever adversities may be present with renewed pride and dignity."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I purchased this book because I was told that in junior year it's required to read this novel. Instead my teacher showed us a movie version that follows the book exactally, but I decided to read the book for fun. If it wouldn't have been for the help of my English teacher I never would have understood this novel, but from what I did gather it had a great story and wonderful moral. If you are good at reading Hawthorne's style of writing, I suggest you read it because it is good, just hard to follow at times."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I will admit that shipping did not go as planned but that was not on the sellers part. My mailman forgot to put it in my mailbox the day i was to get it. The book was in excellent condition and i will consult them for further book-buying. The book was new like it said it was. Way to go people. =)"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I was supposed to read this for English class,and had some interest because I\`ve heard people and my teacher say that this was an American classic and was very good.But once I heard some of my friends who started to read it and say it was difficult and boring,I got the book on audio to assist me.I only got to chapter 3 and I was trying to guess how many pages were left to the end.Its uniteresting and difficult because the story wanders with absolutly no direction.I highly recomend getting Cliff Notes(which I got and are very easy to understand compared to the book) and possibly the movie(It might not be the same to the book, but having the visual aid of Demi Moore certainly helps the mind focus better)."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is one of the all-time most boring books. I do not recommend reading it at all. The introduction is incredibly long, and incredibly boring. Also, it doesn't really have the sort of plot that would make it a book you can't put down. I personally fell asleep four different times reading this book. I had much higher expectations for this book. If you are looking for a classic to read, I would recommend The Count Of Monte Cristo, not this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I had to read this book, which I had heard quite a bit about, for school but after reading it I had no idea why it is considered such a classic. There is no question that the language is old-fashioned and difficult, but that isn't the only problem I found with it. The whole story was rather boring. It seemed that the author tried to make a lightweight story about an affair and the child that was a product of it deeper or more important by describing how the characters felt. The book was not exactly bad, but, like many other books, it does not really deserve its status as a classic. I saw it more as a book that showed somewhat the morals and ideas of the Puritans. While it is good in that sense, I don't think that it is very important in modern times, and it certainly wasn't a fun read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I feel that the Scarlet Letter is one of the most instense novels I have ever read. The symbolism and the characters draw you further and further into the novel. There are many different themes and aspects of the characters that you can anylize. Further more I don't feel like writing anything else so that's it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I think this novel by Hawthorne was an incredible work of art and should continually read by not only high school students-but people of all ages. The topics, and ideas discussed take a deep look at the dark side of the human soul. An excellent novel!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"First of all: those who found the book to be dull, such as me, listen to it on tape (it's abbreviated yet still dangerous = boring to listen to while driving, as I found out). Indeed, Hawthorne introduces some advanced ideas for the times, such as writing about a single mother, as well as musings about women's rights. His obsession with Victorian themes, such as the deification of children, fixation on bodily sins, as well as overdramatization and simplification of the plot equals predictability and annoyance to the reader. While this book could probably be considered &quot;a classic,&quot; such as Tolstoy's &quot;Anna Karenina,&quot; both are better classified as carefully crafted literary exercises rather than engaging stories."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Aghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, this the worst book i've ever read, I consider myself open to all fine lterature but I absolutely hate this book. But the writing is superb!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Yes the writing is poetic...but the book says the same thing over and over. I didn't feel like I learned anything from reading this book, the characters are rather flat and the symbols are far too obvious and there is too many of them. It's like Hawrthorne had a contest with himself to see how many symbols he could cram in."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I first heard of the classic novel &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; when I was in fifth grade. My mom told me a brief description of the story, and her thoughts on the book made me want to read it. I finally got the chance to read it this year, and I was greatly disappointed. The novel failed to hold my interest at any point in the story. I could only read so many pages at one time as I found my thoughts wandering away from the story of Hester Prynne, her young daughter Pearl, and the affair that she had with one of the ministers in Boston. The vocabulary was quite advanced and often hard to comprehend. The lengthy descriptions of Hester's agony over this great sin she has committed were quite repetitive. When Nathaniel Hawthorne adds the complicated vocabulary to the descriptions of Hester that go on page after page, it creates frustration and a sense of hopelessness for the reader. Most of the time, I knew what Hester was thinking or what she was going to say before she thought it or said it. Even through all of the tedious descriptions, it was hard for me to identify with Hester Prynne since I have never been in her type of situation before. The only aspect of the novel that I really understood was the Puritan way of life. Hawthorne's description of the way that the Puritans lived was quite accurate. The Puritans were a very religious society based on high morals and respect. Once one did something to shame those morals, they were ultimately shunned from society. This aspect of Puritan society was one of the only points that was well illustrated by Hawthorne. Overall, the book was lifeless. I would recommend this book only to someone who has a large amount of both patience and time."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The whole time reading The Scarlet Letter I thought that it was just extremely interesting. The characters were well-developed and at times, endearing. The way that Hawthorne is able to describe the torture that Reverend Dimmesdale undergoes is very believable. Although I am only thirteen years old and have never committed adultery, I find it easy to relate to Hester Prynne. And Pearl, my most favorite of all the characters, just adds a very interesting touch to the story. Despite the good characters, I did not like the fact that during most of the book, parts of the main plot are dismissed for chapters at a time to describe something not always commpletely relevent to the story. But, overall, I thought this book was very interesting, and would definately take the time to read it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The scarlet letter was one of the best books i've ever read, and the only reason i'm putting in my 2 cents is because i've noticed the negative reaviews and i just want to clarify something - this is NOT a boring book at all - if you are in any way intellegent. This isn't dick and jane people. don't expect it to be a walk in the park. yes, the language does talk a little while to get used to, but once you do it draws you into the story. this book is anything but boring, but if you did find yourself falling asleep it probably wasn't the book that was bad, just your reading level. I highly highly highly reccomend this book. the characters are fully and beautifully developed and the symbolism, foreshadow, and imagery are all delicous."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"It is no secret that Nathaniel Hawthorne is a household name of our time, mentioned in almost every book group, every school, and has touched every American's bookshelf at least briefly. When writing a review on such a classic masterpiece, it is hard to evaluate the faults in The Scarlet Letter. I started thinking about what in the novel I could detract points for, I thought of nothing. Ornate detail, reflective thoughts, chapters that literally push Mach 6 and an example of irony that defeats all other novel's attempt to insert the literary tool into their work(s). Some complain about the Shakespereon language used, but one must consider that this was the toungue in the time the novel was set. To base critisism soley on that would be similar to rejecting The Beatles for not sounding like Eminem. Hawthorne did not write this novel overnight, many revisions were made and the work itself reflects that. Many subtle details are hidden between the lines of almost every sentence, and the reader never knows first hand which sentence can possibly foretell another event in a later chapter. One is constantly guessing at outcomes of the novel until the bittersweet end and it is this, above all else, that gives The Scarlet Letter it's place on the throne. Definatly pick up the novel, but buy it, there are so many notes one must make in various chapters in order to fully comprehend the magnitude of the piece. It is, without a doubt, five star reading and will continue to carry that rank in my mind and in the mind of many other reviewers as well. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"One of the greatest novels in all of literature, The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne tells of a life vastly different from those that we live today. Rejecting the present permissive lifestyle to which we are accustomed, the reader is entrenched in the gloom and doom of Puritan society. It is an exposure to a law that tells us what to wear, how to think, and whom to love. The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature, hypocrisy, and of undeniable passions.Enlightening and refreshing, the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately, beyond the limits that society sets. A novel that can be enjoyed by all ages, The Scarlet Letter is a masterpiece of its time."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is an excellent book. Hawthorne spends so much time discussing the characters' thoughts and motives that by the end of the book, you can understand why the people act the way they do. It makes them seem almost real. He relates nature to what the character's are experiencing that makes the story even more powerful. In one place he told of a rose bush that grew by the prison so it seemed Nature was saying that even though other people had abandoned them, someone could always count on the nature's love. It's very beautifully written. The story of adultery and jealous spouses happens in our own day which makes The Scarlet Letter relate to the reader. It's just a great book all over, and I feel that it's one of the best ever written."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book is one of the greatest classics of American literature, and my personal favortie. It is the story of Hester Prynne, a strong woman who struggles between her society's austere piety and the callings of her heart. She must hide her beautiful fire beneath gray simplicity, yet she has a badge with which she can proclaim her true spirit to the world. Through her scarlet letter and her illegetimate child Pearl (who herslef is a nonconformist in the true Emersonian spirit), Hester is a mirror of truth in her smothered and pious surroundings. Hawthorne proves his skill through exquisite descripions and proves his wisdom as he explores the impossibilities of feminine nature. This is a book that everyone should read, not only as a classic, but also as an extraordinary piece of literature that rings true even today."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"A short novel portraying the life struggles of a young woman named Hester Prynne who is shunned by the rest of her society by commiting the crime of adultery. The product of this crime was her daughter, Pearl. Pearl is stuck in the middle and sometimes even seen as evil by the town's people because she was the product of this crime. Hester, however shunned, still stands tall and proud. She's a strong woman that doesn't really care what people think of her. The only other person that sticks by her side is her lover, Arthur Dimmsdale. I liked this book, but I did not enjoy the way that Hawthorne refers to &quot;the reader&quot;. It pulled away from the story. I do, however, still recommend that one reads this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"By reading the title of my reviw, most would probably not believe that I am an 11th grade student who was initially 'forced' to read &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; for an assignment. I knew of the book before I read it, and had been interested in it and its plot for some time before, as, for some reason, I'm utterly infatuated by the American Puritan period. I read &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; on the day I recieved it, and found it amazing, one of the best books I've read; very true to its title of &quot;classic&quot;. They don't write books like this anymore; pity. The &quot;copious style&quot; of Hawthorne is not for everyone, but it certainly was for me; as, being an 'aspiring writer' myself, who loves to explore language, I found the style inspiring with incredibly beautiful discriptives. Some also find the book to be slowly paced, but, then again, what is the pace your teacher is making the class read it at? If they told you to sit down and read it as a normal book, it would pace itself much quicker. The plot is timeless, and a change for those involved with today's plot-driven and bland tales, the language is masterful, the characters thought-out and filled with emotion. I truly enjoyed this book. And, to whoever said the book wasn't 'romantic in any way', they're gravely mistaken, as &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; itself was indeed a book of the 'Romantic' period of American lit..."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I think that the book was ok.

The symbolism surrounding such objects as the &quot;A&quot; itself, the blacken weeds, and the sign in the sky make the story deep, and leave much of it open for interpretation. Hawthorne's use of details was also very good. His descriptions added so much to the plot and setting, but mostly to the symbolism of the book. I think the book is definitely a &quot;must read.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Admittedly this book is difficult to read, but that is part of the wonderful challenge. The story twists and turns with plots, subplots and all of the heresy of the time.I have seen the movie,however some plots are not included.

Take you time, enjoy the difference in writing style and really get to know the characters in this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I agree with just about everything that has been said about this book.

This book is the topper to any great collection."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter is a tale of secret love, adultery, and sadness. Every person should read this timeless American novel at some point in their life. The strength of Hester Prynne is unusual for novels composed during the time this was published, and is therefore a revolutionary literary work. My only complaint is the length of \\"The Custom House,\\" however horrible this sounds, I would just skip it, it does not add to the plot of the novel anyway."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I read Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter for my Advanced English 11 class. This is not a book I would normally have picked up and read, but I am glad that I read it.The Scarlet Letter deals with themes of love, society's oppression, secrets, a character finding herself, as well as numerous other classic literature themes. I found the book itself to be challenging to read, but I liked the story. Hawthorne explores when feelings and passion conflict with religion, which was fascinating to consider from a religious perspective.Although I did not enjoy the book much at the time I had to read it, it proved to be quite useful when I took the AP Literature and Composition Test this year. When I had to choose one book to frantically review the day before the test, this is the book I chose. Sure enough, this is the book I used for the AP test as a reference.This is an essential book for anyone taking AP Literature."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot, once I got past the slow parts. Hester Prynne is found pregnant out of wedlock. Since she won't reveal the identity of the father, she is forced to wear the Scarlet Letter \\"A\\" on her chest for the rest of her life. She gives birth to a girl and she changes her life around, so at the end of the book, people refer to her as \\"Angel\\" instead of \\"Adulterer.\\"This is a timeless tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period. When we do something wrong, the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character. One event does not define us. It's our entire lives that should be taken into account. I think that is Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. Redemption is possible for anyone, regardless of their sin. Also, the father who remained unknown to the society but not the reader, suffers enormously because he doesn't confess. This is a good point. When we hide our sins, the only person it ultimately hurts, is us."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"After the short introduction about the Scarlet Letter, the story unfolds with Hester Prynne, the protagonist, beginning the second part of her life, branded with a Scarlet Letter A for adultery. Standing on a scaffold garnering public humiliation, Hester is questioned about her partner-in-sin -Arthur Dimmesdale. However, Hester refuses to answer, preferring to bear her sin and punishment alone. Dialogue between the townspeople before the questioning depicts a harsh community, unforgiving with sin and falling out of line. However, Hester painfully endures all this and readily accepts her sin, portraying her strong character already. At the beginning of her punishment, Hester is shunned from the rest of the community. Eventually though, she contributes to her society more by volunteering. She integrates her scarlet letter, a constant daily reminder of her wrongdoing, into her life, and moves on. Interestingly enough, the protagonist -depicted as a strong independent character -is a woman. Hester's child, the only pure and innocent character Pearl, is also female. Ironically, Pearl was created through adultery, a severe sin, and therefore would not be considered pure in anyway. However, her name suggests the most beautiful form of purity and cherishment. Contrasting, the morally weak, unable to move on from the past are males. Nathanial Hawthorne ingeniously establishes this female versus male motif, praising the woman's strength of suffering while denouncing the men's weakness.Through Dimmesdale's character, Hawthorne explores guilt's destructivity of human beings. Beginning as a strong revered preacher, Dimmesdale's guilt of sin eats him away inside, leaving him only an empty shell. Hawthorne carefully depicts this deterioration, masterfully capturing each emotion felt by Dimmesdale. Hawthorne creates yet another round character with the physician -the leech - Roger Chillingworth. Driven by an injured pride, Chillingworth sets his life goal to ruin his adversary. His internal overwhelming anger hidden by a calm composed countenance only furthers his horrifying intrinsic nature. Still, Chillingworth's character is weak, unable to forget the past and accept the present circumstances. He wastes his life away, attaining happiness from another's misery -a creepy yet temporary way of life. Able to extend his characters to the deepest of human emotion, Hawthorne develops his characters, though unrealistically, to form an impressionable memory in the reader.Symbols scattered throughout the story render The Scarlet Letter a clever, well-thought-out book. The most obvious symbol would be the physical scarlet letter, a shameful A representing adultery. However, it is described as wonderfully embellished, glittering with a gold outline -a symbol of beauty and confidence. The reader wonders what Hawthorne's opinion about sin really is -an unforgivable crime or an ignition sparking personal growth. Also, Hawthorne's naming perfectly matches each character's personality. For example, Dimmesdale, is the most gray, melancholy and miserable character (although we do not pity him for his character is weak), garnering the name DIMmesdale. Chillingworth is, from \\"chill\\", a cold character, distancing himself from everyone and whose only purpose is to ruin another.In all his stories, Hawthorne's writing style can be best described as ambiguous and delightfully detailed. The ambiguity establishes a sense of curiosity in the reader -leaving the reader wanting to know more about Hester's story. At the end, Hawthorne speaks about the Scarlet Letter -has it become a symbol of hope or failure? Also, his long detailed sentences places images after images in the reader's head, transporting the reader back to Hester's time. Thus, the reader is more involved in the book, no longer in his present but the past.The Scarlet Letter uses a variety of hidden clever symbols, and implements an ambiguous but detailed style into his story. Setting his story in a strict Puritan community, Hawthorne presents a strong feminist view of a male-dominated society. My favorite though? The character development."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In high school, which was quite some time ago, I \\"had\\" to read this story and if I needed a quick nap all I needed to do was pull out Scarlet Letter. Many years later I read it again. I knew there was a reason that Hawthorne had this grip on me. His writing is so dark, yet wonderfully illuminating. No one utilizes symbols better than Hawthorne. The idea that Hester lives on the edge between the city and the woods is a great example of how that represents her situation. It's absolutley brilliant. Also, there has to be a connection to Hawthorne's anguish through the character of Pastor Dimmesdale. The idea of living with so much guilt in a community that was intolerant of 'mortal' sins reveals the soul of Hawthorne and the quiet cry of a man tortured with his past.I would highly recommend other stories of his, novels or short stories, in order to better understand his anguish and desire for perfection. Once I read other stories it made this novel so much easier to understand. This is on level with Romeo and Juliet without the feud.Scott A.

I tend to limit my reading these days to two primary realms, classic literature and early 20th Century fiction, and this one just didn't measure up to the standard set by other famous authors of Hawthorne's day.It's a simple story about scandal and I guess I was expecting so much more. I wish I could say it was superbly-written but I think that it reflects a lack of committed effort on Hawthorne's part."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"When people think of a \\"scarlet letter,\\" we immediate think of a person outwardly branded for something they have done. Credit Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" for that -- it's an intense, impassioned (if slightly hammy) story of a strong-willed woman in Puritan New England, who is branded for her sins and her love for one weak man.In the mid-1600s, a passionate young woman named Hester Prynne has been accused of adultery -- she recently had a baby, even though her husband was abroad. Just as damning to the elders is the fact that she won't name baby Pearl's father. Even her estranged husband -- a cold-hearted older man calling himself Roger Chillingworth -- wants to know her lover's identity, but Hester steadfastly refuses to even hint at the man's identity.We learn early in the book that Pearl's dad is actually the local minister Arthur Dimmesdale, who is wracked with guilt, hallucinations and sickness because of his secret adultery. Chillingworth slowly deduces who his wife's lover was, and begins to scheme revenge on Dimmesdale. Will the former lovers manage to escape their guilt-ridden lives, or will they reveal the truth to everyone?It sounds like \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is JUST a story about guilt and sin, but it's also a story about love and steadfastness. Hester remains strong and kind throughout her life despite others' cruelty to her, and her love for Dimmesdale and Pearl is what gives her that strength. Chillingworth (symbolic name!) is a cuckold, but it's impossible to like him because of his lack of love -- he loves no one, and lives only for revenge.And at the same time, Hawthorne reminds us that goodness can overcome your past sins. Hester slowly overcomes the Puritans' loathing for her by simply being charitable, kind, helpful and loving, until eventually her sin is eclipsed by her virtues. On the flip side, Dimmesdale is annoying because of his weakness and cowardice -- I know he's supposed to be wracked with guilt, but he's so pathetic compared to Hester that it's just infuriating.Hawthorne's writing may take a little while for modern audiences to get used to. It's very 19th-century in style, with staid, slightly stuffy prose gilded with hauntingly poetic moments and intense passion (\\"Never, never!\\" whispered she. \\"What we did had a consecration of its own\\"). At times Hawthorne's story gets a little... hammy (such as Dimmesdale revealing his \\"A\\" burn scar), but the power of his story keeps this from getting silly.\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is used to describe outward signs of guilt, but Hawthorne's novel is actually about strength and love, and how they can blot out misdeeds."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"It is hard to imagine the world Hawthorne creates, but he brings it to life completely.

It's a pity for women of the 1700s to be treated the way Hester Prynne was. Equality and understanding between the sexes, women's liberation and empowerment have indeed gone a long way since that time, though there are still societies in the present that place a low regard to women. The situation of the society at the time being so, it was remarkable of Hester to be very resilient and faithful - either that was her nature as a very unique woman of her time or probably more because she was a mother looking after the sake of her child.Though short, I took time reading this book as I had to go back not a few times for better understanding of a very dated prose. That notwithstanding, it was very well written as to hold the interest of the reader; it is full of timeless lessons about faith, forgiveness, judgment, humility, love, resilience...the list is endless."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Read it for the first as a school project and fell in love with it.

While I did enjoy it eventually it does have a very slow beginning. It has a good plot though and is a great way to understand the period in which Hawthorne wrote.In my opinion this novel has one major flaw; metaphors. Yes most novels employ literary elements yet Hawthorne goes over board. He will give you a metaphor, give you another metaphor the same thing in case you didn't understand the first one; he will then flat out explain what the metaphor was.

Very Pleased!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel HawthorneThe Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a great American novel!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The two missing stars are the result of Hawthorne's abuse of repetitions throughout the novel.At times, the novel is redundant - while it might have served to emphasize the author's purpose, Hawthorne's repetitiveness is an overkill. His point could have been delivered in one piece even if he cuts multiple parts out from the novel. Like Korean dramas (Hawthorne even captures the love triangle and illegitimate aspects of said dramas), this book is a complete drag - but only in the beginning and ending. The parts that connect the two are at times, either intriguing and twisted or completely dull and uneventful. These sudden, drastic changes are often hard for readers to adjust to when trying to focus and decipher what is going on.Despite Hawthorne's verbosity, the novel should be merited for its moral conflicts posed of the society. The ostracized, as Hawthorne portrays, can be good and unaffected by the majority; the community, on the other hand, is unforgiving and hypocritical of what they say. The characters in the novel are set to explore the moral boundaries of human nature - the community, in fact, is a microcosm of the world. This sets up the entire novel to be an example of man vs society, with Hester and pearl representing man and the Puritan society as society.There is heavy symbolism in the novel: from the letter A to the entire community or even Pearl, each little detail carries a double meaning that contributes to the build-up of the book's climax. Because of Hawthorne's repetitive style, these symbols are easy to notice and hard to overlook. They are motifs that keep recurring throughout the novel as Hawthorne relentlessly inserts one every now and then.The denouement is in many ways disappointing. Of all possibilities, I could not imagine an ending less exciting than what Hawthorne has chosen. Otherwise, the story overall is worth a read for its in-depth analysis of the hypocrisies of the society."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I thought the book was good, but it was way too descriptive and wordy. It is about the consequences of a woman who committed adultry and has to suffer the conseqences of bearing an illigitimate child. It deals with the feelings of guilt and isolation. It gives us a history lesson as to how this type of crime was dealt with in the late seventeen hundreds (I think that's when it took place). The problem was that it was very wordy and overdescriptive. The author used huge words and I had to have a dictionaory with me at all times. The length of the book could have been cut in half if the author had been more direct and to the point. It was a good book, but it probably should not be read by a high school student like me. I say this not because of the subject matter, but because of the vocabulary and long sentences. It has some Shakspearian language in it (thou, art, thee) which make the simple plot even harder to understand.

This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader, but frustrate them as well.The fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant.

In a moment, however, wisely judging that one token of her shame would poorly serve to hide another, she took the baby on her arm, and, with a burning blush, and yet a haughty smile, and a glance that would not be abashed, looked around at her townspeople and neighbors. On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold-thread, appeared the letter A. It was so artistically done, and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy, that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore; and which was of a splendor in accordance with the taste of the age, but greatly neyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony. - Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter.You can always tell a patriarchal society from a matriarchal society. A patriarchal society, one ruled by males, is almost always more cruel, punitive, and coarse in general. A matriarchal society, one ruled by females, is usually more nurturing and accommodating in general. Male dominated societies are fearful and violent in most cases. Female dominated societies tend to be trusting with caution. Where even you see children suffering and women being abused, there are men in complete control. The unfortunate fact for us is that all societies today are ruled by men, at least all of the societies that I can think of are. I sure would like to see a female ruled society, just once. -"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I have made it a point to read as many classic novels as possible.

Witness strange old fashioned punishments and let your ethics be applied to this imaginative play. The Scarlet letter illustrates the message of being honest and embracing your flaws and your talents or else it will lead to your downfall. When Hester is punished to wear her scarlet letter and to be publicly ridiculed for her sins, Hester chooses to avoid as much human contact as possible. Whenever she had to go into public she described her goings as torture, for every single person in town was looking down at her with shame and disgust. As Hester deals with her punishment and her troublesome child, Pearl, Hester learns to use her skills with crafts to help those in need. Honesty is also shown as an essential lesson in Scarlet letter as seen through the downfall of Pastor Dimmesdale, who refuses to tell anyone that he was Hester's partner in sin, in fear that it would ruin his prestige. His evil secret eventually drove him mad and he soon became cursed with visions and serious health problems. He eventually was unable to take the guilt of lying to his congregation and confesses to his followers who became shocked at such an unbelievable confession of such a \\"holy\\" man. Read this book and experience the plot come alive with its dark imagery and masterful writing! I highly recommend this book for those who are interested in historical fiction, and the message of the book will never be forgotten, it encourages the need of forgiveness for the regretful and proves that redemption can be found by anyone."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Written in 1850, The Scarlet Letter is a work of art and brilliance. Hawthorne's intricate writing and entrancing plot make this novel a classic in American Literature. The characters and the symbols they represent can keep even the most critical readers lost in thought. The book itself seems not to be written as merely a story, but rather as a lesson for the reader, often leaving one lost in thought for days after finishing.The book opens with a long, somewhat unnecessary introduction. If you are an impatient reader, skip this. It is not necessary to the overall plot. However, once you move into the actual story, the novel is hard to put away. I spent two weeks reading a novel that I usually could read in two days. The language is dense and the ideas masked and I often found myself re-reading the same paragraph, page, or even chapter just to ensure that I had found the real meaning.The main character, Hester Prynne, is found to have had an adulterous affair with an unknown and unannounced lover and to be with child. Living in a puritan society, her punishment is harsh since the Bible is their law. She is forced to stand on a scaffold with her illegitimate child and bear the discrimination of the town. Furthermore, Hester is required to wear a letter \\"A\\" on her breast to show the extent of her sins for the rest of her life. The priest of the town, the Reverend Dimmsdale, takes pity on her and tries to console Hester and her daughter Pearl. To further complicate things, Hester's husband, a man now known as Chillingworth, returns to the town after a two-year absence. Disgraced by his wife's actions, he pretends to be a physician to avoid any relation with Hester's scandalous acts. The novel progresses through the drama and effects of the psyche on the characters.Overall, the writing style, while sometimes dense and difficult to comprehend, is unique and entrancing to read. A bit forward in his approach, Hawthorne lavishes in detail and thought of the characters, acting as God and narrator. The book, admittedly, is hard to read and often simply confusing as to what Hawthorne is trying to get at. Despite all of these shortcomings, I still find that the novel is one worth reading over and over again. It is one of those books that can be read thirty times, yet still manages to hold another surprise the thirty-first."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I was quite skeptical when my teacher told my class to read this book, as I knew it was another \\"Hawthorne\\" book that the English Department required the students to read. But as soon as I read past the intro where the narrator introduces himself to the readers, I actually found this book quite fascinating and quickly began to appreciate Hawthorne's writing. The Scarlet Letter revolves around the life of a young woman who is branded as an adulteress who must wear a scarlet letter A on her chest. She is ostracized by her town and also has an unforgiving husband who wants to do much harm to her lover. It goes on to chronicle how the young woman, Hester Prynne, overcomes the odds of being ostracized and accepts her sins and grows as a person.One hesitation readers might come across when trying to read this book is its language used by Hawthorne in the book. This was one of my biggest challenges when reading this book because there were times when I did not understand the language and thus could not understand Hawthorne's purpose in writing a certain phrase or sentence. But other than that, I thought that this book was extremely well written not in the sense that it is by a \\"famous\\" writer, but that it teaches readers to question their own morals and ideals. This book is a book that cannot be read only once, as the first time, it is read to be understand but the second time it is read to be enjoyed.Though The Scarlet letter was written in a time where women did not have much say in their societies, it is evident through the narrator's tone that Hawthorne had much respect for women and illustrated Hester as someone who was strong and independent. Because of his illustrations of women as courageous, individual figures, Hawthorne not only depicts one side of the society, but rather two. I understand there are many of you that may find this book boring or just another assignment to be finished, but I strongly suggest you to read The Scarlet Letter because not only does it have a story that is entertaining, it contains lessons that teach us about our own morals that can be applied even 100 years from now."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hester Pryn is a flawed selfish vain young woman who at the beginning of this novel has been caught by the Puritans for the Crime of Adultery and punished by being forced to wear a scarlet letter, the letter A, for all to see so they may know her crime Adultery which she will have to wear until she repents and names the man with whom she sinned (he turns out to be the colony preacher). She has also born a child as a consequence of her misbehavior.Her husband offers to reconcile If she repents and names her seducer. (He's ready to believe she is a victim).Her vanity prevents her.This is a novel of flawed people. Pryn's vanity. The parson's moral doubts. Chillingsworth's fury.A nice period piece. It is really hard to sympathize with anyone other than Pearl, Hester Pryn's daughter.Ironicy I find myself wondering about Chillingsworth, once he gets his revenge he just ages up and dies but before he dies he makes Pearl his heir giving her a vast fortune."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"It is not as much about adultery as it is about the corruption of unconfessed and unforgiven sin. Adultery is simply a vehicle for the author to deliver the underlying message and compare the lives, minds and souls of two sinners and the secret they share. The writing is in the Puritan style which befits the time period and the mindset of the characters. Some have complained about the language as being outdated but this is not a valid concern. The book should be read as the author intended. The style becomes easy to read with exposure to other period works. The Puritans preached much about sin as the evil of evils and how it corrupted the entire being. The true scarlet letter is the one worn within that sears the soul and not the one worn without. Hester's sin leads to redemption. Her public humiliation and shame is simply a mirror of the sin hidden within the people she lives with. Her public punishment is an expression of other's fear of contamination by sin as self judgment turned outward. The error of the townspeople is in their hardness of heart in failing to pray and help bring the sinner home. Here, piety itself becomes religion rather than love of God and fellow man. Such outward piety without true love is a stumbling block to salvation and is paradoxically sinful. Shame and fear of public humiliation and becomming an outcast stands in the way of confession of sin and ultimately forgiveness and salvation. Hawthorne hangs the millstone around the neck of false and self-deceptive piety. This is timeless lesson and the stuff of great literature."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I liked this book as I was reading it. It was really interesting to see Puritan life through Hester Prynne's eyes. I think one reason that I liked it has to do with the fact that I skipped reading the first part, \\"The Custom House.\\" I didn't read it when the teacher told the class to read it, and I wrote a paper on it and got an A.All in all, a good book, but I don't think I would've gotten through more than half of it if I hadn't been pushed into it by my English class. Looking back, though, I'm glad I read it because a lot of other works have some thing(s) in common with \\"The Scarlet Letter,\\" and it would be a shame to graduate with a degree in English without reading it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"While it's true that Hawthorne's style requires concentration, one is rewarded for one's efforts with total immersion in the alternately stark and lush atmosphere that permeates The Scarlet Letter, in both emotional and physical terms. The narrator makes his observations as an outsider, not pretending to know exactly what is going on, but nonetheless giving us many spot-on psychological insights. As a modern reader I wonder is Pearl autistic? Is Dimmesdale bipolar? Hawthorne's non-judgemental observations on shame and avoidance are especially poignant. Personally I love Hawthorne's style, but I love learning new words in my lucubrations. :)My main reason for writing this review, however, is to warn people that this edition includes copious typos. As noted above, I like to look up words, and I had the dangest time finding the meaning for 'daim' on pages 9 and 121 before I compared them and realized they were typos for 'claim'. By the time I got to 'sweemess' on page 252 I knew it must be a typo, as many other such instances had occurred throughout the book. Typos are always annoying but they are pernicious in a book which contains much archaic language. Shame on the editors at Everyman's Library. I will not purchase their editions in the future."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I'm a highschooler and this is one of the best books I've ever read. It isn't dull (except for the chapter on Hester's sewing and the first chapter), it's beautiful. Yes, it has many descriptions, but it's symbolic and beautiful, and if you don't understand them, then you need to think more.Yes, what happened in Puritan times is irrelevant now. But so is 9/11 and we keep whining on that still. It's past, but it's still a beautiful story about strength, courage, and the preassures of society. It's inspiring."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is about a woman named Hester Prynne who lives in a New England Puritan village. She wears the scarlet letter A for adultery because she has sinned by having an illegitimate baby. She thinks that she is a widow, but little does she know that her hustband is alive and has hiddne his identity. Her hustband finds out that she is wearing the scarlet letter. He tries to find the man that is the father of the baby and torment him.The Scarlet Letter was a little harder than some of the other books that i read. I found it interesting to read the old English. I didn't really like the story that much because it was boring and it was in old English and i didn't like that very much other then that it was a good read. I like how he described the people.I would recommend this book to people who like historical fiction and like to read old English. Also if you like to try different types of genres then i would suggest this book i hope you enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book is very interesting! Unfortunately it's hard to understand. The version I read was Barnes and Noble Classics 2003, with notes by Nancy Stade. It's about how people deal with sin. What would you do if you were involved with adultery? Hester Prynne had to wear a scarlet A on her clothes as a mark of shame to \\"purify\\" her. Arthur Dimmesdale hid his secret for seven years, which tormented him with guilt. Roger Chillingsworth lived a bitter and revengeful life after the incident. I would recommend this book for people who can understand old English. It is a story with a good moral. It talks about confessing sin, the consequences of sin, and forgiving others. - Daniel W."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"My daughter needed this book for school and specifically needed an edition with the custom house. We \\"looked inside this book\\" on line and it shows that it includes the custom house. When the book arrived, it did not include the custom house. Very disappointed as we took the time to check and she needed this for class."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a great novel. It takes place in Boston, Massachusetts during the era when Puritans were there. The main character Hester Prynne is forced to wear a Scarlet Letter A for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from Europe.The book really recaptures what Puritanism was like. Its interesting to think about what America would be like if we were still Puritan. A theme of the book is concealed guilt. The minister Arthur Dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain. The message of the book is that you shouldn't let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your life.The book denounces the religious atmosphere of the Puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of Old England. You get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of Chaucer was lost in America due to the influence of the Puritans."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"An extremely pared-down version of the classic, but it was still very enjoyable. Very appropriate for readers who are frustrated by the flowery language found in many classics.

Thank you!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I absolutely loved this book, it was so engrossing, could not put it down. Hawthorne has wonderful descriptions, it is a fascinating time in history and he brings it alive. A flawless book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I started off a review of the more famous of 19th American writer Nathaniel Hawthorne's short stories by noting that the old social democratic literary critic and editor of \\"Dissent\\", Irving Howe, once noted that Mark Twain, and his post-Civil War works represented a dramatic break from the Euro-centric ante bellum American literary establishment. And on this question I agree with him. As I do on his choice of Nathaniel Hawthorne as an exemplar of that tradition. Certainly his most famous work, \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", reflects that European influence, and is justly place in the pantheon of that handful of important works that emerged in the early days of the American Republic.One of the of clearest links the ante bellum American literary establishment and the European tradition, especially from the English tradition was the need to pose and resolve some high moral question. And of course what is simpler to do that go back to the stark and isolated foundations of the white American tradition, the Puritan tradition. I know that if I were a writer and I wanted to dramatically portray the effects that physically isolated (and isolating) religiously-driven communities have on the individual, and on individual choice, those Puritan settlements from Cape Cod to Salem on the coast of Massachusetts in the 1600s would, at least get my serious consideration.So that, in part is what drives the action (if one can use that term usefully here) of a woman (naturally) banished from the tight-knit community (or so they claimed) by running off and having an affair with Mr. X. Now today that would create in the reader nothing but a big yawn, and maybe some spicy gossip, but hardly banishment, and hardly the necessity to wear a badge of courage sewn on your dress. Except maybe today one would advertise that status and place a video on \\"YouTube\\". And that is my moral point.Hester Prynne did not deserve the social opprobrium of the religious fundamentalists of her day. But old Hawthorne did a great service by creating a masterpiece to point out that moral ambiguity and dilemma back in the days."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Being unconditioned to Hawthorne's writing style, this one took some perseverance at the front end of the story before I could read through his narrative style without getting bogged down or letting my mind wander. However, I'm grateful I stuck with it, as in the end the story captured me. Unbelievably, before it was over, Hawthorne actually produced a real page-turner of a story!! But I have to give all praise to the wonderful character of Hester Prynne. In my limited exposure and experience to the world's great literature and associated characters, I have to believe she might rank among literature's greatest women. Strong and full of character, overcoming the Puritanical intolerance and \\"ignominy\\" heaped upon her; a woman of soft heart with a core of steel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Is it better to admit guilt and choose to live a life of shame, or is it better not to admit guilt and choose to live a life of dignity? This is the theme of Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter. The heroine, Hester Prynne, is accused of committing adultery, and has to live with a scarlet letter \`A' hanging from her neck. Because she wants to protect the dignity of her lover, she refuses to disclose his name.The story is set in the eighteenth century, when having a baby out of wedlock was considered to be extremely shameful. That may seem irrelevant to the present culture, but conflicts around shame and guilt are prevalent even today. So the emotional conflicts are as relevant today as they were in those days.Hawthorne is an expert in describing psychological conflicts. Even though his style may seem old fashioned, he dissects the human mind with the expertise of a modern psychologist. As he describes the course of the two lovers' relationship with society, Hawthorne expertly describes their emotional and character changes.A priest, a doctor and a wild little girl are some of the other colorful characters woven together to create a story full of suspense and surprises.If you like serious dramas, which deal in depth with complex human characters and situations, you will love reading this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I'm sad to say that I overlooked the Scarlet Letter when we were forced to read it in high school. The depth with which Hawthorne peruses the soul of both Hester Pryne and her lover is uncanny. Without a doubt it is timeless and powerful."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Having to read this book over the summer was not the right atmosphere for a high school student. I appreciated the book's deep symbolism and rich emotion. These aspects had a great impact on me, especially the significance of Pearl who connects the two adulterers. Unfortunately, reading this book was a summer assignment and I would rather do other summer activities. The diction in Nathaniel Hawthorne's works are noted among high school students as having a syntatic permutation. We usually do not understand the point of his works until we have read it over a few times or until the teacher has given us the explanation. It is a great book, especially in the right atmosphere, but high school students should also look at the Cliffs Notes if they have a difficulty in understaning it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is one of the most fascinating and interesting books I have ever read. It questions people's integrity and standards, along with forcing people not to underestimate one's capability of being infalliable. Hester Prynne is a perfect example of how one can have a ruined reputation and still choose to do good."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I imagine that people who read this book in the days it was first published had mixed views pertaining to the story of a woman who is scorned for committing adultery. There were those who likely condemned the book (priests, conservative high-class citizens), while others heralded its many themes and praised its originality (women, other authors, and open-minded beings). I give this book five stars for Hawthorne's ability to move people to so many feelings, including myself, with his diction, his syntax, and his endless use of literary devices to convey Hester Prynne's suffering, the downfall of a minister loved by his parishioners, and a man whose lust for revenge feeds on itself time and again. Speaking from experience, in reading this, one must look over each sentence very carefully and shred it to pieces in order to gain the fully intended information which Hawthorne wished for readers to digest. While not the easiest read of one's life, it is certainly one of the most enlightening, with its naturistic and societal themes that set it apart from other works of any time period. This tapestry of Puritan life stands as a brilliant example of a novel that will touch many more in years that follow."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote a prolific and profound novel. Who couldn't feel Hester Prynne's pain, Arthur Dimmesdale's shame? Was I the only one who felt hatred towards Roger Chillingsworth? As a 16 year old sophomore, I was not happy when I was told I had to read this book. I am glad that I did. My honors English teacher told our class to read the book, write an essay, and take a test on it. I wish she would have spent more time examining the characterization, setting, and symbolism that Hawthorne used to create his stunning novel of sin, guilt, and redemption."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is not a dull book if you get into it. It is true that it's language can be hard to read and understand at times, but that does not make it uninteresting. The main story, may not be considered exciting, but the novel is full of literary elements that make it a good book. Several faults are pointed to in this &quot;perfect&quot; Puritain town in which the story takes place. The book uses good elements like foreshadowing, foil characters, and a lot symbolism. A main point of the book is Hester's admiting her guilt as compared to her &quot;lover's&quot; hiding his guilt. I'm not going to tell you who she had the affair with, but it will be soon figuared out when you see the signs of his scarlet letter. The book may not be as exciting as some, but don't let this keep you from reading it, because it really is good."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Call me a sucker for classics, well I am. This novel brings forth issues that are still with us today. Yes, the book was written over 100 years ago, but it deals with Single mothers in a two-parent society and how the outsiders to the situation (townspeople) deal with Hestor Prynne and her daughter, Pearl. Even today we seem to look down upon single mothers as nothings, even though they are doing the best they can to raise their child(ren) and to survive themselves. Nathaniel Hawthorne seems to be writing about not only the early settlers, but also about HIS time and OUR time all in the same book. I give it five stars because of it's beautiful discription of the trials and tribulations of single-parenthood."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is a good book, although it can be difficult to read. It is a book in which a young and beautiful woman, Hester, has committed a very serious sin of that time and is being punished by wearing a scarlet &quot;A.&quot; The letter begins to take on new meanings throughout the book and this shows a unique way in which bad things may come to represent some good things. The book also represents opposites. Chillingworth and Dimmsdale live under the same roof and are totally opposite from one another. Both have different goals that they are trying to achieve. Dimmsdale is trying to find happiness, forgiveness, and strength to confess. Chillingworth is like a leach to Dimmsdale in that he is trying to draw the life out of him and every means to happiness that he may ever have. The book showed symbolism through different aspects that really made you think about what the author was trying to express to you."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I read this book for English class and liked it, here is the essay I wrote on it. The scarlet Letter is permeated with polarity and duality. polarity is the existence of doubles. In the Scarlet, opposites exist side by side and doubles exist side by side. In accordance to the foreshadowing, &quot;No sensible man, it was confessed, could doubt on which the victory would turn. The people looked with an unshaken hope, to see the minister come forth out of the conflict transfigured with the glory which he would unquestionably win,&quot; good will eventually overcome evil. Dimsdale and Chillingworth live side by side under the same roof; yet, they are different in many ways. Each looks very different from the other; whereas Dims is a pale and attractive young man, Chill is a dark and ugly old man. Hetser's feelings towards the two men foil. Hester stays in the land where she is scorned just out of love for Dims; however, Hester depicts her feelings for Chill as, &quot;I hate him! He betrayed me! He has done me worse than I did him!&quot; Even the townspeople view Chill as the healer of the body and Dims as the healer of the soul. Dim's words &quot;affected them like the speech of an angel&quot;; however, the people would probably be cautious of Chill's words, &quot;a large number affirmed that Chill's aspect had undergone a remarkable change,&quot; maybe into something demonic. By being opposites who live under the same roof and exist in the same story, Dims and Chill is an example of polarity. Hester and Dims living in the same colony in the same story is another example of polarity since they are opposites of eachother. Hester is justified, she had the courage to announce her sin even though she knew she'd be publicly scorned; Dims, on the other hand, is not justified, he was too proud to admit his sin and so should not have been idolized by the people. - i'm goin to stop now though i'm not finished"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"though I'm not a native english speaker, I didn't find it difficult to read it.

Sorry for high school students who couldn't understand it, something needs to be done in order to improve their reading comprehension and interest in their own culture.."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I did not read much of this book, however, I do remember some of it. Often when I discuss comparative literature, I tend to use the example of Charlse Dickens's &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, for in Dickens's famous novel, there are about five hundred pages of mere background information. And so, we have the style of Nathaniel Hawthorne presented to us: he is, in essence, a lover of symbolism and all things literarily analyzed. I really got into the story when the first pyre scene happened... Now, note, when I said pyre I meant pillar, for pyres are something entirely different and generally greek/medieval... Anyway, as I was saying, Hawthorned loves literary symbolism and creativity. I love the way he ended the plot, but I think that the story line could have moved a little faster, thus giving &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; a Dickens-like quality."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"My son was forced to read this book for his high school english class. I consider this cruel and unusual punishment. I believe there are some consitutional laws that prevent schools from giving kids this big slop of boring inside about 300 pages. Its the reason why kids these days hate reading, because before they have time to read anything exciting and interesting they have to read stuff like the Scarlet Letter. The only reason Nathaniel Hawthorne is a classic is because he wrote fancy and he is dead. In fact Hawthorne never wrote an interesting word in his life. Its like he went out of his way to bore people to death. Now I know there wasn't much around to inspire good stories back than but I didn't think it was this bad. He drags on a plot that shouldn't of lasted more than 30 pages into a whole freakin novel! Pure insanity that kids are forced to read terrible bore fests like Hawthorne."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book was awful! Now I'm sorry for the length of the next paragraph, but I feel it is important for you to understand who is writing this review.OK...I read this book in my High School American Literature course, like many of the people posting reviews, and I can safely say it is the worst book I have ever read. I wasn't a \\"big\\" fan of reading when I read this book, but I am alot more interested now after having read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" (If you want an ACTUAL masterpiece, read the aforementioned two books...especially \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\".) I also didn't HATE reading either so DON'T take my review as that of a stupid HS kid who just hates reading anything!Now, back to The Scarlet Letter and why it is so overrated. 1. The writing style is terrible, the book is nothing but run-on sentences filled with buzzwords that an idiot would use to make himself sound important, describing some insignificant detail you (the reader) didn't care about in the first place!!! THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE IS 22.1! THAT IS IN THE 80TH PERCENTILE FOR RUN-ON SENTENCE STATISTICS! also every character speaks the same way, whether it's a stately politician, a valued clergyman, or a 3 year old child, every character speaks with a sophisticated vocabulary, flawless grammar and perfect syntax...How dreadfully unrealistic! 2. The symbolism in the book is written at a 5th Grade level at best. The use of symbols is so shallow I wondered why Hawthorne even put them in! 3. {HUGE COMPLAINT} The plot is very \\"intangible.\\" This is a bit hard to explain, but I'll do my best. In most books, something is actually happening (ex. the characters are trying to get rich or are caught up in a war or looking for a whale or something.)In this book, nothing is physically happening...the main character is just going through hum drum daily activities (that are hardly mentioned in the book) while the whole book is written about the metaphysical changes and such. EVERY CHAPTER is about somebodys \\"soul\\" or their histrionic emotions or whatever, it made me want to puke! I am a very logical, unemotional person and having to read fifty paragraphs about the inner feelings of the main character and every petty character she casully walks by on the street was not my idea of a page-turner. I like books that show how a character is feeling because it adds depth to the character, but in this case there wasn't enough character interaction to emphasize the thimble of plot this book contained. 4. {Another big complaint) The story is about the struggles of a woman named Hester Prynne...alright...let me just say that by the end you are \\"supposed\\" to be in tears over what a courageous-hero this women is for putting up with all her hardships (this emotional response the author hoped the invoke is the WHOLE point of the book). NOW let me tell you why this sentiment is flawed. HESTER PRYNNE IS A CHEAP FLOOZY!!! I have no idea why people can't understand this point. The woman is married to a good professional man and she goes and decides to have a one-night-stand with the town minister, gets knocked-up, and the town realizes she is an adulterer when she bears her misbegotten child. Now the book is set in Puritan society, a strict, religious society that was prone to burning/hanging people out of fear of witchcraft or sin, and instead of being executed in the name of the lord (as one who broke the ten commandments surely would have been in those days) She gets a letter embroidered on her dress to make her an outcast! To make her punishment (if it can so be called a punishment) even more lenient, about halfway through the book the townspeople begin respecting her again! Meanwhile, her husband has been driven insane by his lust to find her secret lover who has also gone masochistically insane with guilt. AFTER ALL THIS I AM SUPPOSED TO FEEL SORRY FOR THIS NYMPHOMANIAC!?! Well I didn't. She got off easy for an act that ruined the lives of every other character in the book. 5. There are to many complaints about this book to list! The Scarlet Letter doesn't have a resolution!!! Instead of thinking up an interesting ending to the book, Nathaniel Hawthorne (probably bored to tears from typing this crumby world of plot holes and spelling errors) decided to save time by having nearly every primary character die in the last couple of chapters! LITERALLY, The last chapter just describes what happened all the characters (Animal House style) and nearly every one of them randomly died. Wow what a deeply brilliant ending, he must have let his dog write the last chapter.Please save yourself the agony and leave this one on the bookshelf. By the end of reading this I felt angry at the school for having violated my precious mind with this boring waste of paper. If you want to simulate reading this book why don't you stare into your toilet for a few hours. I am not even kidding, I would rather have my organs boil out of my eye sockets like a science fair volcano than have to read this book again!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I believe that the plot of \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" could have been wonderful & something I would love to read, because the events are all such interesting ideas. I just think that Mr. Hawthorne made them boring through his writing style.

I think if this was written by a different author, with mainly the same plot, it could be wonderful. But this, was terribly boring!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I usually have nothing to say but good things about book I read! But this book, it does have it's interesting points but I just don't get into it. I rather would burn myself at the stake that read the remaining chapter I have to finish for my English Class. What did I have to do to deserve this? I stood there reading the book with my book in one hand and dictionary in the other, I ended up reading Chapter 9 about 10 times because the information wasn't getting to me. And the way the author addresses the reader, I want to scream. I'm sure in the 1850's this was a wonderful book because of the message it stated back then, but more than 100 years afterwards, people seem to lose interest. And the fact that they make HS students read this book is just plain homicide. STOP THE ASSIGNING OF THIS BOOK! DON'T PUT YOUR STUDENTS THROUGH TORTURE!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne holds little significance other than being a complete waste of time. As a 10th grade student in American Literature who personally enjoys reading, I was throughly disgusted. There are much better classic American works that would have served the same purpose. The novel also holds little relevance in today's world, for example religion is not the law of the land. Hawthorne's elegant and complicated style frustrates and maddens the reader. After spending long hours reading I had hardly made a dent in the book. Normally, I am pretty fast reader but this book just took forever. I had to look up so many words because I had no idea what they ment. Even then, many of the words were not even used in today's english. Thanks a lot Webster! Not only that, but every character spoke exactly the same. I don't think a 3 year old is going to speak like a very gifted orator like the Reverend Dimmesdale. It was very difficult to tell who was speaking. The story could be summarized in about 10 pages but instead rambles on for about 220 more than it should. A simple action such as Pearl looking at Hester's &quot;A&quot; includes 10 pages of explanation. I know many kids that actually fell asleep while reading the book, during the middle of the day. Yes, its that boring. Also, the need for Hawthorne to credibilty to his story makes me think. I would have never questioned it if he hadn't felt the need expalin it. I feel as the book is simply a way for Hawthorne to clear his conscience by writing a subject that is near and dear to his heart. Its no secret that Hawthorne was suspected to have had incestous relationships during his lifetime. This fact alone makes me sick, as does the whole book. It should contain the label: DO NOT READ."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This eddition of the book is not about the excellence of the story- but, rather a consise review of Hawthorne's writing of several of his works. It is excellent for the student of the author"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This novel is widely regarded as overrated. The plot is not that interesting, the writing style is torturous,the plot twists are predictable. It's a typical example of pre-20th century bad writing. Not to say that any book from that era is crap, but this book certainly is."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter, considered a classic by many, is a long and tedious book to read. Long, drawn out, and confusing sentence structures and organization and a rather lackluster plot line, renders this book an absolute waste of time.The story itself is a dull and boring book to read. From the very start, the book is already lulling readers to sleep. Beginning with a prolonged introduction that does little to help readers comprehend the context and background of the story, the plot drags on, which seemingly never ends. The entire \\"custom house\\" introduction lacks any significance whatsoever, and instead of leading readers into the story, the introduction is downright confusing because readers cannot understand what is going on. It takes several reads of the introduction alone to actually understand that the introduction basically has no additional effect on the story itself. In addition, after the story begins to play out, readers have no idea the story has already begun and the introduction is over because Hawthorne continues to bore readers with useless information. Lacking any significance, readers are quick to drop the book and leave it for some other time.Hawthorne uses drawn out paragraphs and sentences, which lure readers to sleep. He focuses on extremely minor details which would be awesome if they did anything to help the readers. Yes Hawthorne can create the somber mood and depressing settings, yet nothing goes on in the actual plot to really capture the readers' interest. The action is dull as readers wait for something profound and exciting to happen; however, Hawthorne continues to tease his readers by making them think something drastic will happen in the end. Unfortunately, even the most pivotal parts of the story are downplayed as they do not really do anything or affect other characters in extreme ways. Along with the actions, the character themselves are too one-dimensional and boring. Each character has an uninteresting personality, and few readers can even connect with any of them, making each character appear distant and detached. It is as if they are not human and the readers tire out quickly trying to understand the purpose of each character. In essence, readers tire out trying to understand the story at all.On a brighter note, Hawthorne does incorporate a great deal of symbols. Readers can be fasinated by the purpose of each symbol and how it affects the story. Sadly, Hawthorne may try to emphasize the symbols to much and are no longer subtly entwined into the story itself.For any reader, The Scarlet Letter is a complete and utter bore, as many would be able to find any quality substance in the work itself or comprehend the story for what Hawthorne was trying to say."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In all honesty, this book was really hard to understand. Then again, I've never really been a big fan of the classics. But I got bored way too easily, and I honestly thought the last thirty or forty pages were the best part."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The abridged version of this book would read as so:\\"Sin is inevitable. So make the best of bad situations. And oh by the way... women are strong.\\"There ya go. Nuff said. I don't need to read obnoxiously long sentences lamenting on one sentiment for the entire 160 odd pages or so of this travesty. The entire book is just one big complaint. From the girl who commits adultery. She laments about it for the whole stinking book and puts up with some obnoxious kid the for whole thing as well. Painfully thick language, stupid storyline, quixotic style... everything that would piss off a recreational reader. Avoid it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I ordered the Penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started. It was very important to have the correct edition for proper pagination. I PAID for the Penguin edition. I GOT the $2 Dover Thrift edition three weeks later. When I called the distributor, he told me to email him to remind him to fix it, but he didn't ask me my name or my order number or anything to identify me from any other customer. I asked for an email address and he told me to look on my confirmation email. The email address from the confirmation email didn't work. I had to spend another $15 to get the correct edition of the book. I'd already paid more for the book that I got than it would have been worth brand new. I will NOT purchase from this distributor again."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book is not the most enjoyable book in the world. Like many people have already said, the sentences are looooooooooong and it can drag on forever. It took me several hours to read it (about 40 pages a day) and my mind would wander when I read it. Actually, I didn't find it necessarily boring, just not very exciting. However, like many people I had to read it fo high school, and while I can't say I agree we should have to read it in high school (since even Honors students have trouble with it), I can see why it's a classic. It's just a more adult classic, that's all.It can be hard to understand, and it is extremely slow-paced. But Hawthorne, in my opinion, has an insightful and intelligent way of writing. He spends lots of time describing and it seems like almost nothing happens. For that reason, this is definitely not a book for everyone."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book was very boring. Only at the end was I somewhat interested in who the father was and what Roger Chillingworth would do. The language was a tad difficult to understand, but after watching the movie (not the one with Demi Moore), it helped a lot. It is full of metaphors."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Although The Scalet Letter is superbly written and there is no denying the greatness of Nathanel Hawthorne, I must admit that the book was, perhaps, a bit on the dry side. Hawthorne, himself having grown up in Puritan Salem, writes from first-hand experience of the unwavereing rigidity and intolerance of Puritan society. Hester Prynne, having committed the unthinkable sin of adultery and conceiving her illegitimate child Pearl, becomes a veritable pariah as she is forced to live on the outskirts of town and wear the ignominious scarlet letter A on her bosom for eternity.In sanctimonious colonial Salem, Hester's impropriety is tantamount to murder in today's society. She, however, should not have to bear the guilt alone. As they say, it takes two to tango. Reverend Dimmesdale, in his absolute cowardice, is just as, if not moreso, guilty than Hester. Furthermore, the biggest coward and hypocrite proves to be none other than her spineless husband, Roger Chillingworth. I must say that the reading was at times a bit laborious, but a good read nonetheless. I must further confess that the movie version with Demi Moore is much more rewarding, although the book should undoubtedly be read first."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Well I read this book and it amazed me. The first time I read this book I thought it was stupid. page after page it got better. Well this book is about a girl who commits an adultery. The girl's name is Hester. So she gets an A on her dress and she goes to prison. Her husband left her like a coward. and I don't want to ruin the story so I will recomend this book to anyone who wants a good read. When I read this book i thought it was hard comepare to the books LORD OF THE FILES and THE ANIMAL FARM. so just read THE SCARLET LETTER."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I have yet to actually complete this novel. It is so dog-gone hard to understand. On top of this, I have an essay that is due: TOMORROW! Is there no relief?!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I was assigned this book when I was a sophomore in high school (22 years ago). I couldn't get through it; the Cliff Notes version help me pass the test. I found it turgid and laborious reading.I graduated in the top 10% of my high school class. I have a master's degree. Despite my academic success, I don't understand why this book is a classic. I don't understand why Hester didn't just pack up Pearl and her stuff, move to another town and tell everyone she was a widow. That would have saved everyone alot of grief, especially young readers like me."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. The attempts at symbolism are bogged down with unnecessary detail and the language is over the top even for the time period. I hurled it across the room at one point in agitation and disgust."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I got the auido book cuz I didn't have time to read the book for my english report and exam. I listen to it for one week and did a great book report and did great on the final exam. I did better listen than reading."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I decided to read a good classic a couple of years ago, and picked up \\"The Scarlet Letter\\". I read this book in one whole weekend and I enjoyed it. It is a little old-fashioned (because she's the only one blamed for the adultery..what about the father?), but it is still a good book. It was like a \\"mystery\\" to me because I didn't know who was the father was at first, until I got to the end, which turned out to be Rev. Dimmingsdale. I also found out that Hester's husband was an evil man. This is a good book for anyone to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In answer to your first question, yes I was forced to read this book by my Literature teacher.The Scarlet Letter, in its whole, is a metaphor for the urges we experience everyday, and the consequences for indulging ourselves.While this book may be listed as Historical Fiction, I believe it is a Romance. It has elements of both, but its just interesting enough not to be Historical Fiction (Boring being the the most important criterian.)The Scarlet Letter is a Romance because of, simply, urge. Adultery is the word (contrary to popular belief, it is not Grease.)Personally, I thought the Scarlet Letter was mediocre. A book written 150 years ago isn't fared to do well in a modern-day English class (most of my class didn't like it). I think, that when it was written, it was a good book. If my mindset were set some odd century and a half ago, I probably would have appreciated it more."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The author added so much feeling and description in this novel which was very appealing. The way that symbolism, description, suspense, revenge, and romance were all rolled into one wonderful literary piece was excellent. Many books have a lot of description but do not have such an effect on some people's emotions as this story did.Some say that this book is hard to understand. The thing with this novel is that you either have to really get into the book or be used to reading old English. They only thing that was slightly confusing is when the author would add his point of view and the reader would not know who was talking. The language was perfect for the times.This novel is worth reading. The novel is never boring. The author always finds a way to catch attention. The story kept getting more and more complicated. When one of Hester Prynne's problems would seem not as significant, something else would arise. This book has a sad truth for many humans. When we have a problem and suddenly they go away, there is always some other thing that accompanies its end.This book is just right for the high school reading level. The reading can be challenging for some students while others will like the pace. High school students should be presented some challenges with such readings. Education and literacy are the backbone to this country. To get a good job when you are older, we should be challenged."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"One ofthe greatest novels in all of literature, The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, tells of a life vastly different from those that we live today. Rejecting the present permissive lifestyle to which we were accustomed, the reader is entrenched in the gloom and doom of Puritan society. It is an exposure to a law that tells what to wear, how to think, and whom to love. The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature, hypocrisy, and of undeniable passions.Enlightening and refreshing, the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately, beyond the limits that society sets. A novel that can be enjoyed by all ages, The Scarlet Letter is a masterpiece of its time."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"While the life of a modern person of Christian faith may not be well-reflected in this book, the ideas are.The struggle of legalism vs. liberality... truth vs. lies... faith vs. fear. Boiled down, in one respect, is the question of what makes a true Christianity, the sort who has as much integrity as claimed. Living as Christ would live is a high standard, and Hawthorne demonstrates the multi-layered issues fallible people deal with.True to the genre and period of writing, Hawthorne is as much of a character as the ones he writes about. While today's novels are embroiled in myopic first person narratives, &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; enjoys the psychological unravelling of characters through analysis, observation and deduction.&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; asks questions we no longer ask, and draws out intrigue as the reader page-by-page wonders what is the best response to a Christian woman who has given birth outside of wedlock, and what response is appropriate for the dodging minister. When is it hypocrisy and when is it simple inconsistency?I fully recommend this book.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I thought this book was excellent! The plot really captured my attention, and though i admit at times it was a boring, I usually couldn't put it down. Her mysterious lover was a shocker, and kept me guessing all the way! I really recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"If you're looking for a quick, fast paced, leisurely read, MOVE ON! Because this is not the book for you. When I finished the book, my expectations were fulfilled. The book is written in puritan plainstyle and has virtually no dialouge for you to enjoy... But the book creates great emphasis on sin and adultery.Hester Prynne commites adultery and is condemned throughout society. Basically this book deals well on the subject of bravery, courage, the Puritan ethic, and the way society ran in New England (it also implied how women are strong enough to brave humiliation and condemnation in society and how men can be spineless cowards). Even though it's not a book you can absorb and finish in one reading, after I read it I got some insight on the Puritans and why Hawthrone wrote the way he did. Read it only if you think you'll enjoy it. Slightly recommended."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The scarlet letter is a book which skips around alot. Based in MASS. it is about adultury and how it affects everyone around who ever commited it. Hester Prynne falls in love with the reverand dimmesdale and end up having a daughter, pearl. The one problem is that Hester is married. She feels that it is ok to love dimmesdale due to her husbands rumored death. Soon her husband returns, very much alive, yet hidding the fact of being hesters husband. Hester is forced to wear a scarlet letter A, A standing for adultry, on her clothes for the rest of her life. This book was good, yet at times you get lost and there is much unneeded text in there. If the author was to take out much of the unnessecary text, then this book would be great.. nice story line."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is a book on the thoughs and motivations of a person who is outcast. The specifics are nonsense to just about any other time than those of the Puritans, but the humanity is still the same. It's a story so easy to relate to because we have our own scarlet letter or letters. Our own scarlet letter might be our appearance or our lack of education. Read the book and do not concern yourself of those who say the book is difficult. It is not. Hawthorn uses a few words that you might find as stumpers on your SAT tests, but hey why not just learn those and titillate your friends with them sometime. Meanwhile enjoy."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I definitely agree that 'The Scarlet Letter' wasn't the easiest read of my life. However, now that I've been able to thoroughly digest Hawthorne's language and message, the beauty of this great American work shines through clearly in my mind. I'll admit that I did not come to the book by myself - it was assigned to me over the summer - but that hasn't stopped me from appreciating Hawthorne's command of the English language, his sensitivity and astute view of humanity, and his extensive use of allusions and images to carry his story beyond Puritan times and into all time. Hawthorne's writing style, while dense and very literary, isn't impenetrable; and once you break through the shell of our own modern prejudices, it's easy to see what a wonderful and important novel this is."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter has endured for over a hundred years and will continue to do so, because it tells a powerful story well. Though many may find Nathaniel Hawthorne's writing boring or too descriptive, I think that every sentance serves to bring the book to life even more. The story itself too is fascinating, especially since the characters of Hester and Dimmesdale are not clearly good or bad. They've sinned, but they are still good people, or are they? Is Chillingworth really truly evil or are his motives justified? And then there's Pearl, the strange little girl who posesses unusual thoughts and character traits while still being the scarlet letter come to life. Altogether the book is a great study of shame and guilt for any age that is mature enough to appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book was very interesting to me and I like the time period it was set in, which made me love this book. Each time I read it, I understand what it means a little better. This is one of my favorite classics to read over again."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In this book, Hawthorne has truly captured the human spirit. However, it is not a work for the simple-minded. Those who do not fully understand it fail to appreciate the precision and genius with which it was written. Hester is such a strong character; as she struggles to win back the respect of the community, she regains her self-respect, which, she realizes, is ultimately more important. Hawthorne sets Rev. Dimmesdale, a very weak character, opposite Hester perfectly. Chillingworth is, in fact, &quot;chilling,&quot; and little Pearl is a troublemaker but grows to be much like her mother. The book is a slow read but well worth the wait. It's full of symbolism -- pay close attention to the rose bush (first mentioned within the first chapter, so be alert!) and the significance of &quot;mirrors.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I've read worse. But it takes a lot of mental energy to wade through all the commas and figure out the point of each paragraph. It seems a lot longer than 240 pages. I wouldn't have read it if I hadn't been forced to by the school. And the introductory thing is torture."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I read this book over the summer because I had no time to go to a library or a bookstore and I had gotten to book for my birthday from my aunt back in May. I usually read ALL the time. If it's a good book, I can read it in less than 1 day. Sometimes it even takes me 1-2 hours. But this book took me 3 weeks. I couldn't believe how long it took me! Then it turns out that I have to read it this year in school. (UGH!) Please don't read this book, only if you love very old books that are very hard to understand."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book is the first of two grand contributions that Nathaniel Hawthorne made to American literature (the second being the inspiration that he provided to Herman Melville during the composition of Moby Dick.) Like all great books, this novel deals with issues which are timeless and central to the human condition. Can (or should) the state legislate morality? If so, to what degree? Which is the greater sin, a momentary weakness or a sustained and conscious deception? Which is the greater punishment, public humiliation or private guilt? And, perhaps most importantly, what is the proper response to each? The novel provides clear and compelling examples of tragic consequences which can be avoided by the simple, but sometimes difficult, act of telling the truth. The permeating sadness of the story results from the failure of each character to do so.Despite comments here to the contrary, this book is not difficult to read or understand, and it is not dull if you can grasp its themes. The ideas expressed are intricate and symbolism is pervasive throughout the story. However, any reader who really wants to understand and enjoy the book should not have great difficulty in doing so. To those readers who feel challenged to appreciate this book, Hawthorne himself offers you a thought (on page 18 of my edition) which you should seriously consider --&quot;It contributes greatly towards a man's moral and intellectual health to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself, who care little for his pursuits, and whose sphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter was an great book in that it kept me reading. It was not boring. It had sense to it. It has alot of symbols in it that makes sense and has a purpose instead of just being there."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I had to read The Scarlett Letter for my honors english 3 class. I found that the author was too verbose in describing people, places, situations, and just the story in general. The book was so wordy, I often found myself forgetting the topic of that particular paragraph. Also, I was disturbed to find out that ever day the Reverand A. Dimmesdale would beat himself, and stay up till the early morning hours!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I first read this book as a high school requirement, and was one of the few who actually liked it. I recently read it again in my college literature class, and I learned to appreciate it even more. I picked up so much more the second time through. The thing that just blows me away is the author's use of symbolism and the way *everything* ties together...it's genius! Another amazing thing about this book is that it represents three different time periods: the time in which it took place (1600's), the time in which it was written (1800's), and the time in which you read it (present). So in a way it spans across centuries and connects to so many different generations. It's truly a timeless classic. I hate to be negative or insult anyone, but any person that hated this book is probably just an ignorant high school student who doesn't appreciate depth in a novel, and doesn't know a true masterpiece when they see one. This is also a great book for people who love American history (such as myself). It sheds a lot of light on the Puritan times."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"From the beginning chapter of this novel, I was compelled to read on. The use of diction and the author's attidude toward the character's and their behaviors make the novel appeal to a more variety of audiences. Hester's attitude throughout the novel shows a willingness to go on to the end, even though she was shunned away by the townspeople. If you are at all interested in romances, mysteries, prejudice,gothic styles of writing and the beliefs of the Puritan lifestyle I strongly recommend that you read this novel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This was truly an enlightening book and showed that men were jerks even way back then! (obviously I am a girl) Seriously though, I found the book to make compelling reading- the character descriptions were insightful and I did not find it difficult to read at all! This book should be read at least once by everyone."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"There is a reason why the Scalet Letter has the station of a classic in todays society, and it is because the book encompases a grand depth that is severly lacking in so many books in our contempoary society. It is not a book for an imature audience, as its themes run multi-layered and can be misunderstood by the ignorant mind. But let not that ignorance, caused, most likely, by the simple-mindedness of the mediums we are today exposed to for entertainment, tarnish the image of this sacred epic. Um, its a really good book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hawthorne has written a book deeply in psychological symbolism and wordy sentences. This book is for those with enough patience to let a deluded, complex story develop -- not a story for me, even though I have read many in the genre."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"As a young person, I must say...This book ROCKS! I read this book for the first time as an assignment. I have read four or five times since and each time I get something different out of it. Hawthorne's characterization is a masterpiece! He explores the psychological impact of ostracization. A story of redemption and hope. Read it and cry, smile and then sit and ponder. Guaranteed to have an impact on your live"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I personally consider this book one of the best ever written. It is full of symbolism and insight into todays society. The rosebush, the prison door, the scarlet letter, Pearl herself, the forest, the scaffold-every element in this story contains a symbolic nature which can be explored deeply. It is a truly amazing book. Upon reading it again, many new truths and plot elements can be uncovered that weren't noticed before. This book has the potential to leave the reader with a different view of society and life."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hawthorne's masterpiece is beautifully written and skillfully constructed. It's message is subtle, yet pervasive: that people we punish as &quot;sinners&quot; are often far more noble than their punishers. Judge not, lest ye be judged. Best (or worst) of all, the story is still wonderfully applicable to contemporary life. Perhaps President Clinton ought to wear a big scarlet letter 'A' on his chest for the rest of his term."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne does a great job of including detail, I think that is one of this book's strengths. It also has a very believable moral message, which makes it the classic known around the world. Classic is a repulsive word though, this book doesn't contain all the boring and repetitive characteristics of classics written 6,000 years ago. The book isn't just some ancient work written in an Italian province either. It was written here in america, maybe a little under 200 years ago. Classic maybe, but this is the only classic I'll read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne is a superb writer of American history with an interesting story to tell. When he first wrote this story he was told, probably by the an editor or publisher, that the story needed to be longer so that it would be considered a novel. So he went back and incorporated filler and massive detail into his story and that is the book you have before you today. If you don't read this, you are missing out. It may not have dinosaurs eating people on a remote island or worse yet San Diego, or any other worthless s***, but it was written with actual talent. This writer doesn't need unbelievable effects and wild stories to make a good story. READ THIS BOOK NOW!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"What greater journey than to delve into the human heart? Every emotion one can nurture there is here, bared and examined.Hester, at once forthright and complex, serves as our guide, as she wanders the lambrynth of her own private neart.That we can fall, sin, disappoint and still find redemption in confession make the message of The Scarlet Letter a most comforting tract for out day."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"So maybe I'm not your typical high school student. I was prepared to love this book, so I came in with more patience and excitement than most, probably. What I found, through a month-long picking apart of this book in my Lit. Class, was that I loved it more than I ever could have imagined. I flew through it! This book is a high-gear powerhouse of emotion, reeling with the intensity of deep true love fighting the evil forces of human hate and revenge. I would recommend this for any reader who is mature enough to handle the language and themes of forbidden love with acceptance and understanding. It's a fantastic book. I cherish my hardbound copy!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter by Nathanial Hawthorne was a book assigned to me to read and I was prepared to hate it. Upon reading it, however, I found it to be a wonderful novel which still makes valid points today, almost 200 years after it's publication. Hawthorne was deeply insightful in this novel about the intricacies of human nature. The entire novel is a perfect view of all of the flaws in the human race including the vices of jealousy, passion and cowardice. Through the actions of the Reverand Dimmesdale, Hester Prynne and Roger Chillingworth, Hawthorne was able to portray all aspects of emotion. Chillingworth's actions can all be justified by his love for Hester and the intense jealousy he felt for Dimmesdale. Hester's strengths and weakenesses were shown through the great courage she had in staying where she was hated and also in never making her accomplice own up to his actions. I loved this book and even though it was tough to read, it was well worth it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I thought this book would be much better.

It shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake. Can't go wrong with the classics."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This review refers to ISBN 978-1613823613. With no explanation or indication that it is doing so, this edition leaves out the author's introductory chapter, \\"The Custom-House.\\" Admittedly, the chapter is long, tedious, and skipped by many. Still, it leaves the book useless for the classroom and, let's face it, who else is going to read it? This isn't exactly light summer reading.In addition, there is no bolding of SAT words, with definitions in the margins, that some reviewers mention, which was the main reason I chose this edition. In fact, other than the abbreviated text, there is absolutely nothing: no forward, no reader's guide, no author bio -- nothing. So, not the most helpful textbook.On the bright side, it is well-bound and the type is quite easy to read.I am returning the book, and looking for a more suitable edition."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is an old classic that is still enjoyable as a modern read. I was not looking forward to reading another story about adultery, but like many other readers, I was forced to read the story. My daughter uploaded it to my Kindle and constantly pressured me to read it, and I was glad I finally gave it a chance. Once I began I couldn't put it down! I found it so lovely and enjoyable. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I don't suppose anything can ruin a book more than being required to read it in school. While it is true that some books overcome this at the time they are first read, others can take years before the reader is able to stomach reading them again. For myself, Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" falls into that category. Though I had already come to respect the work again, I never got around to re-reading it until I saw it was available as a free download for the Kindle. As with all the free downloads, it is a bare-bones edition, but there is nothing wrong with that since the book stands on its own. Published originally in 1850, it is an historical romance which takes place in Puritan New England during the 1640s.The book opens with the somewhat autobiographical introductory work called \\"The Custom House\\". Of course it is also fiction in that he did not find a scarlet letter or the roll of paper which contained the story while working there. One could easily read the rest of the book without this section, but it does offer some insight into the author and his perspective.The story itself is well written, and Hawthorne integrates several major themes into the work, such as sin, guilt, punishment and foregiveness, etc., which add to the enjoyment. Also key to the story are the characters. Hester Prynne is the woman who must wear the scarlet A. Roger Chillingworth is her husband who comes to town from the Netherlands as Hester is being publically shamed, and he is determined to find and torment the father of Pearl, whom he determines is Arthur Dimmesdale, the respected minister who is torn apart by his guilt.At times Hawthorne has been bashed by critics, but at this point he has stood the test of time. Though I wouldn't consider him the great American writer, he is one who should be read and \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is certainly his most famous, if not his greatest work."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is a classic story of love, betrayal, lies, and an evil child all set in a Puritan town in the mid-nineteenth century. Hester Prynne falls in love with some mysterious man and becomes pregnant with his child. There's a slight problem. She's married to another man who wasn't anywhere near her when she got pregnant. In Puritan society, Hester has committed a serious crime, and when she decides not to turn over her lover to the rest of the town, they force her to wear the letter 'A' on her chest every day for the rest of her life. With this punishment, she is also mistreated by other members of society who look at her as if she is some kind of vicious monster.This is a great story to teach people about their prejudices and what happens when you fall in love with the 'wrong' person, especially after you've already married someone else."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I first read this book in 10th grade and breezed through it. A few weeks ago, I had to reread this book for my English class. With the plot not so fresh in my mind, I picked up the book again and was amazed at what I initially brushed off. While the idea of a married woman being forced to wear a scarlet A on her chest for producing a child born out of an affair would be improbable today, the story contains many truths about sin, revenge, love, guilt. Also, though some might disagree, his writing is amazing and a joy to read. Pick up this book again, you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The first time I tried to read this book I had to keep looking in the dictionary, which was very distracting, and the last thing you need when you read this book is distraction; besides, I was too young to really understand this, anyway. I picked up the book again recently and this time, the first thing that comes to my mind is whether a person like Hester really existed, and if all the things she had to go through without losing her serenity and aplomb happened the way it happens here. Hester Prynne is a married Puritan woman who was condemned to wear a scarlet letter A embroidered in her clothes at all times, to remind everyone of her sin: having a child, Pearl, with another villager whose identity she will not disclose. Being publicly recognized as an adulteress, Hester is a victim of her neighbors' scorn and the authorities' suspicion, even threatened to have her daughter's custody taken away from her, and in the midst of this, she discovers her husband's designs of revenge on the man he suspects of being her lover. Hester's personality and her suffering are superbly described, but the story in itself drags on excruciatingly from the beginning to about the middle of the book, and even from that point on, the prose is still very complicated and full of arcaic words and florid descriptions, that's why I say distraction is the last thing you need when reading it; you have to really want to read this book, but it will pay, if what you want is something that keeps you thinking about it well after you finish reading; I don't know why it is required reading in some schools and I certainly would not reccomend this book for occasional readers."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Although I commend Hawthorne for his brilliant writing style that seems to convey exactly what he is trying to say, I must admit that I found the actual novel itself slow to read. I try to look for literary devices that unfold the novel before my eyes, but I find very few in The Scarlet Letter. Conrad's Heart of Darkness and Dostoyevsky's Notes from the Underground are prime examples of the symbolism I am looking for. The Scarlet Letter has a remarkable message about human morals and cruelty along with divine intervention, but you may find it difficult to complete due to its lack of interesting prose."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I was a little disappointed with this book. After hearing all the hype (good and bad) about the movie, I was anxious to read the book when it was assigned in school. There was a lot of lengthy description in the book that was a little hard to follow. The novel didn't really &quot;come alive&quot; for me- I was too busy trying not to get lost in the descriptions. On the other hand, the book/writing does a good job of portraying human nature and human feelings. After reading the book, there's lots to talk about in terms of the characters' feelings, motives, and internal struggles as a result of Hester's and the Reverand's sin."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I just finished reading this book (found a copy on the internet) and must say it was quite a story. I think readers young and old can enjoy this book, but if you're in high school and your school has only fed you those soppy, milktoast pieces of so-called English lit, I must tell you that you should probably look elsewhere for Winter Break reading. On the other hand, if you're a somewhat linguistically precocious high school student and are well-acquainted with other authors of this genre, you will find this book a quick read and beneficial to your high school studies for a number of reasons. One. You will now understand those vague references your friends make when they call you Hester Prynne under their breath. (okay, so maybe that's just me.) Two. All that Puritanical &quot;nonsense&quot; from American history will make a heck of a lot more sense now that you understand in a more emotional sense what impact Puritan morals had on gender roles in colonial New England, etc. Three. Your English teacher will appreciate the fact that you went out of your way to read something that wasn't Tom Clancy or Michael Crichton. Four. If you've been having a hard time with your college app essay, you now have a great topic for the one about who you'd like to meet and why. (Pick either Hawthorne or Prynne -- but please, be intelligent.) Anyhow, if you've got over two brain cells, this book is an intense and very speedy read. And you're not likely to confuse it with any other literature, like I so often do with Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility or Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. So read this book. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"A friend of mine called this book ponderous; she read it in 8th grade. Go back to this one; I keep returning to it myself. Maybe it's in response to my parents' divorce. And how Hawthorne handles adultery -- not the danger and desire, but the punishment and crime. Hester's story begins outside the jail house. An American sex crime. Read it as such. Trust Dover for a good, cheap reprint."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathanial Hawthorne is a wonderful writer, if gloomy. I have read quite a few of his books because of how much I enjoyed this one. This is his masterpiece, although some of his other books are worth a read as well. This book is chilling because of his mastery of language and characterization. He explores sin, alienation and spiritual regeneration as he tells the tale of a Puritan woman (Hester Prynne) who has an adulterous affair with a minister. We see the ripple effect that this illicit affair has on Hester and her lover, as well as Hester's husband, and most disastrously, her daughter Pearl. We see the effect that being ostracized has on Hester herself. This is visibly pictured by the scarlet A that she is forced to wear, but the effect that this has on her psyche and the way that she finds to cope with this estrangement show how strong a human being can be if pushed to it. This is a great book, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I read the Scarlet Letter last year for English and found it to be one of the most increadible stories I have ever read. Symbolism abounds in the forms of Pearl and Chillingsworth; even the scenery comes alive to tell this tale of love, atonement, and revenge.Don't come into this book looking for action, there isn't any. Instead, there are intense mental conflicts between the characters, making for some exciting and powerful scenes. Hawthorne's uses a great deal of description, mostly to create symbols, but also just to allow you to imagine yourself in the time and place: puritan New England, so that you can empathise more with the brilliantly designed characters.If you aren't familiar with the story of the Scarlet Letter, it describes the punnishment of Hester Prynne, a woman charged with adultry and punished by having a red letter 'A' sewed onto her main article of clothing. She is a marked woman, and therefore raises the daughter from her affair in a house seperate from the rest of her village. Her husband, who was supposedly following Hester to Massachusets from England, but took a long time getting there, arrives to witness her punishment, and decides that he is going to find the man who did this and make him suffer. From there, Hawthorne brings his characters together through scene after powerful scene, until the amazing ending.The Scarlet Letter is a classic for a reason, and deals with many issues that we still wrestle with today. If you're a fan of symbolic books, don't mind books which lack action, and want a book which will make you think, I recomend the Scarlet Letter to you. If you want the action and not the symbolism, then you probably shouldn't be looking for classic books, especially not this one."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"How could anyone call the plot of this timeless story mundane?! This story is timeless as anyone in our age of technology who has had a baby out of wedlock can attest to the social ignominy they immediately endure, whether by their own church or by the Puritan bred society we live in. Some things do not change. The central figure Hester Prynne must stand on the public scaffold with her fatherless child and endure the silent reproach of her peers and town fathers, putting on a good front of indifference while also serving as a means of perverse entertainment for the crowd gathered round. Hawthorne makes the public shame of the scaffold felt in his rich skill with words that resurrect the cold, disapproving world of the Puritan. The Romans had the colliseum, the Puritans had the scaffold! Some will find the reading heavy, bogged down with a rambling of words. Others who want to rekindle what it meant to tell a story in Victorian times will enjoy the rich prose, each sentence carefully composed to the point the reader feels Hawthornes throbbing pity for the fallen Hester Prynne and her undisclosed lover- which will remain so here in case anyone has not read the book yet. The narrative voice is one of sympathy for the doomed lovers and the innocent child Pearl, and at the same time one of grudging empathy towards the Puritan fathers who given the age, did only what they felt was right in condemning a woman of wicked ways, but not so wicked that they stop purchasing her fancy laces and superb skill with the needle. The hypocrasy of the Puritan way of life is easily discerned within three chapters. Hawthorne's own grandfather had been party to the Witch Trial period, having sat in judgement over a woman condemned to hang. His interest in the human turmoil the strict Puritans must have endured is evidenced in his writing of the poor Rev. Dimmsdale, caught between the dark presence of the physician Roger Chillingsworth's snake like vigil, the blind devotion to him from the townspeople as a living saint, and his desire to help Hester Prynne, clutching at his own heart everytime she passes by with the Scarlet Letter emblazoned upon her chest. This is well worth taking the time to read. Think of those long passages as sitting in front of the fireplace with Hawthorne as he unravels his tale for you, his desire to make you sympathetic to the lovers inciting his lengthy descriptions. A must for any age reader."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter was effective in achieving its purpose of portraying the downsides of Puritan society and values through keeping readers entertained with a captivating plot. The author wrote about Hester and Pearl in a way that helped them attain emotional sentiment from the readers. Also, Hawthorne showed the physical and psychological effects of having a guilty conscience by writing about what Hester and Dimmesdale had to endure to hide their sin. The author also successfully showed the hypocritical aspects of Puritan society in Boston, Massachusetts during the mid-seventeenth century. For example, Dimmesdale still remained a religious minister and role model for the rest of the townspeople even though he was responsible for a forbidden affair with Hester. A main purpose of The Scarlet Letter was to show that human beings can be misunderstood if they aren't allowed to have personal identities due to strict societal regulations. In this novel, the author, Hawthorne, portrayed the idea that Puritanism often lead to unjustified punishment, sometimes against the wrong person. Throughout the novel, he draws strong criticisms against Puritan values.The Scarlet Letter was ineffective in achieving its purpose of satisfying readers because it did not come to a significant conclusion at the end and some of the main characters didn't receive enough focus. The author could have more effectively showed how Pearl shaped her later adult life by stating more information throughout the novel about her early life experiences. This addition would have significantly improved the novel because Pearl was a significant character that deserved a stronger focus. At the end of the novel, none of the characters surfaced as a winner above the others. The Scarlet Letter would have been significantly better in achieving its purpose if the author had written more about Hester and Dimmesdale at the end of the novel. Hawthorne didn't write in detail about their time together at the end of the novel. Instead, the characters died rather quickly and readers didn't get a chance to delve further into their lives to see if they could live happily after overcoming the ordeal of their sins.The Scarlet Letter is a well-known classic American piece of literature. Hawthorne effectively conveyed to readers the downsides of Puritan society during the mid-seventeenth century and values through expressing the hardships characters such as Hester, Dimmesdale, and Pearl had to endure due to the society and time that they lived in. However, the novel was ineffective because it didn't achieve its purpose of satisfying readers. The ending of the novel seemed rushed and didn't show or symbolize enough. Also, some of the main characters, such as Pearl, Hester, and Dimmesdale, deserved more credit in order to further exemplify their significance and everything that they symbolized throughout the novel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I love it but it saddened me. . .

It was one of the first books I downloaded when I got my kindle 2. The character portrayals are superb. It analyses the thoughts, motivations, strengths and weaknesses of the four major characters in the story - Hester Prynn, the vengeful doctor, the hapless minister and Hester's vivacious and elf-like daughter Pearl. The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society, is especially moving. While there are some descriptions of nature that are quite vivid, most of the text goes into developing these four characters and is a fascinating psychological study, though at times it's little slow.Overall, a well-crafted story and a good read.The book though is hard to navigate on the kindle because it has no active table of contents. I therefore would not purchase this version at regular price. Luckily, it's free!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Like many reviewers here, I was &quot;forced&quot; to read this book for my English Composition class. However, unlike many reviewers here, I have a much different view of the story. As some people have said before, Hawthorne's book takes a good deal of concentration, effort, and strength to understand. Not only to understand, but to finish. The story can drag sometimes, it is true, and Hawthorne's style of writing occasionally leaves something to be desired (I don't think I've ever seen that many commas, 15 letter words, or page long paragraphs before), but we simply must look past these minor issues. Overall, the plot is highly creative and intense, despite the writing.\\\\Ok, ok, I agree that the first chapter, &quot;The Custom-House&quot;, was pretty bad. In fact, it was so bad and boring that I drifted off to sleep several times while reading it! The first chapter has little relevancy with the story, so, unless you have to, I would suggest skipping that part of the text. The rest is exceptionally good, and the quality of the plot cannot be overlooked. My advice is to just lay off the first chapter; that way you'll be able to enjoy the rest of the book without difficulty.The story itself deals with sin and adultery, a subject that isn't very popular right now. Hawthorne does an excellent job of telling us about this, but he leaves the reader with many questions floating around in his mind at the conclusion. At the end of the story you're not 100% sure if Hawthorne was condemning the Puritan society, or if he was commending it. He leaves that for the reader to figure out, which is a thing authors seldom do. That's a major reason I believe this work is so unique and timeless.The story involves a women named Hester Prynne, living in the New World in the late 17th century. She has committed adultery with someone unknown, and, since the Puritan society considered the Bible to be their ultimate source of law, the punishment was quite severe for such an act. Hester is forced to wear a scarlet &quot;A&quot; (for adultery) on her attire at all times, as a sign to everyone that she has sinned deeply. And so she must carry out the rest of her life this way. That's the major gist of the plot, although there's much more. I won't give it anyway, though, you'll have to read the book to find out.Let's face it: at some time or another we all are going to probably have to read this book, voluntarily or involuntarily. Shouldn't we try to make the best of it? Read it for its enjoyment, anything else would be missing the point."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne, takes place in the 1600s in Boston, which was a Puritan community at that time. The Puritans had extremely strict moral codes, and adultery, a subject matter in this novel, was deemed by the Puritans in the same way that felonies today are regarded. The novel's plot is directed by the Puritans' reactions to such behavior.Nearly all classic novels get praised for character \\"development.\\" However, the Scarlet Letter is the only novel I have read so far that, in my opinion, truly demonstrates development of characters. All other novels I have read have \\"exploration\\" of characters, but not actual development. Development of characters involves portraying the changes in a person's personality as a result of conflict.In my opinion, the most impressive aspect of the Scarlet Letter is the ingenious connection between the novel's message and character development. In the Scarlet Letter, a single incident of adultery has unforeseen consequences that affect four people. How each character responds to the situation determines his or her physical and mental outcome in the story. The core message of the novel is that hiding one's sins causes more anguish than revealing one's sins.The character development is superb, but the novel does not seem to use the developed characters to influence the plot. The subject of adultery was a creative element to develop characters, but I wish that the author had introduced a different conflict toward the end of the novel to show how the 3D characters would have reacted to the change in subject matter. I personally think that varying the subject matter and conflict would have made the message even more convincing; however, the novel is written with a confident call to action, which is the MOST important aspect of any work of fiction.We live in a world in which immorality is everywhere, so a novel in which nothing inappropriate happens would be a pointless novel. Novels must address societies' immorality without sacrificing decency. Therefore, I commend The Scarlet Letter for referencing sexually immoral subject matter, without being a \\"sexual\\" book. This represents brilliance and should be observed by all writers of fiction.Many readers have complained that The Scarlet Letter is irrelevant to today's society. To some extent, I agree. However, the greatest novels written today will be irrelevant to society two hundred years into the future. Therefore, there is no justification for criticizing writers simply because their masterpieces will someday seem irrelevant. As time progresses, scenery changes, climates change, countries split up or join together, governments change, laws change, etiquette changes, etc. However, the elements of human personalities do not change with time. It is for this reason that I constantly emphasize the importance of characters. The Scarlet Letter's characters' personalities are thoroughly developed and distinctive, so they exist throughout today's world, as well as tomorrow's world."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"\\"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,\\" might well be Nathaniel Hawthorne's theme in The Scarlet Letter. Certainly, by all community standards Hester Prynne's adultery is a sin. Worse yet Arthur Dimmesdale has triply sinned since he has had carnal knowledge of a member of his flock, and through a deep and abiding cowardice has failed to acknowledge his sin; and what is even worse yet, he allows Hester to bear the weight of public condemnation alone.However the worse sin of all belongs to Roger Chillingworth, Hester's husband who is not dead at all, but returned in disguise as a physician who has learned the efficacy of various medicinal concoctions from the Indians during his captivity. He pretends to befriend Dimmesdale in order to extract his long and torturous revenge. But it is Chillingworth's character itself more than anything that marks him as the worse of the sinners. He lives only for revenge and to give pain and suffering. He cares nothing for his wife and her child. He cares nothing for anyone, not even himself. He lives only to avenge.Dimmesdale's sin is that of a weak character. In a sense Dimmesdale is Everyman, the non-heroic. We see the contrast between the proud bravery of Hester and the all too human weakness of Dimmesdale who cannot bring himself to confess his sin, but looks to her strength to do it for him. We see this in the first scaffold scene as he pleads along with Chillingworth for Hester to reveal the father's identity. \\"Reveal it yourself!\\" we want to say.While some have seen Chillingworth as the devil incarnate--and indeed I suspect that was Hawthorne's intent--it might be closer to the truth to see him as the vengeful God of the Old Testament with his lust to mysterious power and his desire to see the sinful suffer. At any rate, Hawthorne's masterpiece--and it is a masterpiece, one of the pillars of American literature, to be ranked with such great works as Melville's Moby-Dick and Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn--is about sin and the effect of sin; and this is only right since the central tenet of Christianity itself is sin and the forgiveness of sin.By employing and investigating deeply three types of sin--Hester's from love and even something close to innocence; Dimmesdale's from lust, pride, neglect and cowardice; and Chillingworth's from hate--Hawthorne came up with a most felicitous device for examining the human soul.The Scarlet Letter is regularly taught at the high school level, but surely this is a mistake. The novel is difficult and challenging even for honors students. The architectured sentences, with their points and counterpoints, their parallel construction, their old school rhetorical cadences are strange and even wondrous to the modern eye. It is a good practice for the teacher and for the student to read aloud Hawthorne's prose so as to grow accustomed to his words the way one must for Shakespeare. If this is done and the edifice of Christianity and especially the fatalism of the Puritan mind brought to bear, then with leisurely pace and a steady concentration, the terrible beauty of Hawthorne's novel might be made immediate.Although the story itself is compelling, and the prose rich and poetic, the real strength of this great novel is in its characters. How true to life are all of them including even little Pearl who is defiant and willful in her beauty and her promise, so like a heroine-to-be of a modern novel. And how despicable and loathsome is this bent old man who embodies the very soul of the despised! And how attractive on a superficial level is this pretty young pastor whose actions are not the equal of his looks. And how strong and faithful and heroic is Hester who invites both envy and admiration, something like a flawed goddess of yore.What stuck me when I first read this, and remains with me today, is that it is those who presume to punish sin who are the real sinners. Chillingworth's life is one devoid of human feeling, devoid of any real joy as he lies in the stone cold bed of hatred and revenge. And to a lesser extent so it is with Dimmesdale who cannot forgive himself, who secretly flagellates himself so that his life becomes a hell on earth. On the other hand there is Hester who finds forgiveness and love with good works and in the joy of her beautiful and precious Pearl and in her unstinting love for Dimmesdale and her hope and faith that a better life will come.This is a deeply Christian novel although it is usually seen as a criticism of Christianity in the sense that the Christian community condemns the least of the sinners while the hypocrisy of its clergy is made manifest. Looking deeper we see that it is forgiveness of sin and the redemption that comes from good works that is exemplified. Hester knows the joy of life because she is a loving and giving person; and on another level she is forgiven because we the reader forgive her. How could we not? And most of the Puritan flock also forgave her since it came to be said that the scarlet \\"A\\" she wore upon her person stood not for \\"Adultery\\" but for \\"Able.\\"It is also good to realize that when Hawthorne published the novel in 1850 the scene of the story was nearly two hundred years removed. Thus Hawthorne looked back at Puritan America from the standpoint of a more secular society greatly influenced by Jeffersonian deism and the transcendentalism of Emerson and Thoreau. In some respects, Hawthorne's brilliant treatment of the ageless theme of sin, guilt and redemption was a serendipitous, even unconscious, artifact of his literary skill. No artist composes a masterpiece without some deep talent at work independent of his conscious efforts."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I think the many readers who were forced to partake of this classic were angry at their English teacher for making them read a book so wordy, detailed, and archaic in language. Many of the reviewers' complaints are about the author's style, which is definitely an acquired taste. Hawthorne doesn't merely give you a scene; he tries to tell you what time it is, how and why it is happening, and what each character is thinking as they enter the room. In this way, this can be a turn off to a leisurely reader; it may even be a turn off to an avid reader. The bottom line is that The Scarlet Letter, maybe more so than any other classic, is definitely a matter of style. I tend to admire the book because I can over look some of Hawthorne's unorthodox styles and look for a deeper meaning; if you happen to feel this way, great, if not, then maybe it just wasn't your kind of book.The main subject in The Scarlet Letter is sin--but not only the sin of adultery (Hester and Dimmesdale). There is also the sin of jealousy and revenge (Chillingworth) as well as the sin of hypocrisy and gossip (Puritan community). Hawthorne's opinion of the hypocrisy of the Puritans seems to be illustrated in the opening scene with Hester coming out of the prison door we hear the Puritan women making besmirching comments about Hester, and one even wanting death for Hester because of her sin--this reaction from a do-good community! The main crux of the story though, as alluded to, is about Hester and Dimmesdale's sin of adultery, and, more importantly, how each of the two protagonists deal with their sin. While Hester's sin is spread out in the public eye of the New England community, and she is shamed publicly, Dimmesdale's sin is hidden, as no one except he, Hester and Chillingworth knows about it. In this way, there are two very paths that follow for Hester and the Reverend Dimmesdale. Hester, after her initial public humiliation and shame, begins life anew, and is able to find a hobby (that of a seamstress) to make ends meet, and her suffering seems to make her able to take on the challenges in life. She is able to deal with the questions and mischievousness from her daughter Pearl, and seems to implore Dimmesdale, who is obviously overcome with guilt, to forget their sin and live free. Dimmesdale, on the other hand, takes his sin very harshly, and not only feels he must punish himself for it, but physically becomes a shell of his former self. Still, Dimmesdale has a remarkable power to still give amazing sermons to the community, even with guilt. Chillingworth, Hester's ex-husband, enters the scene early in the book, and begins to \\"peck\\" away at Dimmesdale, knowing full-well that he can break him down mentally and physically with such a weight on his shoulders. During the scenes where Chillingworth is probing the mind of Dimmesdale, there seems to be a symbolic parallel between Chillingworth and the devil (there are several references to Chillingworth being the \\"black man\\" in the novel). Dimmesdale can't save himself physically, but he can spiritually. Hester emerges as the novel's hero, mainly because she sheds her former faults, and becomes a stronger person in the process.The Scarlet Letter is definitely \\"heavy\\" reading. It might take you a few times to get through a few of the chapters. But, alas, persevere, and you may find it worth reading. And, take some advice: skip the introductory chapter \\"The Custom House\\" and just begin reading with \\"The Prison Door.\\" I can give you a quick synopsis of the introduction: Hawthorne wrote a book about two people who sinned by committing adultery, and the Puritans weren't happy. As much as people say this book is outdated, it really isn't. I mean, public scandals are a part of our culture just as much as they were then. Hester Prynne is that public scandal, the story you hear on the news or other media outlets. Public infamy, as well as changing public perception, seems to never go out of style.3 stars"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I enjoyed reading The Scarlet Letter. I was not forced into by a Literature teacher; I picked it up on my own because I heard it was a great American classic; and, indeed, I have to agree. It is truly timeless. It has been almost five years since I have read this book and I can remember the scenes and words so vividly. Hawthorne's dizzying imagery provides an adventure into the life of a Puritan woman, Hester Prynne, that one does not soon forget.Hester, practically abandoned by her husband is left to take care of herself in a lonely new world. She is flesh and bone with desires and passions like any other human being. Hester commits adultery and is found out by a cruel, judging community. She must wear a Scarlet A on the front of her dress; A for Adultery. Hester refuses to give the name of her lover Dimmesdale so he goes free and untouched by the damning society, but must face the tortures of his own conscience.Hester is humiliated and must suffer the consequences for her actions but she is not a broken woman. She stands, brave.Dimmesdale comes through in the end and admits his role in the dangerous game. Hawthorne takes the readers on a spinning ride to get to this point.

I could really feel for the characters, who each had a special quality that made them who they were. This is a must-read!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is truly one of literature's greatest triumphs, its characters and themes reverberating in our collective consciousness more than 150 years after its initial publication. Few novels inspire as much contemplation and feeling on the part of the reader. Hester Prynne, American fiction's first and foremost female heroine continues to haunt this world, inspiring a never-ending stream of scholarly debate. Even in our less puritanical age, some doubtless see her as a villainously great temptress, but to me she is a remarkably brave hero indeed. Her sin is known to all, and she never runs away from it, bearing the scarlet letter on her bosom bravely for all to see; she realizes the true measure of that sin, fretting constantly over the effects it will have on young Pearl, remaining steadfast in her beliefs while at the same time envisioning a new society where women and men can exist on more equal terms, free of the stultifyingly harsh punishments meted out on even the most repentant of souls by Puritanism. She shows her noble spirit by refusing to name her partner in sin and goes so far as to allow the ruthless Roger Chillingworth to torment the man she loves deeply enough to protect him for all time. Little Pearl is somewhat of an enigma, truly manifesting traits of both the imp and the little angel; her questions about the letter her mother wears and the minister who continually holds his hand against his heart reflect an insight that amazes this reader. Chillingworth is a thoroughly black-hearted man; I can certainly understand the blow he sustained as a result of Hester's sin, but his actions and thirst for prolonged revenge on the so-called perpetrator of the wrong he suffered can only be described as roguish and unpalatable.Of course, the most complex character in the novel (and literature as a whole) is the good minister Arthur Dimmsdale. One is compelled to both like him and despise him. He is basically a good man and an unquestionably fine soldier in the army of the Lord, winning many souls to God with his impassioned sermons. He is more aware than anyone else of his sinful nature, and he punishes himself quite brutally in private in a useless attempt to make up for the public ignominy he lacks the moral courage to call upon himself with a public profession of his deed. Dimmsdale is a coward and a hypocrite. At one critical moment in the latter pages of the novel, he blames Hester for his state of misery, and it is that comment in particular that makes this tragic character a man I can only commiserate with to a limited degree. Even at the penultimate moment of the novel, as he finally bears the mark of his shame and guilt for all his parishioners to see, the very men and women who have viewed him as a saintly man of God rather than the brigand he knows himself to be, he does not openly confess-his words and deeds do make plain the secret of his heart, but it is his lack of a thoroughly bold confession that causes some of his most devoted followers, so Hawthorne tells us, to blindly judge his final act as an illustrative parable on the danger of sin threatening each member of his congregation rather than an admission of guilt and self-condemnation.It upsets me to see readers who do not appreciate this novel as one of the earliest and best American classics, a novel that contributed greatly to the establishment of a literary culture in the young country. The language is of a more florid style than today's readers are used to, but this novel is in no way boring. Hawthorne paints some of the most vivid scenes of human drama I have ever witnessed; he writes in such a way that you are there in colonial Boston watching the story play out before your very eyes, struggling to come to terms with your own feelings in regard to such complex and sometimes inscrutable characters. The climactic chapter is truly and deeply moving, more than capable of bringing tears to the eyes of the sensitive soul. The Scarlet Letter is just a brilliant, gripping, thoroughly human novel that I wish everyone could appreciate as much as I do."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"One of the American classics, THE SCARLET LETTER tells of a woman named Hester Prynne in late 17th century who committed the then-unforgivable sin of adultery. She had been living in Boston for two years and had been found guilty of bearing a child (Pearl) by an unknown father. As punishment for her sin, Hester was forced to wear a scarlet A (adultery) on the bodice of her dress and to stand on a public scaffold before Boston's townspeople.The opening chapter &quot;Custom House&quot; seemed irrelevant to the rest of the novel the first time I read the book. It was not until a couple of years later I found it not true when I re-read the novel. I do have to admit that Hawthrone's writing style can drag at times, the once-seemed boring opening chapter significantly set the mood for the rest of the novel.&quot;Custom House&quot; does not seem to be an integral part of the story; yet the passage in which Hawthrone tells of having discovered, in the Salem Custom House, the faded scarlet A and the parchment foolscap sheets containing the facts which he says he used as the basis for this novel. The two landmarks mentioned at the beginning: prison and cemetry, point to the central themes of punishment and death, which will be combined in the climax of the novel. Prison might symbolize how Hester Prynne, who wore that scarlet A on the bodice, was forever locked in by her sin.This entire tale is filled with symbolisms. The prison is described as &quot;the black flower of the civilized society&quot;. The tombstone at the end of the book implies that crime and punishment may well bring about the death of such civilized life. The most popular and conspicuous symbol that is well sustained throughtout the book is the scalet A that is worn by Hester Prynne. Initially it is a red cloth letter which is a literal symbol of the sin of adultery. But the author makes the symbol A much more richly symbolic throughout the rest of the tale. The scaffold is not only a symbol of the stern Puritan code, but also a symbol for the open acknowledgment of personal sin. Night and day are symbols for concealment and openness. The sun symbolizes happiness and freedom of guilt. The list goes on and on....Arthur Dimmensdale, Roger Chillingworth, Hester Prynne, and Pearl themselves, are symbols as well. They reflect certain view of sins and effects on humans and society. The book might take strength and effort to read; but it's not quite a bad read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Unlike every one else that was forced to read this in English class. I to had to read it and I liked it thought that it was a good book and read it in day and a half. Every easy read at least for me it was."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is a book that will leave a reader wanting more after every page, being one of the most addicting books on the shelf. Through trials of morality and sin, it expresses every facet that the human mind wonders to when faced with decisions of \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\". Hawthorne truly captures the senses and amazes by expressing the battle of moral punishment vs. understanding.As the scarlet letter burns upon Hester Pyrnne's chest, one truly feels as if they are thrusted into the same situation of having to wear their own sin in plain sight. Still the question remains to the reader: who has done the most wrong, Hester or those that punish her so harshly? But as the book reads on, the main question becomes unimportant, and the true question hidden in the text is seen: It is not who has done the most wrong, but are the morals of the time too strict and in need of progression?"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I highly advise rereading books after a decade or more. Why? Because what you think you read and what you really read is not always the same. Especially when you read it in high school or college under duress. That is what happened when I just read The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne after more than twenty years. What I thought had happened was very distorted over the years.If you have forgotten what the book is about or just simply never cared, let me summarize. The whole story starts off with a young woman who has recently given birth being taken from the dark prison of a Puritan colonial settlement and placed upon the scaffold of shame along with her newborn girl. Upon her breast is a scarlet letter \\"A\\" that proclaims all that sees this mark that she is an adulteress. Her husband had disappeared over the last few years which does not help her cause. She is asked to announce who should be on the scaffold with her, but she declines out of love for the man.The story gets more intricate as unbeknownst to all but her the husband that has been reported missing has shown up on the same day as her public shame is announced. He desires to keep his identity secret as he hunts out the man who shamed his wife. It is not long in the story that the reader discovers the agony a young minister has in hiding his part in the shame while longing to be with her in exile. It is a passionate story of secrecy, laws, social acceptance, piousness, revenge, and the dark currents of man's evil nature.First of all, this is not a long book. It is relatively short. The version I read only had about 170 pages of the actual story. The rest of the book was comprised of introductions, notes, commentary, and a large bibliography.What turns many off from this classic is the fact that it was written in the 1800s in early America. It is always assumed to be dry and boring as it is not written in the fashion of today. No, you won't find long dialogues where a character pours out their heart and soul. Instead you will find descriptive narratives to give us these feelings.For example, the minister who should be on the scaffold with the woman shows the reader his guilt through the decline of health and the constant covering of his own breast where he knows another scarlet letter resides that only God can see. The innocent comments of a child over the years brings attention to the seen letter on her mother's bosom and the unseen on that of the minister.In all honesty, I found it hard to put the book down as I was drawn in with the poetic language of Hawthorne to the souls of a young woman who longed for love, a man who was torn between two worlds of love and obligation, and a man who gave his soul to the devil just to exact revenge.This is a true classic that gives someone a glimpse into the world of Puritan colonial America and into the social and religious order it abided by. In addition to that, it gives one a glimpse into their own souls and has them pondering which character represents themselves.I highly recommend that you read this classic. If you have read it once, do it again. Read it with more mature eyes and the ability to connect with the characters within the book.Note: This book was provided as part of a class on American Fiction."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Unless you have the correct size font, you will have a difficult time reading this book on the Kindle. It is not set up to have the text wrap correctly and therefore has a full line of text, the next line has a single word, then another full line and so on."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I hadn't read this since high school, so going in I anticipated something like this: Boring, boring, boring. Sudden intensity! The End.Rereading it as a married mother with a few adult relationships under my belt, I had a very different response than I did at 15. I can now appreciate the story of the pretty young bride, the disfigured, neglectful older husband, the smart, charismatic young minister.I empathized with the whole single mother situation, and could imagine the added pain of being alone, a social outcast. I also could understand better why Hester wouldn't reveal her illigetimate child's father.The scene in the woods when she bares her soul to her baby-daddy (I won't spoil it in case anyone on the planet hasn't read this book) was particularly poignant.Hester was a young girl in love. And she glamorizes her otherwise mundane life with her protection of her co-conspirator. At the same time BD still irritates me. He's ambitious and allows Hester to hide his guilt so he can go on pursuing his career goals.Yet he's so weak, his hypocricy literally kills him. He can't muster the strength to leave it all behind and take Hester and Pearl away. Even after confessing his love for her.Wow. Hats off to Hawthorne. I think I've met that male protagonist. And I know I've been guilty of playing Hester before in at least one relationship. Forget my needs, I love him! (*snort*)So no wonder it's a classic. Now here's my question: Is this book wasted on a 15-year-old audience?I taught 15 year-olds, and I guess my answer would be, \\"Not if it's done right.\\" And alternatively, if they're not made to read it then, will they ever? And then will books like these be lost?Doubtful about the lost part. It's a good book. I recommend picking it up sometime, and feel free to skim the lengthy, dense descriptions of minutiae. I did."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Without a doubt this is one of the must-read books for American Literature. Therefore, I do not have problems with the story itself, but the version of the book.Pros: Thin, easy to carry around, pages are easy to write on (it's REAL paper, not the flimsy ones many other versions have), pages not too bright, durable, simpleCons: Not enough space to really be able to take notes within the book because there is little space between one chapter and another(post-its recommended), \\"THE CUSTOM-HOUSE\\" is NOT included!!! (it is however, easily accessible with a simple google search)If you are just looking for a copy to read, but not analyze, then this is a really good copy. Even if you are looking to analyze (not too deeply), this is still a great choice because it's simple and the introduction essay is only a click away. If you are lazy to recognize symbols and themes, then I would suggest the Barnes and Nobles edition (they have their own version, and then they sell another one with analysis of themes and motifs), as they have the essay, analyses, but is around three~four times thicker than this version.I am satisfied with my buy. :) Great classic! Please have a version of this book somewhere in your house because it really reveals a lot about the Puritan society at that time period (although it is biased) and is interesting to read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I put my goal to read Moby Dick on hold in order to read The Scarlet Letter as I prepare to teach it with my AP Language & Composition class. As Hawthorne and Melville were friends, I didn't think that Melville would mind.While I read and taught The Scarlet Letter before, I never had the appreciation for it as I did in this reading. I was captivated by the story, but the language and style of its writing was preeminent for me. Hawthorne crafts a beautifully written story that tells the familiar tale of Hester Prynne's public shame and Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale's private tormented guilt after an adulterous affair set in the backdrop of Puritan Boston. The story is simple, as Hester faces a judgmental crowd in the town, and Dimmesdale suffers from a burning conscience as he does not admit to his sin. One man, Roger Chillingworth--Hester's husband--knows the secret and is bent on revenge against them both.While The Scarlet Letter is often used to criticize and demonize the Puritan era, it rather shows the importance of what the consequences of sin lead to within our hearts. The public consequences are temporary, but the private consequences are far longer reaching as the \\"Hound of Heaven\\" chases after us to confess and repent. While Hawthorne does not condemn adultery as a sin, we see the destruction causes by infidelity with the Prynne family. Hester Prynne is indeed a model of feminine strength and virtue in accepting responsibility and guilt, but she also provides us a picture of the results of our sin and the need for redemption in a Savior.The book begins with this excellent line, showing the coldness of the scene and the tone of the entire novel:A throng of bearded men, in sad-colored garments and gray, steeple-crowned hats, intermixed with women, some wearing hoods, and others bareheaded, was assembled in front of a wooden edifice, the door of which was heavily timbered with oak, and studded with iron spikes.In our first picture of Hester, Hawthorne contrasts the ugliness of sin with the beauty of the woman:On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread, appeared the letter A. It was so artistically done, and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy, that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore; and which was of a splendor in accordance with the taste of the age, but greatly beyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony.If you are looking to read novels that you should have read in high school but didn't, I heartily recommend starting with this one."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Book is a great read.

Thank you for a pleasant transaction."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I first read The Scarlet Letter (TSL) back in high school. I thoroughly enjoyed the book then. Going back and rereading a second time still brought back the awe associated with the imagery painted by Hawthrowne. Perhaps the most striking image is that in the beginning, where Hester Prynne is about to come out of her jail cell and a single rose blossoming amidst the bleakness of her prison is used as a metaphor. Hawthrowne does a superb job describing the details and ways of life. I believe he captures 17th century Bostonian life accurately. In a way this book is a history book. I do admit that the plot is slow at times, but the book does appear to move much more quickly if you try to admire Hawthrownes writing style and descriptive language. Overall, I would say this book impressed me as much as War and Peace and some of Dickens' novels did."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"There are so many things I could say about this book, but should I reach the heights of elegance achieved only by Shakespeare, Hawthorne himself, or Faulkner, I could not overcome the horrible, terrible misconceptions most people have formed after having this beautiful novel foisted upon them in high school. Instead, I'll share a few observations and some tips for reading.First, this is a complicated story. It's not about evil Puritans and hero Hester, although you will read this point of view in the cheat note summaries on the internet. It's not about feminism, really, nor is it about religion in any technical sense. The only comparison that really fits is that of love story, or love triangle, or maybe love square. (I told you it is complicated.) In all of literature, there are very few writers who have penned characters so incredibly real and well-rounded. When you finish the novel, you KNOW these people. Certainly there is some minor societal commentary, but the real story here is about these people.Now, I'm assuming that many people looking at this page have been told they must read this book for high school English. As a former teacher of said subject, I have some pointers.(1) Make sure you read the book for yourself. Chances are (in our current educational system) your teacher is going to have a flat interpretation of this book, likely gleaned from some ready-made teaching packet. (If you have another kind of teacher, consider yourself lucky.) You can have some very interesting class discussions if you actually read the material and challenge some of the majority opinions about the novel. Be a rebel. Have some fun in English.(2) Read *The Custom House* introduction, but wait until after you've finished the book. It's only good in that it explains Hawthorne's view of his own book (difficult and painful) and reveals his struggle to write it. The writing style, however, is decidedly un-Hawthorne and more difficult to read than the rest of the book. If you read it first, you will be unfairly biased against the novel.(3)Read it SLOWLY, if at all possible. The storyline is complex and should be read with care. I would also recommend underlining and taking notes, if your copy of the book allows it. You will develop a truly deep appreciation of the work.(4) Finally, avoid the Demi Moore 1995 adaptation AT ALL COSTS. Words cannot describe how awful it is. And if your hope is to find something to help you on the test, the only real similarities are the character's names and the red patch on Hester's dress. If you must see a film version, find the PBS miniseries with John Heard and Meg Foster (made in the 1970s). It does the best job that a film possibly could with this material."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This classic work on Puritan life and morality was written 200 years after the events described took place. Hawthorne (House of the Seven Gables and Twice Told Tales) begins with an autobiographical description of the Custom House of Salem in his day, of his work there, and of how he came to write this story. He then jumps in 'in medias res' and we see a woman being put on display before the people of Salem with a scarlet A on her breast, to be worn forever as a remonstrance for her adultery. It is to be a warning to others and a scourge to her soul.We follow the story of this woman (Hester Prynne), the child of her affair (Pearl), her husband (unknown to the community and in the guise of a doctor), and the object of her sinful passion, whom Hester has refused to name before the magistrates, clergymen, or town. Hawthorne treats everything with vivid descriptions and the style of prose popular in his time (1804-1864) that is often seen as cumbersome today. (Think Dickens if unfamiliar with Hawthorne's contemporaries.) With concentration, however, any reader can get through the seemingly endless procession of commas and insufferably long paragraphs to see the beauty of the story within.Most fascinating is the way Hawthorne describes the physical transformations that occur as a result of their sin. In addition, he lays bare the consequences of sin, not only on Hester, forced to wear the scarlet letter all of her days, but on everyone touched by the adultery.Hawthorne was a transcendentalist, friend to Emerson, Thoreau, the Alcotts, and many other influential thinkers of his time. This philosophy is seen in the reverence with which he describes nature as well as the harshness he has for Puritanical solemness. He holds no approval of adultery, however, even if he does disapprove of Salem's residents and society, but desires to place before us an example of the consequences of sin, in order that we might not do likewise. He also holds out hope in the last paragraphs that an equality in marriage, such as had not been seen in the 1600s would develop, in contrast to the unhappy unequal marriage to which Hester felt bound. This was another distinguishing trait of the Transcendentalists, especially the Alcotts.It is a classic for a reason, a beacon of time tested truth. It should not be read with a modern eye for it is not a modern tale, but full of what we consider unwieldy language and awkward grammar. However, it is no less a classic to be enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"In this classic tale written in 1850, N. Hawthorne tells the tragic tale of a fallen woman, Hester Prynne. In his essay entitled \\"The Custom House\\", the author pretends to have found a mysterious relic of cloth in the shape of the letter along with a manuscript in which a certain Jonathan Pue described the letter's wearer.Thus the character of Hester Prynne was born, this adulteress who has to wear the shameful letter A embroidered on her garment in scarlet letter and insolent gold thread. Her error is adultery and the Puritan magistrates of colonial Boston decided that she should wear the bright letter affixed to her breath. In the opening scene, Hester is standing dishonoured before the town holding another man's child just as her long-lost husband Roger Chillinworth arrives in Boston. The story is tightly constructed and takes place in 24 chapters with the action in the first, the twelfth and the last revolving around the scaffold on which Hester suffers her punishment. The structure is taught and essentially limited to the description of the three adult characters of Hester Prynne, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale and Roger Chillingworth, each in turn wearing various masks to hide themselves from the failures of the human heart. Hester never reveals her lover's identity thus protecting her from public disgrace but not from his interior sense of guilt. At any rate she is a strong character, a rebel dwelling in solitude which grants her freedom of thought, particularly concerning the fate of women: \\"The world's law was no law for her mind\\" the author writes. To the reader she appears as a fascinating creature, captivating, rebellious, even intimidating. The d&eacute;nouement is equally startling. After Hester's daughter Pearl marries, she returns to the small abandoned cottage and resumes her former life, not being able to remain an expatriate, the scarlet letter now voluntarily clamped to her bosom as if it were part of her true identity. Her triumph finally lies in her willingness to take up the mark that identifies her as a woman."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The book is set in Boston, Massachusetts, during colonial times. Hester Prynne, who is believed to be a widow (it's thought her husband died at sea on his way to Boston), gives birth to a little girl she names Pearl. Hester is convicted of adultery, and her punishment is to wear a scarlet letter \\"A\\" on her chest for the rest of her life. Since Hester refuses to name the father of the child, and he doesn't come forward on his own, he goes unpunished, while Hester and Pearl become outcast in the town. Roger Chillingworth is a doctor who is a newcomer to the town. He is actually Hester's husband, but no one knows that other than Hester. Chillingworth swears he will find out who Pearl's father is and get revenge. Meanwhile, the Reverend Dimmesdale, who is Pearl's father, is consumed with guilt about his sin and about the fact that he allowed Hester (and Pearl) to take all the punishment for it.I first read this book 20 years ago in high school and recently re-read it. I enjoyed it much more this time around. This is a very difficult book for a young adult to read. The pace is very slow, the vocabulary words are rather advanced, and the author is very wordy--he takes half a page to say something that could be said in one sentence. Those reasons are why I only gave the book 4 stars, instead of 5 :) Still, it's important to remember that the book was written over 150 years ago.Even with all those 'problems' the story itself is wonderful. It's a story of sin and the price that people pay for them, as well as the price that others are forced to pay for those sins. It's a story of guilt and the effect it has on you. It involves difficult decisions--do you admit your guilt and accept the punishment or do you hide it in an effort to still be in a position to do some good in the community? And do you forgive someone who hid his guilt while you accepted complete punishment?It is a book that makes the reader think about some very hard issues. And that's always a good thing."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Hawthorne wrote a masterful work of historical fiction incorporating an examination of guilt, revenge and suffering in the context of Puritan Salem.

The Scarlet Letter, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne, whose books explore the themes of guilt, is a striking romantic tragedy set in Puritan New England. The characters are well developed, each tinged with deep human emotion and conflict. The societal beliefs and superstitions of the people at the time provide Gothic elements. Again, one can make the argument that this is not only classic American literature, but Gothic romance.The Scarlet Letter revolves around Hester Prynne, a beautiful young early colonial woman who has recently ben married. Her husband has not yet arrived to the states from England (for some reason or other) and there is even rumors that he is dead. She loves the pastor of the community, Dimmesdale. Dimmesdale and Hester make love, committing the \\"sin\\" of adultery. When their relations are discovered through Hester's pregnancy with his child, the Puritan society they are part of are in an uproar. They immediately brand her as a sinner, an adultress and imprison her (she even gives birth in prison). As a reminder of her hell-bound deed, the elders sew a scarlet letter A (adultery) on her gown. She becomes a recluse, where she raises her daughter, Pearl, away from the people who have shunned them. Dimmesdale, is by far, the most troubled character. He is thoroughly immersed in guilt, and he must bear the hypocrisy of his crime. As a pastor, it is his duty to enligthen the people spiritually. He hides his sin, but punishes himself with physical torture each night, branding his own letter \\"A\\" with hot wax. The villain of the novel is not the Devil (who, contrary to the references made to the Devil, witches, etc) but the villainous Chillingworth, Hester Prynne's husband.Chillingworth returns from England to discover that his wife has become an outcast for her adultery. Full of raging jealousy and the desire to extract revenge upon the transgressor, he makes it his sole mission to torture Dimmesdale and plunge him further into dark despair with guilt. He feigns a friendship with Dimmesdale, but he makes it possible to mentally punish him and to inflict him with emotional pain. This is the real sin, here, the violation of the human heart. Through Chillingworth's constant torture of Dimmesdale, in addition to what seems like heavenly signs of condemnation (a comet passes in the sky leaving the letter A), Dimmesdale becomes so full of pain and guilt, that he dies in Hester's arms, announcing that he has committed the sin of adultery with her. The classic tale is read well and the cover is very striking. This can also make a nice gift."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter is a novel that I enjoyed reading and gained much knowledge from. After reading this novel, I learned a lot about love and adultery and how the people in the seventeenth century responded to it and dealt with it. The story takes place in Boston where a passionate woman named Hester Prynne goes off and cheats on her husband, Roger Chillingworth. While he was in England, Hester Prynne was having an affair with the pastor of the town, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale. Since he is the Reverend of the community, their love was to remain a secret even though they had brought a child into the world. Because Hester Prynne had committed adultery, she was forced by the townspeople to wear an embroidered letter &quot;A&quot; which was patched on her clothing right over her bosom. What you will read about in this novel is how Hester Prynne and Reverend Dimmesdale live through their struggles and what their daughter Pearl had to go through during her childhood. Be aware, it's intense!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This is for all the kids out there who have had to read this book for school and then written awful reviews of it here. Take a few years and PLEASE TRY AGAIN! You will not be sorry. Hawthorne is a wonderfully subtle author, and while his writing might seem tedious at first, it will reward you. This is not just a book about adultery punished by a repressive society- it is about guilt and love, secrets and integrity, personal demons and responsibility. The story has true relevance in today's world. And Hawthorne's language is amazing. If anything he writes seems obvious, look again. He may not have said what you first thought. He often shows many sides of a situation and lets the reader draw his own conclusions. I never had to read The Scarlet Letter for school, but I have read it twice and will probably read it again soon. It is one of the few books that have really stuck with me and made me think. Like other great works of art, it will keep coming back to you. What it lacks in swift and exciting action, it more than makes up in the author's great understanding of and compassion for his characters."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne, is a beautifully written controversial novel. It really highlights many of the problems of society during the time when the puritans had power up until present day society. The issues brought up include sexism, sexual morality, religion, and a line between what is considered right and wrong. Hawthorne shows the struggle of women in a society that is solely based on religion, the obstacles that have to be overcome in a situation of love vs. society, and the strength a single person can have to stand up for what they believe in when everyone else tells them they are wrong. Hester Prynne, the female protagonist, maintains many admirable traits and does not let society get the best of her. She comes to set up in Boston, which was then a puritan colony, while her husband takes care of business in Europe. While awaiting his arrival, Hester has an affair with Reverend Dimmesdale and falls in love with him. The consequence of this affair put restraints on Hester when she becomes \`with child'. Society ridicules her and makes her wear an A(adulterer) sewn into her clothing so every person will scorn her because of her sin. An inspirational strength is shown in Hester when she wears the A like a badge of honor. This shows her overpowering the standards of society and that she is not ashamed of her actions just because people tell her that she should be remorseful. Hawthorne integrates many ideas together that make this novel intriguing. His word choice strings together pictures and feelings to the scenes in his writing. The situations that many of Hawthorne's characters endure are ones that many people can relate to today in the 21st century."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"i am a seventh grader and i think this book is amazing... i absolutly loved the story and the descriptions of the book. this is an awesome book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I love this story! This particular book is very small...smaller than a paperback...and the text is tiny, too. It has a beautiful red cover and a red ribbon page holder. Just beware of the size if you are looking for a full-sized hard cover to complement your library (like I was)."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The narrator does an excellent job. He has a very pleasant voice and does great characters when they speak. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to listen to Hawthorne's slice of Puritan America."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Quick read because the book is really a short story and some of the character language can be annoying but necessary per the theme of the novel . Interesting read especially since the book was written in the late 1800s but set in our future. Not your typical \\"end of the world\\" novel with all the \\"glitter\\" and multiple story lines like Earth Abides (same genre) but for being written so long ago the author hit the nail on the head per the cascading long-term effects of a \\"Scarlet\\" event."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"My son wants to know why the cover of this book is bright green since that seems to have nothing to do with the story. I told him it was probably because is was a cheaper version and they used whatever color card stock they had sitting around the printing company. What do you think?"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"It is easy to see why this is considered an all time classic. What a beautifully written, extremely intense and moving story. This is not just a classic for scholars either--my 6 year old niece was equally interested!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This unabridged CD version of the classic tale of Puritain life was delightful listening. Great for commuting. I also bought the DVD version and enjoyed that as well. Covered missed literature from my past!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The best measure of the greatness of a literary work is its capacity to reward rereading. By that measure, the SL is one of the greatest works of literature, one that keeps American Literature in competition with the other great literatures of the world. This does not mean that the first or second reading will be easy: indeed, difficulty of decision and moral judgment is one of the book's major modalities. The Preface alone tries to block a happy, entertaining reading, to promote thought about language, history, national identity, and ethics. The point of the novel then is mortal education but not in favor of a religion or creed but in favor of humility in the face of the complexity of our collective experience."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"The Scarlet Letter shows Nathaniel Hawthorne at his finest. The imagery is quite wonderful, but there's only so many times you can say the same thing. The images in this novel stretch out far longer than needed.I nearly couldn't make it through. I do like to see every detail given it's fullest attention but even this is too much.This book is one that is very vivid and quite pleasing to understand, but hard to read and not as easy to follow. Sometimes there's only one resourceful fact in a half a page paragraph.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I read The Scarlet Letter when I was in 10th grade more than 14 years ago. This was one of the three novels, the other two being Beowolf and Great Gatsy, that I remember reading, which tells you how boring high school curriculum was and also how outstanding this book is among its peers."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"I am a high school student who had to read this book for an assignment, even though I was &quot;forced&quot; to read this novel I loved it. At times it can be complex but if you stick to it and read it in the end it was well worth it. The characters flow extremly well and this novel can still be used to view some societies now adays. In Iran and many of those eastern countries women are still judged harshly for many things. Hawthorne truly displays the sufferings of women all through the ages"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"It is interesting that this superb piece of literature came out the same year Dickens' masterpiece &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850) came out. The roots for this novel can be found in Hawthorne's short story &quot;Endicott and the Red Cross.&quot; This exquisite work shows us a harsh and brutally realistic picture of Puritan America. Hester draws much sympathy as the woman who suffers way too much persecution for her crime of infidelity. Dimmesdale is memorable as the guilty lover who tries to advocate for Hester when the authorities want to take Hester's illegitimate child away. He also offers a very moving passage in XVII when he openly confesses to us (the readers) his guilt. Pearl is captivating as the product of Hester and Dimmesdale's affair. While as a child she can not figure out exact details, she CAN make connections between facts. Roger (Hester's husband) is perhaps Hawthorne's greatest creation. He offers a very chilling and memorable passage in IV when he confronts Hester and reveals his identity to us. He is by far the most intelligent character in the book. Furthermore, his careful investigations contrast strikingly with the other characters breakdowns and outbursts. Hawthorne increases the complexity of this phenomenal character when Roger leaves his wealth to Hester despite her affair. Another fine aspect of this book is the way in which Hawthorne gradually unfolds the major facts and gives us time to figure them out before he flat out tells the crucial happenings."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Where does one begin ? how does one begin ? This novel of Hawthorne is an excellent one .. a classic...a novel to be cherished . The lessons to be learnt about sin ,giult ,denial and eventual deliverance of truth ,redemption and socialization can all be internalized into real life . Yes , Hawthorne was not a perfect Writer but he portrays the language skillfully and beautifully . I must stress that to reaal understand this book, you shouldn't be cranking up the volume on your stereo and drinking caffeine drinks ....if you do . you'll fell the book is &quot; the worst book you could ever read &quot;"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Although rather difficult to understand, The Scarlet Letter was an incredibly interesting book. Hawthorne writes in a way that his characters are very realistic and relatable. I just finished reading it for American Lit. and I have to admitt I was far from thirilled about the idea but I found by the time I got to about the 5th chapter that I really couldn't wait to find time to read more. If you like to read about human nature and how one decsion really can determine your life and that of those around you than you should definetly look into reading The Scarlet Letter."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"One might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammer and multiple spelling errors. Although I respect those who disliked The Scarlet Letter, I disagree. It's no wonder that people that don't know how to capitalize the word 'I'. I thought that this book was wonderful, if you are willing to put effort into understanding it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; is a vivid (and accurate) portayal of life in Puritan New England. The prejudices, superstitions and institutions of the society are expressed so well that contemporary readers, who have little knowledge of New England's history, are able to feel the oppression and religious pressures that were common in that society. Indeed, this work is comparable (if not superior) to Arthur Miller's Crucible."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Most people of todays time don't seem to be able to really get this book. It is written for the time of old when women were homemakers and men ruled all. If things were a sin it was likely a womans fault and everything that happened that wasn't typical was considered either a sign from God or the devils work. So, here we have a story of a very naughty girl who got pregnant out of wedlock. So, by custom she was inprisoned and judged because of her sin. This is where the story begins. She keeps her mouth shut about who helped create this heathen child with her, which shows her own character. Then the story goes through the details of what becomes of her life. The town gossips have their hayday and later in the book people from out of town come to town just to see the girl with the scarlet letter. You see how many people treat her because she chose to not move away but to stay and face her persecutors head on. The whole time she also has to keep seeing her thought to be dead husband who is imitating someone else. All the while she faces many more trials and triumphs them all. She almost gets to run away with her love who fathered her child but circumstances keep that from happening. However slightly sad the ending is, it also ties up many loose ends. Overall, even with some rather drawn out details it is written amazingly well and a great read for anyone."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This book is rightly a classic.Its in depth portraits of a courageous woman, who defies public morality, and of her opponent-lover the despicable Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale are timeless.This book is also a frontal attack on the Pharisaism of Puritanism (and other religions?), symbolized by the Reverend, who 'clear as the mid-day sunshine on the scarlet letter, establish himself a false and sin-stained creature of the dust.'The comment on his death 'After exhausting life in his efforts for mankind's spiritual good' is the same as 'Do what I say, don't do what I do'.The Pharisaism sounds also clearly in the following sentence (shortened): 'Pearl, the daughter of Hester Prynne, the demon of offspring became the richest heiress of her day. Not improbably, this circumstance wrought a very material change in the public estimation and at marriageable period of life, might have mingled her wild blood with the lineage of the devoutest Puritan among them all.'In sharp contrast with Puritanism, the ultimate message of the author is crystal clear: 'Be true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred.'A magisterial human novel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"This isn't your book if your looking for adventure or swordfights or any of that sortI had to read this for my English class and my first impression was from all the other rumors about it.. \\"it's boring\\" and etc. As a result, when I began reading I held that in my mind. However as I kept reading, I discovered Hawthorne's character are so 3 dimensional in their personality and who they really are. Hawthorne does an AMAZING job of describing his characters and giving them life I couldn't help but begin to really love the bookThe only problem was when I had to give my presentation on it.. Hawthorne took all my insight..hahaha"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter","review":"Okay I'll admit right here and now that the first time I heard about this book was indeed for my AP English class but unlike the other degenerates out there I actually appreciated this book. It's simply amazing! Hawthorne's writing is intensely descriptive and so full of symbolism that you're pretty much drowning in it, but that doesn't make him a horrible author. In fact it's one of the things I love so much about this story.Hester's shunning from the colony is absurd by today's standards, but you can't compare Puritannical methods to today's trials and tribulations. If you are then you're a fool. Anyone with half a braincell will know the glaring differences between how we run things today and how things were viewed back then. This book seems a bit too advanced for seventeen year olds to handle only because they'd rather be watching reality tv or crappy Hollywood ''films'' to pass the time instead of entertaining their mind with a book.There's really not much I can say about the book that hasn't been gone over and over again in previous reviews: I simply wanted to address how enraged high school juniors shouldn't be the only voice that is allowed to be heard in regards to The Scarlet Letter."},{"Title":"The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical Linguistic Approach to Christian Doctrine","review":"Kevin Vanhoozer's Drama of Doctrine is a sweeping reconceptualization of Christian doctrine using the metaphor of drama. In an age when many pastors and theologians believe doctrine to be irrelevant or even divisive and dangerous; Vanhoozer's project cuts like a laser to reveal the importance, purpose, and practicality of biblical doctrine for the 21st century church. According to Vanhoozer, doctrine expounds to the church the Divine drama of the canonical scriptures in a way that allows the church to act within that continuing drama. Doctrine teaches us to improvise fittingly in God's continuing drama. As Vanhoozer puts it, \\"Canonical-linguistic theology attends both to the drama in the text--what God is doing in the world through Christ--and to the drama that continues in the church as God uses Scripture to address, edify, and confront its readers\\" (17). While this book is long, it is worthy of a wide reading by pastors, theologians, and churchmen and women around the world."},{"Title":"The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical Linguistic Approach to Christian Doctrine","review":"This is an excellent work which seeks to set out the method for Vanhoozer's theology. It is orthodox yet aims at new ways of thinking of old ideas. Vanhoozer attempts to deal with the major problems that evangelicals face in this age; that is, trying to fit modern problems into the Christian Canon (i.e. Wayne Grudem; though Grudem can be appreciated as well), and on the other end, accepting postmodern notions of textual interpretation. To put it simply, Vanhoozer deals with how the Church is to go about living wisely all under the guise of a drama which we are ultimately part of without accepting more dangerous alternatives to traditional doctrine. I am convinced that this volume will be an immense help to those who struggle with rigid doctrine (Vanhoozer is very orthodox), modern epistemology (this is canonical-linguistic theology), postmodern hermeneutics (Vanhoozer deals with the major players very well), or all of the above (I think evangelicals struggle with all). His writing is articulated well and is yet enjoyable to read. I highly recommend this weighty yet worthy volume."},{"Title":"The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical Linguistic Approach to Christian Doctrine","review":"This book should jolt both liberals & evangelicals. Vanhoozer favourably quotes sociologist of religion, Jack Wolfe, who nails down what the church is facing: \\"Evangelical churches lack doctrine because they want to attract new members. Mainline churches lack doctrine because they want to hold on to those declining numbers of members they have\\" (cited on p. xii). The great strength of this book is the call to marry the teaching of biblical doctrine with living it personally and in church life. If his treatment is followed, it should deal with the disease that teaches doctrine in a \\"dry as dust\\" form.Some may find it difficult to adjust to the redefinition of theological categories: \\"This book sets forth new metaphors for theology (dramaturgy), Scripture (the script), theological understanding (performance), the church (the company), and the pastor (director)\\" (p. xii).I'd recommend this book to thoughtful pastors and laity who may have forgotten their responsibility to teach sound/healthy doctrine (I Tim. 4:6; 6:3; Titus 1:9; 2:1). I hope the book's length (488pp) does not deter them."},{"Title":"The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical Linguistic Approach to Christian Doctrine","review":"Kevin J. Vanhoozer's The Drama Doctrine is by far one of the most challenging and rewarding books that I have worked through this year. In this magisterial volume, Vanhoozer wrestles with the role of doctrine in the church, interacting with insights from postmodernism and developing creative ways of speaking of the respective roles of Scripture, tradition, and theology in the life of God's people. His controlling - and creative - motif is that of drama, articulating the role of doctrine as \\"direction for the Christian's fitting participation in the drama of redemption, thus enabling one to continue the missions of the Son and the Spirit into new situations\\" (110).Using George Lindbeck's \\"cultural-linguistic\\" post-liberal approach to theology as his foil, Vanhoozer develops a \\"canonical linguistic\\" post-conservative approach. His approach to Christian doctrine integrates the insights of postmodernism (regarding the epistemological importance of community, culture, and language) while robustly maintaining historically orthodox views of Scripture and the knowledge of God. The result is a satisfying account of the importance of the church, Scripture, tradition, liturgy, and community in the Christian life, as well as the abiding value of doctrine for the church. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical Linguistic Approach to Christian Doctrine","review":"Kevin Vanhoozer's The Drama of Doctrine is an illuminating and thought- provoking approach to Scripture that both preserves the integrity and centrality of the Biblical text within the faith community, and with avoiding the narrow literalism (which Vanhoozer calls \\"propositionalism\\") of the right wing of the evangelical movement.For anyone concerned with the study of the Bible, and especially those charged with preaching the Word, Vanhoozer provides an image of how the Bible works within a community of faith: It is a multivalenced script for the life and thought played out by the Chistian people. His very effective Use of contemporary dramatic theory is an exciting alternative to the bland liberalism of the left (that pretty much ignores the importance of the text) and the rigidity of the right (that removes the text from the historical process, and seeks to cast the Bible in bronze). This is an extremely valuable book!"},{"Title":"The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical Linguistic Approach to Christian Doctrine","review":"What I'd like to add to what's been said so far is that Vanhoozer restates, not reinvents, theory of doctrine so as to make doctrine at every point a matter of both believing and doing as directed by doctrine. His approach is deeply redemptive-historical. This frame, the scriptural frame, allows him to think of doctrine as directive without giving up one inch to contemporary theology's attempt to reinvent key doctrines. This should be read and understood, i.e. dramatized (lived because Christianity is real), by all ministers."},{"Title":"The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical Linguistic Approach to Christian Doctrine","review":"Hermeneutics is an area of increasing interest to me, and it seems that it is one of the most important aspects of the recent challenges and developments in Evangelicalism. In light of that I think The Drama of Doctrine has been one of the most transformitive books I've read in regards to how I read the Bible, and one of the best explorations of contemporary hermeneutics and its related issues available.VanHoozer is an expert in hermeneutical issues, and especially postmodern hermeneutics. He by no means wholeheartedly embraces postmodernism in fact he critiques it in many ways, but he also sees its value and does not approach it in a reactionary way, an element of the book I appreciated.Two of the best aspects of the book are its ingenious use of the themes of play and theater to better understand the theological tack, and its explanation and promotion of something I see as a very promising step in evangelical theology, post-conservatism.www.newwaystheology.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical Linguistic Approach to Christian Doctrine","review":"I'm only a little into this book, but from what I've read it is shaping up to be a terrific read. I have made plenty of pencil markings already."},{"Title":"The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical Linguistic Approach to Christian Doctrine","review":"I hope that many people give Kevin Vanhoozer's book a chance. I understand that the cover of the book is not too catchy, but besides that, what it contains can change your perspective on the necessity and relevancy of scripture for your life today. There is very few people out there that can clearly as profoundly with an artist's brush paint a practical realistic theology of the Bible.Vanhoozer's illustrative use of Drama and the Stage are profound and inivative for the creative thinker as well as for boring dusty stale systematic theologian. My friends, if these perspectives catch on, it is unthinkable what good could come from such a work. Please pick up this book today, and savor the eloquent truth that is found therein."},{"Title":"The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical Linguistic Approach to Christian Doctrine","review":"Vanhoozer tries to appropriate George Lindbeck's cultural-linguistic approach for biblicists via what he calls a \\"canonical-linguistic\\" approach. Basically, he claims the Bible has a logic of usage and thus a system of habituating consistent meanings internal to itself, before it is socialized into ecclesial life. Historically this is highly problematic, given that the Bible's content and orthodox meaning were determined by the Church over several centuries (50AD-400ish, if not later). If you don't believe that last sentence then you will probably love Vanhoozer's book. If you're looking for something a bit more intellectually satisfying then you should probably skip Vanhoozer's qualifications of Lindbeck and go read Lindbeck's \\"The Nature of Doctrine\\" yourself. On the plus side, Vanhoozer displays more or less sophisticated dealings with many post-modern theorists that do not get dealt with by many of Vanhoozer's colleagues, and that should be applauded."},{"Title":"The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical Linguistic Approach to Christian Doctrine","review":"I gotta warn you, there's nothing like this book nowhere nohow.

Let me say, as someone who also served with that regiment many years ago; his behaviour is nothing more than a publicity gimmick. Why? Because there are far too many former members of that regiment who work in the media spotlight and also publish books who do not obscure themselves in such a fashion. I mention this because there is something very similar about that man's behaviour and the overall tone of this unrelated work. Even the photograph on the front cover shows 2 soldiers wearing black berets with their faces obscured as though they are SAS and should not be identified. The SAS \\"never\\" wore a black beret!From the very front cover we are asked to believe that this \\"Omnibus\\" of SAS stories includes; Soldier A was behind Iraqi lines, Soldier B was a South Atlantic hero and Soldier C took part in some secret Arabia war. Soldiers D, E and F appear in an equally disappointing Omnibus 2!The thing that did it for me, however, was written on the back cover where the publishers state the content has been \\"Factionalised for security reasons!\\" Think about that. We often have works of fact that have been deliberately fictionalised - for whatever reason. In this instance, however, we have a whole new concept of Fiction being dressed up as fact.In short, it is utter tosh.Having said all that, all might have been forgiven had the resultant work been a good read but this is one work about a fictional SAS which is not worth picking up.NM"},{"Title":"Blythe Style","review":"I own a Blythe doll, which just recently arrived here at home after a lot of research on my part. I know about face types (\\"superior and \\"radiant\\"), the different companies who are allowed to reproduce the dolls (which were originally released in 1972 for one year only, by Kenner), customization of Blythe dolls, and the best websites to read tutorials on that, and where to find outfits for my new, fantastic Blythe!As you may have guessed by now I am a \\"reading-type\\" person! Because of this, I felt that it would be fun and important to also add the books which photographer Gina Garan had created, to my Blythe collection.The way the story goes, Gina received an original Kenner Blythe doll as a gift from someone who felt that Blythe looked like Gina. Gina began taking her on photoshoots and practicing taking pictures using her as a model. Shortly Gina was never without her. Since that time Blythe has travelled the world with Gina, making each of them famous both in the fashion arena and in charity work as well. Many of the Blythes in this wonderful book are dressed by top couture designers, and were later shown off in Vogue Nippon magazine, ultimately to be auctioned off to support children's charities. How great! The introduction to this book explains how that came about and is written by Junko Wong, a lovely person who met up with Gina and really got much of the interest in the Blythe phenomenon to grow.As a mother of two children with severe dsabilities (and five sons in total!), I am always gratified to read about events which raise money for children's charities of all sorts!However, that is actually beside the point in one sense. This book stands on its own as an elegant testimonial to a fantastic, personality packed creation...the doll who is Blythe.Blythe dolls have four different eye colors! What you do is pull a string on the back of her head to make her eyes click to a different color. She has two \\"straight ahead\\" colors, then there is one which looks off to the right, and one which looks off to the left. One of the \\"straight ahead\\" colors is what is called the \\"main color\\". In the case of my doll, it is described as a \\"mysterious purple\\" color. I love all of her eye colors and they do change her expression and personality. Add a collection of doll clothes, such as the great ones you can get through Gina's own website, www.thisisblythe.com, which I thoroughly recommend, and you will be having the time of your life dressing up your own doll, photographing her, if you enjoy that, or just..loving her.If you don't want to spend the money on a doll, buy this book instead! Or consider this other bookThis is Blythe, by Gina as well, available here on Amazon.com . Gina has captured every expresssion, every mood, every situation you might imagine coming up in a doll's daily life.

Included within are the well known designers of our favorite dolls: Milk, Over The Stripes, Monno Comme Ca, Tommy February6. It's interesting to see their one of a kind designs - the ones that weren't mass produced!If the cover picture of Blythe in Gucci isn't enough to inspire you to buy this great book I'm not sure what else will.The pictures are gorgeous, large and bright and the designer outfits are completely adorable (You'll want them all, trust me!).

The characters and their relationships were complicated enough to keep me very interested. Bob Ferguson was a great character and even though he operated on the edge, I was always rooting for him. Very good series and I would like to see more of Ferg."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team: Fires of War","review":"I try to read novels dealing with nuclear weapons, the genera I write in.The plot is built around extracting Pu-239 from spent nuclear reactor fuel rods. Uranium-235 or U-238 is used to make fuel pellets for a nuclear reactor. After a period of time, the fuel pellets are removed from the reactor and placed in a cooling pond, as the authors describe in the book. A small portion of uranium-238 in the fuel pellets capture a neutron and become plutonium. Once cooled the pellets can be dissolved and the plutonium extracted--a very complex and dangerous process.The story is technically feasible, and the authors do not tread into the highly technical area of nuclear weapons physics, yet they manage to tell an interesting tale.I cringe when authors and media announcers use \\"bullets\\" instead of cartridges. A pistol, rifle, submachine gun, etc., is loaded with cartridges (brass case, primer, propellant, and a bullet). When the powder ignites, the bullet is propelled down the barrel.FIRES OF WAR is a good read for fans of action heroes. Bob Ferguson is less of a superman than some others, which makes the Fires of War an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team: Fires of War","review":"Ive read the other First Team books, This one was worth the wait.I wasnt disappointed."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team: Fires of War","review":"I read this pretty quick and felt it was better than other First Team books, for the most part a \\"page turner\\".

It left me waiting to see what happens in the next one in series."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team: Fires of War","review":"I found this book incredibly slow and lacking any kind of real action that Mr. Bond was known for in his earlier books. This books story line was interesting, but in the end nothing really happens. I really enjoyed Bond's Vortex, Red Phoenix, etc., but this First Team series dosen't come close to comparing to the action and page turning excitement those books gave you. I don't know if hes just \\"lending\\" his name to Jim DeFelice's books or not, but I can't recommend this particular series to anyone."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team: Fires of War","review":"This book starts off kind of slow, but it builds momentum rapidly. The ending is quite suprising."},{"Title":"Larry Bond's First Team: Fires of War","review":"I love Bond's books but this one just bogged down about halfway through. Not compelling at all. I couldn't force myself to finish it."},{"Title":"The Dead Beat","review":"Robert Bloch can really write, but he can't always hit the high notes. In his novella \\"The Dead Beat\\" Bloch holds our attention for the first hundred pages with a hardboiled noir tale of Larry the Fox. The moniker is a tip-off that Bloch penned this on his lunch hour, yet, because he's Robert Bloch, even a mediocre effort from him is a cut above most other crime fiction.Larry Fox is as amoral as they come: a poseur pianist and callow youth with a decidedly checkered past who blames his life on the orphanage he grew up in as a \\"bastard.\\" Bloch paces the story well for the first 100 pp. which drip with authentic 50s ambience, loose women, gangsters and junkies. Larry is a guy you love to hate and anticipate his comeuppance, sort of. The hesitation rests on the fact that there are no angels in this story, everyone's a little tainted or so gullible (\\"square\\") they deserve what's coming to them.The ending is predictable and does not live up to the camp paperback cover's hype about a \\"suspense shocker\\" which surpasses Bloch's bestseller, \\"Psycho.\\"As the pace slackens somewhat, the author tries to enliven the dialogue by peppering it with a 39 rap by a professor-type who discourses on the profundities of youthful angst and the generational divide.At p. 113 an intriguing speculation about American youth rendered into psychological mutants by the haunting spectre of the H-bomb is a potentially interesting bit of James Shelby Downardian contemplation that Bloch should have developed into a theme of post-modern youth not as Beatnik but Deadbeat. He doesn't go there however, and the book ends with a comically reactionary rant against the Beat movement itself, hence the title, even though Larry Fox is no kind of Beat.This is entertaining, mid-20th century schlock, suitable for airplanes, buses and late-night reading when concentration on deeper material would be difficult to muster."},{"Title":"The Dead Beat","review":"This is not a mystery. It is a snapshot of the sixties, when the \\"longhairs\\" loved classical music, and the cool kids were learning to boogey. And when squares were bemoaning the beginnings of the youth revolution."},{"Title":"The Dead Beat","review":"Although destined to be remembered as the author of Psycho (the novel upon which Hitchcock's classic thriller was based), author Robert Bloch wrote many fine tales of horror and suspense. The Dead Beat is one of them. Larry Fox is a jazz pianist just filling in at a local nightclub when the singer, who is a woman from his criminal past, steps onto the stage. Larry decides to extort money from her, but only gets roughed up for his trouble and his unconscious body is discovered by Elinor and Walter Harris, a soon to be middle aged couple out celebrating their wedding anniversary. The kindly couple nursemaid Larry and invite him to stay with them until he recovers. Larry, sensing that he's found the perfect hideaway from which to attack his former partner, accepts and begins formulting an intricate plan for revenge. Bloch keeps the pace quick and even tosses in some social commentary that remains relevant to this day and age, despite the book being well over forty years old. Anything Bloch wrote should be considered required reading for suspense fans. Recommended."},{"Title":"Horror: Another 100 Best Books","review":"While its predecessor was pretty essential, this somehow fails to deliver. Inevitably, searching for another hundred critics and a further hundred works to look at meant a danger of scraping the barrel, but that's not the problem somehow. While the first volume felt bold in expanding the remit of the genre, this time round you can't help feeling that you bought a book with 'horror' on the cover, but with a load of voices inside trying to sell you on material that simply doesn't fit the bill. Are they trying to be clever? Are they too good to review genre 'trash'? Maybe they just haven't read much horror?The latter suspicion is raised by the number of critics contained herein with very dubious horror credentials. The lay-out doesn't help either - the review is now followed by a CV of the writer responsible, and I really didn't want to know how many corny dragon books or redundant movie tie-ins they've put their names to.There's good stuff in here, and it's nice and easy to dip into, but it all feels rather strained and uneven. There are far too many horror anthologies, too much personal anecdote posing as critique and - I'll say it again - far too many non-genre books posing as horror. Maybe I'm a little oversensitive as a lifelong fan of a genre that's long been regarded as the bottom of the literary heap - but reading sci-fi hacks recommending thrillers in a supposed exploration of horror gets my goat a little.Do buy the first one - it's a classic - but this is a rather weaker effort that suffers by comparison."},{"Title":"Horror: Another 100 Best Books","review":"I picked up \\"Horror: 100 Best Books\\" back in 1988/89 because I wanted to read something exciting. I love horror novels and the 80's saw a boom in the market but 90% of the material coming out was cliche and weak. Here was a book listing 100 horror novels, and not chosen by reviewers but by authors in the field. My first thought on buying the book was to see how many I had read of the 100. I was a savvy teenager (in my mind) and I had read tons of books. I felt I had probably read half the books listed. It turns out I read 9 of the books listed. (Just tape the L to my forehead).I went out to read a fair portion of the books listed but I'm falling off track. This review is about \\"Horror: Another 100 Best Books\\".I enjoyed this one leaps and bounds over its predecessor (which is saying something). First off, the original only covers books published from 1987 back. A lot of the titles listed are old or they are major classics (remember, I was looking for new blood; I wanted to try books which slipped under the radar). The essays by the writers are very short and in some cases cold. These authors are discussing the books that influenced them but their essay reads like Joe Friday's \\"Just the facts, Ma'am\\".There is none of that in the the new book. The new time frame covers books from 2003 back. The essays feel expanded and are filled with the wided eyed awe you would expect from authors discussing their inspirations. There are some well known books listed but many more \\"new blood\\" titles to put me on the hunt. (I had read 17 of the books listed but I've picked up 10 more of the recommended material without a shred of disappointment).Each essay begins with a synopsis of the author whose work is being covered (what else they wrote, a brief bio, and a history of the books publication) and ends with a brief bio on the author covering the book of choice. There were a few cases when the discussion felt more focused on a film version of the selected title or the book covered is questionable as being of the horror genre but they are easily dismissed when moving on to the next installment (though these reasons account for the 4 out of 5 stars).I recommend this book for any fan of horror fiction (even fans of fantasy and suspense). The essays give enough material to let you know what the book is about without giving away spoilers (for the most part anyway).There is even an appendix in the book that lists futher reading and it's not a sparse appendix. Basically, if you enjoy reading Amazon's reviews to see if a book sounds good to you then this is required reading. Not everything is for everyone here but it will arouse your curiosity."},{"Title":"Horror: Another 100 Best Books","review":"This is a sequel to Jones and Newman's superb 1988 \\"Horror: 100 Best Books\\" and may be even better than the first installment. The editors continue to seek out books that bend the genre, like Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Fowles' \\"The Collector.\\" There's also new evaluations of contemporary classics, like King's \\"Pet Sematary\\", Harris' \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", and Levin's \\"Rosemary's Baby.\\" And of course the most recent best books since '88 are here. The editors also include a massive list of \\"Further Reading\\" that mentions a whole boatload of books from in and around the genre. Web resources that detail internet locations for both the authors of the 100 books listed and their reviewers appear as add-ons at the back of the book. The reviewers this time are a mix of familiar names in horror, and some new faces that I didn't know but was happy to meet. This book should take its place alongside the first volume as essential for horror fans."},{"Title":"Horror: Another 100 Best Books","review":"I enjoyed the first collection and I'm glad Jones and Newman added another one. As the editors point out, even though the first collection contained a hundred titles it was not an exhaustive list. The editors don't want to give the impression that these were the ONLY books worth reading. Also - especially with horror - it is important to have some sort of guide to help separate the good stuff from the dross.The only problem with this particular compilation is that the contributors are not of the same caliber as the first one. The original Horror: 100 Best Books included contributions by Stephen King and Harlan Ellison, as well as snippets of criticism from deceased masters such as Poe, Lovecraft, and James. I think the editors are aware of this, which is why the contributors' bios follow the mini-essays immediately rather than being placed in the back of the book as they were before. Some of the names are familiar to me but most are not. The contributors are not all authors but editors, illustrators, translators, etc. The result is that general quality of the essays is not as good. For instance, I am glad that The Phantom of the Opera is included in this volume, but the interpretation provided by Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier is the worst analysis of that novel that I've ever read."},{"Title":"Horror: Another 100 Best Books","review":"The relatively low score on Amazon for this title is kind of amazing. Of course, it's not nearly as excellent as Newman and Jone's earlier Horror; the 100 Best books, but it towers above most other readers guides covering this genre. I would even call it essential, just because there are so few guides of this quality. It's particularly good at listing the better anthologies. Each book has an essay written by a practicioner of the horror genre, and as you can guess, the essays and choices vary greatly in quality. It skews somewhat to the literary and semi-obscure. Overall, I found it quite convincing and probably picked up about 25 titles I'd be interested in reading, which I find to be a terrific ratio."},{"Title":"Horror: Another 100 Best Books","review":"This book is a collection of essays, in the majority. There is, of course, given the title, an earlier volume. This I have not gotten around to reading yet, but I probably will now.However, in a really well packaged publication, the editors have listed what was chosen in that volume in the back of this one. Very well done, as this is one of the first things a reader will wonder about, especially as some choices are referenced throughout the text.The project has been constructed by asking a lot of writers and editors to choose a book they would like included to write about, and write a short piece about why. Given the essay part is around 400 pages, these are all quite short. I imagine there might have been the odd grumpy argument about who was chosen for particular selections.A wide range of new and older material, and novels, anthologies and collections all feature, which makes this even better, I think, not just being full of novel after novel.The weakest part of the book is the tendency to have somewhat bloated--given the length of the essays--author bibliographic or career summaries, large chunks of some not being relevant to horror. Given they know what a URL is, for those that had bilbliographies, could have given the link. Maybe the promo was part of the deal to get the writing.Also included at the end is a further reading list, in chronological publication order - and for the average type and speed reader of books, this will take a lifetime or two to get through - and also a list of writers, with actual urls to find them on the web.This 'webliography' also includes links to the actual novels, for public domain examples such as William Hope Hodgson, and evinces a very 21st century feel throughout the essays, in general, as far as being aware of what is going on technologically and in the media. Not always the case, it would appear, in books.So, high marks all around for this book.For people looking to start on horror that hadn't read anything, really, this pair of books would be a fantastic find, no doubt."},{"Title":"Horror: Another 100 Best Books","review":"I think I found this volume to be more helpful than the first one. A lot of obvious choices marked the first volume, and found more inspiration from this second list. Some more recent works are covered here. Nice job."},{"Title":"Horror: Another 100 Best Books","review":"I disliked this book very much. I bought under the impression that it would be a nice compilation of horror stories. I was disappointed to find that it was essays and no stories. I could not muster enough courage to even finish the first section."},{"Title":"History of the reformation of the sixteenth century","review":"Those who delight in the Lord Jesus Christ and a salvation by grace through faith alone will relish this incredibly thorough book (containing five volumes in one). d'Aubigne's style and his evident affection for his subject are truly compelling. It is as much a book on Theology as it is history, but at over 800 pages, there is room for the weaving together of both. d'Aubigne gives quite extensive quotations from both sides of the Reformation, but if you are of the Catholic persuasion, you'd better have thick skin. Get this book if you want to review the mighty dealings of God in history affecting your freedoms today."},{"Title":"History of the reformation of the sixteenth century","review":"This book, although very long and detailed makes clear the bravery required to face the then-dictatorship of the Catholic church. The reformation of the Christian world is laid out in a very readable form though the print style is a little hard on the eyes, but the story keeps you going. I'd read other sources before but none bring together the huge amount of detail that this book does."},{"Title":"History of the reformation of the sixteenth century","review":"Excellent detailed information concerning the Protestant Reformation. The print is not real easy on the eyes but the author writes in a way to keep the interest and encourage reading. I've learned a lot and highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"History of the reformation of the sixteenth century","review":"Jean Henri Merle D'aubigne's History of the Reformation in the Sixteenth Century is an excellent resource for anyone who wishes to know more about the Reformation. It is a long read (5 volumes), but worth the effort and time. In these books D'aubigne takes you on a trip through reformation history, visiting Germany, France, England... etc. He doesn't simply move through one country, finish it and then move on to the next, he visits countries again and again. First he will take you to Germany, stay there for a little while, and then he'll say something like \\"let us leave Luther a captive at the Wartburg and go see what is happening in Switzerland\\". After dealing with Switzerland he comes back to Germany and catches up on what is happening there, leave again, come back, and so on. And instead of merely recounting events,\\"this happened and then that happened\\", he'll often take you into, as it were, the different scenes in history, bringing 'to life' the different characters. For instance, when Luther is called to Augsburg to recant, you get to see and hear(or rather imagine while reading) Cardinal Cajetan ranting and yelling at Luther, Luther standing before him, very frustrated, trying to reply, finally getting some words in and trapping Cajetan with his own argument. Furthermore, D'aubigne uses several letters from the reformers, enemies of the reformers and their friends, and quotes historical documents, such as the Papal Bull, the 95 Theses and Tetzel's Theses, to help 'transport' you into history.Perhaps the thing I like best about this historical work is that D'aubigne aims to show \\"God in History\\". He always acknowledges the sovereignty of God, that the events that he recounts are ordained, decreed, by God. Here are some excerpts from one of his introductions:\\"Had the Reformation been what many Romanists and Protestants of our days imagine it, had it been that negative system of negative reason which, like a fretful child, rejects whatever is displeasing to it, and disowns the grand truths and leading ideas of universal Christianity, it would never have crossed the threshold of the schools, or been known beyond the narrow limits of the cloister or perhaps of the friar's cell. But with Protestantism, as many understand the word, it had no connexion. Far from being an emaciated, an enervated body, it rose up like a man full of strength and energy.Two considerations will account for the suddenness and extent of this revolution. One must be sought in God; the other among men. The impulse was given by an invisible and mighty hand: the change accomplished was the work of Omnipotence. An impartial and attentive observer, who looks beyond the surface, must necessarily be led to this conclusion. But as God works by second causes, another task remains for the historian. Many circumstances which have often passed unnoticed, gradually prepared the world for the great transformation of the sixteenth century, so that the human mind was ripe when the hour of its emancipation arrived.It is the historian's duty to combine these two great elements in the picture he presents to his readers. This has been my endeavour in the following pages. I shall be easily understood so long as I am occupied in investigating the secondary causes that concurred in producing the revolution I have undertaken to describe. Many perhaps will understand me less clearly, and will even be tempted to charge me with superstition, when I ascribe the completion of the work to God. It is a conviction, however, that I fondly cherish, These volumes, as well as the motto I have prefixed to them, lay down in the chief and foremost place this simple and pregnant principle: GOD IN HISTORY.\\"\\"In history, God should be acknowledged and proclaimed. The history of the world should be set forth as the annals of the government of the Sovereign King.I have gone down into the lists wither the recitals of our historians have invited me. There I have witnessed the actions of men and of nations, developing themselves with energy, and contending in violent collision. I have heard a strange din of arms, but I have been nowhere shown the majestic countenance of the presiding Judge...Shall we not recognize the hand of God in those grand manifestations, those great men, those mighty nations, which arise and start as it were from the dust of the earth, and communicate a fresh impulse, a new form and destiny to the human race? Shall we not acknowledge him in those heroes who spring from society at appointed epochs - who display a strength and activity beyond the ordinary limits of humanity...?\\"\\"The epoch whose history I am desirous of retracing is important for the present generation. When a man becomes sensible of his own weakness, he is generally inclined to look for support in the institutions he sees flourishing around him, or else in the bold devices of his imagination. The history of the Reformation shows that nothing new can be made out of things old; and that if, according to our Savior's expression, we require new bottles for new wine, we must also have new wine for new bottles. It directs man to God as the universal agent in history, - to that Divine word, ever old by the eternal nature of the truths it contains, ever new by the regenerative influence that it exerts; which purified society three centuries ago, which restored faith in God to souls enfeebled by superstition, and which, at every epoch in the history of man, is the fountain whence floweth salvation.\\"\\"I address this history to those who love to see past events exactly as they occurred, and not by the aid of that magic glass of genius which colors and magnifies, but which sometimes also diminishes and changes them. Neither the philosophy of the eighteenth nor the romanticism of the nineteenth century will guide my judgments or supply my colors. he history of the Reformation is written in the spirit of the work itself. Principles, it is said, have no modesty. It is their nature to rule, and they steadily assert their privilege. Do they encounter other principles in their paths that would dispute their nature to rule, and they steadily assert their privilege. Do they encounter other principles in their paths that would dispute their empire, they give battle immediately. A principle never rests until it has gained the victory; and it cannot be otherwise - with it to reign is to live. If it does not reign supreme, it dies. Thus, at the same time that I declare my inability and unwillingness to enter into rivalry with other historians of the Reformation, I make an exception in favour of the principles on which this history is founded, and I firmly maintain their superiority.Up to this hour we do not possess, as far as I am aware, any complete history of the memorable epoch that is about to employ my pen. Nothing indicated that this deficiency would be supplied when I began this work. This is the only circumstance that could have induced me to undertake it, and I here put it forward as my justification. This deficiency still exists; and I pray to Him from whom cometh every good and perfect gift, to grant that this humble work may not be profitless to my readers.\\" END QUOTESFor further incitement to read this work, here is a review of one of D'aubigne's historys by F. Godet:\\"What difference there is between the perusal of a work of this kind and that of one of the religious novels with which our public is now satiated. In these latter, notwithstanding all the good-will of the authors, there is always, or nearly always, something unwholesome. Imagination, that admirable gift of God, is employed to transport us into the chiaro-osouro(?) of fictitious scenes, which communicate a kind of fascination from which it is difficult to emerge, to return to the humdrum of every-day life, and to confine ourselves to the narrow limits of our every-day duties. Here on the contrary we find the full light of historic truth, imagination restored to its true object - that of giving life to real facts. The faith of this martyr, it really struggled, really triumphed - this blood, it really flowed - this pile, its flames lighted up the surrounding country, but in so doing they really consumed their victim. When we read these true histories our hearts do not swell with vain ambition or aspire to an inaccessible ideal. We do not say: \\"If I were this one, or that one.\\" We are obliged to commune with ourselves, to examine our consciences, to humble ourselves with the question: What would become of me if I were called to profess my faith through similar sufferings? Each on of us is thus called to less self-complacency, to greater humility, but at the same time to greater contentment with his lot, to greater anxiety to serve his God with greater faithfulness and greater activity...\\"I would also recommend the lesser known sequel: The History of the Reformation in Europe in the Time of Calvin It's 8 volumes, so it's rather long....but worth the read!"},{"Title":"History of the reformation of the sixteenth century","review":"I was looking forward to this classic reprint, but when it arrived it became quickly apparent that the print was unreadable.

Each person, even if only given a short time on the stage of this fabulous novel, is as rich and vivid as a person would be living their life before your eyes.This book is also a window into prejudice, cruelty, and personal disenfranchisement that was ordinary during the time of his writing.

It seems to me he would have been more effective in getting to the heart of the American experience in poetry rather than novel. And more concise too."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"\\"Look Homeward Angel\\", together with its sequel \\"Of Time and the River\\", is an intense and panoromic narrative of life in, and a paean to, early 20th Century America from the perspective of a Southern writer gone North. As such it foresages the experiences of others who came after him like Willie Morris. Wolfe's work artfully evokes much of the era that Ken and Ric Burns seek to capture in their documentaries but from the perspective of a participant and his personal struggles in life. (Wolfe's evocation of New York City in the 20s and 30s in \\"Of Time and the River\\" comes to mind in this regard). In sum, Wolfe's works are not only top-notch examples of American literature but stand as a monumental and inspiring expression of American culture and of the spirit that animated much of our society during the dawning period of the 20th Century. Wolfe's work is not in the tradition of pop culture and has little in common with the work of the current writer of the same name. Thus, reading Wolfe's work can be intellectually challenging. Nevertheless, tackling these books can be a rewarding and enjoyable experience for those seriously interested in American history and culture. Wolfe's work, notwithstanding its challenging level of literacy to some, is very absorbing and will only be found to be boring by more pedestrian readers or by those Yankee snobs who have contempt for the work's mostly plebeian subject matter."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"After reading this in college decades ago, it seemed time for a refresher. I had been impressed as a teenager by the vivid descriptions Wolfe used and wondered if the passing of many years would change my perception of the quality of his writing. It did not. The story is captivating and Wolfe's style invited me to re-read paragraphs just for the fun of it."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Author ofAfinidad: A novel of a serial killerAztec Dawn: A tale of sacrifical murder, from Manhattan to MexicoLike the author himself, this first novel resonates with the surge of life. It is passionate, sensual, and unsparing. Every aspect of life, from the characters' every thought and emotion, to descriptions of the natural world around them, is explored in great detail, sometimes to the point of being rambling and incoherent. However, there is a structure to the novel that ensures that the reader does not lose his way for very long. The book is set in a town ringed by the North Carolina mountains, at the beginning of the twentieth century, and tells the tale of a young man's entry into and passage through a life that was intensely sensual and chaotic. The large, rumbustious family that he is born into is given as much attention as he is. There are no aspects of family or individual life left unexplored. You get to know the members as well, or better, than you know your own, with all their idiosyncrasies, strengths and weaknesses. And when the young man goes out into the world to attend school and college, the reader goes with him in all his thoughts and deeds. We learn things that we may feel we could have done without knowing, but the story is a deeply honest recording of a young person growing up. It is, perhaps, a book that has not aged well, because the modern taste in books is for getting to the point of the story fairly quickly; but, for anyone who enjoys a rich flow of prose, of powerful use of language to create incredible imagery, character descriptions, and emotions, then Look Homeward, Angel is a must. You must read it for the journey that it is, and not for a particular plot or ending. I cannot understand why people criticize the book for being autobiographical. That is as legitimate a theme for a book as any other.Yes, the book is flawed and could have benefited from more editing by Wolfe's editor, Maxwell Perkins, but, for anyone who loves to get to know characters intimately, who enjoy being drawn deeply into a writer's web of lyrical narrative, this book will satisfy."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"When I was a teenager, I read Wolfe's final novel \\"You Can't Go Home Again\\" and was floored by its poetry and keen observation. I am a few (OK, quite a few) years older and recently returned to Wolfe and read his first big success \\"Look Homeward Angel.\\" It was a strange and not totally successful experience.The book is a fictional account of Wolfe's own childhood, and is a tragi-comical coming of age novel. The best parts, and there are quite a few, are achingly beautiful and poetic. Those scenes delivering newspapers in the early mornings, concerning a death in the family, and his early years at college as World War I was erupting are beautiful. Wolfe at his best makes you feel you are there and feeling the same things his main character Eugene Gant is feeling.Then there are chapters that seem to repeat what was said earlier or stretch an idea into a chapter length section when one page would do. Plot is not Wolfe's forte - it is conjuring scenes and emotions through smells, sights, sounds, and images. Wolfe adopts several different styles to accomplish this feat, but at its best this is a mix of super detailed realism and incredibly nostalgic poetry.Wolfe is legendary for his gigantic manuscripts that his editors whittled down to a more manageable size. For modern audiences, perhaps a little more editing would be desirable. It is a shame but I see why Wolfe was once so popular and why his literary star has dimmed over the decades. Still, at his best, Wolfe was amazing - you hit that final chapter of \\"Angel\\" and there are few final chapters in American literature as beautiful, powerful, and purely imaginative."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"This novel, his first, captures perhaps more than any other debut the fantastic potential this young man would show in his later writings. There is an old maxim that states that one should write what he or she knows, and Thomas Wolfe did just that. Other writers, with less than sincere motives, portray their surroundings with cynicism and malice; Wolfe wrote with an idealism that is heartbreaking in its naivete.Eugene Gant, like his real life counterpart, is a young man overflowing with a passion for life. Wolfe captured perfectly the ebullient and sensitive nature of this youth. But more than that, he somehow managed to portray Youth itself, with all of its passions, heartaches, and fever.Wolfe was no less generous with his portrayals of the characters who made up his family and acquaintances, describing them through the eyes of one who has yet to venture into the world. These portrayals, while not always flattering, are nonetheless sincere and honest.Much has been said about Wolfe's style, his tendency for verbosity. Many feel that his writing might have benefitted from more careful editing. But to limit Wolfe's prose is to limit the man, to cut him off at the knees. As Wolfe was acutely sensitive to every sensation that he encountered, so did his style reflect his unique experience of the world. His writing overflows with imagery, and he gives the reader the gift of experiencing life as he felt it.This novel lacks the fine-tuning and subtlety of his later work. The words rush recklessly, in a torrent of images and experiences, much like adolescence itself. In his story one can find, or recapture, what it means to be young and idealistic. Most of all, Thomas Wolfe left us a masterpiece that shows what it is like to be young and to feel as if the entire universe was created for each of us, alone."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"While I am thoroughly enjoying the book, this particular edition is awful!!! I don't know who if anyone edited this, but the rules of word division are totally ignored. Words just go to the end of the page and continue on the next line. As for paragraphs, they, too, follow no known rules. All of this, makes this edition very difficult and frustrating to read. I highly recommend buying the more expensive edition."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I was turned onto this book by Hunter S. Thompson, who in one of his books said it was the finest chronicle of \\"buried life\\" he ever read and he highly recommended it. I heartily agree. What's \\"buried life?\\" You'll know for certain once you read this novel: People buried by a dead-end life. It's the story of the Gant family living in Altamont (actually Asheville), North Carolina. Published in 1929 and considered semi-autobiographical, the bulk of the story takes place from 1900 to the mid 1920s. The focus is on Eugene Gant (Gant and Wolfe have the same birth date), his boozing father, his real estate obsessed mother, and assorted brothers and sisters. The style is spellbinding. What Wolfe can say in six words, he chooses to use 60. Where one modifying phrase will do, he tacks on seven more. A sentence can be an entire paragraph long. The book is filled with rants, which makes sense if Thompson recommended it. It's a long book, 662 pages, and it's not a fast read, but definitely a page-turner. It kept me up late for several nights. Bottom line, this is now one of my five most favorite books. Look Homeward Angel may not be your cup of tea, but I believe it's worth a shot.."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. Sometimes I re-read sections just for an inspiration. Detailed and loaded, yes, but worth the effort to read. An underrated American classic of the highest order!"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"When Thomas Wolfe is at his best, his writing is inspired, lyrical and athletic. Clearly, the work may be considered by some to be self-indulgent as the story line stays pretty close to home. Home is located in the hills of western North Carolina at his mother's boarding house, Dixieland. When a writer is fixed on his or her autobiography, and in Wolfe's case this involves his childhood, early youth and college education, the writing seems more non-fiction than fiction. This story is essentially Wolfe's autobiography like a novel from Proust. I wished that his jazz riffs from his personal experience were somewhat more improvizational and that he had ventured a bit further in his storyline as often this is a sign of immature talent in a novelist. But Wolfe's theme is home, after all, and if you enjoy coming-of-age stories, then you can savor this one. Wolfe does prove his real talent when he gets caught up in the mysticism of the moment and to his credit when he does so, his prose launches into a higher angelic ionosphere. His vocabulary is impressive and the writing, in many places, is so good that I found myself slowing down simply to savor the beauty of his use of language. Wolfe was relatively young when he wrote this novel and it brims with idealism and vitality and energy. This novel is an American classic of the South and well worth the reading for Wolfe's pure lyricism alone."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"The descriptive language and the use of metaphor were wonderful.The characters were actual residents of Asheville, N.C. who recognized themselves and made Tom Wolfe a pariah for many years. He is now remembered by the statue of an angel in a cemetary in Hendersonville, N.C. I enjoyed it a lot!"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"A novel about growing up living and dying. A life filled with anguish,angst,loneliness and quiet beauty. The characters are so vivid you can see the buttons on their coats. Wolfe loves his life but he also knows that it will soon be over, so he captures the essence here. This novel is sometimes so beautiful it will fill your heart to the brim, making you stop reading ,put the book down and hold the ache until it passes. A must must read. Wolfe's &quot;Of Time and the River&quot;, is also brilliant, as is his short stories."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"... to a book of one's youth. I first read Look Homeward, Angel some 40 years ago, and like a few other reviewers, decided it merited a re-read. In the intervening years I carried the memory of a wonderful book that dazzled in its descriptive passages. In particular, I always remembered that he was one of the very few writers to have written at length on smells, as he did on page 69. I've always considered Wolfe on a par with other great southern writers like Faulkner, McCullers, Welty, and Baldwin. The re-read was from the same book that I had purchased those 40 some years ago, a Scribner Library edition, for $1.95, with the marks outlining the passages I considered relevant then, and still seem relevant today. After the re-read, I found myself agreeing with those who say that he has not stood the test of time, for others, as well as myself.The book is largely autobiographical, with Eugene, the last child in the Gant family the protagonist. It is his \\"coming of age\\" story; the background is America's own coming of age, the beginning of the 20th century. Most of the book is set in Altamont, a thinly disguised Ashville, North Carolina, with some sections in \\"Pulpit Hill\\" for his university studies - you guessed it - Chapel Hill. Like so many of us, his family is \\"unhappy in its own way,\\" but by in large, \\"gets by,\\" with an alcoholic father and an acquisitive, possessive mother. The siblings run the gauntlet from a vagabond bum, the \\"dutiful daughter\\" caring for the father, a sailor, one who dies far too early, et al. Each is supportive at times, and at others, disparaging.There are numerous insightful, well-described passages covering the coming of age period, such as: the time of first love, high on a hill, overlooking Altamont which eventually morphs into shades of Maugham's \\"Of Human Bondage\\"; the agony and awkwardness of that freshman year in college; the first job, delivering newspapers in the early morning hours; the heartbreaking death of two siblings to naturally causes; the underlying theme of the severance of ties from one's family and community. These, as well as others, would most likely find resonance with all readers. Wolfe becomes positively Joycian in lengthy chapter 24, capturing a slice of daily life in Altamont, with even a cameo role for William Jennings Bryan. The book, written in 1929, is also a valuable historical record of the outlook of Americans in the first two decades of the last century. The memories of the Civil War fade as America strolls onto the world stage, first via the Spanish-American war, later \\"The Great War.\\" The wars are welcomed with enthusiasm by the population. War profiteering was in full bloom in the section on Newport News, Va. Cars replace horses; electricity becomes widely available. Diseases routinely take lives far short of the allocated three score and ten. University education is reserved for a small minority. Medical care is rudimentary, often something reserved for \\"quacks.\\" And there was a distinctive hierarchical structure to small town life.There are some passages of philosophical insight, such as a precursor to the \\"butterfly theory\\" (i.e., distant events like a butterfly wing flapping in China effecting local events (p.160); is hell oneself, as Wolfe suggests or other people, as Sartre claimed?; and the marvels of war propaganda, when he read the headlines he thought the Germans were pushed all the way back to Cologne, and was surprised to find them just outside Paris.Was Wolfe racist, as some reviewers charged? He did describe African-Americans and Jews with the terms widely used at the time, in their roles in American society then. Overall though, he did not seem to do so in a derogatory way; more so it was as he might describe the natural surroundings. And who knows, in 100 years, perhaps the term \\"African-American\\" will be viewed as an epithet.But from the perspective of 40 years, and after having read Joyce, Nabokov, Proust, and others, I do believe that Wolfe falls far short, as a writer. He does hit on all cylinders in some sections, but there is a numbing repetitive use of some adjectives like \\"gaunt,\\" (probably 10 times in the first 15 pages), \\"pearly\\" for the sky, \\"petulant\\" (sometimes twice on the same page), and of course, the theme, the melodramatic \\"O Lost\\" grates like the proverbial chalk screeching across the black board by the end of the book. On at least three separate occasions he uses \\"stranger in a strange land.\\" On the first reading I was impressed with his dazzling erudition as displayed on page 29, the events and people who preceded the turn of the 20th century; now it seems like a mere listing of deliberately obscure events and people. Some of the dialogue is overblown, and pointless. And I do think his editor, Maxwell Perkins, who did delete some of the original manuscript, could have chopped another hundred pages off the bookI also found myself agreeing with other reviewers who derided his egotistic self-absorption which lacked useful insight. What, for example, do we learn of his first trysts with black prostitutes, or being seduced by a \\"cougar,\\" a woman almost twice his age? There is nothing. What of his sense of responsibility to the family he leaves behind? What of the returning veterans of the \\"Great War,\\" and there disillusionment. Again, nothing. Overall, there seems to be far too much wallowing in the \\"O Lost\\" theme, without the hardship to justify it.So, at least with books it is possible to go home again, and reflect on where you have been in the meantime. Despite the 3-stars, it is a recommended read for being a classic book of its period."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"If you're looking for light reading, this is not for you!Thomas Wolfe's writing is akin to old Victorian furniture...ornate,heavy, and cumbersome,but with its own particular beauty.Wolfe is in love with the language, almost to a fault.I found his descriptive style tedious at times, piled high with far too many adjectives.This coming-of-age story is sweet within itself.And Wolfe gives us an interesting and detailed historical description of the area around Altamount, North Carolina,and the city of Boston, and Harvard University. The thoughts and feelings of a bright and talented young man trying to find his way in the world, weave their way throughout the fabric of the story.If you are willing to forge your way through all the heavy prose, this would be worth your while. But this tome is NOT for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I could not read the book. The product was defective and it could not be read, it would not line up on the page correctly. When speaking with someone at Kindle they told me they were not able to fix the problem and would have to send it back to the book company. I was sorry because I really wanted to read Look Homeward Angel."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Thomas Wolfe reminds me of the eager kid who was smarter than the rest, surging ahead for pure love of learning and life itself. This transcendental outlook pervades this meandering story which in lesser hands would become saccharine, but veers away from that precipice with carefully constructed characters who are not cut-outs used in the puppet show of stories with a \\"moral,\\" but these vivid, living, breathing pieces of life that resemble others we have all known.While the subject matter is romantic to its core in that it combines a knowledge of mortality with a sweet delight in life, between the lines there is a fine-tuned observation of America as a culture of personalities. Wolfe understands the struggles of people both average and exceptional and winds these together to show the common path they are threading as they attempt to understand themselves, so they can appreciate life.Thomas Wolfe described himself as a \\"putter-inner\\" and in this book that might be initially viewed as a problem, since it spills from its pages even after extensive editing with gloriously rich language and a wealth of detail. After the first 100 pages however I stopped caring about this attribute, because my bias against it came from lesser authors who blurt out everything but the kitchen sink in an attempt to appear smarter than they are. Wolfe just delights in the details of life and the subplots that associate a character's journey through it.I recommend this book most heartily for parents of confused teens. It does not fail to show the shortcomings of our world, our species, and our nation, but it awakens our inner emotional strength that forms the want to overcome those. It does not preach morality, but it shows us the value of our time and from that a moral outlook, since when we care about our time we become more discerning. It took my breath away in its audacity to do the unthinkable, and sing a song of life the imperfect beautiful, and never to back down from that vision of poignant, transient glory."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Coming upon some of the reviews written herein, one is startled to hear repeated cliches in lieu of actual opinions. The most refreshing review; that is to say, the least sycophantic; is unfortunately the one furnished by a member of a women's book club whose latterday &quot;sewing circle&quot; found the novel tedious. (And so it should seem to proper citizens, one might hazard to comment. Poetry always has seemed foreign to good, clean simple folk. (&quot;Stick to Oprah's book club, ladies. You cannot fail to be out of your depth in picking up the work of an artist like Thomas Wolfe!&quot;)) Forgive the brazen honesty, but it's true: the writing of this profoundly gifted man, like all great art, is not for everybody. It's for the discerning few. Its appeal is not that of McDonald's or MTV. That is, it does not pretend to a mass market. It is, rather, personal--deeply, touchingly . . . hauntingly. &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot; is a novel for poets and dreamers; a book for lovers of beauty and worshipers of the creative image; a manifesto of the morally subversive and socially irresponsible. Alas, it is Art."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"The work that established Wolfe's reputation as a modern master.

I realize that by abandoning this project once again I am missing out on some brilliant writing, stunning imagery, amd memorable metaphors. Oh Lost!A note about the racism: Apparently I am supposed to tolerate the stereotypical descriptions of African-Americans because, after all, Wolfe was a product of the South and we can't expect him to have known any better. I'm not buying it. Wolfe was a highly educated world traveler who read hundreds of books before writing this novel. Yet he can't use the word &#34;Negro&#34; without prefacing it with &#34;sleepy.&#34; Wolfe has great insight into the tragic condition of humanity, but that humanity is apparently white only.

Hardbound and you simply can't beat the writings Thomas Wolfe provides. Planning to make this a very special Christmas gift."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Thomas Wolfe's first novel, the autobiographical Look Homeward, Angel, reveals Wolfe as a writer with unusual gifts. His sensory equipment appears to have been marvelously sensitive, and he can recount convincingly the things that he touched and saw and smelled as a small boy. He is attuned to the seasons, and much else at the same time:\\"Yes, and in that month when Prosperpine comes back, and Ceres' dead heart rekindles, when all the woods are a tender smoky blur, and birds no bigger than a budding leaf dart through the singing trees, and when odorous tar comes spongy in the streets, and boys roll balls of it upon their tongues, and they are lumpy with tops and agated marbles; and there is blasting thunder in the night, and the soaking millionfooted rain, and one looks out at morning on a stormy sky, a broken wrack of cloud; and when the mountain boy brings water to his kinsmen laying fence, and as the wind snakes through the grasses hears far in the valley below the long wail of the whistle, and the faint clangor of a bell; and the blue great cup of the hills seems closer, nearer, for he had heard an inarticulate promise: he has been pierced by Spring, that sharp knife.\\"That's just one example. Seemingly few seasons pass without comment during the years spanned by this novel.Wolfe is also attuned to character, and he writes at length about the members of his family and many of the people he knew during his boyhood in Asheville, North Carolina. The father of Eugene Gant, the Wolfe character in the novel, is lionized as a \\"great man\\" with larger-than-life passions and appetites, including a lifelong thirst for alcohol. His mother, a real estate speculator and boarding house operator, is described in rather unflattering terms, and a high school teacher eventually becomes Eugene's spiritual mother. Wolfe gives carefully drawn accounts of his siblings as well, including Grover, \\"a gentle peering face, a soft caressing voice, unlike any of the others in kind and quality,\\" who dies of typhoid when Eugene is a toddler. His sister Mabel (Helen in the novel), with a great maternal nature, often cares for their father or for Eugene in the novel. But it is his brother Ben, a kind man with a diamond-hard exterior, who has the closest bond with Eugene.The plot takes us through the familiar events of a boy's life. Many of these events are related with great wit; they are all written, in Wolfe's words \\"in innocence and nakedness of spirit.\\" Anyone who has had a paper route will respond to Wolfe's accounts of prowling about the town in all seasons, on the job, before the rest of the world awakens. From the other paper boys, he learns to smoke:\\". . . in the sweet blue air of Spring, as he sloped down to his route, he came to know the beauty of Lady Nicotine, the delectable wraith who coiled into his brain, left her poignant breath in his young nostrils, her sharp kiss upon his mouth.\\"At a tender age, Eugene goes off to college; he comes to know corruption and grief; he finds his way in the world. In a climactic scene with his brother Ben, Eugene understands the meaning of his journey so far, but there is no resolution or end in sight. The book leaves Eugene when he is 18, still an unformed man."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Calling Thomas Wolfe a literary genius is like calling your wife a dynamite telephone caller; it may be true, but it doesn't tell you much.After all, when we think of literary genius, we tend to think of a gift of words exercised in the service of something big, like truth or beauty or human potential, don't we? We may disagree about whether some genius accomplished great work, but it seems as though geniuses at least try to tackle something larger than themselves.Well, if Thomas Wolfe was a genius (and I'm not _entirely_ convinced), he seems to have used his abilities mostly to let everyone know just what a special, unique, amazing, unappreciated and put-upon soul Thomas Wolfe was. Some may call that an accomplishment; I call it whining.Mind you, \\"Look Homeward, Angel\\" is a very accomplished whine. In all honesty, too, that's not all it is. This book was one of the earliest examples of American realism as it came to prominence between the World Wars, a movement that included Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and all those other guys trying to shake loose from the Victorian romantic tradition. This means that Wolfe devoted considerable effort to descriptions of Southern small-town life around the turn of the century in all its details, including the ones that respectable people preferred not to think about. As such, it's a convincing job.Structurally, this is pretty straight narrative, which means that whatever was innovative about it had to come through Wolfe's writing style. \\"Look Homeward, Angel\\" concerns the history of Eugene Gant, Wolfe's alter ego, from a few years before his birth in North Carolina to his departure for graduate school at Harvard University.He grows, learns to deal with an alcoholic force of nature for a father, a semi-delusional miser for a mother, and a bunch of half-crazed older siblings. He explores the town from its wealthiest mansions to it most degraded poverty and racism. He goes to school and shows early promise, reads incessantly and fancies himself the hero of the grand drama that is his life. He falls in love two or three times, sometimes platonically and sometimes not. He attends college, finding it difficult at first, but soon makes a place of prominence for himself there. Finally, upon coming home, losing a favorite brother to tuberculosis and discovering the joys of alcohol, he confronts his family's collective sickness and littleness of mind, and heads north.None of this is terribly unusual. Indeed, any young person with any soul at all has probably gone through similar phases and stages, including the conviction that no one has ever gone through anything remotely like this before (ah, I remember the attitude well). That's what makes \\"Look Homeward, Angel\\" such an unbelievable pain in the rear; Wolfe apparently never grew up enough to realize that his experiences are universal, and so throughout his book he insisted on couching Eugene's (or his own) smallest experiences in the imagery of glorious Homeric adventure, with language to match.Sometimes this actually works. When, for instance, Wolfe describes the opening of a day in the Gant household with its boisterous flow of energy and alarming quantities of breakfast, the inflated language sucks you right in, makes you want to grab a plum from the Gants' table and chow down. The town, the people and the life are so vivid that it's no wonder people believed in them. Some found the sensuality so overwhelming they seemed to regard Wolfe as a threat to public morals.Elsewhere, though, particularly when showing us Eugene's inner life, the whole edifice falls apart like used Kleenex. Which may be appropriate considering the tears Wolfe obviously expects us to shed for Eugene, but it's hardly pleasant or inspiring. Surely it was possible, for instance, to give us Eugene's melodramatic love for a boarder in his mother's hotel without making him seem quite so pathetic? This is a boy and a slightly older girl in a run-down boardinghouse in North Carolina, after all, not Lancelot and Guinevere in noble but doomed love at Camelot, but you'd never know that from the language Wolfe uses.There was something I found disrespectful in Wolfe's utter inability to judge what tone to take with regular people and their lives. Such things are without question worthy of attention and respect; that's the whole idea of America. Wolfe's writing at these moments made me wonder if he was really attending to his characters and their experiences, or whether he was just using the whole thing to show off how fancy his writing could be. Made me want to reach into the book and slap him. Twice.So why the four stars? Well, because the man could actually write, dammit. He could write so well that even his purplest passages fascinated me. And at the end, as callow as Eugene Gant remains and as unaware of how ridiculous his moans of ecstasy and woe can be, I couldn't help liking the jerk. If I came across someone like him in real life, I'd think he was going to be a very worthwhile man one day, after a good kick in the pants or two.Thomas Wolfe didn't live long enough to benefit from such a kick in the pants, but his books show what he might have made of himself, so the air of melancholy about his prose feels earned somehow. And he certainly helped deliver a very useful kick to American literature, booting it right out of its leftover 19th-century politeness. For that alone, \\"Look Homeward, Angel\\" deserves our gratitude.Benshlomo says, God save me from a genius who knows he's a genius."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Few writers can coin a phrase or capture a mood or feeling like Thomas Wolfe could. This is never more evident than in \\"Look Homeward, Angel.\\" After all these years, still a classic, well worth reading for the first time or for another time. His ability to capture mood, colors, feelings and emotions in the depths of the human heart and soul, in and out of family relationships, is remarkable, as is the agelessness of the story. A timeless story of personal growth, coming of age and family dynamics. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Wolfe is known for his wordiness. So, 500 plus pages of oblique, almost pretentious prose could be too much for the average reader. The book is rarely boring, though. Actually, the more time you spend with this one, the more you will absorb, the more you will enjoy. Wolfe's descriptions of the characters and emotional climate of Eugene Gant and the townspeople of Altamont are stunning. University of North Carolina alumni, prick your ears: Chapel Hill, redubbed Pulpit Hill, was here put on the map more than half a century before Superchunk did the same thing with a different medium. The book never drags, and becomes pompous and a bit annoying only when the words \\"Oh, Lost!\\" crop up three or four times in a single paragraph.A side note: Wolfe was, of course, a well read man. Something that dawned on me a while ago: There is an homage to the great poet William Blake here. Blake, after the death of his brother Robert, whom William was training as an engraver, claimed to see visions of his brother, instructing him on how to format Blake's Songs of Innocence and Experience. Towards the end of the novel, Eugene Gant, grief stricken at the death of his brother Ben, weathered and aged though still in college, sees visions of his dead brothers Grover and Ben, swirling around him in a benign cloud of otherworldly wisdom and commiseration. Clever, Tommy.A great book all round."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"the most human characters i've ever known an author to create. every last detail is here, and it's painful and slow and heavy. by the end even the most heavy handed and abusive characters are somehow endearing and beautiful--like the family members you have to love, they are your blood. it is tragic and long winded and eruditic-- and simply the best book i've read."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"After a recent visit to Thomas Wolfe's home in Asheville, I felt like I had to read this book. I was particularly curious as to why everyone in his hometown was in such an uproar upon its publication in 1929. Now I understand.I checked this book out from the library, but now I simply must own it to add to my shelf of absolute favorites. It's a long book, so I spent a LONG time getting to know Eugene Gant/Thomas Wolfe, and I love the author all the more for letting me in on his autobiography in such a beautiful, poetic way.Wolfe came from a difficult family situation, with an alcoholic father and a poor mother who worked herself to the bone trying to run her boarding house, known as Dixieland in the novel. You can tour this home in Asheville; the house is actually called the Old Kentucky Home. Throughout the novel, he's searching, trying to find meaning to his many losses: his brothers who died, a lost love, his innocence, his childhood.In the end, Eugene Gant/Tom Wolfe finally feels free to leave his home forever. He'll be leaving North Carolina for Harvard, and now we all know that he left his life as a small-town boy with big dreams to become one of the most beloved authors of all time. I can't wait to read the sequel, Of Time and the River. I highly recommend Look Homeward, Angel to anyone who is a student of great American literature, and especially to writers of autobiographical fiction.Good companions to this book are Thomas Wolfe's The Story of a Novel and John Chandler Griffin's Memories of Thomas Wolfe: A Pictorial Companion to Look Homeward, Angel. If you're reading Look Homeward, Angel for the first time, Griffin's volume is a must. You'll be able to see Wolfe's actual family photo album, from which he drew his characters. After staring into the real Ben Wolfe's eyes, it took me several days to fully grasp the haunting story of what happened to him (I won't spoil it for you.) I have definitely become a Thomas Wolfe fan and only wish he hadn't died so young so that we'd have more of his genius works to ponder and enjoy."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Thomas Wolfe's Look Homeward, Angel is many things, all of them great; profoundly emotional yet deeply philosophical, it is one of the all-time best bildungsromans, an unforgettable evocation of the mountain American South in the late nineteenth/early twentieth centuries, and a masterpiece of poetic prose. It is an immortal American classic absolutely essential for anyone even remotely interested in American literature.The first thing we notice is the sparkling prose, which is some of the most poetic ever. Wolfe's writing is not simply beautiful but truly sublime; his sentences are lovely, his descriptions lush, and his tropes stunningly memorable. After two major successes, he fell out of favor in an era that valued concision and ambiguity, and time has only made him less conventionally palatable. The book is over five hundred pages, its sentences long, and its vocabulary dense; few readers would now not be scared by such a work. However, Wolfe shines at least as brightly as ever for those truly alive to language's beauty; his prose is near-unparalleled for inventiveness and sheer exquisiteness, making him one of America's great stylists.More fundamentally, the main thing making Look still so undeniably great is its masterful bildungsroman aspect. The novel is above all Eugene Gant's coming-of-age story. There are of course many such stories, but this is one of the very best. We follow Eugene literally from birth until he truly comes into his own in young adulthood and are deeply interested in his journey. The story is firmly rooted in Wolfe's life and thus has many particular trappings, but youth's essential experiences are universal, letting the book speak powerfully to many. We truly feel with and for Eugene because we see ourselves in him; he reminds us of our own youth - what could have been as much as what was. Wolfe tells his story with truly engaging emotion, quickly drawing us in and never letting go; we feel Eugene's ups and downs almost as if they are ours - which of course they are to a large degree. Though admirable in many ways, Eugene has clear faults that only make him seem more human and thus easily identifiable. Few bildungsromans are so transcendentally relatable or thoroughly stirring.However, calling Look a bildungsroman sells it rather short; it is a grand, sweeping epic of many facets. There are numerous other characters, a variety of situations, and several settings. The book is in a larger sense a story of the Gant family, following all members at various times and to various degrees. They are their own family, and we can admire or criticize as we please, but they are also in the truest sense archetypal. The interactions - strife at least as much as joy - that they represent are familiar to nearly everyone. We become as intrigued in their story as in Eugene's, feeling and growing along with them.Characterization is another Wolfe strength. All the Gants have strong individuality and are drawn strongly and evocatively, as are other characters. Wolfe interestingly combines Dickensian eccentricities with American realism's best aspects, creating a genuinely engaging and unforgettable cast.Look is also notable for bringing the Mountain South alive. Local color writing has a long and grand American tradition, and this is one of the best entries. Its Altamont is closely based on Wolfe's Asheville, North Carolina hometown, and he describes with the precision and subtlety only experience can give. Few writers have a greater sense of place. He makes us see landscapes nearly as if we are there and understand what it was like to live in such a place in regard to everything from speech to economics. On top of everything else, Look is thus of substantial historical value to anyone wondering how such people lived in such places in this era.The great William Faulkner called Wolfe the best writer of their time, and it is easy to see why. His writing is universal in the best sense, but he mastered the truly American grain that began with Twain and ran through the likes of Faulkner and Steinbeck. Dialect and place are of course a big part, and Wolfe has them down brilliantly, but it also runs deeper. Faulkner said art is worth nothing unless shot through with eternal feelings and thoughts, and Wolfe handles them with unusual deftness. He makes us feel as few writers can but also makes us think. Look is a deeply philosophical work focusing on themes like life's meaning, individuality vs. wider responsibility, the loss of youth's illusions, aestheticism vs. practicality, etc. It also touches on issues like class and race that are integral to American art and culture - and indeed to the world's. Novels encompassing all these threads are very rare, and only a few dozen have tied them together so well, much less so movingly.One problem with reading Look today is its unflinching racism depiction. Blacks are consistently treated poorly in it, the victims of prejudice and innumerable slurs from all white characters. More disturbingly, the narrative portrayal itself is grossly unflattering and lacks nuance, being also full of racial epithets and other highly derogatory comments. Jews are also shown unflatteringly but far more subtly. This is particularly worrisome in that Look is known to be highly autobiographical and that - unlike with, say, Twain - it is not satirical. It is impossible to deny that Wolfe grew up with many racial prejudices, at least some of which seem to have lingered when writing Look. His views later liberalized, as reflected in subsequent works, but Look remains clouded. Some will not be able to get past this, which is understandable. However, it is important to keep in mind that his prime purpose was realism; characters talk as people of the era really did, and the narrator writes as someone from Wolfe's background portraying such events almost inevitably would. The real problem is not Wolfe or the book but the era; he presents things as they were, for better or worse. This also adds to the historical value, though that of course does not atone. In fairness, we must remember that, however autobiographical, this is a novel and should not be used to determine personal views. I believe this should be a foundational critical principle, and it applies here as well as elsewhere. As for Look, all must judge by their own hearts and consciences. It is certainly a product of its time, which is no excuse but does explain the prevalence of views now rightly considered unacceptable.Excepting this admittedly large caveat, Look is superb in all respects, an American literary monument that will not be soon forgotten."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I recommend Look Homeward, Angel to anyone searching for his or her identity. Therefore, I recommend it to everyone since we should all search for understanding ourselves forever and ever. We can all appreciate parts of this book. High school-aged students might be able to handle it if they are pensive readers...If you grow weary from heavily worded literature, this book may not keep your interest all the time. At times, I felt like I was forcing myself to tolerate the repetition of Wolfe's seemingly favorite word choices-\`loamy,' \`spermy,' \`inchoate,' to name a few. Also, the tone of the book is a bit overly dramatic and heavy, like an unnecessarily emotional woman; you may feel like plugging your ears. Otherwise, this book invokes the remarkable and unsettling sensation of never quite understanding one's place in this world-feeling restless and apart from it all. Without a doubt, I know that not everything in this book reached me-but I know it's there, and that's why I will read it again and hopefully appreciate it more someday. \`O lost!' for now, perhaps."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"In this American classic, Thomas Wolfe presents the Gant family, a spirited, feisty, multigenerational family living restless lives but unable to resist the magnetic pull of family and the small town in which they live. The centerpiece of the novel is Eugene Gant, the youngest, most intelligent, and possibly weirdest of the clan. From the time of his first thoughts, Eugene has the urge to flee, escaping the confines of the situation he was borne into in order to find a richer existence; no matter what he does, however, he finds himself back at home, among the people from whom he desperately wants to escape.Such is the story of every Gant member so brilliantly depicted in the novel. The oldest son fails to live up to any expectations and moves away in shame, only to return at the prospect of an inheritance. The daughters marry and try to create families of their own, only to return to help nurse the sick or with heads bowed down unable to conceive. The brothers strike out into the world in a variety of ways- as businessmen, soldiers, wanderers looking for a good time- only to find themselves back in the arms of their not too welcoming family. Each is a manifestation of their vibrant and restless parents, a drunk father who fights off an illness that has claimed many, and a money hungry mother who puts finances above family, all for the sake of the family.The characters are unforgettable, and Wolfe's depiction of small town life captures a time in this nation that has long been abandoned. The writing is beautiful, sarcastic, insightful, whimsical, lyrical, and when it comes to capturing the emotions of life- first loves, first heartbreaks, death- powerful.A must read."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Look Homeword, Angel is the most well-written piece of prose I have ever read. Wolfe is a genius, and I do not understand how society seems to have forgotten him when it lists great writers. This book is a work of art. While most books entertain, this one enlightens. In this book, Thomas Wolfe creates some of the finest characters in literature. I feel sorry for anyone who cannot relate with the protaganist, Eugene Gant. This is the story of one man struggling to learn his identity and find himself amongst a world of strong personalities. If I were an English teacher, I would make this book required reading. For beautiful language, intriguing characters, and wonderful imagery, I do not think a better story exists"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I wanted an older copy of this book, as the author is my distant cousin.

There is no way around it- Wolfe uses more words than most people are interested to read. I myself at times got tired of crawling at a snales pace, and I skipped or skimmed parts of the book. But the book does get progressively better. If you can't read the whole thing, read the last two hundred pages, and you'll have a pretty good idea of the story. If you want a book to challegnge you,(and try your patience at times) this one should. If you are interested in quick and exciting reading, this isn't the book for you. The ending will make you think about life in general- a good accomplishment for any book in any genre."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"The first novel of arguably the greatest literary genius produced by America.

They start when the city is just a small village and they grow - over two generations - along with the city, Altamont. The book gives us a very good vision of social hierarchization, a caste system, with seven castes. First the Episcolians who have the highest social eminence. Then the Presbyterians who are less fashionable but solidly decent. Third the Methodists who are the middle group between vulgarity and decorum. Fourth the Baptists who are the most populous and common. Then we have three castes of outcast people. The negroes or Blacks who are nothing but dogs walking on two legs . Then the Jews who are a perpetually chased and hunted group. Finally the Pigtail Alley white-headed, white-haired and white-faced people. Those seem to be rejected even more than the previous two groups. This caste system is based on two scales of values . First religious affiliation among white Americans. Then a racial rejection based on the color of the skin (blacks), the non-christian religion (jews), the color of the hair and skin (white, in fact what could be poor whites who are not even decent enough to live up to their race). The members of the second generation are followed very carefully. And that is where the book has a real problem. We constantly jump from a descriptive vignette to a psychological portrait, always at a determined moment, so that we cannot in any way have a fair idea of the plot, the events, the way they are stringed together, nor of the real psychology of any character, because, along the pages, we have quite many psychological vignettes of one character, and not two of these vignettes are comparable or equivalent. The writing is perfectly impressionistic and we get lost in its meandering among successive touches. This is a shortcoming because we do not really enter a novel , but rather a slide-show where each slide would be a vignette, but with no unifying commentary. The end is pathetic because it shows how the children are fighting to put their hands on their shares of the father who is going to die's estate. Eugene, the last born, stands over the m&eacute;l&eacute;e because he is going away and does not want to come back. He is going to Harvard to finish his university studies. And there appears the long-dead Ben, his brother, who makes him realize that anyone has to sever the chain to the family in order to be, to be oneself, to be free and oneself in one's own world and on one's own feet.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Thomas Wolfe (1900-1938) was greatly admired during his lifetime; no less than William Faulkner declared him the single greatest American writer bar none. Even so, many critics pointed out that although Wolfe had great strengths he also had great weaknesses, and those weaknesses have become increasingly apparent with the passage of time. His reputation has not survived, he is seldom taught in standard literary classes, and even less often casually selected by the reading public.LOOK HOMEWARD, ANGEL, published in 1929, was Wolfe's first novel, and like every Wolfe novel it is both fascinating and frustrating. The great fascination is Wolfe's sense of poetic narrative; he skillfully layers phrase upon phrase, creating images that sparkle in the mind's eye. His failure, however, is multiple, and not the least that too often Wolfe so heavily layers these images that it becomes very hard to see the foundation upon which they rest--it becomes difficult to see the gemstone because the setting is so lavishly ornate.Re ANGEL, Wolfe worked with editor Maxwell Perkins, who strove to curb Wolfe's excesses, and the result is considerably more readable than later Wolfe novels. ANGEL tells the story of the Gant family. Father W.O. has a broad world view--but drifts first into marriage with the unimaginative and utterly pragmatic Eliza and then into a roaring alcoholism. Their children emerge from this battleground as highly neurotic individuals--including their youngest child Eugene. Although the family regards him as they do any other member, Wolfe makes it quite clear that Eugene is a genius, and the novel follows him from cradle to young adult as he deals with his dysfunctional family.Virtually every novelist is autobiographical to some degree, but Wolfe is infamous for being exactingly so, and ANGEL is nothing more nor less than the story his family and his life. It is largely because of this that the novel, for all of Wolfe's talent for poetic narrative, is such a spectacular failure: he includes everything, from a carriage accident when a toddler to a case of crabs as a teenager, and he gives gives it all equal emphasis, treating such incidents with the same gravity with which he describes deaths, failed love affairs, and the like. Perhaps even more frustratingly, these events are often random and have no real position within the narrative thread; since it so meticulously rendered, you expect the carriage accident, for instance, to be a factor in the later portions of the work--but it isn't.What does gradually emerge is Wolfe's sense of social caste: Eugene is forever aspiring to higher social status and forever being knocked back by his father's alcoholism, his mother's lack of social propriety, and his own physical awkwardness. In tandem with this we also gradually come to realize that ANGEL is essentially Wolfe's self-justification of his feelings about his family and, more specifically, a love-letter to what he presumes is his own genius. The novel is seriously tainted by the author's own egotism.Add to this the fact that Wolfe is extremely self-contradictory in his writings and you have a significantly up-hill read that has less to do with a novel per se than it does with the writer's certainty that he is indeed a genius and that every moment in his life is worthy of prolonged examination. It is an issue that would plague virtually every word Wolfe wrote over the course of his lifetime: he is utterly and completely self-absorbed, and no world exists beyond himself.Although the comparison may at first seem unlikely, Wolfe is very much like Ayn Rand: a supreme egotist who writes in an incredibly wordy style and whose works are essentially created to display a presumed superiority over the rest of us. He is also like Rand in the sense that Wolfe is one of those writers that appeals to the young--especially those who are not well-read and who therefore aren't really prepared to spot the glaring flaws in his work. From my own point of view, Wolfe is memorable for his skill at turning a phrase, that famous gift of narrative poetry, but this aside the bulk of LOOK HOMEWARD, ANGEL is ponderous trash. It is a novel best left to advanced literature students who have no choice in the matter.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Sadly, I don't get what the big deal is about this novel. It is boring and plodding and pointless. It just goes on and on and on, and I kept asking myself, \`What's the point?' I kept waiting to be wowed, and instead I found myself wishing I'd never begun reading it.Quite honestly, I think Wolfe is overrated. He's nowhere close to being a Hemingway or a Faulkner. The entire novel is just a bunch of nothing, really. There's no substance to the \\"story\\" at all. In a way, he reminds me of Stephenie Meyer. She can't write either, and she takes forever to get to the point too.I've finished it and I'm still not sure what the \\"story\\" was about. It just seemed like this rambling mess with no plot. The only thing I know for certain is that the entire Gant family was crazy. That's about the only thing I got out of Look Homeward, Angel."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"It was sometimes difficult to wade through Wolfe's complex and dense style. After reading five pages, I felt like I had read enough for the day. With each page of prose, Wolfe shows that he is a master of the English language. There isn't much dialog or fluff in the book.Wolfe, by his character Eugene, writes about growing up in a mediocre family environment with a mediocre morality based on conventional platitudes that are not necessarily lived out. The funniest example would be Gant's saying that \\"licker\\" is root of all evil, but he could not stay off alcohol once the prohibition that he supported began. The Gants never seem to reach any transcendent enlightenment as they go about their little lives. His parents were often neglectful of their children's needs, but were not terribly abusive. The worst thing that happened to Eugene was that his mother made him wear shoes that did not fit him, which ruined his toes because she did not want good shoes to go to waste. The Gants were more materialistic than spiritual and their worst fault over the years was they forgot to love one another, being wrapped up in their own selfishness that made them a family of strangers. They pursued happiness, but never found a lasting one. \\"O lost!\\" is a phrase frequently used to express the loss of some long forgotten ideal that would have made life complete. So it is in this comical tragedy.Each member of the family plays his own role. Eugene is the scholar, Helen is the nurturer, Luke is the go-getter, Ben is the bitter one, Eliza is the property owner, Steve is the bum, Gant is the colorful character. There is a constant tension among them, with an occasional glimmer of rough affection that they are almost ashamed to show.Eugene's Dad, old man Gant, the master of the irrational rant, was given to drinking and whoring around at times. One example of his rants would be the tax rant. With each increase of property taxes, a new tirade would start about how the democrats would send him to the poor house. Eugene's mother, Eliza, was a pinchpenny who was always concerned about acquiring money to get more property to justify her self-worth. Gant and Eliza are in a mediocre marriage. He wants to roam the earth and she wants to possess it. They eventually separate. She runs a boarding house and he lives in the old family house.Eliza was the type of mother to send her children out to scare up some business for her boarding house, which a lot of characters came through, including clandestine prostitutes. After all, she thought, a person should not be afraid of a little hard work. So she lived the life many choose, concentrating mostly on work and money, and complaining about how much she had to work while accusing others that they were not working hard enough. She was also quite the chiseler at prices during any deal and everything could be bargained for with Eliza. Hard times during her formative years had traumatized her into being very materialistic.Eugene, the protagonist, becomes increasingly bitter about his dysfunctional family. He wants to leave them and enjoy life in peaceful isolation. Yet, he still loves his family and feels conflicting emotions about them. This is a good novel about the complexities of family life from someone who had below-average experience with one.Eugene's brother, Ben, is the bitter cynical child who has worked his life away since childhood and once states, \\"What are we living for?\\" He blames his mother Eliza especially for her niggardliness and her demanding that the children work hard even though the family is a well-off. Ben's death brings the family together for a brief moment of honesty and contriteness, until they go back to the selfish and self-pitying ways of average human beings. Ben's getting his death wish from weak lungs, smoking, and pneumonia is the climax of the book. The novel is a series of vignettes so there is not the usual rise and fall of a typical novel.A reader may note the annoyingly predictable habits of each family member, such as Eliza's frequent pursing of her lips. Knowing beforehand that someone is going to react in the same mechanical manner shows that they are stuck in their rut that they are addicted to.This is another sentimental boyhood tale at times, but Wolfe's superior writing makes it appear more than it is."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I loved this book. And I was rather bothered by 'Lindsay's review (below), calling this work 'self-indulgent, self-pitying, pretentious, and cliched'. Isn't ALL good literature all four of these things? I mean sure it's a good old coming-of-age story, which are pretty common, but Wolfe embues the whole book with such a glorification of the normal plight of Man that one can't help but at least respect the writer, even if one doesn't appreciate the book itself. I don't mean to attack someone personally, it's just that I despise the way some think it is 'intellectual' to diss famous books. Not liking the novel is one thing, but it is utter pretension to assume any book that people dig is garbage just because it didn't fit into a close-minded veiw of what literature should be.Now the book: I thought it was bloody brilliant. As I said before, it's a coming-of-age story. But there is so much innocence and wonder in the book, as well. And the last 10 pages or so make the whole entire book worth it. They (and, in turn, the rest of the book leading up to these last pages) sum up in it's entirety the plight of every young romantic fool on the edge of the soon-to-be-discovered 'real world', looking back over their shoulder at shadows and angels and hoping there is glory to be found somewhere in the world.

If you've ever had the pleasure of visiting Asheville, NC, you will understand how perfectly Wolfe captures the atmosphere, the scent, the light. Nothing can be said about a book this spectacular and real except that it's an under-appreciated gem. I don't mean to compare but it stayed with me more than anything I've ever read from Faulkner or Mellville. It has a humanity neither of those authors tried to capture. It's a different ballpark."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"As an English lit major, I readily recognized the literary genius of Thomas Wolfe.

I recommend it highly -- especially to people that appreciate good literature."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Yes, he did write while standing next to his refrigerator using its top as a writing surface. Writing for Wolfe was so necessary and exciting that it could not be done sitting down. Words would rush from his mind like a river and it was all he could do to keep up. This is the impression that you must get from reading Wolfe. With the flow of word after word after word, in prose described as rich and ornate, Wolfe will be appreciated by anyone who loves language and knows that words are, in essence, vessels of meaning. How appropriate then, that he chose as titles of his books &quot;Of Time and the River&quot; &quot;Look Homeward Angel&quot; and, &quot;You Can Never Go Home Again.&quot; Read Wolfe and you, too, may be carried away, perhaps never to return."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Forget your preconceived notions of Wolfe's legendary verbosity.

From the first few words, you are transported, entranced, rivetted to the pages. Never was a town, a family, a coming-of-age so tenderly and ruthlessly recreated and revealed.

I had read some positive reviews concerning the author's work and picked this one up while on vacation in California. I think I was also influenced by knowing that Wolfe was a major influence on Jack Kerouac, who, while not the best writer I've ever read, certainly is my favorite and the one I've most felt a kinship to. But after 230 pages I realized this morning that I just don't give a damn about the story or anyone in it.Kerouac wrote with a humility that borders on the spiritual. Wolfe by contrast is pompous with everyword. His talents as a wordsmith are undeniable. But, at least in this work, he lacks the introspection necessary to make this sort of autobiographical journey worth taking. What he seems to have not realized is that the story of life has few original happenings. What counts is the perspective each of us bring to those events and how we come to see life as a result. This book fails by that measure. I never learn how these events have molded him nor, after 230 pages, do I get any hint. What I've read is more narcissistic rant than honest self exploration.Other reviewers have said \\"don't waste your time\\". I won't go that far. Wolfe does have a beautiful way with the English language and from that point of view he could be worth the time. And just because I didn't like it doesn't mean you won't. But short of the love of words for their own sake being your motivation, your time may be better invested elsewhere."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"A very well-read, highly educated person, with whom I had a passing acquaintance, mentioned one day that &quot;Of Time and the River,&quot; by Thomas Wolfe, was her all-time favorite book. Very shortly after that, I read somewhere that &quot;Of Time and the River&quot; was the actor Anthony Quinn's favorite book. Okay, now this title, previously unbeknownst to me, was somewhat &quot;following me around,&quot; and my reader's curiosity was piqued, and I went to investigate. I discovered that &quot;Time and River&quot; was a sequel to &quot;Look Homeward, Angel,&quot; which is how I wound up reading this book. Did I feel about this book the way my acquaintance (and Mr. Quinn) felt about its sequel? Not by a long shot, but still this book is a MUST-READ. Why? Even though parts of it are dull, Wolfe has a brilliant capacity for poetically explaining certain types of situations and behaviors that I have oft found incomprehensible. If I'm compelled to underline sentences and paragraphs, as I was with this book, then I'm also compelled to recommend this book and rate it even half a star higher than it deserves. (It doesn't really deserve a full four stars, because it took me FOREVER to finish, which is never a good sign.)Well, now I'm off, to begin the much-anticipated sequel, &quot;Of Time and the River.&quot;"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Look Homeward, Angel is Thomas Wolfe's masterwork, the novel that made his reputation. Born in Asheville, NC, in 1900, he was educated at the University of North Carolina and at Harvard. He spent his time teaching and traveling, building his reputation as one of America's master novelists. Wolfe died in 1938.The novel tells the life of the Gant family in a small mountain town in North Carolina. It is widely acknowledged that the town is Asheville, NC and that the book is a thinly disguised account of Wolfe's own life there.The Gant family was made of Oliver and Eliza Gant and their children, Steve, Luke, the twins Ben and Grover, the girls Daisy and Helen, and the baby, Eugene. Eugene is the individual whose life most closely mimics Wolfe's own. The family is portrayed for the twenty years of Eugene's childhood and early manhood, as he grows up and learns that he must move on to achieve what he wants from life.The daily lives of the Gant family are richly portrayed, each detail building upon the next to demonstrate daily life in the mountain region of North Carolina from 1900 to 1920. Oliver is a stone mason, Eliza becomes the owner of a boardinghouse. They both are so consumed with the thought of money and what it takes to make a living that they neglected the emotional lives of their children. The children are left to provide emotional support for each other, to force their way through life trying, sometimes succeeding and sometimes failing to achieve their goals.Education was a great good, although expensive and those who had the opportunity to get an education were reminded daily of their great fortune. Wolfe details the daily working life of laborers, of those revered in small towns such as lawyers, doctors and politicians. He covers the relationships between men and women, and those between the races. The first Great War and the iinfluenza epidemic are covered. The United States was changing and the Gant family is a representation of how the country changed over this time period.This book is recommended for readers interested in knowing how daily life was in western North Carolina during the early years of the 19th century as the population moved from a rural to a city focus. It is intricately detailed and moves the reader through the daily life of this family and the constant questions of why we are here and what we are to do with our lives."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"As above. Totally random and impossible to read formatting. A scandalous way to treat a wonderful novel. Doesn't Amazon employ someone to check the formatting of their Kindle books?"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"For me, having grown up in a small quasi-southern town, much of the world described in this novel is eerily familiar. But I grew up in the 1950's and 60's, not in the 1900-1920 era that spanned the young years of author Thomas Wolfe. This book chronicles a world that is more akin to that of my grandparents. I recognize much that I remember as typical of small town life. There are the various social castes--with some defined by race. The description of Sunday school lorded over by old women is quite familiar. Much of this novel, however, is alien to the world that I knew growing up. The blatant racism, hard drinking, and constant whoring is shocking! There are even two unmarried sisters who provide their younger brothers with money for monthly trips to the local brothel--because they consider such visits necessary for the boys' health! An older teenage paper boy tells the new boy on the route the houses where payment can be taken \\"in trade\\"--meaning amateur prostitution.I should prepare the reader for the format of this book. Much of the material consists of very long passages and descriptions. There are some incidents that occur sufficiently often to render them close to superfluous--especially the tirades of the drunken father of young protagonist Eugene Gant who stands in for the young Thomas Wolfe.I first learned of this book from a grad school friend who was a North Carolina native. He knew of this book as a roman a clef that focused on the life of the Asheville NC that Thomas Wolfe knew as a young person. According to my friend, North Carolinians in the 1960's were still shocked and insulted by Wolfe's exposing of the vices within that little country town. I should point out that small town people guard their secrets very closely. People once went to great lengths to appear upstanding in order to avoid being subjects of gossip. An acquaintance who moved to my hometown to work for the local newspaper told me that because he had not graduated from a local high school, nobody would dare speak to him regrading the seamier goings-on within our county."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"This was an excellent book. Tom Wolf's ability with words is out of this world. Our book club read the book then visited the Wolf Museum in Asheville. Can't say enough about how good it was. Our discussion was so very interesting."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"The rhetoric is there, the poetry is there and the story of a generation that wasn't &quot;lost&quot; is there. Whitman, Poe, Melville and Fitzgerald all between the boards of one book.For those pilgrims willing, the complete ms. is available as O Lost that gives us the story before Mr. Perkins intervened.All of Wolfe is worth reading for the sheer enjoyment."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"The book is a compelling and powerful study of how the aesthetic sensibilities of a young man ultimatly collide with a world he increasing comes to view as preoccupied with hypocritical pretension and manifest materialism: qualities he believes are also crudely prized by a simple and unquestioning society. This isolated and lonely young man begins to escape into books and fantasy while maintaining a strong admiration for his one strange, brooding brother, who alone seems singularly ambivelent to all this outward hypocracy and hucksterism. The brother he calls 'The Ghost'. Wolfe at times seems to be a bit overconsumed with his own sense of mental superiority, but ultimately by portraying this, he also appears to be allowing for a bit of self-deprecation. One can see how Kerouac was a big fan. Although admittedly wordy with needless overdiscription, the books delivers a certain unique historical texture to life in Asheville and elsewhere in the South in the first decades of the 20th century"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Written in the early 1930's and still as moving and enjoyable today. Yes, he was as he said God's oarsman of words. And what wonderful words. This and all his novels that followed are a treat. I'm a devoted Wolfeman."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Wolfe catches the spirit of the South in this accurate portrayal of a time and place. His descriptions bring the picture vividly to life. You smell the smells, hear the sounds, etc. Unfortunately there are few positive characters, especially women. Young Gant's sexual experiences were particularly devastating and crude. Realistically the young man never finds the answers to his questions, the peace he looks for, the solution to his problems. That was a disappointment. But this book is still a must read for it's snapshot in time and character development!"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Listen. This is the &quot;Great American Novel&quot; that supposedly is waiting to be written. Mr. Wolfe's fantastic articulation will make you feel like you are one of his neighbors in Altamont, very familiar with the town and its inhabitants. No other author has written with such vivid honesty in American Literature. It is NOT a thinly veiled autobiography, but a sincere autobiographical account of his childhood which captures the purity of the moment, without letting his ego command full attention. Perhaps the best novel you shall ever read."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Never have I read a novel which has rewarded the close attention to detail that this novel demands of its readers. Passage after passage is full of a descriptive brilliance which seeks out with intensity the breadth and depth of human experience. Such is Wolfe's brilliance (and I see that other readers agree), the question must be asked why (and this after a search of Amazon) there are not more of his titles in print. Can something not be done about it??"},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"He was born a year after Hemingway, and the comparison diverges from there. His work is brilliantly and excessively poetic and rhapsodic to distraction in places. There's an abundance of nuggets that make it worth the trip for those who appreciate poetry, but you're forced to wade through endless description and overmade points. Hemingway would have told the story with half the words. Some of the characters were well drawn, while others were overdrawn. Still others were barely drawn.Max Perkins cut 60,000 words from the manuscript and still let Wolfe get away with murder. There's gratuitous commentary that took me out of the story again and again. The dialogue was excellent in many places, but missing in others. Perkins did a brilliant job with Hemingway and Fitzgerald. What happened with Wolfe?One of the problems with writing an autobiographic novel is that you're stuck with making a workable story out of what actually happened. Wolfe could have left out a lot of this material and had a better story. There's too much here, and all the extraneous detail gets in the way. The entire final chapter could have been condensed into a few paragraphs.I didn't like the narrator's voice. He seemed arrogant, egotistical, spoiled and entirely full of himself. It's a chore, but still a worthwhile read for the poetry and for the nuggets of brilliance sprinkled throughout."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I feel sorry for anyone who can't find echoes of their own youth in Wolfe's undeniably Romantic writing. You won't find clipped Hemingway-esque sentences, nor the pages-long obscure wanderings of fellow Southerner Faulkner, but Wolfe recreates his world so perfectly that filming it would be redundant. &quot;Self-absorbed&quot;? Yes, how else could anyone produce a literary translation of a life's experience? Cliched? Not when it was written, although as a &quot;coming of age&quot; novel it has many predecessors, none were so ambitious in scope or detail. Achingly, achingly nostalgic, beautifully written, TRUE to itself, sparing nothing of the author or his vision. Pretentious? Hardly, especially when set next to the Oprah-fied books on the best-seller lists today. This and its immediate succesor &quot;Of Time and the River&quot; are, to me, arguably the finest books ever written describing not just life in America but more importantly the sense of loss through time and distance of love, family, and home and the emotional maturation that follows.No, I couldn't recommend this to EVERYbody, but if you haven't become too sophisticated to remember what it was really like to be young, lonely, in love, or homesick, or to see though a child's eyes the wonder in a leaf, a stone, a door; to cry &quot;Oh, lost!&quot; over a memory, you will find much to cherish in this book."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"&quot;Look Homeward Angel&quot; is undeniably a young man's story and as such, I wonder if it appeals to men more than it does to women. It's hard to imagine how the novel's countless aches and awkward blunders would fail to resonate with any man's youthful recollections. When readers in Woolfe's hometown castigated him for his venial characterization of the people he grew up with, Woolfe pointed out that none of his characters represented any one particular person. Instead, their qualities were so real and so vivid that readers felt they instantly recognized them. And so it was with me, although I was born decades after Woolfe's death and raised in a different part of the country. The dialog, drama, and emotional undercurrents of &quot;Look Homeward Angel&quot; were strangely and overwhelmingly recognizable. This is the genius of Woolfe.My favorite parts of the novel vary considerably. I love the prose poem in the very beginning of the book. I also love the protagonist's descriptions of seemingly ordinary activities such as walking through a pasture on a fall evening. Such passages have the unnerving quality of being accessible yet somehow ineffable. A part of you is walking through the field with Eugene Gant taking in the cold wind, the smells of smoke and cow manure under the grim sky. Another part of you is asking why that experience feels so real and immediate even though you've never had it before.Woolfe took a microscope to ordinary people and somehow rendered them great. He did not accord them the stature of epoch heroes or contemporary celebrities. Instead, he rendered their feelings and actions as immediate as their surroundings. You probably would not want to be any of the people in &quot;Look Homeward Angel&quot; and you might not even like them that much. But you will come away from the book with the sense of knowing those people intimately. For this reason, it is impossible to finish &quot;Look Homeward Angel&quot; without a having profound emotional response."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I was much taken with LOOK HOMEWARD, ANGEL when I read it as a young man, particularly the chapter on the death of Ben Gant. It was one of the most moving things I had read at the time and I never forgot it. With more years behind me than in front of me, I was curious to see what effect this novel would have on me on a rereading. I found this tome this time to be long, wordy, at times bombastic, with far too many \\"O Lost's.\\" Mr. Wolfe never misses an opportunity to do long lists, often sounding like Walt Whitman on a bad day. And why on earth would he name Chapel Hill, North Carolina \\"Pulpit Hill\\" in the novel?On the other hand, sometimes Wolfe writes pure poetry; and the novel pulses with life. He has captured a town (Asheville, North Carolina early in the 20th Century) with all its prejudices, idiosyncrasies but hopes as well and has created a family we will never forgot, the Gants. Anyone who knows anything about Thomas Wolfe understands that they are a thinly veiled version of his own family: the bigger-than-life patriarch of the family Gant who has bouts with the bottle; his wife Eliza, obsessed with making a dime at whatever cost; and their children-- Daisy, Helen, the sailor Luke, the twins Grover and Ben and Eugene, based on Wolfe, himself. These characters are as much of the literary history of the United States as Willie Loman, Rabbit Angstrom, the Compson family et al.Yes, Wolfe's account of the death of Ben Gant at the age of 26 of double pneumonia will tear your heart out. After the Gant family members have spent excruciating days at his deathbed, Eugene has this beautiful words: \\"We can believe in the nothingness of life, we can believe in the nothingness of death and of life after death--but who can believe in the nothingness of Ben? Like Apollo, who did his penance to the high god in the sad house of King Admetus, he came, a god with broken feet, into the gray hovel of this world. And he lived here a stranger, trying to recapture the music of the lost world, trying to recall the great forgotten language, the lost faces, the stone, the leaf, the door.\\"LOOK HOMEWARD, ANGEL, for all its shortcomings, remains an American classic."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I loved it in 1968 as a college freshman and I love it today as a 52 year old prose lover, ex-hippie, and wage slave. While discussing the book with a classmate in college thirty years ago, He dissed Wolfe by saying that his writing was pretentious. I got seriously upset and wanted to slug him. Enamored I was and still am. After a hard day at work, you may not do better than get lost in the hill country of North Carolina. The characters are so real that you will be saying to your spouse or significant other, &quot;Hey sweetie, listen to this&quot; as you read passages of what seem to be your life. The book takes us places that we can see and feel. Intellectual? yes. Soulful? Hell yes! Settle in and read maybe twenty pages a day. You will be moved."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Wolfe is definitely a master of prose and words, at times hisdescriptions and observations of life are captivating and inspiring.However, the book did move very slowly at times, as his level of detail and character development was almost unparalled compared to others authors I have read. This was good and bad, at times it was really boring, no matter how intellectual I wanted to be, and it was difficult to keep going, however you really do get a sense of the characters. For a true look at small town American life at this point in history, there is no equivalent that I have come across. The last half of the book is especially poignant, and the most interesting development of the book for me was to witness Gene's transformation from child to a wanderlust stricken youth. There are no happy endings here, there are no unbelievable revelations, only a family and its tumultuous journey through this strange travel that we call life. You will either love this book, or you will hate it, but if you have the patience to persevere through Wolfe's long-winded prose, it is well worth the time."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Look Homeward Angel is a rather lengthy and rather wordy coming of age story. Centered around Eugene Gant, a character modeled on Wolfe himself, the story is an exhaustive and detailed account of his life all the wayh from birth to his leaving for Harvard in his 20's.I found this book to be an overall enjoyable read but I also found it to drag in some parts,the tone was a bit too sentimental and it was unfocused in parts. So much time is spent on details and wordiness that the book becomes bogged down at points. It takes close to 300 pages for Eugene to turn 12. I didn't think it was possible to find 300 pages worth to write about young childhood. Wolfe did apparently but none of it was really all that compelling to read. The tone of it is more than a little sentimental. Sure the whole point of the book is nostalgia but it gets too weepy for my tastes. The novel was also unfocused and uneven at times. Too much time was dedicated to his young life, and not enough to his adolescence and young adult life. A lot of the time the story focused not on Eugene, but his myriad of sibblings and his parents. And I wished Ben would stop saying &quot;oh jesus&quot; every sentence.Wolfe does succeed however in capturing the feel of small town life, and he does present a somewhat enjoyable read. If the novel was shorter and more focused, it would have been much better. I recommend Of Human Bondage by WS Maugham or A Portrait of the Artist by James Joyce as better coming of age stories. Of Human Bondage is more focused and deals more with his later and mature life, and Joyce's novel deals mostly with adolescence and should be read for his groundbreaking style."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"What sets this book apart from most 'coming of age' stories is the stunning combination of poetic language and monumental vision with which Wolfe imbues this tale of Eugene Gant's blossoming into manhood. No other American writer of novels has managed to utilize a voice so lush and exacting at the same time. The reader is literally seduced into the world that Wolfe creates and provided with an experience as rich as any in modern fiction.Thomas Wolfe was a large man, and he thought and acted in a large way. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, had to severly cut down the size of the gigantic text that he was given, and it is still a big book in all respects - in sheer size, breadth of vision, and thematic scope.This is one of those books I have to return to every few years just to see if it is still as good as I remember. While it is very much an adolescent book - in the sense that it storms the emotions with a 'Romantic' intensity - and I am much more critical than the young man who first read it - I find that I am still awed at Wolfe's talent and command.This is one of those 'must read' books for all who would be conversant with modern American fiction. It's type has been out of fashion for some time, but it can't be ignored as a substantial contribution that is uniquely its own thing."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Description:A child (Wolfe's fictitious double) born around 1900 grows up in a town in the mountains of North Carolina. The story follows the story of the boy, Eugene Gant, from his ancestors' immigration to America to his graduation from the University of North Carolina.The Good:Wolfe is an excellent writer and his heavily descriptive style works. By the end of the book, many of the characters feel like family. There are times when Wolfe departs from his descriptions to make beautiful philosophical observations you'll want to copy or underline for later reference. The final chapter is a masterpiece, and well worth the 513 pages of text leading up to it.The Bad:Wolfe's romanticism is grating to modern sensibilities--repeated phrases like &quot;O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again!&quot; seem more like the lamentations of a histrionic drama student than a top-notch writer. His characters, for the most part, don't undergo any radical changes or exhibit any interesting incongruities of behavior that hint at &quot;depth,&quot; something audiences nowadays have come to expect in a novel. Sometimes his references to other texts (generally quotes intended to represent Gant's literary thought processes) get annoying, and sometimes his attempts to describe scenery or occurrences, especially through the medium of Eugene's thoughts, can be a little bit messy or fall short of their targets.The Verdict:Even though it was published on the verge of the Great Depression, Look Homeward, Angel feels like a work from the nineteenth century . . . Dickens, Whitman, and Emerson seem to be influences. Most of the problems with the text that I mentioned simply take a period of adjustment to get used to. All things considered, it's an incredible piece of literature. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I love the sprawl of this novel; it has an organic energy, an enormous scope and vitality, and a sensuality, a feeling on each page. The novel is large in more than just page count. Wolfe's story portrays the spiritual and pscyhological growth of Eugene Gant--an autobiographical character. The image that remains is unforgetable. Wolfe's intelligence is that of the fox, uncanny in depth and range.If you like to read novels that create a world, create an irony and have a passion, I'd recommend this one. I can see the debt that Wolfe has with previous writers. He owes something to Dreiser in creating the enormous vitality in his prose. But Wolfe doesn't care about the naturalistic forces like Dreiser does, its powers and drives. For Wolfe, it is more important to live life to the fullest, completely alive. In this sense, I think that Walt Whitman's poetry parallels Wolfe's fictive prose. Whitman and Wolfe wrote about the people, the families, the bodies, the minds, connecting and disconnecting, all vitally alive and all eventually passing away.To me, what makes this novel most worthwhile to read is the final chapter: haunting, lyrical, amazing. I doubt if Wolfe will be read with a wider audience in this day because his race references can easily be construed as racism. Push past that, though, and read it for its heart, not the age in which it was written. Wolfe needs to be read long into the future."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I can easily see why Look Homeward, Angel is an American classic.The story is rambling and diverse, with a host of characters who are strong-willed and self-assured yet deeply flawed. This strongly reflects the character of the American people, as well as the nation itself.But the strength of Look Homeward Angel is in the prose. Wolfe's writing brings to light those passing moments in time that stay with us forever but which we don't recognize at the time as significant - the glory of the air in an early spring morning, the sensual stimuli that are all around us walking down a dark street late at night, and many other unforgetable scenes. His writing has the power and vitality of Faulkner, without the sometimes impossible sentences that cause one to lose track. It is challenging and rich.

I had never read him before and had heard complimentary reviews of his work. I was hoping to find a Modern American writer that has been neglected because of the dominance of Faulkner, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, et al. Wolfe excels in description and that is what much of the novel is, description of his family and his hometown. A thinly veiled autobiography, the novel is a bildungsroman set in his hometown, Asheville, NC. Many times, the description is wonderful and uplifting, but at other times, annoying.

It's cliche to the extreme: &quot;romantic&quot; young man goes to university, laments the fact that he is so much more intelligent than others, wishes people could understand him, returns home and looks down on everybody there. Unfortunately Wolfe is not close to being intelligent or interesting (and he certainly is not a genius as he himself said!). Wolfe obviously thinks that everything that has happened in his life will be of interest to the reader, after all he holds himself to be a genius, but one immediately sees how self-important he is, and how seriously he takes his ridiculous outlook. This is a nostalgic book; if you want to read a nostalgic book, read some Proust or Nabokov, who both soar above Wolfe, and let Wolfe be forgotten as he soon will be."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"OKay, I think my title pretty much sums up the book. But I suppose I should elaborate. In general, I do not like coming-of-age stories because all the author does is reflect on his youth without any plot. The main characters are always flawless heros, in a struggle against a cruel world that cannot understand their genius. Of course, no character in a book can be flawless. The authors just use the novel format as an excuse to lament on the cruel injustices that happened in their youth. I was punished in school when I didn't deserve it! I had to work at a job I didn't like! Boo hoo, poor me! No one is as smart as me! I have really deep thoughts! It's me against the world! Yep, arrogant, self-indulgent, and self-pitying all the way.Wolfe's writing is also particularly bad and cliched. &quot;Negroes&quot; are always snoring &quot;through blubbering lips.&quot; When they are awake, they do everything &quot;sleepily.&quot; You never see Eugene's mom without her pursing her lips. You never see his brother without him saying &quot;damn!&quot; The bad descriptions wouldn't be so intolerable if they didn't happen over and over again. And for the record, I like description, and I don't judge novels for racism that was considered politically correct in their day. I love Conrad, for example. But this is pretentious and generic and bad. Avoid at all costs."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Of all the supposed American &quot;classics&quot; I've read, this is the dullest of the lot, and, given the overtly racist observations, a poor suggestion for young readers. While the characterization of the family is unparalleled, the book, at 500 pages, is about 200 pages too long, and Wolfe takes way too many liberties with his flowery anglophile prose, repeating ad nauseum the same pithy poetic quotes. The book also serves as a painful reminder of our not-so-distant past, with numerous insulting racist commentaries regarding African-American and Jewish peoples. As a slice of history, and a gripping family portrait, this book is worth a read, but in pure story-telling talent and artistry, Wolfe pales in comparison to the other writers of the era (Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Faulkner). Thumbs down."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"Someone from my book club selected this as their recent choice. Out of 8 people not one person liked the book.

Its only saving grace is the way it conjures up late 19th and early 20th century America, with all it's charlatans, hucksters, get-rich schemes, and its often cheap and crude quality of life. It helps you understand why Charles Dickens hated America! But Wolfe has an undisciplined, crude style (matching his subject) that is painful to read. I swear he's made up many of the words, and one can't decipher them from the context. My book club read it, and not one of the nine attendees read more than 300 pages of the book."},{"Title":"Look Homeward, Angel: A Story of the Buried Life","review":"I rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it, but I couldn't take any more of Look Homeward, Angel after Part I (about 1/3 of the way through).

It is a living philosophy book for both adults and children. Wayne Dyer makes some excellent points in this book. He says to be sensible about failing particular tasks. He mentions that in 1927, Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs, more than anyone in the history of baseball up to that time. Babe Ruth also set another record that year. He struck out more than anyone in the history of baseball up to that time. Wayne Dyer says that the lesson is that if you want to hit home runs, you must be willing to strike out. He mentions about creativity and the reasons why often creative people need to be alone at certain times in their lives. Some families have fights about children's rooms. He says that as long as there are no serious hygiene problems, the child's room should be just that-the child's room. It should be left alone. He quotes Wolfgang Mozart saying that he is completely himself when he is left alone. When Thomas Edison failed 25,000 times in his effort to create a simple battery, he said that he was no failure and that he found 25,000 ways not to make a battery. This is truly a great book to read."},{"Title":"What Do You Really Want for Your Children?","review":"As the author of [...] I find What Do You Really Want for YOur Children to be nice, but not on the leading edge. Wayne Dyer is always full of stories and joy which is inspiring. The book is a fine introduction to being a parent who does not follow the old authoriterian ways. If you are inspired, don't stop here. Read other, more up to date books.For example, Wayne speaks in praise of praise, yet, praise is manipulation. It gives the parents control over the child. The parent uses it to attempt to get a child to repeat a good behavior or achievement or control their emotions. If you read Punished by Rewards, or my own articles about praise and my book, you would know that praise is as bad as punishment and actually harms self-esteem and self-reliance.Although much is missing in this book, it is also a delight to read from a delightful writer and speaker."},{"Title":"What Do You Really Want for Your Children?","review":"I love this author - this is a good lecture - I would recommend you get it - everyone can get something out of it... only thing I really didn't like were the cheezy, cheezy transitions between chapters - from the music to the little in between \\"parent child skits\\" that was annoying - other than that - awesome -"},{"Title":"What Do You Really Want for Your Children?","review":"This is one of the best books on parenting I've read EXCEPT for the one part (page 136) in which the author states \\"Accept the fact that you are precisely where you have chosen to be in life. Stop blaming your spouse for your unhappiness, your parents for your lack of motivation, the economy for your financial status, the bakery for your exess weight, your childhood for your phobias, and anything else to with you assign blame points. You are the sum total of the choices you have made in your life. Even if your parents made mistakes with you, accept the fact that they were human beings doing what they knew how to do at the time, given the unique conditions in their lives. How can you ask more of anyone? Forgive them and make peace with everyone in your past...\\" That's BULL. The author is negating the importance of his book with that statement. Why are there so many parenting books if there weren't so many adults out there with major problems BECAUSE of how they grew up? Why don't we just parent any way we want to--we can abuse our children--and then turn around and say \\"Don't blame me for your problems\\". Parents DO have responsibility--BIG responsibility in how their children turn out. How can anyone say of an ABUSIVE parent that he/she was just doing what they knew how to do at the time and that you couldn't ask any more of them??? Children can ask a WHOLE LOT MORE of their parents than to live with abuse. \\"Forgive them and make peace with your past\\"--in other words just tell them that all the abuse you suffered through didn't really matter and it was OK and you just weren't important enough to be treated any better? In other words, Dr. Dyer is giving them license to abuse and possibly continue the abuse but take no responsibility for it. WRONG!!! What's the point of this book then? What's the difference if we raise happy children or completely miserable children--how they turn out is going to be completely their responsibility and none of ours. Children do not grow up in a vacuum. People do not make choices in a vacuum. Yes, you are the sum of the choices you made, but your choices are based on what you learned of yourself and of the world THROUGH YOUR PARENTS. How can ANYONE take responsibility off of ABUSIVE parents as this Dr. Dyer has done??? Whether your parents abused you emotionally, physically and/or sexually--THEY have the responsibility, NOT YOU. You could have and you had every right to \\"ask more of them\\". Blaming a bakery on your excess weight is absolutely NOTHING like blaming your parents for the effects of their abuse. How can Dr. Dyer even SUGGEST such a thing? Having lived through a lifetime of hell because of abuse, I resent the fact that Dr. Dyer is taking all responsibility away from my parents and putting it on me. I didn't ASK to be abused. I DIDN'T make that choice. My parents have all the responsibility of that on THEIR shoulders. I made choices based on what I believed about myself from what I LEARNED as a child through that ABUSE. I know for a fact that abused children cannot just \\"forgive\\" their parents and \\"make peace\\" without working through the pain and hell of the past, but I had to learn that after much suffering and years of therapy. Oh yes, I want to be a good parent and I do make mistakes with my children, but ABUSE is not a \\"mistake\\". If you have been abused as a child, whether mentally/emotionally, physically and/or sexually, I recommend that you get the book \\"Toxic Parents\\" by Susan Forward and don't EVER listen to ANYONE who tells you that your parents are not responsible for who you are today. THEY ARE.This is a good book on parenting, but please don't pay any attention to the part that I am referring to--it is simply NOT true. Ask any person who was abused as a child.TOXIC PARENTS BY SUSAN FORWARD is an excellent book for persons who were abused as children.CHILDREN LEARN WHAT THEY LIVE by Dorothy Law Nolte, Ph.D.If children live with criticism, they learn to condemn. If children live with hostility, they learn to fight. If children live with fear, they learn to be apprehensive. If children live with pity, they learn to feel sorry for themselves. If children live with ridicule, they learn to feel shy. If children live with jealousy, they learn to feel envy. If children live with shame, they learn to feel guilty. If children live with encouragement, they learn confidence. If children live with tolerance, they learn patience. If children live with praise, they learn appreciation. If children live with acceptance, they learn to love. If children live with approval, they learn to like themselves. If children live with recognition, they learn it is good to have a goal. If children live with sharing, they learn generosity. If children live with honesty, they learn truthfulness. If children live with fairness, they learn justice. If children live with kindness and consideration, they learn respect. If children live with security, they learn to have faith in themselves and in those about them.

The only way to effectively model this behavior is to actually become this kind of person ourselves. It requires an open mind toward one's own behavior, thoughts and beliefs.

However, many parents are not specifically clear what characters they really want their children to have. Not knowing where to go and how to get there, it results in frustration, friction, conflict, mistrust, ... between the generations. Dr. Dyer's book is an invaluable guide for all serious parents to set the correct goal, make the goal approachable, and make every day of the parent-child relationship a deep enjoyment.This book is not an easy book. As other readers have pointed out, this book is not just about raising kids, but also (perhaps more importantly) about changing the parents themselves. As I read through some of the paragraphs, I often felt my regret for things that I should have not done to my kids (I hope I can be better next time...).Not only did the author set the goals that were founded on sound human development theory (mostly Maslow), but he also gave numerous detailed daily advices that are well organized around these goals. Examples include as simple of an advice as \\"Do not create monsters in the minds of young children to temporarily quiet them\\" to the more thoughtful \\"Try making your adolescent right rather than arguing with them any longer.\\" Another observation worthing everybody's thought is \\"If you use guilt on children on a regular basis, it will not be long before they start using it on you.\\"I also enjoy the many profound sayings that the author quoted. One is \\"A mother is not a person to lean on, but a person to make leaning unnecessary.\\" The other is \\"The greatest evil that can befall man is that he should come to think ill of himself.\\""},{"Title":"What Do You Really Want for Your Children?","review":"If you are looking at this review and care about your children or even about yourself, BUY THIS BOOK!

I discuss it with everyone I can and have found it to be immensely helpful in re-directing my own way of thinking. Postive thoughts surround me, I no longer feel pity on myself, I take action!I am happy to say that although it will make a difference in how I parent my daughter, it already has changed me and how I think. I realize now that I should not allow situations to control me, and this book is wonderfully adept at helping with this. If you have unbridled anger or frustration...this book is for you. Share this book with everyone you know, it will only affect them postively. Although there were some issues which I do not agree with personally, I did understand and respect all of Dr. Dyer's thoughts.

There are a lot of things we just aren't aware of in life that influence our children and this book brings a lot of them to your attention.

If that fact was missed by a reviewer with A Bone to Pick, that reviewer did, indeed, totally miss......the point.The reviewer states: &quot;That's BULL. The author is negating the importance of his book with that statement. Why are there so many parenting books if there weren't so many adults out there with major problems BECAUSE of how they grew up? Why don't we just parent any way we want to--we can abuse our children--and then turn around and say \\"Don't blame me for your problems\\".I would have to assume that anyone who was attracted to this book, if only because of its title, would not be of the mindset to abuse his/her children. More importantly, we can't coulda shoulda - we can't redo our own childhoods. The point of the book is to help us find more effective ways to raise our OWN children, in spite of our own childhoods, and to help us see very clearly what we TRULY want for our children. Dr. Dyer is marvelously successful in helping us to do just that. In this book, there is no room for blame, retaliation, recriminations, or lingering hostility. The point of Dr. Dyer's statements is that if we hang on to those negative feelings and long ago reactions, we will damage our own kids as well as continue to damage our ourselves. The name of the book is &quot;What Do You Really Want for your Children,&quot; not &quot;How Much Were You Abused as a Child?

Sadly, it's discouraging to realize the amount of hard work, discipline and self-control that are required from parents to pull off this challenging protocol for raising kids to be non-blaming, empathetic and self-confident adults. The main precepts tend to be repeated many times, but that's helpful for learning things well. As you might expect, there are plenty of helpful self-improvement tips for adults, who must really be exemplary people to follow the child-rearing advice Dyer gives. It would have been nice to have this book much sooner in my parenting career - now, as a grandparent, I'm finding it difficult to convince my daughter that the Dyer approach is workable.

This book helped me to see many of the negative parenting patterns that years of conditioning had created in my ego. The number one thing that I walked away with was the understanding that my children have to make their own lives (with my wife's and my guidance, of course), and that it is not my place to control them. Wayne also provides ways to help you see yourself and then how to correct any negative traits you possess concerning parenting. While I may not agree 100% with every idea he has regarding parenting, I would say I agree 90% (now that I've read it). I have seen many of my fallacies and have seen how they have affected and will affect my children negatively; I have seen how to change those ways also, thanks to this book.I believe EVERY parent should read this book, and I've given it to new parents and have recommended it to others. No matter how old your children are, Wayne has written this book for you, now. It's never too late to correct your mistakes and help your children grow to be mature, responsible, creative, limitless adults, and Wayne stresses that in this book.

Her anecdotes are often amusing, although her style is a little disorganized for my taste.The other 50%, however, is about politics (of the conservative variety) and religion (of the ardent variety). Down seems to believe in the smallest government possible (she expresses dissatisfaction with the concept of government aid for sufferers of natural disasters, she believes that having mothers in the workplace is taking a step towards Communism, and she thinks that the feminist movement \\"ran its course\\" (72)). Her religion is also extreme: \\"... someone does not want us to have an enthusiastic day, and that someone would be Satan... We must acknowledge that here is an enemy and recognize him for who he is. He desires to destroy the family\\" (47-48).I'm not saying Down's book is awful. But I am saying it is as much about conservative, accusatory political venting and inflexible religious views as it is about motherhood (a reality at which the description here and on the book's jacket does not hint).

For a paperback of this age, it is in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Unwanted Wife","review":"4 Stars!~ There are actually two romances in this book - Adrian and Tanya's; Diane and Roger's. In both, much could be avoided if only someone would be brave enough to express how they truly feel. Tanya's brutal honesty shakes up the lives of the others. Adrian came off rather selfish at first, thankfully, we've been given glimpses into his heart otherwise he might not have been redeemable. Roger and Diane are that couple who love to get under the other's skin but neither have the courage to reach for more. I enjoyed this vintage Presents very much.Unwanted Wife by Rachel Lindsay~ Harlequin Presents #249 ~ August 1978From the back cover...Tanya dazedly tried to understand what Adrian was saying. \\"Six years ago,\\" he went on, \\"your government announced that all its citizens who were married to foreigners had divorced them. So seeing you was something of a shock.\\"Something of a shock! The understatement almost made Tanya laugh, except that she was the butt of the joke.Not only was she in an alien country, but the man to whom she had come no longer wanted her. Even worse, for five years he had believed that she no longer wanted him"},{"Title":"Masters Touch","review":"Wonderful uplifting book. Loved the personal stories. Sometimes we hear the same accounts over and over. It was great to hear some new collections of individual experiences, yet from early history. I loved it, gave it to a friend for Christmas. Wish they would print new additions, I think it would be worth it!!!"},{"Title":"Affirmations","review":"I bought this book unseen with only the on-line recomendations expecting to learn about positive mental attitude via affirmations. I got stuck on Mr. Wilde's seemingly remorseless and perhaps even boastful background as a scam artist: in the first chapter he makes a big deal of being a tough guy in boarding school by selling protection to the other students, girlie magazines, and illicit cigarettes. From there he brags of staying in the U.S.A illegally while avoiding the INS. When he moves to California, he states the only games in town were being a guru or being in real estate. I gave up on the book after futher skimming it and coming across other information such as how Mr. Wilde moves objects with his mind. I could not get past Mr. Wilde as a person to read the rest of the book in any depth and relocated it to the trash.I do, however, highly reccommend &quot;You Can't Afford the Luxury of a Negative Thought&quot; if you are seeking a well written, serious, but funny book that teaches many of the important lessons on living a wonderful life. It's relatively inexpensive and available at Amazon.com."},{"Title":"Affirmations","review":"If you do not believe in what you say, you will get what you believe. So - why not believe and affirm in the things that you want and ask for assistance in getting them? That works for many many people..."},{"Title":"Affirmations","review":"I love how Stuart Wilde tells about his extracurricular activities in boarding school like selling insurance against a masters paddling then paying off if the teacher paddles you anyway. Or also selling girlie magazines for extra money. I also like how Stuart Wilde made big money in the clothing business selling radical, alternative threads. I have read other books and tapes by Stuart Wilde and would recommend this one."},{"Title":"Affirmations","review":"I also had a hard time with all the boasting \\"stories\\" about his life in general.I found myself wanting better definitions and ways to make the affirmations work.I was a little disappointed with this book. Although it was entertaining."},{"Title":"Affirmations","review":"I thought that this was a good introduction to affirmations; however, I enjoyed his book \\"The Trick to Money is Having Some\\" more. Still, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Affirmations","review":"If maintaining a grip on positive attitude and a positive frame of mind is a daily struggle for you (like all the rest of us), Wilde's little book of affirmations can come to your rescue like an emotional first aid kit. It is the absolute BEST of its kind. Don't expect depth here, it is targeted and focused on all the specifics we need help with. It is concentrated for power and punch and does not disappoint. Traveling? You will want to take your aspirin (or Tylenol), your Immodium, and your TUMS, but most of all don't forget to take Wilde's book. No matter what your goals, in this little gem, Wilde will take you to higher ground."},{"Title":"Affirmations","review":"I found this book in a quaint little shop by the beach at a low point in my life. It changed my life by opening my mind from the \\"tick tock\\" thinking which had my life in a rut. I started taking responsibility for my future and adopted an empowered, positive attitude. I enjoyed Stuart's sense of humor and his ideas had a big impact on me. I ended up reading all of his books, and found most of the others to have empowering ideas, too. The only downside to his books is their lack of a spiritual feeling. For that, I'd recommend reading Yogananda's \\"Where There Is Light,\\" my favorite spiritual book, which is very easy to understand, gives lots practical advice about real life situations and includes references to biblical passages where appropriate."},{"Title":"Affirmations","review":"This book is subtitled: How to expand your personal power and take back control of your life. And it does so mostly on the wilder side of metaphysics. The affirmations are printed in script and interspersed with the highly entertaining normal text - part autobiography, part good advice, part esoteric insights, all of it very uplifting. There are in-deph discussions of affirmations (the different types and how to use them) plus fascinating ideas on the life force and universal law. His descriptions of his astral travels &quot;up the tube&quot; still fascinate me and I love the Ayn Rand reference. Similar books that are equally engrossing: The Greatest Power In The Universe by U.S. Andersen and Cosmic Trigger Vol. I by Robert Anton Wilson."},{"Title":"Affirmations","review":"Writing a 150 page book about affirmations would be a daunting task for most people. Even though the power of daily affirmations is well established as a means of freeing ones self from negative habits of thinking and is used with great success by groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous, the process is usually relatively simple and straightforward. The process and techniques could easily be contained in a folded pamphlet.Stuart Wilde expanded the entire concept of affirmations in this book. He carries it into a wide-ranging field of metaphysics, manipulation and, probably, magic. The concepts aren't new, but Wilde's approach is always interesting, pithy, usually helpful, and readable.I have mixed feelings about Stuart Wilde, and similarly mixed feelings about this book. It's good, it's effective and it delivers what is offered on the cover. A means of taking back control of your life.On the downside, I suppose I'd have preferred to see a stronger division between manipulative energy and merely self-improvement. The distinction is there inside the book, but I'd have liked to see it repeated a few more times."},{"Title":"Affirmations","review":"This is the first book I've read by Stuart Wilde, and I can definitely understand why he is considered \\"a real character\\" in the human potential movement - it shows in his use of controversial, yet humorous tones within which his insights are encased.The main theme of this book seems to be that in order for people to find & use their personal power, they must first take personal responsibility for EVERYTHING in their lives - realizing that their energy \\"fingerprint\\" is what is drawing all of their experiences to them. Another aspect of this book has to do with affirmations. Mr. Wilde discusses 3 types of affirmations (thought, feeling, & action), describing what they entail & how to use them to create that which you truly want.Although I found this book to be quite insightful, I would have preferred a bit less emphasis on the author's political beliefs/views & a little more spiritual depth - but I would still highly recommend it to anyone looking to take personal responsibility on their road to change."},{"Title":"Affirmations","review":"I recommend this book for anybody who is... searching. And you know who you are. It's like being enlightened. It's the spark you've been looking for, the spark you knew you already had all this time. A small book, to help you realize your potential and your power !"},{"Title":"Affirmations","review":"Great reading.Opens your eyes and heart and mind. I'm actually not afraid to die. I'm happier then I could ever remember being. Will definetly be reading the other titles by Stuart Wilde!!"},{"Title":"Affirmations","review":"I did not care for book and put it in the pile to donate to the library. The book wasn't what I expected and in reading the first few chapters, it seemed to me that the author of the book was rather a pessimist and I wondered why he was writing a book on affirmations, at the time I was reading the book. Perhaps it was the author's sense of humor that is difficult to read when you can't see body language. Whatever the case, the book was not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Affirmations","review":"For all of us who are on a spiritual path: This book is affirming within itself. Even though it has only 140 pages, each page is powerful and needs digesting.

An Introduction to the Use of Structuralist Analysis in Social Anthropology (Themes in the Social Sciences)","review":"I had to use this book at college for communications courses and at the time, it was difficult to follow and remember salient points. It's a classic example of an author writing for his colleagues and not for actual people. The language is too high-falutin' for the average college student. Sad, but true. But I come back to it every couple of years, and it becomes easier to understand. I suggest that it be issued as part of a graduate course instead of an undergraduate course."},{"Title":"Art from the Trenches: America's Uniformed Artists in World War I (Williams-Ford Texas A&M; University Military History Series)","review":"More than half the book is biographical materials on the individual artists and text regarding their involvement with the army.

You should read it if you've ever suspected that Revelation might be more than a psychotic episode.Chutes 'Search for God' is great too especially the chapter on Genesis but also the prophets and history, the chapter 'the finding'. Boy she makes it all so clear and alive...can't recommend it enough.A quiet and very personal revolution and revelation for me.

The seventh in the Mitford series, \\"In This Mountain\\" is Jan Karon at her best. Her gift for weaving details into her stories that later blossom into poignant and powerful life lessons is unparalleled.As a woman, my favorite character in this series is dear Cynthia Kavanaugh. She is a wonderfully human mixture of weaknesses, strengths, and believability. \\"In This Mountain\\" recounts, from Father Tim's perspective, her gentle and enduring faith in the midst of a dark and relentless crisis in her husband's life. Oh! To be a wife like Cynthia Kavanaugh! In spite of its status as fiction, \\"In This Mountain\\" holds many valuable Truths.If you are a Mitford fan, you won't be disappointed in this tale!

All of the other Mitford Series audio books I've listened to and/or purchased were unabridged. The online description of this one didn't specify. So, I took the chance that since all the others were unabridged, this one probably is too. No such luck. I would rather have the unabridged version, if it exists. The Mitford Series by Jan Karon are truly delightful, which is why I don't want to miss a word! Is it possible to return this abridged version in exchange for the unabridged version?"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"After reading the first 6 books of this series I was hoping it would never end.

Homespun and endearing, Mitford is a community that always warms the heart."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"This is my kind of book. When all the world seems to be in turmoil, Jan Karon knows how to calm our feelings and help us realize that all is not bad in the world. We could all take lessons from people in Mitford.....slow down and smell the roses and know there is still much good in the world. I can hardly wait for her next &quot;Mitford Book&quot;. I have recommended her books to countless friends and all are hooked. I have the entire series and my first order of business at the beginning of each new year is read them all in the order they were written......uplifting for the soul and the only problem I can see is the new one is not yet published. Keep up the good work and thank you, Jan Karon, for helping us see the goodness all around us."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I stayed up until 2 a.m. to finish this book. Father Tim's struggle with depression and self-doubt was very realistically portrayed and I suffered right along with him as he fought to regain himself. As usual I enjoyed the doings of Dooley, Uncle Billy Watson, Puny and the twins, and the rest of the Mitford family. I particularly enjoyed the liberal sprinking of quotes of scripture in this book and even pulled out my Oswald Chambers to look up a passage mentioned in the book. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series but until then I may go back and re-read the earlier Mitford books."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Maybe it's just that, by now, I feel that I know the people of Mitford, NC.......but Jan Karon has made them so very real that I *do* know them.

Father Tim's depression, Cynthia's irrepressible joy for life, Dooley's teenage feelings.......I loved it all and will eagerly await Karon's eighth book in this series!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"My wife tried for several years to get me to read this series. \\"Sissy Books\\", I'd cry. I bless the day when I finally succumbed to her charms and read the books by Jan Karon. I have read them once, retired, and started re-reading them again. I laughed, I shed a few tears (that's hard for a retired police officer to say)and I had some very important lessons in life re-emphasized. I saw in Father Tim a man after God's own heart, and it makes me want to be that kind of man. I highly recommend In This Mountain as well as the entire series."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I adore the entire Mitford series and would highly recommend it.Make sure you start from the first book so you get to know the characters and running story lines.

The quality writing and uplifting story with solid values can make you feel grounded as well as full of hope. The world is an amazing place and though this book is fiction, it gives a positive perspective that may help you get a fresh focus. The characters from Mitford always have something going on and Father Tim seems like someone that you could really enjoy knowing."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"This is the best Jan Karon book yet!

Thank you Ms. Karon."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I absolutely enjoyed all of the Mitford series and this book is no exception. I have even rationed out the number of pages I read nightly so that I can spend the summer with the Mitford gang. They are like extended family. I am sorry, however, to read that there will be only two more forthcoming,with the end of the series is coming in 2005. Jan Karon has captured my laurels with her simple, gentle readings. Believe me, in these times the Mitford books are a delightful retreat from the horrors on the news. I suppose it is difficult to keep producing these books for the demand, but I with the Muse would inspire Jan Karon to give us many more."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I think not only did we get an update on the &quot;Mitford&quot; family, but some important subjects were touched upon.

This one displays more insight and emotion into the characters, particularly Father Tim, as he deals with several tough issues. But there is still the same small town humor that we've all come to know and love in this series, and I again finished another Mitford book wishing I could visit this place and meet these eccentric, loveable, and strong characters.

An amazing addition to the Mitford series, one that left me gasping at one point and re-reading it almost as soon as I finished it. Once again Ms. Karon presents the reader with the gentle village life of Mitford and the lovable but occasionally cankterous Father Tim, and shows us a gentle side to some very difficult issues. Far from syrupy, the books in this series manage to tackle some really hard turns in the road without becoming a soap opera - more an approach to life through faith and kindness and devotion. For some people, this might be a difficult read but the message of thankfulness and hope will guide you through the darker parts. Life with Father Tim, Cynthia, Dooley, Puny, Emma, the Turkey Club, Harley, Hessie, Hope &amp; Helene - well ALL the favorite Mitford character, continues to challenge and enrich anyone opening the cover of this truly wonderful book."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"The seventh book in the popular Mitford Years series returns fans to peace, comfort and serenity despite obstacles. John McDonough, known to many as Captain Kangaroo on the Fox Family Channel's \\"The All New Captain Kangaroo,\\" turns in a measured and understanding reading, investing characters with authenticity.It has been over three years since the beloved cleric, Father Tim Kavanaugh, and his wife, Cynthia, have returned to Mitford. For Father Tim it is a time of introspection as his 70th birthday approaches. He, unfortunately, reaches some painful decisions about his career while Cynthia seemingly flourishes professionally.Favorite characters from past Mitford books abound: Dooley Barlowe finds romance and his life's work as a veterinarian; duck for cover as there's a haircut war between barber and hair stylist; and there's an updated menu over at the Main Street Grill.Karon hasn't lost her touch at creating characters we'd love to know.

Don't get me wrong, I really liked this book, but throughout I felt like we had been covering territory that we'd already journeyed through in the first books, particularly &quot;A Light in the Window.&quot;I felt that Ms. Karon got a little bogged down in all the introspection Father Tim went through in this book after his accident (which I won't give away for those who haven't read it yet). And I also thought the Edith Mallory character resurfacing yet again was a repeat of what had happened in previous books. I was really hoping to see the end of her, especially after Father Tim married Cynthia. Maybe it's just a part of the woman's character that she keeps trying to get Father Tim in compromising positions!However, I loved the &quot;Sammy&quot; angle in this story as well as how Ms. Karon further fleshed out Hope Winchester (a delightful character), Helene Pringle, and Hessie Mayhew. And I was happy to return to Mitford, albeit through some familiar territory as said before.I'm looking forward to the eighth book in the series, and am hoping some of the loose ends from this book will be tied up -- Dooley and Lace, Sammy and his mother, and the &quot;year in the country.&quot;Oh, and one more thing -- my question at the end of &quot;A New Song&quot; was never answered in this book. What was in the note Father Tim gave Helene Pringle at the end of that book? Was it an oversight that it was left out or are we supposed to think whatever we like?"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Father Tim Kavanaugh and his author-wife, Cynthia, are back in Mitford, thank goodness, for this 7th installment of Jan Karon's lovely series about a tiny village in the North Carolina mountains. Compared to her last book, a prequel about the couple's wedding that only took a couple of hours to read, this book is much more substantive and fun to read. Once again, Tim's fussy personality and Cynthia's practical sense make for a pleasurable read. It just goes to show you that it doesn't take blood and guts and cussing and sex to make a very good book."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"The 7th book in the Mitford Series is a joyful read, and just what I had hoped for. Father Tim and Cynthia blossom as their years together move on. Their devotion to each other never wanes, even through the trials and tribulations that are about to test their beliefs to the core. Father Tim goes through some dark days, after an occurrence that shakes all of Mitford to the bone. As usual there are lessons to learn, for with every darkness comes a dawn, though it might be an unexpected one.All the regulars are back and gizzards are the Tuesday special at the grill, Percy is as cantankerous as ever, some things never change. Emma Newland is working on getting Father Tim into cyberspace, while he's still working on learning to use the microwave. Dooley is back and still searching for his brother Sammy, and George Gaynor \\"The Man in the Attic\\" returns.Jan Karon has created a wonderful place to come with every book of this series, and she doesn't disappoint in her latest edition of the town that everyone should spend time in. She has a wonderful way of allowing the reader to step right into the setting she has created so clearly in her minds eye. We all should spend a little time in Mitford.

Father Tim has always served as an inspiration to me just as he does to everyone he comes across. The characters that surround him in the Mitford books have become more real to me than the people in my own neighborhood, and church. Jan Karon is a gifted author, and enjoying her books has been a real blessing to me. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"While I have enjoyed the other Mitford books, if I've had any complaint it is that the stories are a little too pat and everyone is a bit too cute. I was pleased and moved by the direction that Karon took In This Mountain. I felt this book had more substance than her previous books, while retaining their charm. Father Tim's wrestlings were very meaningful to me, and sermon he delivers near the end of the book is a masterpiece. I hope this indicates the future direction of the Mitford series."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"In this latest of Jan Karon's novels, the pace is considerably quicker than in her previous Mitford series books. I was pleasantly surprised at the unexpected turn of events in the life of Father Tim in this book. It makes the reader realize that from time to time, a little rain falls in everyone's life, including the beloved Father Tim Kavanagh. Jan Karon has a wonderful ability of bringing all her characters to life for the reader. Keep up the great work Jan!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I've thoroughly enjoyed all the Mitford Series, this one being no exception. It's refreshing to read a book where the characters genuinely apply Christian princples to their daily lives. I reviewed the first set for my book club and even served the famous orange marmalade cake! However, I find Karon's overuse of \\"trotting\\" and \\"thumping\\" distracting. Jan, why don't you trot down to the Happing Endings Bookstore, thump down $5.99 on the counter, and get thee a Roget's Thesaurus. I'll be counting the \\"trots\\" and \\"thumps\\" in the next one!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book to find out how my friends and indeed family members had fared since the last book. I am a great Karon fan and hope she will continue to write about these lovely and real folks with their flaws and endearing traits but only if she is really inspired to write another one. I think this one seemed like a stretch for her and there was a lot of &quot;fill&quot; between the pages. I felt like she was trying too hard to pull all the factions together and was laboring over the storyline. I didn't like the departure to Whitecap island in the first place and would have preferred her staying in Mitford, hence I had trouble recreating the Whitecap vignettes as I didn't really care as much about those characters and it's been quite awhile since I read the last book. Would have given this 3 stars but I just couldn't do that to such a wonderful storyteller whose books I love so well."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"In This Mountain finds Father Tim and Cynthia again living in Mitford, following their stint on Whitecap Island a few years ago.In the little town of Mitford, life hums along. Dooley looks toward his career as a vet. Joe Ivey and Fancy Skinner fight a haircut price war that takes no prisoners. Percy steps out on a limb with a risky new menu item at the Grill. Uncle Billy feels pressure to produce a surefire joke, and 'The Man in the Attic,' returns to Mitford as the town holds its breath to see what happens.Though Father Tim dislikes change, he dislikes retirement even more. His wife wins awards, receives bouquets, gets invited to tour the country. What's he doing? Father's health with his diabetes takes a turn for the very worse when he is neglectful taking his medicine. This bad spell leaves him in the throes of depression and sadness. To top it all off, Edith Mallory, who absolutely despises Father Tim, gives him more problems.Finally, he snaps out of his depression, and decides to take on a unique and difficult ministry. This makes him feel more energized than ever before.The book was a dandy one as all the preceding ones before it. I couldn't put it down once I started it."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"book shipped promptly ; confusion on title by Amazon was cleared by shipper- was in very good condition"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"As a pastor I enjoy reading the Mitford series. I can relate to lots of the things that Father Tim deals with. This book spoke directly to my heart. Retirement is not something that Pastors look forward to, at least not the ones I know. A good pastor / missionary / evangelist never retires from doing the Lord's work.But what caught me here was the fact that even Pastor's can struggle with some discouragment and depression. I have struggled for the last two years with some depression after being moved from one position to another. It has been difficult. Sometimes I wondered where God was.I like Father Timothy kept opening my Bible looking for the right verse that would speak to my heart. So, as I read this book I totally related.I would hope that as you read it you will come to understand that Pastors are just as human as everyone else. We deal with the same issues that laypeople deal with.God is there and is walking with us through every part of our lives. You just might not see him clearly right now. But hold on tight, He is there and He loves you and will help you find the other side of depression and bring you Joy in the morning.Thank you Jan for writing a truly heart felt book."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Like all the other Mitford Series I loved this one and looked forward to the next one!!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Still not up to the first books in her series, but still worth the read."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"After reading In This Mountain I have decided that Jan Karon should follow Father Tim's example and retire.

It's a quick read. Unfortunately, much of the action is predictable and corny, but it's also relaxing to read something that isn't, frankly, challenging. Think of this as an adult version of a children's bedtime story. Peaceful and sleepy. Nothing wrong with that. I won't hold it against the author that the photo of her on the back of the book, complete with too much jewelry, too much hair, and what looks like real fur trimming her clothing, makes her look like Edith Mallory, one of the book's antagonists. Somehow, I assumed the author would look more like the sweet Cynthia character (the minister's wife). All in all, this book is delightful, undemanding, and spiritually uplifting. As someone with a number of Jewish friends, I do wish the author would downplay the Christian rhetoric, though. One can be spiritual without pushing a particular religious agenda. (I gave a hospitalized Jewish friend a copy of this book before I had read it and before I realized it had Christian overtones.)"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I've liked Karon's Mitford books, but this one was almost too much. Must EVERY exchange between Tim and his friends include, &quot;Im praying for you,&quot; and &quot;And Im praying for you, too&quot;? I started noting this early on, checked each occurrence, and there's more than forty such exchanges. Now even for a priest, that'a little much. And I have come to skip over the paragraph where Tim asks Cynthia, &quot;And what DON&quot;T you love?&quot; Her cutesy replies are gag material. And the description of Edith Mallory &quot;trapping&quot; Tim in a locked room and trying to seduce him is almsot Saturday Night Live material. All this said, the nice telling of ordinary stories in an ordinary town is refreshing, and with the above qualifications, this still is a good read."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"The (endless) crisis of an old man, thickly spread with religious jam. Ms Karon has given up story telling in favor of preaching, not an appealing choice."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Reading any of Karon's \\"Mitford Series\\" is somewhat like reading about people who have been raised for their entire lives to date in some dark closet. Her characters are absolutely and purely ignorant of virtually any and all aspects of human culture, human civilization or human achievement. Their conversation reveals no inkling of what year it is, or what state they are in, much less what nation or planet they are on. In the real world these creatures would have spent the last 50 years glued to the front of the boob tube, and essentially their entire conversation would be devoted to soap operas, talk shows and televised sports.Yet apart from a few vague references to a \\"remote,\\" or the \\"five o'clock news,\\" there is little evidence anyone even has a TV... much less reads a (non-local) newspaper or books, fiction or nonfiction. [Hope, who runs the local bookstore, does seem to know who Thirkell and Wodehouse are.]For quite a few years Karon has been mining the vein of \\"non-books\\" diligently, rather than supplying new \\"adventures\\" (to use the word very loosely) for Father Tim and his fellow prisoners. This is finally the 6th Mitford novel (despite what the publisher claims), and takes over roughly where A NEW SONG left off. As we join the team, Father Tim and wife are getting ready to spend a year living in a tent in Goatbugger, Tennessee doing something the author never bothers to specify, because it is obvious to both author and reader that Tim ain't gonna get there (what would become of Violet, for example!). Instead Tim, in his customary mindless way, manages to seriously injure himself and another minister, and spends the rest of the novel in a deep, brooding depression. It's not that Tim is communing with his inner thoughts, because like all the other characters, HE HAS NO THOUGHTS! And that makes this novel very rough going, to say the least.As another reviewer noted on these pages, \\"pray\\" is almost the only verb in the book, and it seemingly appears about 5 times per page. Otherwise, nothing happens. There is some nonsense about a lunatic who wants to build a log cabin the size of a cathedral, or maybe a cathedral the size of a log cabin, his raving being unclear on this point; continuing villain Edith Mallory makes her customary pointless appearance; Father Tim gets a computer and goes online so he can read his own e-mail; some ex-cons need the good Father's support; one of Dooley's missing brothers turns out to have, gosh, been right there all along; and that's pretty much the size of it. About the only suspense concerns whether or not incidental characters Hope and Helene will become regular church attendees and I wouldn't dream of spoiling that for you!Rumors are afoot that in a later novel in the series, Father Tim will encounter for the first time in his life a Muslim, or a Hindu, or a Jew, or a Catholic, or a university professor, or a scientist, or even an uppity knee-grow, and expire from shock and heart-failure. I don't think loyal readers need to worry."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I enjoy the Mitford series.

The owner of the diner tries to figure out the best way to offer chicken gizzards when a frequent customer makes a recommendation. The strength of this book lies in the characters, but it also has a strong plot involving Tim Kavanaugh the main character, and a bout with diabetes.

I was spellbound, eagerly waiting to see what came next.Karon's stories are believable because they take one into the mind and soul of the characters. I just know that if I were to run into Father Tim and Cynthia on the street, I would recognize them instantly (Father Tim would probably be in need of a haircut!)The Christian mores are woven so intricately into the story that they do not &quot;hit you over the head.&quot; I have found life lessons in the books that I have put into my journal to refer to over and over again.I like the fact that Father Tim, even as a spiritual leader, wrestles with the very same emotions and spiritual issues as the rest of us and that he uses prayer to see him through.I am involved in a couple of Bible studies; these books are a wonderful complement, putting the principles into everyday situations.Can't wait for the next Mitford book!

Karon deals with the difficult topics of illness, death, and depression with a deft hand, mixing in just the right amount of hope and grace. All of the old favorite characters are here, along with some new ones, and readers will delight at the humanity and gentle humor which Karon injects in her book. She has a way of getting inside her characters' heads and is able to lovingly portray their frailties along with their faith."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Everyone who has submitted a review has done a great job commenting and summarizing the seventh book in this series. I tried myself to stretch it out so I wouldn't finish too quickly as I knew, I also would be sad to finish it. I would hope that more authors would spring up like Jan Karon and take the lead in writing good quality stories that do not have to have explicit sex scenes, swearing and uncomfortable inuendos or undertones that make someone question why paper was wasted on the book. A long sentence, but I believe a common thought of many readers. Thank you again, Jan Karon, for staying on the straight and narrow yet providing your readers with a very rich and pleasurable story. There is no time wasted, no guilt to be felt when picking up one of your books. Anyone would be truly blessed to read this story as well as the 6 books before."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Jan Karon has outdone herself in this novel. She has deftly and beautifully reminds us of grace and redemption in this fallen world: both of their existence and of our need for them. She writes about the realities of life, which can sometimes be painful, but Karon never for a moment lets us forget that God offers redemption for all who merely ask. This redemption not only secures us a place in heaven with God our Father, but it is how He works in our lives day by day, as He measures grace sufficient to meet the need. Father Tim struggles deeply in this novel, making us ache with him, and he learns that dealing once with painful issues (such as his relationship with his father)is seldom enough to banish them forever. He also learns how much his actions and lack of action can wound those he loves most. Having a father who was for many years a minister, I am amazed at how well Karon has captured this often lonely life. So often people fail to realize that ministers struggle sometimes and need ministers of their own, yet they are often isolated and not generally by choice. Thank you, Jan Karon, for writing about the world as it really is and for writing about God as He truly is. And, yes, &quot;in everything give thanks . . . for this is the will of God.&quot; Thank you, God, for Jan Karon and for the reality of Christ's redemption."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I was the first to read Jan Karon's 7th book when it arrived at our local library branch. I devoured it over the week-end, turned it in on Monday morning, then went immediately to buy it so I could enjoy it again slowly. Now I'm ready to begin with At Home In Mitford and re-read the whole series. I've begun to include Father Tim, Cynthia, Uncle Billy, and all the other wonderful characters in my conversations like they're real people. Jan Karon, through the voices of her characters, has preached some of the best sermon material ever. She must be a wonderful person to have such wisdom, insight, and inspiration. No fictional work has ever made a greater impression on me. I also have every audio version, and John McDonough is the best!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Once again it was interesting to follow Father Tim's struggles, Cynthia's successes and Dooley's progress. I enjoy the searches for Dooley's siblings and the stories of what happens when they are found. The other characters make for a great read too. I was especially glad to see George Gaynor reappear. I had hoped he would become part of the series again. Overall it is another well written book. My only problem with it is the Edith Mallory plot. The tricking Father Tim and locking him in a room seemed too odd. Edith was an interesting villain in the earlier books but this time she was just too strange."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I love all the Mitford books. I love the characters, the town and even Barnabas. But for some reason, the whole tone of the book seemed sad. With Father Tim having his diabetic blackout and the repercussions that followed were unlike the other books. I always found them uplifting so I am wondering if the next Mitford tale will be within the same vein. Is this the prelude of Father Tim's more grim illness or just an instance of showing us that life is never perfect, even in Mitford? We will have to see."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Karon is definitely nearing her best again with this latest installment in the life of Father Tim. Well worth reading, and as always I come away from her better works refreshed in mind and in spirit.However! I take it Ms. Karon has an editor, and while I know that one of the most thankless tasks on earth must be the editing of a highly successful author...if Ms. Karon uses as verbs the words \\"crow\\" or \\"relish\\" ONE MORE TIME I will personally drown her in a vat of wisteria eau de toilette!The two largest criticisms of her work in general, and I think we can safely say in this book in particular, are Karon's propensity to be precious...suffocatingly precious...and her use of the good Lord to solve all the problems that prove a bit too taxing for her storytelling skills.In this novel, Father Tim suffers not only a crisis of the soul, but clinical depression. While Karon describes the disease very well indeed, she hands off the cure to a convenient religious revelation, which sells short the real life experience of this condition. It strikes me as vastly unwise to suggest that God will send a cure in the absence of prescribed medication (Father Tim ditches his for no good reason) or skilled therapy (Father Tim gets none...a rather damning omission on Dr. Hoppy's part, I thought).The book could also have benefited enormously from another 50 pages or so, delving into the minds of those around Father Tim. Dooley goes through some major stuff off screen, as does the Bishop, Cynthia...jeepers, everybody.The stuff here is good, and don't miss the wonderful diatribe against those who spurn cake-eating, but Ms. Karon needs to pull out the stops and give these books the much better shot I am sure she is capable of."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"It was wonderful to pick up on the life of Father Tim and Cynthia once again.

Sadly, this is not the case. I believe that the author is writing for those readers who are soooo glad to have a good old small town story with the right values, that she neglects character development and plotting.

I had a hard time reading it, and have so looked forward to another Mitford visit. The characters are all there, and the examination of Fr Tim's struggle with retirement, depression, health and most importantly, his faith was outstanding and very well done. It was just hard to jump from one thing to the next. Really these books are a good exposure to Christian faith and values, and really want to make you think about it all. I remember thinking there were to be 7 books total, but this leaves off making you think there will be one more book, as there is still a Barlowe brother to be found, and that appears to be the mission of Fr. Tim--reuniting the Barlowe children.

Somehow, I assumed the author would look more like the sweet Cynthia character (the minister's wife). All in all, this book is delightful, undemanding, and spiritually uplifting. As someone with a number of Jewish friends, I do wish the author would downplay the Christian rhetoric, though. One can be spiritual without pushing a particular religious agenda. (I gave a hospitalized Jewish friend a copy of this book before I had read it and before I realized it had Christian overtones.)"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"The seventh book in the Mitford series is all about love and discovery...Father Tim and his wife, Cynthia have returned to Mitford and those of us who have read the first five books (the sixth was a novella and not worth discussing) are sighing and smiling in relief that they (and we) are home. The rhythm of the town is one we are familiar with. The characters are old friends (at least most of them). Their eccentricities and foibles have been missed and we desperately need to get caught up with what has been happening in Mitford since the Kavenaugh's spent three years on Whitecap Inland in North Carolina.For a man of strong intellect and true instincts, Father Tim can sometimes be his own worst enemy as he proves in the first part of the book. He is ignoring his diabetes by not exercising, eating the wrong things and &quot;forgetting&quot; to take his insulin shots or adjusting the dose himself. The result of such a course of action is both predictable and tragic. The depth of the tragedy is something he discovers as he recovers from his injuries and is told the harsh truth of what actually occurred.The story is then woven around Father Tim's recovery from the accident and the depression that followed; the search for Dooley's brother; the return of The Man in the Attic; the continuing saga of Uncle Billy and Rose and the comings and goings of all of the wonderful Mitford characters.This book is not fluff, however. There are many sermons, stories and words to live by scattered through the events related here. You will laugh, smile, shed a tear, and grind your teeth, but most of all and most importantly, you will care what happens. You will care deeply and when you at last close the last page you will also have grown from the experience. I guarantee it!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"For those who have grown to love Mitford, this might disappoint a little in that Father Tim and Cynthia get called to another church on a small coastal island. But Jan Karon does an equally great job of making new and endearing characters for Father Tim to minister to. -- Don't worry, you'll still be kept abreast of what is happening in Mitford!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Another wonderful chapter in the Mitford series. I want to move there. The characters are flawed, human, warm, real. They become part of one's life and when you read about them, it's like greeting old friends and catching up with them. So looking forward to the Father Tim series!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"In modern times where any bit of 'entertainment' can leave you feeling a bit down, its nice to have something that lets you walk away with a smile. The quality writing and uplifting story with solid values can make you feel grounded as well as full of hope. The world is an amazing place and though this book is fiction, it gives a positive perspective that may help you get a fresh focus. The characters from Mitford always have something going on and Father Tim seems like someone that you could really enjoy knowing."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Jan Karon's best work to date.

I will at some time re-read all of the Mitford series and enjoy them as much the second time. The characters are just delightful and Jan Karon tells the stories as no other. Her sense of humor is wonderful. Do not fail to read at least this last book.

Wonderful easy reading."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"While Jan Karon's characters are still quirky and interesting enough to get you through the book, this is definitely the worst book of the series thus far. First of all, she definitely needs a better editor to catch her favorite expressions. I was so sick of hearing people \\"thump down\\" into chairs that by the end of the book, I thought their rear ends must hurt! She also has an annoying habit of using the phrase \\"meaning it\\" to describe how intense her characters said something. This is not Karon's fault; it's her editor's responsibility to catch these things. It's difficult for an author to notice these things when they reread their manuscripts because the whole thing, including every rewrite, is in their head.Secondly, there was just not enough action or plot in this book to keep me very interested. While it's true that most of the books in this series are more character driven than plot driven, most of them have enough plot twists to keep you from noticing. This time, I noticed. Maybe it's time to end the series. While I would like to know if Dooley ever finds all of his siblings or if he learns of his inheritance from Miss Sadie, I'm tiring of Mitford. The characters seem to be losing some of their charm - and in a character driven series, that is not a good thing."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I shop only for unabridged books on CD.

I've read every one at least twice.I am over joyed to share another similar book I have just discovered. I borrow the advanced reading copy from a Sunday School friend who is a newspaper reviewer.The Town That Came A-Courtin' by Ronda Rich is a perfect match to the Mitford Series. If you love Mitford, you're going to love Bliss, Mississippi. I highly recommend it.Thank goodness that the publishing industry has finally recognized that there are readers out here like those of us who love books like the Mitford Series and The Town That Came A-Courtin'."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I am glad - truly I am -- that devout Christians and those who yearn for rural utopia have found a champion in Jan Karon. Lord knows, we need wholesome, uplifting stories. Ms. Karon can be a good storyteller indeed, but her publisher has done her no favors by releasing her work without benefit of a good editor. There can be no other explanation for her maddening over-repetition of signature phrases (\\"meaning it,\\" \\"into the bargain,\\" \\"chinwag,\\" \\"the prayer that never fails\\"). As another reader noted, Ms. Karon desperately needs a thesaurus.I enjoyed the first few Mitford books. Only pure stubbornness, alas, compelled me to finish In This Mountain. I am an ordained clergywoman, well acquainted with the power of prayer and comfortable with the language of faith. Still, the simplistic, saccharine faith of Fr. Tim and the Mitford gang - chock-full of spontaneous prayer but sadly lacking in moral courage -- sets even my teeth on edge. I recognize bits and pieces of Fr. Tim in many of my colleagues but the whole package of him is simply not to be believed. One wonders whether Ms. Karon has had, somewhere in her past, a girlish crush on a clergyman and has spun out her fantasies in this idealized portrait of what she imagines a priest should be, casting herself in the supporting role of Cynthia Coppersmith. Thankfully, this Stepford Priest exists only in Ms. Karon's imagination. And thankfully, this literary ordeal will be over soon, with the release of the last book in November."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I have read all the series books up to this one. There was just enough plot variation to keep me going in this time. But I must admit the series is wearing thin on me.But even more wearing is the author's need for an editor. I believe that it's difficult for authors to see their own bad habits. That's why there are editors. And I think Penguin/Viking Books has failed Karon in this area. Karon has a habit of repeatedly using little turns of phrase that were maybe cute once or twice, but after dozens of uses they are just annoying.In a couple of the previous books, the phrase that really stood out to me was \\"..., meaning it.\\" For example, on p.373 of this book, \\"'I'm sorry,' [Father Tim] said, meaning it.\\" Sincerity is a valued characteristic in these books and in life. But there must be various ways of describing it. When that phrase keeps turning up, I am no longer struck by the character's feelings, but by my own annoyance.In this book the description that came up so often I gritted my teeth every time I saw it was: \`thumped down.' I didn't count, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was used as many fifty times. People \`thumped down' on chairs, benches, sofas etc so many times I was wondering if anyone had a sore butt.I like Karon's community that she dreamed up. I loved her first book. Series fans will no doubt be offended by my opinion, but I think she needs to take a break for her own creativity's sake."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I very much enjoyed the first few books in this series, but it seems that the author had written herself out, alas, and had nothing much more worthwhile to say. This seventh offering in the lot is just not worth reading, when there are so many other books out there waiting.For one thing, the author waxes more and more religious with each book. In this volume people are throwing prayers at each other on virtually every page, over the smallest of trifles. It gets a little annoying after a time, annoying and ludicrous. For example, when the bishop has chest pains, his secretary calls Father Tim and asks him to pray for the bishop. The call might have been spent to greater good in finding a competent cardiologist first. Jesus himself admonished his disciples to pray in private without fanfare or show, for those who pray loudest in public \\"have their reward.\\" At various times Tim does remind himself to pray the prayer that always is answered: Thy will be done. Asking God to change his laws or abrogate the laws of nature feels wrong to me. Prayer and dogma get in the way of the story and weaken this novel to a great extent. That the prayers are answered in fiction is a matter of the writer stacking the cards that way.Secondly, while I'm sure some readers are much taken with Dooley, I've found him unpleasant and occasionally obnoxious (for lack of better words) since book one. He is no better in book seven. Why Father Tim takes such pleasure from seeing him is beyond me. Dooley is self-centered and thoughtless.My advice to a reader who has not read any of this series would be to stop after book four. There is nothing after that worth one's time."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I feel Jan's books get better with each one.

However, In This Mountain, was a real disappointment in Jan Karon's otherwise delightful series.The storyline was disappointing, the characters weren't as interesting, and Father Tim's depression was way too drawn out. The lengthy religious aspects of the book made it feel as if I was reading a theology book instead of a book for pleasure. I will stick with the seies in the hopes that the next book will move back to Jan Karon's usual excellent work."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Like those cream-filled cupcakes, the Mitford books are addictive, although bad for you and not even tasty.

I strongly recommend this book to family and friends, because of the lightheartedness and touching moments presented alongside the realities of day-to-day living. Set in a small town in the foothills of western North Carolina, the residents of Mitford are guided through their daily lives by Father Tim Kavanagh and his wife, Cynthia. This book, in my opinion, is the best in the Mitford series written by Ms. Karon. Her books bring Christian values and spirituality back to the forefront of adult literature, where they are greatly appreciated in this world today. I enjoy Jan Karon's books because of the homespun small-town characters, the comical and serious situations that can pop up unexpectedly, and the ability of the characters to persevere through their trials. For your best summer read at the beach or in the mountains, please take In This Mountain with you. Read it and enjoy what life and God have to offer in a small town!"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"I know that many readers are going to disagree with this review, but I felt I had to say that IN THIS MOUNTAIN by Jan Karon is not her best work. While reading this novel, I felt, over and over again, that Karon came \\"back to Mitford\\" because her readers demanded it, not because she was full of inspiration to continue the storyline. I closed the book the other night feeling as if I were reading a religious/inspirational piece. Will librarians place it on those shelves? They should. There is no fire in the relationship between Cynthia & Father Tim, that I could see, but I was delighted as everyone else to see what has happened to Dooley and the rest of Mitford since the last time we visited. I know, in order to write these particular books, and have overcome such stupendous odds in life, Jan Karon has to be one of the nicest people the world has ever produced, but I'm sad that this book is ho-hum. Will I buy another in this series, if there ever is one? OH, YES. I can't lose my old friends."},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"It is always easy to love the townfolk of Mitford and desire to live in a place as simplistic and care-free as Mitford. After six novels in the series, though, one would think they would know what to expect from Jan Karon's always loveable Father Tim. Yet, inside In This Mountain, Karon manages to skillfully evolve the character of Father Tim, the faithful shepherd who cheerfully attends to every need of his flock and town. In a turn of events, Father Tim finds himself in a situation where he is ministered to by the town folk who show him deepest sympathy, gracious forgiveness and abundant encouragement. This book restores one's faith in the ability of a person to overcome life's most difficult trials. The text is refreshing in it's language (anyone can read it because there are no foul words) and is wonderfully written. The ending will not disappoint the reader. My advice to you is: read In This Mountain slowly (and try to wait patiently for Jan's next offering!)"},{"Title":"In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)","review":"Simply put, Jan Karon puts a smile in your heart.

There's Cynthia and Barnabas and Dooley and diabetes and Lord's Chapel and Edith and Uncle Billy, et al.She takes life's day to day grind and makes it wholesome, entertaining and delightful.

That's how I have felt about each Mitford book that I have read. Father Tim is like all of us, so human and goes about his life not really realizing how important he is to the people in his life. He sees only his frailities, not all he does and how much he means to his family and friends.I love the way his heart sings when he is around Dooley and although he isn't his birth father, he has been there for the boy through the good and the bad.

The religious message is there, but does not get in the way of the story.

The first part of the story focuses on internal strains that widen into serious cracks in morale and behavior. Long, grueling patrols at sea will do that. The captain himself has not yet been tested in battle and the reader wonders how he will function when his moment comes. When the ship actually engages the Japanese cruisers, flaws and heroes come flying into light of scrutiny. It's quite an epic, from beginning to end.All the Drowning Seas: The Nicholas Everard World War II Saga Book 3"},{"Title":"The Deep Six","review":"I had never heard of Martin Dibner and as usual, picked up this unknown 50's era paperback with some fear of it being a typical shallow WWII action book. Not to worry. The Deep Six, alhtough easy to read, was quite fulfilling as a great WWII war-at-sea piece. Excellent character studies, with plenty of flies in the ointment. I served several years of sea duty (in Cold War submarines), and it's obvious that so did the author (in the WWII environment, obviously).Briefly, this is about an aged heavy cruiser serving in WWII North Pacific. A hazardous mission, an untested captain, and a rather cast-off crew. I dare say that I found this novel to stand near the stature of Wouk's, The Caine Mutiny, or Monsarrat's, The Cruel Sea.Easy to recommend as a great WWII maritime read. I'll look for more of Dibner's work."},{"Title":"Enneagram Movie and Video Guide : How To See Personality Types In The Movies, 2nd Edition","review":"If you are learning the Enneagram or have a keen interest in it, this book is useful in that it provides example Enneagram personalities as they appear in various movies. It also includes relationships between various ennea-types in particular movies and goes to the level of wing type in most cases! This is useful for observing the dynamics of the types in action and in personal interactions. So... if you've been learning about the Enneagram through such books as the WISDOM OF THE ENNEAGRAM by Riso and Hudson, you will find this a fun and fascinating way to reinforce the concepts.My understanding is that at one time there was a trend to use Enneagram information for plotting character development. I have watched many of these movies and based on my knowledge of the Enneagram this appears like it could be true. I have studied the Enneagram as part of a Masters program in Integral Psychology and I use it as a psychological tool in my personal growth coach practice. In other words, I think I'm in a good postition to assess the merits of this book and whether or not it's just a bunch of hype.With all of the positive feedback out of the way, I would also like to mention that this book primarily contains older movies. This may be a drawback for some people, but unfortunately it hasn't been updated recently. I would absolutely love to see a new edition of this with more movies and newer movies. However, the movies that are written up here are done in-depth and by the time you get through some of the better ones they may have a new edition out.This is a must own for fans of the Enneagram. It is well worth the cost and you won't regret buying it and having it handy while your watching movies. Like me, you may also end up watching some good movies that normally you wouldn't have thought of just because of the interesting character dynamics."},{"Title":"Enneagram Movie and Video Guide : How To See Personality Types In The Movies, 2nd Edition","review":"No praise is strong enough for this book. Just the book I was dreaming about, fodder to my hobby horse. Condon's style is easy read, quirky and funny at points and yet digs deep into Enneagram. I like the idea that he is analyzing classics as well as second or third rate flicks if the characterization is relevant. One might argue with his classification in some cases but that's the fun of Enneagram: it's more art than science, there are no cut and dry rules. He often labels the characters tentatively with an -ish suffix (like sevenish, oneish) -- I quite like that, it keeps reminding us how fluid this system is.Most useful is the explanation for the movement or shift of characters within the system along the 142857 and 369 sequences. I always found it a but complicated to figure out why and how stress and lax points work but for the first time it seems pretty obvious.Strongly recommended for Enneagram nuts and movie buffs alike."},{"Title":"Enneagram Movie and Video Guide : How To See Personality Types In The Movies, 2nd Edition","review":"Do you wonder why you can't get along with your father-in-law?

Instead of having complicated questions at the end of every well written chapter, you are tested as you read it. Most tutorials make it too easy to just cut and paste code into your editor and compile and see the results. This does not work with &quot;EJB 2.1 Kick Start&quot;. If you try, you will find your code will never compile. The way to read this book is as follows:1. take a good pen.2. read every page carefully and try to work out the inconsistencies between what the code in the book says, the diagrams that illustrate the code say, the text says about the relation between the two, and what the code from the CD rom or the web site does. You cannot assume that either of those is correct at any one point. Watch out for diagrams that are misnumbered.3. mark these inconsistencies in the margin on the side of the text, with your best guess as to what is correct. Use a pencil, you may need to revise it.4. Try out these guesses by running the application with your attempted improvements.5. It does work, but don't give up too easily. You may need another book, to help you through the difficult passages.You should be able to find an errata on nearly every page. If you do this carefully, you will understand EJB's well, and you will also be able to use this experience to get a job as editor.One has the feeling that the author sent a preview version of his book to the editor, who then sent it immediately to be printed. Their web site has no errata for this book.I was thinking of putting one up myself, but then that would make it too easy for you cheaters... :-)"},{"Title":"EJB 2.1 Kick Start","review":"I was impressed by author's style in the begining chapters but I gave up after chapter 3 as I could not get the code to work. I could compile the BookBean EJB but I get plenty of errors(for the client code) even after following the instructions verbatim.What's the fun reading the book when you can't run the code?I hope author puts an errata on his website."},{"Title":"EJB 2.1 Kick Start","review":"I purchased this book because of reviews I read about it. I thought it would be perfect! That was until I went to the publisher's website to download the source code. The UML models were not part of the source code. (Nowhere to be found on the website.) I sent three emails asking where to find them and they have yet been answered for more than a month now. I downloaded the errata for the book. A 45-page pdf file of corrections and omissions for the first 80 pages of the book. I am returning the book for a complete refund."},{"Title":"EJB 2.1 Kick Start","review":"I have been programming in Java for about 4 years, but this is the first year that I have had to do any EJB stuff. I picked up this book because it is short (~370 pages) and has a lot of code snippets. I found it a very good read. It focuses more on the way in which somebody can use EJB, rather than the low-level details of exactly how EJB is implemented.I recommend this book, but I will warn you that you will probably want to pick up a more detailed reference manual to go along with this tutorial-style book."},{"Title":"EJB 2.1 Kick Start","review":"This book looked very good in the bookstore. It appeared to give a complete set of EJB examples for both the Sun reference EJB server and BEA Weblogic 7.0.Unfortunately it doesn't carry out it's promise on either count. The book gives a good overview on how to configure Weblogic to run the examples, and it is only when you download the examples zip file that you discover that the Weblogic-specific deployment descriptor files aren't anywhere in the download. That would be enough to make it a 3 or a 4 star book, but then I tried running through the examples under the J2EE reference server, which the book is really meant to cover. First I discovered some minor problems with the code, no big deal. But then the first example (Chapter 3) will simply not work. At all. No matter what I did it would throw a naming exception. An email to the publisher (Sams) brought only an offer for a refund, but no satisfaction. I spent 2 days trying to make this work, and no dice.Very sloppy work both on the part of the author and (particularly) on the part of the publisher (Sams). I've now been through two of their books and neither was complete. I'm beginning to believe that Sams may deliberately publish bad books. After all, if the first book solves your problem then they cannot sell you another?"},{"Title":"EJB 2.1 Kick Start","review":"This book is highly repetitive and focuses way too much on a single example project throughout the book. Instead of starting off with an overview about the technology and iteratively getting more detailed, information is organized almost like an API spec. The first few chapters were written in an interesting and exciting manner, but it was disappointing beyond that."},{"Title":"EJB 2.1 Kick Start","review":"I had high hopes for this book when I found it. Like most others, I gave up after 3 chapters. I found too many defiencies in the code in the book so I downloaded the source from the publisher. That helped, then I found the classpath explained in the book had left out several items. Finally figured out the classpath issues, and got the code to compile fully, but was unable to deploy due to other defiencies so I gave up.Some good points... It does explain EJBs well, just not how to deploy them properly. The exploration of UCs should benefit anyone. And it does show how to use deploytool, for whatever that is worth"},{"Title":"EJB 2.1 Kick Start","review":"Hello,The book is easy to read. I used it to do the project at work with EJB entityBeans. I also use Web Logics there, and this book uses the Sun EJB server, so I had to refer to the Web Logics documentation too. I do recommend this book, though, because it explains EJB in a simple way."},{"Title":"EJB 2.1 Kick Start","review":"Although there were a number of infavourable comments regarding the source code that accompanies the book, I feel that the concepts explained in the book are very practical and easy to be grasped.Therefore, in my humble opinion, this edition of the book appeals more to software architects than source-code seekers."},{"Title":"EJB 2.1 Kick Start","review":"I liked this book very much. It is just right for my level of EJB experience (beginner). I like the author's way of taking the reader through the entire development process from &quot;good idea&quot; to finished product."},{"Title":"Beauty & the Beasts (Harlequin Superromance No. 758)","review":"I loved this book. It is not like most of the other romances I've read and it definantly wasn't really mushy. I would have to say some of the situations in this book are common in real life. Janice Kay Johnson's descriptions about certain things make you feel like you're there and you're one of the main characters. I would naturally read this book again and again over a period of time of course. But I really liked it because I used a lot of description and it doesn't leave you hanging at the end which is really nice. I also really like this book because I love to read and if I can't get stuck in the book it bugs me. And I had a problem putting the book down after I got into it.This is by far one of the best romances I have ever read."},{"Title":"Ballyhoo Buckaroo & Spuds","review":"Ever browse the Oxford English Dictionary just for fun, especially for the parenthetical information about the origins of words?

So can misinformation. People hear a plausible and entertaining story about a word's origin and share it with others -- without bothering to check its validity.

It looks as though they reduced the size of perhaps an original hardback book, including the type size, making for a sleazy cheap-feeling paperback. The font is a bit too small and light for comfortable reading, and the quality of the paper seems really poor with a yellow cast. Ordinarily I like paperbacks because they are lightweight and easy to hold. But I find this book to be physically annoying to read."},{"Title":"Ballyhoo Buckaroo & Spuds","review":"This book is an interesting read, but not one that can lead to or even help toward to mastery of the subject (etymology).

Finally, Fiennes agrees to meet.The result is a fast-paced, international, from-top-to-bottom of society, violent, non-fiction thriller about a man avenging the deaths of his wife and daughter. This has all the elements of man against man, man against himself, and man against nature.A man awakes in hospital beaten severely without his memory. As he searches for his memory, he happens to foil the robbery of a hooker. To show her appreciation, since he has no home, the hooker takes him in.She introduces him to her associates. They are a Bible-studying, drug-dealing family in an English slum. He discovers he has a talent with numbers. He works for the associates and he ends up making them a lot of money and becoming part of their family. The family is an odd collection which even includes a former Irish terrorist. The family even runs a very successful drug rehab center. So, the man is dodging police and rival gangs.As he regains his memory, he realizes that his wife and daughter were murdered. As more of his memory returns, he identifies the men who killed his wife and daughter.But, the passion that drives him to revenge is being tempered by his newly-discovered love for the prostitute.Yet, he decides that he still must follow his path of revenge. The family provides all the extra muscle he requires.Then, he becomes the hunter.But, the hero is not a superman. He does some things well. He is also fallible enough to be real.And, after he becomes the hunter, he makes mistakes ... costly mistakes. He, the family, and the prostitute are then the counter-targets.In the background is an amazing tapestry of BCCI and one of its major players who was involved in the murder of the man's family.I highly recommend ...WARNING: Sir Ranulph Fiennes seems to write books that only last a few days and may cause loss of sleep and may cause use of sick days."},{"Title":"The Sett","review":"The author doesn't let the almost complete absence of verifiable facts get in the way of a very far fetched yarn.

Without it being true, this book is a waste of time. The situations that \\"our hero\\" gets into as the \\"story\\" evolves just keep getting more and more unbelievable. Maybe the author, Fiennes is beyond reproach in the UK, but I think he has done a bad job of pulling the wool over our eyes in trying to pass off soso fiction as truth."},{"Title":"The Sett","review":"Ranulph Fiennes, who wrote the Feather Men and The Secret Hunters writes an intriguing, true story. A man and his family accidentally stumble onto a Sett, which is a dog fight. The man's family is killed and the man survives with some brain damage. During his quest to find his family's killers, he finds an evil network of international drug and weapon dealers. What makes the dealers especially loathesome is their love of watching animals fight. Dogs against dogs or several dogs against a declawed and de-fanged bear. Even amongst criminals, the main character meets kind and compassionate people. One group deals in soft drugs, to raise money to help hard drug users detox. He also meets a young prostitute, who nurses him to health and offers him honest love.I liked the book's commentary on how the cold war kept some crime in check and how the fall of the iron curtain unleashed a wave of destruction throughout the western world.If you can get passed the cruelty of the criminals, you can give yourself an insightful glance at the violent world of international crime.Doug Setter, author ofOne Less Victim: A Prevention GuideandStomach Flattening"},{"Title":"God's Guidance Through Poetry","review":"This is a beautiful book of poems!

One of my art professors compared what I was doing to her work and I have since become a nicely obsessed student of everything she did and I read everything I can get my hands on.This book is one of the best. First of all, I didn't have to get out my German lexicon and second, the narratives that go along with the many pictures are full of detail that you don't get in the smaller books. One of the major improvements that you will see is in her work, \\"Woman with Dead Infant.\\" In many books it appears that the woman's face is melting in to the child, but in Prelinger's narrative, you see much more detail of the nude, vulnerable woman and her child with little covering up his bones.She has many works-- mostly lithographs-- in colour, which is a delight after havimg only seen her work in other books as black and white.One of her works, \\"Man Kneeling before a Female Nude\\" shocked me by it's erotic overtones, just as \\"Self Portrait en face, Laughing\\" shocked me with it's joy.Kollwitz was very much a versatile artist and this book shows that. Any fan of Kollwitz will appreciate the narratives that go with the pictures, and for anyone who isn't a fan-- this book will make them fans!"},{"Title":"Kathe Kollwitz","review":"Kollwitz's lithographs captivate any feeling viewer. Until there's some way to render raw emotion on paper, especially the many different sorrows of war and poverty, her monochrome lithos approach that goal most closely. That makes it easy to forget her mastery of other media and other feelings, too. This book broadens a reader's view of this wonderful artist.The cover image, \\"Female Nude with Green Shawl,\\" starts to break the reader free from the easy stereotype of Kollwitz. It adds color to her commonly dark palette, and presents a simple celebration of womanly elegance. \\"Self-portrait laughing\\" and \\"Lovers\\" show that she could not only express joy, but depict different kinds of it. Woodcuts, etchings, charcoals, ink and wash, and wonderful pastels each display her drawing ability in different ways. \\"Tower of Mothers,\\" \\"Mourning Parents,\\" \\"Lovers,\\" and other sculptures show her skill in bronze, granite, and plaster. Kollwitz's skills range far beyond what she's best known for, and this book helps us appreciate the breadth of that ability.Given so many reproductions of her work, lovingly printed on bright, dense paper, a reader like me becomes easily distracted away from the helpful and informative text of the book. Three long essays, a catalog, timeline, and bibliography invite the reader to various kind of commentary, both in historical fact and in considered opinions. Her personal story as woman, mother, and artist as well as her work deserve attention; this gorgeous volume is a wonderful way to give her work and life some of the attention they deserve.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Quien como Dios","review":"Quien Como Dios is a beautiful reflection of Mexican life in the 19th century as seen through the eyes of Soledad, a young woman boxed in by the rules of criollo society and the Church. The novel flows through a language full of \\"mexicanismos\\" that brings the text alive. I had the pleasure of meeting Eladia Gonz&aacute;lez, and through this book the reader meets her family.

As the three girls get their first taste of 10th grade, they realize that sticking together is tough. Soon it's clear that boys, queen bees and classes are not what they're cracked up to be. Still, everything would be fine if the girls still had each other. But when Maddie makes a huge mistake that the whole school is talking about, Zoe gets in a bad situation with a flirty teacher, and Angela's \\"boyfriend\\" sends her into the dumps, the girls get into fight after fight. Will this huge bag of drama settle down eventually, or will the madness never end?Ttyl was an overall fun read. I enjoyed how the author shared events through aim messages, but there were some times when the author might have actually written an event firsthand, not as \\"Maddie told Zoe\\". Also, drama after drama made teenage girls look bad, and I felt pretty embarrassed that this was the author's portrayal of the average teenage girl.

While the style of the writing is now, which would lend one to think that it won't be popular in thirty years, the teenage girls are, by and large, the same as teenage girls were when I was one thirty years ago, which makes it a classic sort of story to me. Moreover, I find similar characters, though not similar circumstances (obviously), in the writings of Jane Austen. This isn't the downfall of our culture, it's a picture of it; and it isn't just a picture of America today, it's a picture of teenage girls whenever and wherever they live."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"Ttyl was one of the best books I've ever read- and it's also really easy to relate to.

Told entirely in IM messages, this book is a book teenage girls, adults, and even boys would definitely enjoy.This book is about 3 girls, Angela, Zoe and Maddie who are going through high school. Although they're best friends, they start having problems all girls would go through. They talk to each other everyday on the internet and they try to solve each one of their problems. They help each other with everything, from boys, to teachers, to homework. They start to do things they would later regret, but its nothing best friends can't help. At the end, someone does something she would later regret and she takes it out on her other two best friends. Someone also does something she doesn't want to do and the other two girls rush to the girl's rescue and they get the other girl out of her sticky mess.Ttyl is just like Snail Mail. Instead of letters though, they talk through IMs. If you loved Snail Mail, then you should definitely read this. It's a little bit more mature because the girls are high school, but its nothing too bad, and it's far funnier.This book is very realistic and most girls would relate to it. Out of 5 stars, I would gladly give it 4 stars because even though it was great in the middle and the end, the beginning was a little boring. I would without doubt recommend this book to you.

I love how the author stayed true to the form of teenaged chatting by not skimping on the topics and language used, and uses the shorthand of IM-land.

I have read it about twelve times and still find the same drama as realistic and hilarious as the first time I read it. Some of the drama is probably very unrealistic, but it still adds up to be a great book. Written in I.M.s this book is about 10th grade high school for any average high school student. The three main characters, Maddie (madmaddie), Zo (zoegirl) and Angela (snowangel), get in the midst of high school drama. Maddie gets in trouble at a party and it's around the whole school in ten minutes, and it almost ruins her reputation. Good girl Zo gets on with their high school English teacher.

I would rate this book a ***** because it relates to what I am today.I like TTYL because it uses words and phrases like brb, h/o, g2b, and ttyl. I also like it because it gets a lot of teenagers to read it. TTYL tells a lot about girls' and their difficulties in a sophmoore year. The main characters (Maddie, Zoey, and Angela) talk a lot about guys, family, personal problems, and boyfriends. TTYL is a great book and I incourage anyone no matter how old you are to read it.I gave TTYL a five star (*****) rating because it is just as I am a teenager with problems of boyfriends, and guys.

It's a great concept - and something that its audience can relate to. However, it barely scratches the surface of the potential that the format could have. Although it feels a bit realistic, it almost feels like there's too much energy focused on the \\"plot\\", and not enough on, you know, what people actually talk about over IM.The ending feels rushed - not everything gets completely resolved, and it almost feels like a deux ex machina. Not a very good book."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"After the first few pages of TTYL I put the book down and rang up my 20 something school teacher daughter to corroborate or correct Myracle's use of current teenage girl talk. \\"Yes, Dad,\\" she assured me, \\"thirteen year old girls know about and talk about that kind of stuff.\\" Shocked but somewhat relieved by this confirmation from someone I respect who is much closer to the teenage scene than I am, I read on. What a delightful read it was! Maddie, Snow Angel and Zoe couldn't be closer if they lived together. They share pain, pleasure, and intimate thoughts and come up with ways to help each other through difficulties. Don't get hung up on the sex talk. Sex is NOT the theme of the book. Friendship is."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"My daughter received this book. Of course she enjoyed the style the book is written in (texting). My youngest daughter, 12, requested the other book in the series, \\"ttfn\\". I was going to order it (in fact, I did order it, but the wrong book was sent, and I returned it). Thank God I did. I started reading the reviews when a negative one caught my eye. I then realized quite a few people gave it one star. Every last review spoke of the amount of cursing and smut written in a book that is geared at 13 to 17 year olds. Some parents said they weren't prudish, but the sexual things and language written in the book were too much for even them. One mother said her 12 year old daughter asked her (from reading it in Ms. Myracle's book) what a sexually explicit term meant. In ttyl, check out the pages 10 and 11 for more sexually explicit terms. Please understand this type of thing is the tip of the iceberg. This made me go back to the original book, \\"ttyl\\". The nastiness starts on page 2. PLEASE GO LOOK OVER THE PAGES Amazon allows you to review and read it. Page 2 begins a discourse on some girl who needs to shave her private areas (not the words used by the author, I kept it clean), and refers to her as having a pelt, and how this girl's father, in a drunken state, tells her that the girl forgot to mow her lawn. Yes, every curse word you DON'T want your children to use is there for the reading. Ms. Myracle said she remembers her high school days and best friends well. Unfortunately, they sound like little sluts. Thank goodness for some of the teenage girls who wrote scathing reviews saying this book did not resemble them and they were offended by it. Bravo for them. Incredibly, the back of the book says Ms. Lyracle holds an MF in Writing For Children And Young Adults From Vermont College. Appalling that she chooses to include smut in her books geared at teens. Someone said it was a Sex In The City for teens and it is. One parent suggested the books be rated due to the high level of cursing, sexual scenario's, adult type situations, etc., that is portrayed in these books. Another \\"teacher\\" said it was a terrible idea to rate, and a slippery slope. Actually, the slippery slope is what passes for literary works for young people, and sanctioned in many public schools, without any type of check or balance. Your kids can't pray to God in school, but they can certainly fill up on as much amoral junk as possible. This may explain why many parents now opt to home school. The mother in favor of rating did not say to ban the book. We rate movies from G to X, we rate video games from E to Adult, and these books that show up in schools and are being advertised in children's sections of bookstores need to say on the front, \\"STRONG SEXUAL SITUATIONS/ LANGUAGE\\". Then they can be moved to the adult reading section, where they would make decidely less money, since the texting look would not appeal to many adults. Kirkus Reviews is quoted saying for this book it is \\"Perfectly contemporary.\\" NOT FOR MY KIDS.****PARENTS*** Please look through this book and others by this author. At least know what you are letting your children read. I am throwing out the current copy of \\"ttyl\\" that is in my house. IF I CAN'T EVEN QUOTE THE TEXT DUE TO LURID SPEECH, why would I let my young teenagers read that? See the reviews received for \\"ttfn\\" and the others in her series.

You never know what little things can spread a friendship farther apart.One of the reasons i liked this book is because it is so realistic. Some of the reasons why it is realistic is because it is in all IM chat form, it is about teenage girls who get too involved with boys, and it shows how boys can get inbetween the things that matter the most. Another reason i liked this book is because it brought out each girls personality just by their screen names, font and font color, which even makes the book more realistic.Over all, \\"TTYL\\" was a very good book, which made me realize that friendship is more important then boys, and i should never let a guy get inbetween what matters the most in life."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"This has to be the best book i've ever read! It really is like real life. There is a lot of swearing in it so it may not be appropriate for some but that just makes it even more realistic i would definatly recomend this book to all!"},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"While in Chapters one day when I was in grade 10 I picked this book from the shelf at Chapters and went \\"really? A book completely in IM?\\" I had to read a few lines to see how bad it would be... and ended up reading a few chapters of it and buying the book. Since then I've finished the whole series and enjoyed them.If you're a lazy reader like me (I lose interest fast and don't like lengthy descriptions) this book will likely be a good fit for you. I've also read Myracle's novel \\"Shine\\" and I have to say one of her biggest strengths is her pacing; I am a VERY reluctant reader but she manages to keep me flipping pages, and is always an easy and entertaining read.I liked the three characters and though the drama may be over the top compared to real-life high school, so what? That is the point of books and tv shows about high school, they play up the drama to make it interesting. Overall it was a fast-paced, interesting read and has made me a fan of Lauren Myracle :)"},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"For grades 8-10?

Apparently our local library had this book mislabeled and my 12 year old daughter checked it out, thinking the cover was cutsie and that it would be an entertaining read. I was able to intercept at page 14 and wish I would have gotten there sooner.If you want your child reading about shaving pubes, drinking alcohol and flirty teachers, then this book is for you. If you want to talk to your child about the things they go through as kids and how to handle situations (like a flirty, perverted teacher) then you should probably pass on this. If you want to have an actual conversation about the reality of alcohol and teens, then do it yourself and don't let this author (if you want to call her that) do the teaching for you. While adult topics have their place to be written about and discussed, in the youth section at the middle school library is not the place.I know as parents, we should not be naive about the realities and pressures our children face, but for me to let an author make light of things like a student-teacher relationship is not the best way to handle these things.I felt strongly enough about this as a dad that I called our library, let them know the book would not be coming back, and dropped off a check to replace the cost of the book. Maybe they will use that money to buy some real literature for our children to read."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"Lauren Myracle's novel ttyl is very dramatic but at the same time touching. The protagonists Maddie, Zoe, and Angela are in there sophomore year of high school. They vow that nothing will separate them even dealing with boy's temptations, dealing with teachers, mean girls, and lots more. Throughout the story I didn't know whether or not they were going to make it through this high school year.I enjoyed this book a lot because I found it a page turner. I didn't want to put it down and I am not a person who really likes to read but because the book reflects my life I liked it. Everyone I know has school, friends, and family problems, just like Angela (SnowAngel) Maddie (mad maddie), and Zoe (zoegirl). I think Lauren Myracle did a brilliant job with imagery. For example when Angela was describing what Rob wore on there first date it was described like this \\"a moab shirt on top of a long-sleeve shirt\\" and I felt like I knew exactly what he was wearing. It almost feels like I was right their in their lives dealing with their problems but I was really just sitting down reading. I think anyone who really doesn't like to read would love this book because it's written like an instant message. All American teenagers today know instant message! I really like how Lauren Myracle wrote her story using instant message format. One thing I didn't like about the book was I didn't like the ending. It didn't resolve anything that I thought it was going to. But all in all this is a really good book. I think any teenager would like it.

TTYL is about three best friends, Angela, Maddie, and Zoey. These girls are all going through changes in their life, but the hardest thing right now is trying to survive high school drama. The drama all started on Halloween with Maddie and her \\"new\\" friend Jana. Jana took Maddie to her brother's frat party and let's say, things just didn't go Maddie's way that night. Also, in the book, Zoey falls in love with her teacher, Angela and her boyfriend have a dramatic brake-up, and Maddie gets a new boyfriend.The TTYL characters are very interesting. Angela is a major drama queen, she makes such a big deal out of everything, and she always has to have the perfect outfit. Her importance in TTYL is that she helps to get Maddie out of her sticky situation. Maddie is more of the loner in the group, she always gets mad at people. Maybe that's why her screen name is \\"MadMaddie\\". Maddie is important because without her there wouldn't be any drama at all and the book would be boring. Now Zoey is the calm one and the good girl. She has to always calm Angela and Maddie down. She almost never gets into trouble, but at times she can be very sneaky about what she is doing. Jana, on the other hand, is the mean girl in the high school. Then, all of a sudden she and Maddie become friends and that causes a lot of the drama. Jana is the one who really gives the story its tuning point.I recommend this book TTYL, because I thought that it was a lot like what middle school drama is about. I also like this book because it is realistic fiction. It sends a message out to girls, that no matter how mad you are at someone, you will always care about them. When I read this I just couldn't put it down. This book is a good page turner, because of all of the exciting events in it, but I'm not going to tell you them. I say that I do connect with Zoey and Angela because it's hard to try to be on one side of your friends when there are three of you, and a lot of the time I find myself trying to calm down my friends too. So if you have problems with school, friends, boyfriends, or people that just drive you crazy, then TTYL is the right book for you."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"This book was amazing.

I found that it was an ok read but being only 13 I expected it to be appropriate... NOT!!!!! The whole book was just curses, dirty words, and waayyy inappropriate decisions. To give you some examples: One teacher begins flirting with one of the girls and the girl does nothing about it, they get drunk, and to top it all off one of them strips in front of a room full of college boys. They even portray risky decisions as fun (ex. one of the girls tries to get them to change the speed limit by blocking all the lanes with her friends. They go at the exact speed limit and don't stop even when people are honking, cursing, and threatening to crash them off the road.) and embarrass their friend because of her decisions to believe in God and go to church. People who are a little older may enjoy this (I doubt it) but for tween/early teen readers don't waste your time... trust me."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"Written in typical tween/teen speak, the main characters seem more like they are in middle school rather than high school sophomores. Ms. Myracle's writing style (instant messages) makes for an easy read, but I found myself stumbling over some of the language. I am familiar with all of the acronyms used in the book, but it makes for some very choppy writing. The story line is definitely relatable to tweens and teens, but I think even they might find themselves getting annoyed with the poor grammar and spelling used in the messages.Telling the story of the characters' sophomore year of high school, we are introduced to Madigan (Maddie), Angela and Zoe who are as typical as any tenth graders I've ever met.One thing that bothered me when I was reading was that the characters were constantly pitting themselves against one another. It seemed like someone was always upset with someone else. For a group that was supposedly best friends, they sure had their share of fights. I'm not saying that friends, even best friends, don't fight, but it seemed like someone was mad at someone else over something inane every other day. I also got the feeling, although they never come right out and say it, that the girls were good friends with some of the secondary characters (Jana, Terri, Tonnie) in elementary school and now that they're big high school people the main characters are getting shafted.As I read the book, it got more and more far-fetched. I don't disagree that the events of the book don't happen in real life, but in the average high school sophomore's world, these things don't happen. Or maybe they do. It's been a long time since I was in high school, but I don't remember anyone I knew ending up a frat party or in a hot tub with their English teacher.There are two more in the series, but I'm not sure I want to suffer through them. It bothered me that the parents were on the periphery - sometimes I felt like the girls didn't even have parents. Zoe was the one with the most concerned parent and even that was only mentioned two or three times (and only in relation to their potential road trip. I would also like to note that in the end, of course, everything gets tied up in a neat little package.With regard to the banning of this book, it makes sense that it was banned. There are references throughout to sex, drinking, and drugs. I think the book should be used as an avenue for discussion. If my child wanted to read it, I would read it with her so that we could talk about the situations that arise. I think, especially today, kids are much more savvy than they were even five years ago and they encounter situations like this at younger and younger ages. I see the kids when I teach at my synagogue and they know way more than I did when I was their age. But I also think there's more of a disconnect, in some cases, between the parents and the kids. Many parents are very involved in their children's lives, whereas others leave their children to live as they please. I don't want to turn this into a debate about parenting because I am not a parent and can't make a case.I can't think of anyone I'd recommend this book, too, other than maybe a 7th grader (and even that would be questionable, given that it's unsuited to the age group it was written for, which I would assume is 7th and 8th graders)."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"Parents should be strongly cautioned about allowing young girls to read this book.

The profanity throughout the book was unnecessary. I would have a difficult time justifying it to an irate parent who might complain about the explicit language. In addition to the language, the plot of the book was slow. The conflicts of each character did not fully surface until the last 40 pages of the book.

Abrams2004205 PagesAre you into instant messaging, going to parties, talking about boys, and reading about other teenagers lives, if so then pick up this book and read it. Lauren Myracle tells the story of TTYL (means talk to you later for internet-speaking). She tells this story by only using instant messages between three friends. Angela whose screen name is SnowAngel, Maddie whose screen name is MadMaddie, and Zoe whose screen name is ZoeGirl. These three girls call themselves the \\"Winsome Threesome\\". They are just starting there sophomore year of high school, every night they all three get online and re-cap all of the events that happened during the day.This book takes place on the computer because it is all in instant messaging, but the girls talk about school, sports, gas stations, parties they have been too, and driving. Zoe is smart and fairly innocent, she is very dedicated to her schoolwork, and she is very interested when her twenty-four-year old English teacher starts to invite her to church and other church events. All Maddie wants is to be accepted by the preps (the popular kids). Maddie is very insecure about herself and she actively try to get the attention of the most popular girl in school, Jana. Angela is definitely the social butterfly out of the three. She hops from boyfriend to boyfriend and as always she's sure that the current guy is, \\"The one\\". Occasionally they are split apart by fights and misunderstandings but the three girls manage to stick together through all the fun times and the heartaches of high school life.This book includes discussions about sex, so I recommend this book to teenagers or adults. This book kept me up late at night, because I always wanted to know what would happen next so I would never stop reading. I'm really praying for a sequel of this book. This book is really trying to tell us that as we grow up, we learn that even the one person that wasn't supposed to let us down probably will. You'll have your heart broken probably more than once, and it's harder every time. You'll break hearts too, so remember how it felt when someone broke yours. You'll fight with your best friends and maybe even fall in love with them. You'll blame a new love for something that an old on did. You'll cry because time is passing too fast and you'll eventually lose someone close to you. So this book is telling you to take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like you've never been hurt, because every sixty seconds you spend angry or upset is a minute of happiness you'll never get back."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"TTYLLauren MyracleAmulet BooksHave you ever had a friend that you are really close to that you would do anything for? Well in the book TTYL , by Lauren Myracle, you can experience this feeling while reading the instant messages that three best friends have been writing to each other. The three friends are just starting the tenth grade and are all very different. There is Angela, who is jumping from man to man throughout the year. Then there is Maddie who is still trying to find herself and her friends. And last but not least, Zoe gets herself caught up with a flirty, religious teacher. The \\"Winsome Threesome,\\" as they call themselves, have to go through many hardships this year, from boys, to mean girls, to flirty teachers. How can these best friends survive a year in high school when they don't even know themselves?These three girls are so close but are so different too. Angela is a protagonist for the group, she always reminds them how much they really love each other even when they are mad. She is fifteen years old and is quite pretty and she definitely knows it. She is very girlie and thinks hard about every outfit she will wear. Angela loves men and all throughout this book she is trying to find what kind of man she wants. Maddie is the oldest of the group and is definitely the antagonist. She is sixteen years old and is trying to find who her friends really are. She is the rebel of the group; she tries many different things to rebel against society. She is pretty but doesn't really care about what she looks like or what she wears. All throughout the book she finds herself getting into a lot of trouble. Zoe is the calmest person in the whole group, but she herself is not sure of what she wants to do or who she wants to be. She goes from rebellion to religion through the book. Zoe falls for many tricks played by a teacher and goes a little farther than she thought she should. She is always worried about her friends and thinks of them before herself.TTYL is the first book of a series. After reading this one you will want to read the others such as the book TTFN. This is a fantastic book for all teenaged girls. It has fun and it teaches many life long lessons. It is also a book about friendship and will warm the hearts of all teenage girls.

For some reason (probably random selection) the local library had pulled ttyl from the shelves and propped it up for display. The cover is cutish and the inside cover description sounded different so checked it out.The first few pages start off OK but quickly degenerate. For one thing, it's not very realistic. Even if you're really quick with your thumbs no one is going to type such verbose IM/SMS/text messages. And don't HS girls have other topics besides boys and creepy old teachers and sex? Maybe the author did develop the characters deeper than that, but I don't know because after about 25 pages I chose to use my time reading more worthy material. To each his own, I guess."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"At first, I was a bit wary of these books - I didn't think the unusual format would work. I thought it would be impossible for the reader to get enough information about the plot and the characters only from IMs without the conversations seeming forced (it wouldn't have been very realistic if the author had made the characters explain every situation they were in, even if the person they are IMing already knew about it). However, Lauren Myracle made it work!She managed to give the reader just enough information for them to understand what happened, without making the conversations seem stilted. Sometimes one of the two IMers didn't know what happened, so it was easy, but other times Lauren Myracle thought of clever ways to integrate what happened into the natural flow of the conversation.The plot, while not the most original, portrayed teenage life realistically - most of the problems the three main characters had were problems every teenage girl knows - guy trouble, fights between friends, mean girls, gossip, etc.What I liked most about the book were the characters. I thought it would have been problematic to portray the characters only with dialogue and without any sort of description, but it worked perfectly! Each of the characters had a distinct voice and I could imagine them easily. All three of the main characters were easy to relate to. Even though Angela's whining was annoying at points (more in ttfn and l8r, g8r than in ttyl), this, too, seemed like a realistic portrayal of teenage characters - because honestly, don't we all have something we're kind of whiny and melodramatic about?The theme (that friendship is the most importatnt thing) was cute, albeit a little overdone at points (Angela and Zoe tell their friends how great they are and how lucky they are to have each other a bit too often for it to seem realistic to me).I guess you could critique that the side-characters were a little cliched and underdeveloped, but it would have been extremely hard to develop them more without ever having them actually appear in the book (it only shows the IMs between the three main characters).''One thing that I think could have made the book better would have been different styles of writing for the different characters. What they said characterized them well, but how they typed didn't. All three of them typed the same way, but I think it would have helped set the characters apart if they used different styles. For example, 'Good Girl Zoe' seemed like she would take the time to write \\"you\\" and \\"are\\" instead of \\"u\\" and \\"r\\", while I don't think Maddie could have bothered to write \\"don't\\", and instead should have left out the apostrophe and written \\"dont\\". That's not that big a deal, though.Overall, it was a cute, fun and enjoyable read that made me laugh out loud at times (especially Maddie was hialrious). No, it isn't deep or meaningful, but I think we all need some fun, fluff reading every once in a while, and if that's what you're looking for, this series is perfect for you!"},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"I picked up this book from the library out of curiosity. ttyl was on the ALA's Top Ten Most Frequently Challenged Book list from 2007-2009 for \\"offensive language, sexually explicit, unsuited to age group.\\" Since it looks like a typical young teen girl book, I wanted to see what all of the fuss was about. Interestingly, the book, which is about high school sophomores, was published the year I was a high school sophomore.ttyl is written as a series of IMs between three best friends. Maddie is loud and funky- she really wants to be cool and edgy, so she tries to get in good with Queen Bee Jana. Angela is boy-crazy but loyal to her friends. She reminded me of Tina Hakim-Baba from The Princess Diaries. Zoe is a very straight-laced, obedient kind of girl who is unsure how to respond to attention from her young English teacher. She is also curious about the Christian group at her school, and she experiments with faith and religion.The book was exactly what I expected- the crazy actions of high school girls, mixed with drama and tension between the friends. The book contains cursing and vulgar language, but not as bad as the language online when I was in middle school. The sexual content is not explicit, although one scene where Maddie recounts her visit to a frat party might be shocking to a sheltered girl, like her friend Zoe, whom she tries to hide what happened from. Basically, this book was a pretty realistic picture of what high school can be like.The dynamics between the friends were believable- they get jealous, love each other, and bicker about stupid stuff. Their voices were authentic- I felt like I knew these girls. They didn't say \\"lol\\" as much as I know my friends and I did and still do online- I actually can't find any \\"lol\\"s just flipping through.I'm opposed to book banning in general, but I especially don't see why this was banned except because it was so popular and some girl wasn't subtle enough... I always kept books my mom wouldn't like in my room, or I hid them under things so my mom wouldn't randomly see them and decide to read them to get in touch with teenagers. Whatever.Bottom line, this book was fun but not particularly groundbreaking- I'd recommend it for light reading, or to get a young teen girl involved in reading. I don't think I'll be reading the other books in the series right now- I wish I had read this in high school, because I think I would have loved it back then!"},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"I bought this book for my 15 year old niece.

In my opinion anyway, which I am not going to force upon you. However, I would like to provide my reasoning for why I disagree with the majority of the more recent reviews on this book, TTYL.I read this book when I was in the sixth grade, and it has remained one of my favourite books. People complain that there is no plot, but allow me to explain: the plot is that of a teenager's life. It's not like Harry Potter or Twilight or the Hunger Games in the respect that it is simply a book about three friends in high school. However, it simply follows the development of the characters throughout a few years of their lives, throughout all of the trials they experience. It shows them growing up and seeing and trying new things, which is exactly what teenagers do.Another complaint I see is that it portrays teenagers in a negative light of cursing, rebellion, unintelligence, and stereotyping, but that could not be any farther from the truth. It does portray teenagers accurately. They make mistakes. They can act silly. But they can also be serious. They have drama. This is also not degrading and stereotyping to teenagers. There is Zoe, the intelligent, school-focused girl who is also a very loyal friend. Then there is Maddie, the very smart but always-up-for-an-adventure girl. She makes some mistakes, but one look at her inner character shows what a remarkable person she is. Lastly, there is Angela, the pretty-girl. She can be a bit absent-minded at times, but she's a very smart and kind girl, who could never hurt anyone if she tried. The characters are very sincere and believable. No person is perfect, so they all have their flaws, their families their issues, so on and so forth.Lastly, I saw people suggesting that the writing style (IMing, or Instant Messaging) is very relevant to today's youth and the way that they communicate. This is used a device to explore the characters' personalities. Maddie, the \\"wild child\\" of the bunch, tends to use more shorthand than the others, and curses with more frequency, but that portrays an actual \\"brand\\", if you will, of teenager. Zoe, the witty and well-read one, doesn't capitalize her sentences, but uses and immense vocabulary, showing off her mental capabilities. And then Angela, the bubbly socialite of the group, tends to use little inside jokes of made-up words with her friends, and uses asterisks (*) to express her outgoing tendencies. All three of them type in ways that I can confirm, I myself being a fifteen-year-old girl (using my father's Amazon account, to clear up any potential confusion), teenagers of the present time period do use. It is not showing a lack of intelligence, but a common ground for those which this book is based upon.With high hopes that you all give this book a try,Ellie S."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"Myracle writes with a great deal of energy. Some authors write with so much energy it's overwhelming, but Myracle finds the perfect pitch. There's also a good deal of humor, and I laughed out loud during many parts. She seems to have a good grasp on how teenage girls really speak, and some of her language can be shocking. The girls curse now and then, and there is some graphic sexual language here and there. Alcohol is a factor at one point. For these reasons the book, and the trilogy as a whole, have been among the most challenged books in the country over the past decade. I think Myracle writes the way teenagers really do speak (not all, but many), but parents and other authority figures don't like to admit this. I think teenage girls might find the content enjoyable and relatable.One of the problems with a story told in this format is that you're getting all of the details either before the fact or after the fact. We see the excitement of two girls planning a surprise party for the other, and then we see them talking about it afterward. In a more traditional narrative, the immediacy would have added to the emotional content of the novel, particularly suspense or fear, but in the way it is told, we know nothing truly terrible could have happened, because the girls are fine enough to send instant messages.There aren't very many real conflicts until the last two-thirds of the book, and then the formulaic conflicts come into play: friendships being tested and whatnot. One of these simply does not make any sense, but feels forced, and its resolution comes out of nowhere. I feel conflicted about the way the Mr. H situation is handled. I think Myracle portrays that dilemma with a lot of insight into the psyche of a teenage girl. zoegirl doesn't know if she is being victimized or not, and she begins to blame herself. I've seen this kind of behavior in college-aged girls as well, so zoegirl's dialogue with her friends rings true. Also, her friends realize something isn't right, but are afraid to tell her so, out of fear of harming their friendship. This is the wrong decision to make, but I have no doubt many teenage girls would do this. The book reflects reality, but I believe it would be more helpful to young adults if it reflected the better choice."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"First things first, it is a piece of literature designed to entertain 13-18 year olds. And if it was completely realistic we'd all be bored by the second page. I mean seriously, has anyone on this site looked at reality TV these days? Even the regular ABC family shows are loaded with drama, heartache, backstabbing, and hormonal teenagers. It's part of our culture, it's what sells these days. I myself am in highschool and although my life is no where near as complicated as the characters in this book, I was still able to pull out certain situations in the book and relate them into my life.The problem with people calling this book realistic is that in reality (at least in my experiences) i have never shared that much on an IMing situation. It usually takes place over phone via text or call, or in person. However, the dialect is designed to give the reader as much insight into the characters life as possible.It's a good book to get people into reading, because its entertaining as well as semi-relateable. But as literary significance goes it holds no significance.Ultimately, i would not recommend this for ANYONE under 13, or even 15. As there is a lot of context that is meant for older teens, not preteens. Keep in mind that the characters in this book are in HIGHSCHOOL, not middleschool. And the plot line runs much like a gossip girl show, or a gilmore girls."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"You should probably have figured out by now that this book is written in instant-message format. I know what you're thinking--a whole book full of chatsp33k and shorthand, peppered with unbelievable incidents of ridiculous teenage drama. That was what I expected when I picked up this book.However, TTYL surprised me. Myracle manages to create three vivid and lovable main characters by detailing only their conversations with one another, which is quite a feat. This book is unforgettable, simply because it offers insight into teenage life without being overbearing or unbelievable. The characters are easy to relate to, and in general this is a fun read. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"Lauren Myracle, ttyl (Amulet, 2004)When I first heard about this book, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The very idea of an entire book written in chatspeak offended me. So I had to take a look and see if it was really as awful as I feared.\\"it gets worse. cuz then rob strolls up, and i was like, 'sounds like u had a good time saturday nite. u could have called me, u know.' and tonnie goes, 'he wanted to, but i told him not to.' i said, 'oh yeah, sure,' and rob said, 'really, angie, i was punching in your number and everything, and tonnie said to bag it. She said it would just bum u out to know that we were having such a blast without you.'\\"(p. 45)What really gets me is that in school libraries across the nation, people are challenging excellent books like And Tango Makes Three for \\"promoting\\" homosexuality or Whale Talk from \\"promoting\\" bad language. No one's going after ttyl for promoting chatspeak. We have some really messed-up priorities in this country when people are completely comfortable with horning in on someone else's philosophy, but couldn't care less about their literacy. (zero)"},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"Let me be honest: I picked this book up solely because it's one of the top 10 most challenge books. The style is unique. The novel is written solely in instant message format between three girls who are best friends. There's nothing particularly remarkable about the girls. One is boy crazy, sweet, and upbeat. One is shy and religious. And the other has poor self esteem and a bad attitude. Nothing these girls say is out of the ordinary or all that uncommon. So why all the controversy? I'm going to tell you, but let me first give an alert:SPOILERS: Within the first dozen pages, the girls talk about how one of them overheard two other girls in the bathroom. One of the girls was telling the other one about how one of their supposed friends ejaculates when she orgasms. That's mostly it. That's what the main problem people have with this book. Some tiny piece of gossip that one of the main characters overheard in a high school bathroom stall. Now, there are also mentions of sausages, shlongs, etc in referring to a penis. And one (or possibly two) girls joke about how they want to get their hands on particular boy's penises using those euphemisms. But when it comes closer to being an actual reality, they all shy off of the topic. Just like your average teenage girl, they want to have sex but they're scared to death of actually doing it. The other thing that some might have a problem with is that one of the girls has a crush on a teacher. The teacher seems to have a crush on her. As this becomes more and more apparent to the girl, her crush turns into unease. The teacher invites her to go \\"hottubbing\\" at a house he's housesitting at and she goes. She's afraid of what might happen, but (for some reason) still goes. She's also afraid to tell the teacher she changed her mind. So her friends band together and crash it, making her feel safe and embarrassing the teacher. The other thing that happens in this book is that one girl goes to a frat party with a new friend. The new friend is a bitch and eggs her into drinking too much and dancing on a table. She dances topless while she's drunk. The bitch friend sends pictures of her through email. Yes, these girls make mistakes, but I don't see what the major deal is with this book.Since this is a review of the book, I do want to say that this book wasn't great. It was interesting to see it in a chat message format, but the dialoge fell flat. None of the girls were witty enough to carry a full story based solely on dialoge. I won't be reading any more of these books, but there ya go."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"Is it really any wonder wny teens today are so incapable of dealing with real-life? The publication of a book filled with chatspeak and moronic tween ramblings is further proof of the dumbing-down of America. Why would an author want to publish such a thing? Oh wait... for the money. There's always profit to be made from suckers, right?This (and the rest of the series) is the literary equivalent to McDonalds. It has no nutritional content, is clogging (MCD's - arteries, this book - your brain), and leaves you with nothing fulfilling. Teenagers should be encouraged to explore classic novels, or if they want something new, there's plenty of fun and contemporary authors who actually use grammar AND a plot.Chatspeak was never meant to be a mainstay of language, just as McD's was never intended to become the heart-attack-inducing mainstay of cuisine. Chatspeak is fine if you're on a cell phone or having a quick/private conversation with a acquaintance/friend (because chatspeak certainly isn't meant to be used with your boss, clients, or otherwise in a polite/professional setting), because honestly who wants to type in each letter with your thumb? But like McD's, chatspeak as gone beyond where it should have, and is serving as a detriment to society.If anyone wants to know why so many teens today are the way they are - socially inept, rude, possessing terrible attention spans, all you have to do is look at how they have attached themselves to their cellphones, sidekicks, and computers, and are now seemingly no longer capable of speaking normal English, or thinking beyond their own selfish needs. The plot in this book is almost nonexistent, and I can't believe that parents actually buy this for their kids! I'm just glad that cellphones weren't rampant in highschool when I was attending - back then, only a few teens had cellphones, and there was no Internet capabilities for cellphones yet. Cellphones were used for actually CALLING other people and nothing more, as hard as that may be to believe for you young'uns.This book is also a sad window into what many teens actually do. Not all of them, of course - but so many teens now have their own cellphones and value that more than real-life people or the education they're supposed to be paying attention to in school. I bet many of you have heard the news story of the girl who got a $5000 cellphone bill because she was texting all day in class and her grades plummeted for 2 months as a result. And not to mention 'sexting' where teens don't just send one another pictures of themselves naked or in their underwear, but they also talk about sex - and that happens in this book! Some of the chatspeak in this book is rather explicit, and is not at all appropriate for teens in the first place.Parents, if you value your child's braincells, buy them a puzzle, or a book. Here's a list of recommended reading.Oliver TwistDune20,000 Leagues Under the SeaAnne of Green GablesInterview with the VampireWater for ElephantsHarry PotterA Tree Grows in BrooklynLittle House on the PrairieIf you're a teen, consider the futility of texting. Why waste so much time typing in chatbabble when you could be spending your time doing SOMETHING with your friends in real-life instead ox texting one another? Go to the beach, watch a movie, hang with real people. And in school, pay attention instead of texting under your desk. The teacher might be boring, but you'll be much more prepared for the real world. And learn how to use proper English."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"After a few pages, my 11 yo daughter put the book down with such force that I had to acknowledge it.

However, being a teenager (well, young adult), and talking with several friends on AIM, and forums such as myspace... it's easy to see how true this book his. Hey, you can even go looking around in people's reviews and see people who type reviews looking like this:\\"yea dis wus awesome u shuld get it\\". And it drives me nuts, but if you're looking at how this book portrays the English language... is it really THAT far off? Knowing that you can go to any online forum and find dialogue like THAT taking place? People leave their \\"i's\\" lowercase for goodness sake. What I'm trying to say is, lighten up on how it's written, the book is SUPPPOSED to be written that way--as intended by the author. Although it does arise the question: Can people really communicate this way? The answer this book posses is... yes you can. And while it drives me nuts, I guess I can give it credit because I did understand it.I know several people are going as far as to say it's an atrocity to the English language and all, but the truth is, people on AIM actually DO talk the way presented in this book. Actually, if you can believe it, it's a lot worse. Even some adults on AIM type poorly.I'm not much for AIM, not very fond of it at all. I hate how people don't spell out their words and numbers. I don't like the laziness of it.However, \\"TTYL\\" is NOT an atrocity to the English language. It doesn't influence the language either, but it does show where the downfall has gone. If, however, you consider how many people understood this book, I'd say our language is at an okay standing. Hey, there are plenty of better books written out there, I can tell you that much.But we're not looking at how it's written, we're looking at the STORY, it's what's important. The way it's written is what we call \\"style\\" and the style for this book works.Following the adventures of three high school students, we see how their lives change. Maddie (madmaddie), Angela (SnowAngel), and Zoe (zoegirl) are just now beginning the start of their tenth grade year in high school. The vow not to let all the stupid drama separate them. However, it doesn't seem they'll last as friends by the end of the year. Angela has fallen for a jerky boy, Maddie screws up and the whole school ends up talking about it, while Zoe is constantly flirting with her teacher. Not only that, but you can't mention high school and not mention that there are those preppy bitches, and all around jerks you run into.Recently graduating from high school, I'd say this book hits a few points right on the head. The book, TTYL, if you couldn't tell, is just a book about teenage girls gossiping. There's a lot of drama, and this book gets it across just fine. Now just graduating there were a couple of parts where I couldn't help but say outloud, \\"That's childish!\\" or \\"What's the big deal?\\" But I think that's to be expected of any high school drama book.I was perplexed about how much I learned about the characters and their problems through the use of an instant messanger. I hate the thing to death, but I found myself able to get to know these characters through it. Despite their horrible grammar mechanics and how they were incapable of spelling the word \\"you\\". Ask any of my friends and I don't talk to people who can't spell out their words. However, I was forced to deal when it came to this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It starts off pretty flat, but it does pick up as it goes on. Using the infamous acronyms such as LOL and BRB. I was also impressed that I could really see some of my friends in these roles... everything from the lowercase \\"I\\" to simply saying \\"how r u?\\"It IS sad that instant messengers are like that, I won't lie, but that doesn't mean this book is portraying it wrong. For what it's worth, it's right.I would not recommend this to the younger kids (around ages five to eleven). There's a bit of profane language... but again, to read a high school drama book and not expect that is unrealistic (unless you're nostalgic for the \\"I Love Lucy\\" days) especially in this day and age where even a ten year old will try to cuss you out (I've had it happen when I worked volunteer work at my old elementary school).But aside from the language, the book really is human. The use of instant messenger in this book couldn't be more right. I was rather impressed with how they got the digital world down.If you're one who does like to say it's about nothing but the downfall of the English language, I can only leave with these words: Get an imagination, and realize that not EVERYONE talks like this, but you're bound to run into a few from time to time.The book was fairly well done. On another caution note, boys will probably not like this book. I did, and I am a boy, but others may find it to be too girlish for them (especially if you can't accept the fact that high school is, sad to say, about the gossip!). However, it is a good read, provided you don't take it too seriously as \\"The downfall of the English language.\\"TTYL and cya next review."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"This book serves as a great example of the speed at which technology changes. Published in 2004 and written entirely in instant messenger conversations, it embraces a technology now largely abandoned by the teenagers who made up the audience for ttyl.The story is essentially a high school soap opera, told through the conversations between three tenth grade girls. Angela is the flirty one who's obsessed with making sure she has a boyfriend and willing to interpret the signals from the guy she's set her sights on in the most optimistic possible interpretation. Maddie is a world-wise tough girl who suddenly finds herself faced with the chance to hang with the \\"popular\\" kids. Zoe is the \\"smart one\\" who is coming to terms with her interest in Christianity while she has become the subject of a lecherous teacher's attention.The instant-message format of the story serves both to enhance and limit the narrative. Since most of the conversations take place between only two of the three lead characters, the author is able to build tension as the reader is privy to information that the characters are unaware of or are holding back.At the same time, almost all of the conversations are reacting to events that have already occurred, which can be a bit limiting. The format also limits the supporting cast. I found myself wanting to know more about a number of characters who are only shown through the filter of the three lead characters. Especially interesting was the \\"Queen Bee\\" character. There were a few hints that there was more to her than just the generic villain, but the hints were never quite fleshed out.The tone and flow of the conversations was fun, and the characters are fairly complex. There were lots of little details that came across in the small talk between the girls that kept the story personal and believable. The \\"chat speak\\" isn't particularly difficult to follow. I thought there were a few moments when the characters lost the feel of \\"authentic\\" teenagers, usually because there was plot that needed to be advanced, but for the most part the language flows naturally.The final resolution felt a bit abrupt, but readers who find themselves craving more will be happy to hear that the \\"Winsome Threesome\\" return in a sequel that picks up where ttyl left off."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"I thought this was an interesting concept, as the entire book is written in the form of instant text messages.There are three voices, best friends, Zoe, Angela and Maddie. Each has a different font for ease of reading (you don't even need to look at the screen names, even though they are there), each of the characters has a distinct voice and brings a different set of values and attributes to the story.It is set in high school and revolves around the things you'd expect it to, kids being crap to each other, popularity, boys and friendship.It was a quick read, not a bad one for me (as an adult) and probably a really good one for a tween; it reminded me of what it was like to be that age (15), I guess that is indicative of its success in setting the tone."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"I decided to read this book for a bit of light easy reading and that is exactly what I got.

TTYL is about three best friends, Angela, Maddie, and Zoey. These girls are all going through changes in their life, but the hardest thing right now is trying to survive high school drama. The drama all started on Halloween with Maddie and her \\"new\\" friend Jana. Jana took Maddie to her brother's frat party and let's say, things just didn't go Maddie's way that night. Also, in the book, Zoey falls in love with her teacher, Angela and her boyfriend have a dramatic brake-up, and Maddie gets a new boyfriend.The TTYL characters are very interesting. Angela is a major drama queen, she makes such a big deal out of everything, and she always has to have the perfect outfit. Her importance in TTYL is that she helps to get Maddie out of her sticky situation. Maddie is more of the loner in the group, she always gets mad at people. Maybe that's why her screen name is \\"MadMaddie\\". Maddie is important because without her there wouldn't be any drama at all and the book would be boring. Now Zoey is the calm one and the good girl. She has to always calm Angela and Maddie down. She almost never gets into trouble, but at times she can be very sneaky about what she is doing. Jana, on the other hand, is the mean girl in the high school. Then, all of a sudden she and Maddie become friends and that causes a lot of the drama. Jana is the one who really gives the story its tuning point.I recommend this book TTYL, because I thought that it was a lot like what middle school drama is about. I also like this book because it is realistic fiction. It sends a message out to girls, that no matter how mad you are at someone, you will always care about them. When I read this I just couldn't put it down. This book is a good page turner, because of all of the exciting events in it, but I'm not going to tell you them. I say that I do connect with Zoey and Angela because it's hard to try to be on one side of your friends when there are three of you, and a lot of the time I find myself trying to calm down my friends too. So if you have problems with school, friends, boyfriends, or people that just drive you crazy, then TTYL is the right book for you."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"The author typed 'you' as 'you' when she wrote it, and went through Fin&Replace and replaced all 'you's with \\"u\\".

It's a misrepresentation of over half the teenage community. As easy and fun it would be for me to believe that all teenagers girls like to talk about are sex, boys, bars, and gossip, I don't.

By the end of the book, if you don't love every one of the three friends whose correspondence makes up the book (even with their flaws), you should ask someone else to check to make sure you have a pulse. It's so rare and delightful to find YA novels that employ such an authentic voice for their characters, and the instant-messenger format serves to reinforce the sense that you really are getting an accurate transcript of high school banter. It's surprising (and laughable) to see that this book has been criticized by someone for inappropriate content--the treatment of sexual topics is very, very mild compared to a lot of similar books out there."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"Length:: 5:01 MinsKey points of my review: Great story, great characters, great design.

This book is about three girls who are best friends, and they are currently in the tenth grade. Throughout this whole book are the girls instant messages. Maddie, Zoe, and Angela want to remain friends, all throughout high school. They often get upset about many things, but they always manage work them out. For an example, Zoe and one of the girls teachers have a thing for each other. He always asks Zoe to go to church with him and to all these religious events. Maddie and Angela always pick on her about it and Zoe get very mad and up set. See even though they get mad over stuff they still love to do things together, like this year they are going to try to go on a road trip. They are very excited, but don't know if they all can make it. You will have to read the book to figure out what happens between Zoe and the teacher, and if the girls can all make on their road trip.There are many things that I liked about this book. I liked the fact that it was about teenagers and what they all went through, and I thought it was really neat that the whole story was written in the girls instant messages, but on the other hand I didn't like this book because I got very bored during some parts of the book . Over all it was a pretty god book.I would recommend this book to girls who is between the ages of 14-18 because it's about teenage girls who talk about their love lives, and about their crazy parties that they go to.

It succeeded in that I felt like I was reading the chat transcripts of a bunch of real life teens but I think it's because of that that I was just bored with it. It came complete with its own high school drama and even though I only had the points of view of these three girls, I still felt the anger, the love, the awkwardness and everything else they were feeling. I felt like I was eavesdropping in on their conversations. I just didn't find it particularly interesting. Compelling enough but I'm not rarin' to read ttfn or anything.In terms of banned bookage, of course it's rather insipid. There was a mention of female ejaculation. For shame! A natural bodily function! What's next, farts? And then there was a brother's girlfriend's unshaven muffin popping out of a bikini. That one had me gagging. Respect your fellow man, lady! And you had your token sex talks and swear but no teenage conversation would be complete without those things. An awkward and inappropriate student/teacher relationship was even thrown in too. Apparently the text speak is an issue but I'm not sure how that's even ban-worthy. OMG they're spelling laugh like laff! The horror! When the challengers can speak, write and spell in proper English, then I'll give them some leeway. Until then, they can shut their holes.I don't see anything ban-worthy in this book. If parents are up in arms about female ejaculation, what's next? Denying their daughters information on their periods? Let's not stifle a teen's need to ask questions. Parents are supposed to be there to answer them, not keep them in the dark. They're failing as parents if they keep their kids ignorant."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"I see quite a few enraged high schoolers immediately flag this book as unrealistic with the IM speech. I can't speak for this generation of youths, but I can say that, as a girl who grew up in the late '90s and when the internet was full of Geocities and with no Facebook to be found, the novel is fairly accurate in how people had conversations online.I by no means suggest that this book is the representitive of all teenaged girls. Each person is unique, which is why I like this book. It felt as if I were reading the IM logs of three teenagers. I believe the usage of the language and the slang was very real. Especially with Angela, as I know first hand who would use her peticular phrases; was the girl growing up who used the asterick quite a bit to express my actions.Is the novel very deep? No. It's a quick read and an enjoyable one to me. I very much like all three of the main female characters. I like how they have their very different personalities and how their friendship is filled with much strife. I found myself relating very much to all of them at one point in the novel and remembering my own high school days (granted, my memory is a bit hazier than those who are, y'know, living it right now) through their IMs.I'd say for the enraged teenagers to take a moment and think about this; this novel was written by a woman who was born in 1969. She can't quiet pin down every single nuance of teenaged vernacular, but she did give it the old school try. I think she managed to pull it off pretty okay."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"The plot in this book is that three friends, who talk on AIM, go to different classes and try to servive being aprat for the whole school year. On the first day one of the main characters, SnowAngel (Angela), puts a daisy in her two best friends, Zoe and Maddie, lockers. The setting pretty much is taken place at school but they talk about school on AIM the whole time so I guesss the setting is at home on AIM. The problem that goes on in the story is that Maddie goes to a party instead of trick-or-treating with her friends and gets drunk and starts dancing on a table, well somone took pictures and sent it to everyone. So now Maddie won't speak to Zoe and Angela becuase they were talking about her behind her back about what happened. Then Zoe gets invited to go hot tubing with a teacher and doesn't know what to do. Even though Maddie won't talk to them, they plead for help and she finally comes around and decided that all of them go hot tubing instead of it being just Zoe and her teacher alone so nothing bad will happen. I like this book but I don't think it is appropriate for agges 14 and down, beacuse it has too many curse words."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"This book takes place on IM. The characters are Angla(Snow Angel), Zoe(zoegirl), and Maddie(madmaddie). They are all starting high school and begining to like and go out with somw guys. I would recomnd this book for ages 12 and older because it has sexual cooments and it has very bad words that kids who are not mature enough to haddle the book. Another thng is about it is that is that it has some very werid things like one of the girls goes out with a teacher."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"TTYLLauren MyracleAmulet BooksHave you ever had a friend that you are really close to that you would do anything for? Well in the book TTYL , by Lauren Myracle, you can experience this feeling while reading the instant messages that three best friends have been writing to each other. The three friends are just starting the tenth grade and are all very different. There is Angela, who is jumping from man to man throughout the year. Then there is Maddie who is still trying to find herself and her friends. And last but not least, Zoe gets herself caught up with a flirty, religious teacher. The \\"Winsome Threesome,\\" as they call themselves, have to go through many hardships this year, from boys, to mean girls, to flirty teachers. How can these best friends survive a year in high school when they don't even know themselves?These three girls are so close but are so different too. Angela is a protagonist for the group, she always reminds them how much they really love each other even when they are mad. She is fifteen years old and is quite pretty and she definitely knows it. She is very girlie and thinks hard about every outfit she will wear. Angela loves men and all throughout this book she is trying to find what kind of man she wants. Maddie is the oldest of the group and is definitely the antagonist. She is sixteen years old and is trying to find who her friends really are. She is the rebel of the group; she tries many different things to rebel against society. She is pretty but doesn't really care about what she looks like or what she wears. All throughout the book she finds herself getting into a lot of trouble. Zoe is the calmest person in the whole group, but she herself is not sure of what she wants to do or who she wants to be. She goes from rebellion to religion through the book. Zoe falls for many tricks played by a teacher and goes a little farther than she thought she should. She is always worried about her friends and thinks of them before herself.TTYL is the first book of a series. After reading this one you will want to read the others such as the book TTFN. This is a fantastic book for all teenaged girls. It has fun and it teaches many life long lessons. It is also a book about friendship and will warm the hearts of all teenage girls. This book is a total page turner; I was attached to it from beginning to end. It is especially great because it had three stories all connected into one. This is a book that is full of hardships and friendships that all teen girls will love."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"TTYLTalk to you later, is abbreviated as ttyl, a word often used by teenage girls in these days. Drama is the main focus of high school whether you cheated on your test or your boyfriend high school should be abbreviated as drama. When you think of drama you want to run but ttyl just makes what you think of drama the total opposite way. It grabs your attention and makes your eyes pop after every sentence you read. But ttyl is no once upon a time book, it is only instant messenger. The whole book is all instant messaging which makes it one of the most unique books on the shelf. Three 15 year old girl best friends trying to make it through the drama world of high school and all they have is each other. This book relates so much to what girls and boys have to go through in school, in present day time. When one gets heartbroken from a boy all they have is each other to pick up the pieces. The value of friendship is the most important thing they have to rely on. Partying, decision making, and the right paths to take is the main fears they have to overcome in they're lives. All three unique in they're own way, which one will go the safe path? Which one will drive into temptation? The book keeps you guessing the whole time. The main reaction I had when I first picked up the book was curiosity even the first page made me crave for more. Whether you are 10 to even 18 this book relates to everybody in a special kind of way. The three girls find love some get heartbroken and eventually develop new secret crushes. Not the whole book is about teenage love it also deals with girl fights and shows you who your true friends are. The main motto I would say the three girls' opinion on high school is friends are forever and boys are whatever. The three girls Maddie, Zoe, and Angela's separate stories are like rollercoaster's they are up to the sky and couldn't be any better but some times they have to come down and things get rough. Angela is very flirty and is looking for true love and knows it exists, even in high school she always seems to be the one getting heartbroken and her best friends are always there to pick up the pieces. Maddie is very different she always has mixed feelings about people and mostly sometimes has a negative side but when her friends are in need she sticks with them through thick and thin. Zoe is very different from her best friends she has always been the strait A student and takes care of herself but always loves having a good time she is the main role model of the group. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, it can be pure reality of public school and it teaches you a lesson of how you should watch your steps and always look out for yourself and others. Also it has very good cause and effect reaction of the 3 different girls' lives. You are always on yours toes and guessing what the next sentence will be or should I say instant message"},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"I liked the book ttyl because it was written in a modern style and was easy to relate to at times. This story was fun but a little challenging to read because it was written in the modern form of IM text messaging of three high school friends.This story was about three best friends, Angela, Zoe, and Maddie. They IM each other a story of their fifteen year old lives. Angela or snowangel, is a lot like my friends Hayley and Tess because they both are very outgoing and have a happy go lucky attitude sometimes. But Angela can get annoying. Maddie or madmaddie is a lot like my friend Kristyn because they are both dependable and smart but put themselves down sometimes. Zoe or zoegirl is a lot like me, both a goody goody and very shy. The story is about three best friends trying to get through the tenth grade. They experience crushes, heartbreaks, teachers who have crushes on them, and mistakes and embarrassing moments of a lifetime. Sometimes their friendship is in on the line but like Angela says, friends forever!I highly recommend this book for girls only because it talks about some girl subjects and the main characters are girls. I recommend this book to teens or pre teens that are girls."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"I LOVED ttyl, I would definitely recommend it to any teenage girl that is into IMing. And now a days who isn't? Although it may seem a little odd by its look and the way it sounds it is really, don't let that scare you away, it is really worth reading. It is told through the IM conversations of three sophomore girls, Zoe, Maddie, and Angela. They tell all about the stress, humiliation, heartbreak and backstabbing that occurs in high school through gossipy IM conversations. This is an awesome book and it just proves that even through the most horrible of conditions, friendship can still be kept. Over all I would say that this is an easy book to fallow and I would recommend it to teenage girl eager for a good read."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"I'm a senior in high school who sometimes gets bored in the library during study hall. As a result of said boredom, my friend and I decided to select a book from the display our librarian had decided to put up full of iffy-looking young adult books and read it to see if it was as dumb as it looked.That book was Lauren Myracle's \\"ttyl\\".Has Ms Myracle ever HAD an IM conversation? I cannot believe that people are using the word \\"realistic\\" to describe the complete mess that is this book; they must be adult readers because NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT, not even on IM. Trust me. I'm practically sobbing as I write this because I want you to understand...TEENAGERS ARE NOT THIS STUPID IN REAL LIFE. Good god. This book offends me and makes me ashamed to be a teenage girl...is this what people think we're like? AHHH. No. No. Nonononono. Just...No.Please please please do not buy this book. It might encourage the author to type out more stupid things and sell them to unwitting publishers who don't know what they're unleashing on the world. *shudder*"},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"I picked up this book at my library thinking it might be a fun read. The cover was cute and the back sounded interesting, and I had read the first page, and there was nothing wrong or anything, so it seemed reasonable. I should've dug quite deeper to realize the truth.Crammed, spaced, and shorted to IM form, TTYL is a story about three teenagers going through the same things all the other teenagers are going through, boy drama, mean girls, odd teachers, while trying to keep up their friendship. The first few pages were ok, but then, the book got...a bit overboard. I mean, I know teenagers swear, but this was going a little too far, shoving in all the bad words where, it's not needed. There are a thousand other words in the english language but Myracle has to go ahead and use the f word a bunch of times, which leaves some parents not happy with their child's read.But really, this book is totally gross, and I didn't find it funny. It talks about sex and boys as if they are the last things on this Earth. Shouldn't the girls in the books be using their high school time wisely? Well, they don't, and I'm annoyed.Another reason i'm mad is because of the cover: Cute, funny, overpowering to young girls; hint, hint, young girls, reading these books, getting into this stuff at an early age. Now, I admit i'm young too, but I don't read books that swear off every page just because the author believes everyone is doing it, and it's perfectly ok. Well, teens do tend to swear, but some try not to go too far. Myracle, you went off a cliff this time."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"I want to know if I read the same book as the people who gave this thing 5 stars. Reading TTYL made me want to break down in tears. Is that how society truly views teenage girls? As a sophomore in high school, trust me on this, no middle/jr/high school female acts like that. The whole book basically made it seem as if all we're interested in is boys, sex, and boys. I was deeply disappointed in the fact that the author was promoting this. Although, I have more issues with the publisher who thought this one was a winner. And I don't believe anyone on this planet, or the next, types like that.Do yourself a favor, and don't even bother reading TTYL. You've much better things to do with your time, like watching the grass grow."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"Just picked up this winner in the Young Adults section of Border's for my about to turn thirteen year old daughter. As defined in the book description the target audience is 13-17. At least the creators of Sex and The City target their show to adults and don't enter it in this category. However the subject matter and crude descriptiveness in this book could have found it's way onto that show. If you don't believe me, pick it up at the store and see if you would be willing to read pages 10-11 aloud to a group of junior high girls'.(although doing so would probably subject you to arrest) It's bad enough the pressures on young girls' to be sexualized everywhere they look, but it would be nice if we could turn them loose in the literature for kid's; especially when the book jacket tells us of the author's credentials in writing for young people. Perhaps Larry Flynt might have a place for Ms. Myracle in his Letter's to the editor section."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"A perfect book for morons destined to drop out of school at 15 stoned and pregnant.

I read almost all the way through but after I was about 3/4 of the way through it still had NOT picked up.It starts ordinarily enough. After I was about a quarter of the way through it started to get a little annoying that not much seemed to be happening. One had a byfriend, one was a little TOO close to a teacher, and one was turning on her friends and liking her ex-enemy, a ditzy popular girl from the school. Big whoop. It sounds pretty good but I swear that's all it is. By the end a little something happens to peak the reader's interest, but it is soon lost.After finishing prematurly I asked a friend who read it how it ended, and I was almost glad that I didn't finish. On a later date, for reference purposes, I scanned the end, I still didn't like it. The friend whom I asked for a review did like it, but she only reads about two books a year so she may just think it's a fine piece of literature (such a sad fact as she is so bright).This is advertised as having an intriguing format; everything is written completely in IMs. This is what got me hooked at first, that and some convincing words here on amazon. But, it never occured to me that if you're going to use IMs you won't get any descriptions. Seriously, every once in a while the author throws you a bone and describes some clothing or actions or something along those lines. Some people may like using their imaginations, but all they do is talk about what they think of things. Plus, half of the converstations are, \\"Hey, r u there?\\" \\"Yeah, I am,\\" and \\"Oops I have 2 go!\\" then \\"Goodbye!\\" I found this to be very wearing.I had also read in reviews that the \\"author used text lingo well\\" okay, now let me just say, anyone who calls it text \\"lingo\\" isn't really qualified to say anything about it. But the most there is might be a properly formed and punctuation sentece with \\"2\\" or \\"u\\" instead of some other words. I mean please, I don't know any one group of three girls who would talk like that online.So, we have established that it was boring, and the author didn't really pull me in with her good usages of \\"text lingo\\" but on top of it all I didn't like the characters. This book got so many rave reviews, several of which spoke of the indiviuality of the girls I thought they were just made opposite in a pathetic attempt to make them different, but I could still recognize the common voice of the author. It also brought to mind a question --upon seeing their strikingly different views on things such as church and relationships with varous people--: Why in the world would these girls EVER be friends?? It just made everything so unbelieveable.I wouldn't advise ever paying for this book, at least if you're anything like myself, well maybe if you had unlimited cash you could.... If you really want to read this get it from a local library. I'm sure, having gotten so many good reviews there must be some aspect of it that is alluring to some people, but certainly not for me. Now thanks for reading my rant, but if you want to read a book with an interesting format try The Murder of Bindy Mackenzie, it was a better book in just so many ways."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"ttyl by Lauren Myracle is a book that is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read.

This book is not getting the recognition it deserves. It's a great read, actually. While some may say that the book isn't \\"well-written\\" or whatever else, I think it is. I'm a teen, and the majority of teens that I know would much rather read a book of the new age in technology rather than plain old text after text after text.

TTYL's winsome threesome are best friends entering the ups and downs of high school together. This realistic fiction takes place in modern times in the form of IMing (Instant Messaging). \\"SnowAngel\\" aka Angela is a boy crazy, hyper, hippie girl. \\"mad maddie\\" aka Maddie is the tough \`get off my case' girl of the group. \\"zoegirl\\" aka Zoe is the \`perfect' girl who brings peace within the group. Each girl has her problems within the story. Angela won't make up her mind on a boy and when they dump her, she breaks down. Maddie goes through a serious embarrassment when she befriends a \`popular girl' Jane. Zoe won't realize a huge problem until it's too late. This hilarious book will have you laughing out with, I must warn, some disgust. But hey you know it's like disgusting jokes.Personally I thought this book was the best. It was a definite page-turner for sure because it was just like live for some high scholars. I mean don't some of us have crushes where they crush us. Or do things embarrassing that everyone in the school knows. Teenagers especially would like this book with all it's humor on live. And technically this story is about teens. Because when Lauren Myracle wrote this book she based it on some of her friends emotions when they were in high school. One surprise (and Zoe's problem here) was that Zoe never realized a teacher was hitting on her. She never thought that he would do that until he \`asked' her out. But Angela and Maddie come to the rescue for Zoe. I think that everyone who is a teen, thirteen and up, will love this book.

The three girls are Maddie, who's kind of a rebel; Zoe, a \\"people-pleasing straight-A student\\"; and Angela, a flower-child romantic.The fluctuations and in-fights in the girls' relationship are very real, as is the affection they show for each other. Their travails with boys are lovingly detailed. Angela has to get over a boy who cruelly dumps her, while Maddie is rejected by a \\"popular\\" friend outside their circle.

You could see what was coming a mile ahead, like a train bearing down on you. Each girl has their own little 'crisis' that is set up from the very beginning.I didn't relate to the characters at ALL. Keep in mind, I'm a 16-year-old girl. If not me, who are they looking for? I found all the characters one-dimensional, foolish, and they each had one neat character cliche to fit into.The whole thing was fake, obvious, and contained all the cliches that could possibly be stuffed in.It was on easy read-if you're used to the chatspeak-and mildly entertaining, when I wasn't busy being annoyed by how ridiculous it all was."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"First, a warning. I am an older teacher who read this because I sometimes teach a college class in adolescent lit. I appreciate the author was able to tell a whole story through I.M. and associated devices. Wasn't the first novel in English \\"Pamela\\" a series of letters? I was surprised the plot was pretty good. It reminded me of \\"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.\\" Many parents will find the language and subject matter edgier than they would like. I read this title checked out of the library and someone had started to underline all the \\"dirty\\" words and then had given up. My assumption is that the publisher aimed it at girls buying it for themselves and not parents or teachers buying it for them. Boys will find very little of interest here unless they are doing research about the opposition camp. This is not a classic, but if it keeps girls reading and encourages them to move to other titles, that's ok."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"Shyan BlockThe book is one of the greatest books I have ever read!

The change in colors and fonts for each of the three girls make it easy to read, and the presentation and voice are both highly appealing to the teen reader.Snow Angel, Mad Maddie, and Zoegirl have been best friends for, like, four years. This is the story of their friendship and their commitment to be there for one another, no matter what. Like when Snow Angel finds her true love (not the same one from a couple of weeks earlier), and falls apart when he cruelly dumps her. Like when Mad Maddie, in an effort to try to be in the \\"it\\" crowd, goes to a party, gets drunk, and finds herself in the middle of an Internet scandal as a result. Like when Zoegirl trusts the wrong teacher and finds herself in hot water.Over and over, the girls come through for one another, even if they are in the middle of a fight. The emotions and relationships are real and the dialogue is cutting edge. The reader will most likely identify with at least one of the girls. You'll care for them so much you'll feel great relief when they bail each other out of one predicament after another.This was a fun read and I can't wait to read the next books in this series.Reviewed by: Cana Rensberger"},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"The book that I read was TTYL by the author Lauren Myracle. This book is about three girls who are best friends, and they are currently in the tenth grade. Throughout this whole book are the girls instant messages. Maddie, Zoe, and Angela want to remain friends, all throughout high school. They often get upset about many things, but they always manage work them out. For an example, Zoe and one of the girls teachers have a thing for each other. He always asks Zoe to go to church with him and to all these religious events. Maddie and Angela always pick on her about it and Zoe get very mad and up set. See even though they get mad over stuff they still love to do things together, like this year they are going to try to go on a road trip. They are very excited, but don't know if they all can make it. You will have to read the book to figure out what happens between Zoe and the teacher, and if the girls can all make on their road trip.There are many things that I liked about this book. I liked the fact that it was about teenagers and what they all went through, and I thought it was really neat that the whole story was written in the girls instant messages, but on the other hand I didn't like this book because I got very bored during some parts of the book . Over all it was a pretty god book.I would recommend this book to girls who is between the ages of 14-18 because it's about teenage girls who talk about their love lives, and about their crazy parties that they go to. So if you want to compare your parties with Maddie, Zoe, and Angela's then you'll need to read TTYL."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"THIS NOVEL IS REALLY GOOD.

Although the page setup is creative, the wording used is hard to follow even though I am a regular user of aim and by formatting the whole book into conversations you don't understand the main characters enough. Also many of the pages are just them ranting about absolutely nothing.

[...] best friends Maddie (madmaddie), Angela (SnowAngel) and Zoe (zoegirl) are always talking through instant message about their complicated lives. In fact the entire book is written in text message. The friends go through sad, happy, exciting and tough times together. Throughout the book you get a peek at the lives of teens who go through obstacles such as friendship, the tortures of school, and popularity problems. In the book all is hectically normal until Zoe gets involved with a flirty teacher, Angela gets drawn into a bumpy relationship and Maddie makes a mistake of a lifetime that reaches all ends of the school. Can the best friends make it through the [...] in one piece? The strong relationship between the girls seems to be the only thing able to save them. The morale of this story is that friendship is very valuable. Every one should have someone close to talk to so that no matter what happens in life you will have a friend to help you get through hard times. If you love to read books of true friendship this is an ideal book for you. Every moment of the book is suspenseful and exciting.

Of course, they all find themselves in over their heads and need each other's advise on one thing or another-it's Sophomore year, after all.Zoe, (zoe girl)Ms. Perfect of the trio, has gotten herself into a real mess.

I know i fight sometimes with my friends, but we get over it. it also taught me be careful what you say to friends, you could hurt them. It is probably one of my all time favorite books.

Angela is the most outgoing, loud and boy crazy of the three, Zoe is the quietest and most independent but is heading in a bad relationship, and Madigan is the most self absorbed one.The most interesting thing about this book is that it's written in Instant Messaging format. The book is based on three sophomore girl's friendship, not that much happens but what does happen is exciting.This friendship is very strong and has its ups and downs. Boys get in the way, popular girls get in the way, and sometimes even they get in the way of this friendship but they normally work it out. To me this book is nice if you're a teenager because it gives you some tips on how to deal with friends.If you aren't familiar with the IM format then this book would not be the best choice. You should at least know ttyl means talk to you later.In a way IM format is easer to read, because you don't have to worry about who's talking because each girl has her own screen name and font. For instance, Angela goes by snowangle and has a blue font color, Zoe goes by zoegirl and has the regular font, and Madigan goes by mad Maddie and has a bold font.They cover some very important subjects in their conversations, like the dangers in some parties that are out of control, and boy problems. Each character is very believable in some ways, they each have their own personalities that in real life would go well together.I think this book is for people who like realistic fiction because it's very down to earth, open your eyes and hey this is real life. Boys would not like this book because it's about girls it's more kind of for girls."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"The book was over all a very gripping one! The entire book is written as if the reader is reading a conversation on an instant messenger program. With that, many acronyms commonly used when two people instant message each other are used, and those that are strict about English and grammar might be irritated with how the book is written. The plot was intriguing, despite the played out storyline of three best friends with different personalities, and their personalities tear them apart. When reading the book, the way that is is written keeps it engrossing. Plus, each of the girl's characters were nicely developed and it is very easy to grow attached to them. In general, the book can be described as a three tracked roller coaster looping around each other to make a good read for readers."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"I was really surprised by how much I liked this book.

This is definitely NOT a book that you should allow children under 18 years of age to read. After skimming through a few pages, I found plenty of cursing and graphic sexual comments.

I think writing an entire book in IMs is a cool idea, and I think it's alright for a summer read. I don't hate the it, I don't love it. Ttyl is about three girls, Zoe, Angela, and Maddie, Maddie's slightly tomoyish, Angela's girly and upbeat, and Zoe's the good girl. They are only seen in the book through IMs, but I perceived that these were their main traits. However, in this day and age, we are extremely familiar with the fact that the internet can lie. What if all these seemingly nice girls were your friends, but only on the internet? Perhaps their lives, or what you know about them, are all a charade.Angela is struggling to find her true love, and she's flip-flopping around with quite a few suitors. Zoe's having trouble with a flirtatious teacher, and Maddie's regretting ever trusting the queen bee- and the night she went to that party. And that's pretty much the entire story. Not very special, right?All in all, this book was really nothing out of the ordinary."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"Oh my, what a book. I will start out by saying that this book is definitely not for children. There is alot of inappropriate content on almost every page. It was like it was teaching kids to talk junk and saying it was okay. No, it's not. I have to say, though, it was actually a pretty decent book other than the profanity and disturbing content. Some of the conversations were hysterical, which really brought out the light in the book. But, I do suggest that you should at least be in junior high to read this series. Sixth or seventh grade at the least. (: -Bookworm12"},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"I really like this book.The plot to the story was very good. I believed whatever the character said.

The events that happened were dramatic and it was so intersting to me. I would recomend this book to anyone that likes teen romance-comedy books.

This is the first book I've read by Lauren, and let me just say...WOW. Lauren captures teen Instant Messaging perfectly, as if she is actually in a chat room talking to teenage girls.Snow Angel: Thank God all three of us have the same lunch period. *Raises champagne glass* TO THE WINSOME THREESOME! BFF!Maddie, Angie, and Zoe are all Best Friends going through a typical High School sophomore grade year- well, I wouldn't say typical.... Zoe is a \\"goody-goody\\" teacher's pet, who follows all the rules, and is always home on time for dinner. As the story progresses, Zoe seems to be getting in a little too deep with her 24-year old teacher, Mr. H. Will she break all the rules for the love of her teacher? More importantly, does she really want to?Maddie is a full-out rebel. She's the daredevil of the three, and the real moral supporter of the bunch. She is always there when they need someone to talk to, or a shoulder to cry on. Getting further and further into the year, Maddie seems to be befriending the \\"Queen Bee\\", Jana. Will Jana and her \\"evil\\" tricks and ways split the \\"Winsome Threesome\\" apart?Last, but certainly not least, is the boy-crazy, make-up expert, leader-of-the-pack, Angela (Snow Angel). Angela goes through boys like air, it seems, and she finds a new crush every week. As the leader of the group, it is Angela's job to keep everyone and everything together. But what will she do when it appears that Jana's sidekick, Tonnie, is crushing on her boyfriend, Rob? And what will she do when Maddie goes on a wild speed limit-rebelling adventure in her car with Jana and other teenagers?This book is entirely written in Instant Messages, therefore if you do not enjoy that type of thing, I wouldn't read this book. It isn't written with paragraphs, or 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person telling the story. Until you really get to know who's who, it's a little confusing. Other than that, I thought it was phenomenal! Lauren Myracle makes reading it so real because of her vivid descriptions, her use of \\"IM talk\\", and her mind for teen writing. I wish I could have 3 friends as funny as Angie, Zoe, and Madie! She tapped into these characters so well they each had their own personality, and they were each so likeable. Angie could be my Best Friend! I love how Lauren put all the actions she would have been doing (if you could have seen her), in *s. An example would be, Snow Angel: Yeah, sorry I didn't pick up, I was hanging with Rob *drools*.... Angie is such a likeable person, for the way she is obsessive about clothes, to her bubbly and funny personality.Make sure you read TTFN, the sequel to TTYL- I am so excited to read it, and I hope you choose TTYL, too!"},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"hey this is beth and it would be an understatement to say this is a good book.

TTYL is a great book for friendship and how hard times can bring out the best in people.Oh and what did the reviewer mean by the whole robot thing. This is the present not the future.

Reading the book in all instant messages can be frustrating/annoying to some readers, but I found I got used to it after a while. Some readers may be turned away by the nature of some explicit content, but that's one of the reasons this book is written for teenagers. It's possible to relate. Yes, tenth-graders really do talk about such subjects. However, that is by no means the real theme of the story.

Either way, the book is mildly interesting, and to all those who are horrified at the use of chatspeak, let me be the first to break the news to you...English is not a permanently fixed language. From the Restoration to the Romantics to the Modernists to the Beats to the Black Mountain poets, etc., etc, the older generation consistently bemoans the degradation of the language. Let's go back to Middle English, that's what I say...or better yet Latin. This book is no worse than what most other popular novelists churn out by the boatload (James Patterson, I'm looking at you).

The instant messaging format is awkward and often frustrating to read; the reliance on gratuitous grossness is often oppressive. On the other hand, the story has its good points, too. Not many outweigh the bad, but some are notable. First of all, it truly does portray middle- and/or early high-school stuff to a tee (the only exception to this being that IM punctuation is typically WORSE). Second, all three of the girls' stories are entirely believable, and one is truly compelling.A brief summary of their stories: Angela (screen name SnowAngel) is a hyper, boy-crazy soul whose reckless crushes consistently leave her crushed. Madigan (a.k.a. mad maddie) is the \\"tough one\\" who ends up making a huge mistake and paying dearly for it. It is the story of good-girl Zoe (a.k.a. zoegirl) that is the most gripping one. Her exceedingly creepy teacher, referred to only as Mr. H., is putting the moves on her. Zoe is the most innocent of the trio and is all but oblivious to Mr. H's intentions until it just might be too late. It is at this point that the friendship between Maddie, Angela, and Zoe comes to the fore - and proves that it is the saving grace of this story."},{"Title":"ttyl","review":"It's books like this that are going to ultimately cause the gradual crumbling down of the English language as readers become more and more illiterate, using letters instead of words, and smiley faces instead of written, explained emotions.As a writer, I believe censorship is wrong and believe in art and free expression and all this.

They have a really good, strong, bond with each other. This book not only talks about boys but it talks about stuff that can teach you a lot. I don't wan't to give the whole book away but one of the girls go to a party and gets drunk. You are gonna die because theres not a sequel. Oh ya, and the whole entire book is done in IM's so that makes it really fun. It;s really fun to put yourself in one of the girls position. You can totally relate to all of these girls in different ways. I totally recomend that you not only get it from your library but that you buy it. It's totally worth it.

If you read a story and you don't know what's going on, even reading the notes and finding out that the story is based on rhetorical arguments of the day (which were very popular) and how it's a parody isn't going to make the story anymore enjoyable. YOu will get the jokes but only after they've been explained.This is a rather depressing prospect considering that it means that there's a shelf life onSimpsons World The Ultimate Episode Guide: Seasons 1-20.Still, several aspects do come down to us in the modern world without too much translation. Jokes about people passing gas have always been amusing. This is why The Miller's Tale is so funny and even if you don't know the tropes of Courtly Love being parodied. Other stories take effort but are worth it. Some are very influential in their ghastly and grisly methodology (The Pardoner's Tale is a fake morality tale that serves as a horror story).And some stories do just fall flat and serve only to bore the reader.Still it's worth a read.

The group of travellers include men and women of different types and different occupations, so produces quite a few amusing and interesting moments throughout."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"This modern translation is for those who struggle with Chaucer's original language. Coghill's melodious verse captures the timely flow of the original text, thus preventing the reading from becoming a slow and erudite undertaking. Chaucer's Tales were not designed for sluggish meditation, but to be read aloud in an engaging manner, which is what makes this translation an ideal buy for those who wish to experience the Tales for their original charm.The immortal Canterbury Tales is a must for all lovers of great literature. What we can witness in this noble poem \\"is the concise portrait of an entire nation: high and low, old and young, male and female, rogue and righteous, land and sea, town and country\\", as Nevill Coghill describes in his introduction to this translation. The past has become magical to us through the great works of Epic poetry; where the Greeks had Homer, and the Roman's Virgil; the English have none other than Geoffrey Chaucer.It is only infrequently that we can find classic ideas that have captured readers throughout the ages, be it Pickwick's proposed adventure to study his fellow men, Dante's quest for his beloved Beatrice, or indeed Chaucer's undying Pilgrimage; The Canterbury Tales manifests its own unique appeal in an immortal journey through the Tales of many different voices.On the Eve of a Pilgrimage from a London Cheapside Inn to St Thomas a Becket's shrine in Canterbury, a group of thirty pilgrims are challenged by the inn's Host to a competition: to while away their morrow's journey by each telling a tale; on returning to London their Host will then decided the best storyteller: and their reward? a luxurious meal on behalf of that Pilgrim's fellows. What follows are many tales, of many varieties: those of courtly love, bawdy comedy, fresh wit, menacing macabre, didactic fables, in short, to use John Dryden's words \\"God's plenty\\".But it is the prologue to Chaucer's great collection of tales that marks its individuality from the Likes of Ovid, Petrarch and Boccaccio - of whom some of the tales are largely indebted to. The translator of this edition advocates that \\"in all literature there is nothing that touches or resembles the prologue\\". And this is by all means a cogent argument: what we witness at the beginning of Tales is patchwork quilt of Medieval England, a Tapestry of Chaucer's times, or if you like: a doorway into a world long faded away.The prologue simply follows the task of introducing the diverse tellers of the Tales, and yet in doing so it records a valuable sample of history. William Blake faithfully promulgates the Prologue's vitality by declaring that: \\"Chaucer is himself the great poetical observer of men, who in every age is born to record and eternize its acts\\". The Pilgrims are not only well presented characters, they are also true embodiments of normality. What we see in the Tales is not just a snap-shot of Olde England, but something indeed far bigger: a blueprint of our own society's individuals - \\"the perennial progeny of men and women\\". What Chaucer portrays to us in his Canterbury Tales is nothing greater than our very selves."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"Chaucer wrote the Canterbury Tales in \\"Middle English\\" (not quite like Beowulf and what's written today but in between) and this version is fairly easier to read because it's written in modern language. If you want the challenge read the Norton edition, but this is good for beginners and people that really don't want to spend time reading the Middle English with all those footnotes. However, even with the Modern English, it's a lot easier to read but perhaps not as easy to understnad and decipher the tales.Now for the book, historically, the novel outlines the importance of the Church on the country and how in England, the church had become something that was seeking material wealth and status instead of any spiritual growth. Also, it shows the harsh feudal system that ruled the era. Chaucer explains that fourteenth century England was filled with people in pursuit of wealth and power, and that this was also the cause of the problems of his society. It is told as different tale's of pilgrims venturing together on a pilgrimage. The tales are important in understanding the time and culture, basically that's why it's a classic and it's also the first work of poetry written in the English language; so pretty important."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"The Bantam edition (ISBN 0-553-21082-3), edited, introduced and translated by Peter G.

I found this helpful. I could reach the Middle English and glance to the margin for help here and there. The introduction has help on pronunciation. In the end, I was reading aloud to myself in middle English and found the text no more slow-going than other English-language poetry, easier to reach and understand than John Donne.I discovered that the work is, in Middle English, funnier than the translations let on. The rhymes themselves are humorous. The poem also is earthier than the translators suggest. Why don't you memorize and recite the opening in Middle English. Amaze your friends. Be the life of the party. Come on, what else were you going to do with your time?"},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"Chaucer is an author with unusual staying power. Sure we read classical writing and appreciate it but it doesn't seem to have the impact that Chaucer's Canterbury tales still have on us. We can see ourselves and our foibles in the pilgrims he writes about and the stories he attributes to them. To think that this was written in a time period we relegate as a time period of ignorance and religion! We can imagine that even in a time where superstition ruled there were still people that that saw the world quite similarly as we do today and certainly Chaucer was among that group.This version is incredibly well translated and provides a succinct introduction including a nice brief biography of the author. Also the notes are pretty good - I just wish they were footnoted rather than all in the notes section.So if you if you think reading a work that is six hundred years old might be a little boring start in out of sequence and go right to the second tale - The Millers Tale. Like something straight out of a Jerry Springer show if this story doesn't give reason to laugh than I don't know what will. The only hang up you may have is reading in the metered format that the tales are written in. I will say that it is not difficult to get the rhythm o the words and before long you won't even notice. The book is relatively thick but it is fast reading so don't be discouraged by that - its well worth it. Reading Chaucer gives a glimpse of how the secular mind worked in the middle ages. He provides straightforward writing that isnt simple but yet isnt overly complex verbose. Without being totally austere he can tell interesting stories quickly and, since (as we all know) brevity is the essence of wit, be remarkably funny.If you are reading this for school you should be excited to know that not only are you reading a seminal work of secular English writing that is referenced throughout our culture. Also it is actually fun to read. If you are thinking about reading this just for fun you are doing the right thing I waited too long to pick this book up and but I am really glad I did it is thoroughly enjoyable and while while a little historical background may help I doubt you will need a degree in history to appreciate this one.-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is perhaps the best literary work of the Middle Ages. He paints a lucid picture of life during this time period and his familiarity with every social class, as well as his vivid and comical descriptions of his unique characters, makes this poetic book charming. Chaucer embraces several genres, some of which include romance, satire, and fabliau. He uses the voice of a naive narrator. However, one should not conclude that the point of view expressed is his entirely because this may very well be literary trickery. Canterbury Tales is as modern and entertaining today as it was six hundred years ago, with themes such as the corruption of the church, which ironically is still prevalent today."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"The wife Bath Tale opens up with a Prologue.

There's nothing in the way of analysis or notes; after a brief introduction that lays out who Chaucer was and where the tales come from, he lets it rip.The tales themselves are deserving of their fame because of the way that they manage to be maintain a literary value and yet still appeal to the masses. While each tale stands alone (and some of them stand alone very well indeed), the device of a group of disparate strangers stuck together that comprises the frame is exceptionally captivating. There's something very neat and pat about the concept: two tales each on the way, and two tales each on the way back.Even though this was obviously never accomplished, we still get fun interaction between the principles, and get a feel for what the entire project would have looked like (like a thicker book, I suppose, but I digress).That Chaucer used this unifying element to bring together stories from other sources is to his credit, because the variety of sources adds to the concept, by creating starkly different tales that ably bear out the voices of their various tellers.If you have any sort of interest at all in the classics, or have enjoyed the stories to be found in traditional folklore and the greek myths, I urge you to give this edition a shot when trying Chaucer."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"If you haven't read the Canterbury Tales in their native language than you are missing out.

Like many poets he uses and wrote for the specific contexts within which he lived. His works are like a mirrror to his time. During this time there were many medieval and courtly romances to pursue one another to a direct point. Being a engrossed student and an avid reader Chaucer knows just what his feelings are and expresses them quite frequently throughout his work. The Canerbury Tales, is a story of pilgrims that come together and set off on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Thomas. Chaucer made his groups of pilgrims into a picture of the society of his time of which the like is not to be found elsewhere. In the journey there are men of a variety including a squire, physic, a man of law, carpenter ,and a knight to name a few. Also a wife of bath who tries greatlty to show her defense of being married five times. This is a story that Chaucer puts together brillantly to show the effects upon life during his time. The contrast between apperence and reality are use of the general prologue and Chaucer's great power of vivid description.

I only vaguely knew it wasn't written in modern day English. I knew that I wanted to read the book in middle English because of a quaint notion that I needed to hear Chaucer's voice speak to me over the centuries. I might not understand much of it but at least I would have the experience, like with Shakespeare of a kind of intimacy was the text.The first attempt at the \\"Tales\\" was a Norton critical edition but I purchased it before realizing it only contained nine of the tales. So then I searched for a more expansive edition that contained all of them, even the fragments and the often discarded, Parson's tale. That lead me to this one edited by A.C. Cawley. It cost me $3 dollars and was published in 1975 which gave the book itself a ye olde flavor. Add to that the musty smell and I felt very comfortable with my book.Cawley doesn't over do the glosses and annotations to Chaucer's tales but he select the seemingly right word or phrase to offer up in modern English that helped my comprehension. I should admit that I used two other aids, Peter Ackroyd's retelling and also an Oxford guides to the Canterbury Tales. They were useful and I will review them separately.So what to make of the classic itself? My overarching feeling was that Geoffrey Chaucer must have had a devilish glint in his eye. That for all the piety, the religious sentiments and moral teaching contained in the tales, I came away with the sense that he didn't take any aspect of humanity too seriously. He saw in himself and others the absurdist, contradictory, peevish, sinful, humorous makeup of humanity. I relate to him because of that. Other thoughts are that it sucked to be female during those times as women had no autonomy, being forever tethered to a husband or father or cast aside as a widow or nun. And yet men feared women's sexuality to such an extent that it could cut short a woman's life through no fault of her own. The other thought is about how a religious world view was front and center and commerce was a minor matter. Yes, people wanted to be rich and powerful but only if it didn't jeopardize ones standing with God. And many occupations were somehow connected to the church, it was the corporate state in its day."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey ChaucerThis ebook is probably the best place to start with Chaucer, father of English poetry and the originator of comedy in the English language."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"This is a good translation.

The Canterbury Tales, as mentioned in most of the review prior to mine, recounts the soujourn of twenty-nine pilgrams to Canterbury. Chaucer had original intended, or so it would seem, to write four tales for each pilgrim--two to be told going to Canterbury and two to be told on the return from Canterbury. It is very likely that Chaucer omitted the twenty-five or so tales that he did for a stoutly religious reason--that once you meet God in your life (which was the intent of a pilgramage) there is no returning. This is why the pilgrims are never seen leaving Canterbury. In all, the tales tell a very strong moral tale. Nearly every line of this wonderful work can be interpreted with a religious overtone and it is no doubt that Chaucer intended for it to be this way. In closing I would like to make reference to a review I read on this page. The short story for in no way came out of this work. The development of the short story can only be attributed Edgar Allan Poe. To suggest that the short story evolved from this would be a grave error.

He has based his format on 24 mythical pilgrims that are travelling together to get to a religious shrine. This type of religious pilgrimage was extremely popular in Chaucer's day. Anyway, they help to pass the time of their travels by each telling a tale. These individual tales enable the reader to get a very clear glimpse of the personality of each of the storytellers.

They all met at a pub when the pub owner said that they should all tell one story on the way there and one on the way back. The version of the Canterbury tales only consists of four of the one hundred twenty eight that were told.The first story that is told by the Nun's priest. This story is about a poor widow who lives on a farm. As you get further in this story it starts retelling the story of a chicken and a hen. This chicken had many wonderful hens around him. \\"This noble rooster ruled over seven hens, whose work it was to please him. They were his sisters and his wives.\\" (pg. 20) But there was one hen named Lady Pertelote that he liked the most. One night he had a dream about a fox eating him. The next morning he told Lady Pertelote and she thought it didn't mean anything. A couple of days later a fox tricked him to shut his eyes and then the fox snuck up behind him and snatched him in his mouth. He was saved by the widow.The next person to tell was the pardoner. His story was about greed. There were three people who were searching for death because they heard of all the horrible things he had done and wanted to kill him. While on their way they met an old man who told the men, \\"If you're so anxious to find Death, turn up this crooked road. I left him in that grove, under a tree and there he'll stay.\\" (pg. 41) So that's what they did. When they got there they saw a sack full of gold and decided not to chase after Death but take the gold by night. They decided for one of them to go into the city and get wine to celebrate. The person that went was the youngest of them all. While he was gone the two thought up a plan to kill the third one so that they only had to split the money between them. The third boy wanted the money all to himself so he poisoned two of the bottles of wine and left one free of poison for himself. As he got the tree the two men killed him and they celebrated by drinking the wine and they died too. In the end they all got there wish. They met Death.Those two were my favorite and the next two are by the Wife of Bath and the Franklin. The wife of Bath is about a man who threatens the life of another if they don't tell him what women want. The franklin's tale is about women who loved a man who left her and she was very sad. Nothing could make her feel better. If you want to know what happens at the end of these stories you'll have to read the book.Historically this book is very good. It is based in the year of 1386. It show the life style of people who lived in the middle ages. It taught me that not all people were rich back then. It is historically spot on but the thing about this book is because it was written in the middle ages all the living conditions are right but it's very whimsical. Chickens can't talk, and Death isn't a person. In a way it shows how people thought back then. It tells us that some people might have wanted to meet death. Maybe in a physical way because they wanted to die or they just wanted to see someone death took away from them.The reason I liked this book was because of the old English. I like taking in the metaphors and deciphering it. If you like Shakespeare then you'll most likely like this book. It is very whimsical and magical. It shows the people in the middle ages in a very metaphorical way. This book shows how life can be mystical and great even when you don't except it."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"Over some period I have read several translations of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. My first experience, selections in a high school text, was not promising. (Perhaps, I was not yet ready for Chaucer.)

As a Chaucer teacher myself, I'd say read the tales in the Riverside Chaucer or in the Norton Critcal editon with lots of footnotes. But, yes, that is harder, and I'd rather see readers get some experience than none.So, if you are going to compromise, Nevill Coghill's poetic translation is really as good a place to go as any. You will get the basic sense of Chaucer's verse; you'll get the basic rhymes and rhythms too. This is the translation that's used in most high school classes, and in many college survey classes that don't read the text in the original. It's really a fine compromise -- not only a good place to start, but also a decent trot if you are struggling with the Middle English.You can find some closer translations of some of the tales online if you look up Michael Murphy's websites. But for all their virtues, they don't have the smoothness of Coghill's renditions; Murphy's translations are not the complete Tales; and it's clunky to print them out. This economical edition is probably still the best place to start with Chaucer, father of English poetry and the originator of comedy in the English language."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"The version of this classic I read was a translation into modern English by Nevill Coghill. As you can see above, I awarded Chaucer (and the translation) five stars; but I do have a criticism. This translation (and many other publications of Chaucer) do not contain the two prose tales (&quot;The Tale of Melibee&quot; and &quot;The Parson's Tale&quot;). These are rarely read and I understand the publisher's and the translator's desire to keep the book to a managable size. Still, that should be the readers decision and no one else's. I had to go to the University library and get a complete copy in order to read those sections. As I mentioned, this copy is a translation into modern English. However, I do recommend that readers take a look at the Middle English version, at least of the Prologue. Many years ago, when I was in high school, my teacher had the entire class memorize the first part of the Prologue in the original Middle English. Almost forty years later, I still know it. I am always stunned at how beautiful, fluid, and melodic the poetry is, even if you don't understand the words. Twenty-nine pilgrims meet in the Tabard Inn in Southwark on their way to Canterbury. The host suggests that the pilgrims tell four stories each in order to shorten the trip (the work is incomplete in that only twenty-four stories are told). The tales are linked by narrative exchanges and each tale is presented in the manner and style of the character providing the story. This book was a major influence on literature. In fact, the development of the &quot;short story&quot; format owes much to these tales. All of the elements needed in a successful short story are present: flow of diction and freedom from artifice, faultless technical details and lightness of touch, and a graphic style which propels the story. In poetry, Chaucer introduced into English what will become known as rime royal (seven-line stanza riming ababbcc), the eight-line stanza (riming ababbcbc), and the heroic couplet. His poetry is noted for being melodious and fluid and has influenced a great many later poets. He has a remarkable talent for imagery and description. With respect to humor, which often receives the most negative responses from a certain group of readers (as witnessed by some of the comments below), there are at least three types: good humor which produces a laugh and is unexpected and unpredictable (for example, the description of the Prioress in the Prologue), satire (for example, the Wife of Bath's confession in the Prologue to her tale), and course humor, which is always meant to keep with the salty character of the teller of the tale or with the gross character of the tale itself. I am really stunned at the comments of the reviewer from London (of June 21, 1999). He/she clearly has no idea of the influence of the work nor on the reasons why Chaucer chose to present the humor the way he has. T. Keene of May 17 gave the work only three stars, presumably because it was once banned in Lake City, Florida. (Does that mean it would get fewer stars if it hadn't been banned?) Perhaps our London reviewer will be more comfortable moving to Lake City! Another reviewer suggested that &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; was only a classic because it had been around a long time. No! Chaucer's own contemporaries (for example, Gower, Lydgate, and Hoccleve) acknowledged his genius. My goodness, even science fiction books acknowledge the Tales (for example, Dan Simmons' &quot;Hyperion,&quot; which won the 1990 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel of the year, is based on the Tales). These brief entries are too short to review all of the tales. Let me just descibe the first two. Other readers might consider reviewing the other tales in later responses. In &quot;The Knight's Tale,&quot; the Theban cousins Palamon and Arcite, while prisoners of the King of Athens (Theseus), fall in love with Emelyn, sister of Hippolyta and sister-in-law to Theseus. Their rivalry for Emelyn destroys their friendship. They compete for her in a tournament with different Greek gods supporting the two combatants. Arcite, supported by Mars, wins but soon dies from a fall from his horse (due to the intervention of Venus and Saturn). Both Palamon and Emelyn mourn Arcite, after which they are united. It is the basis of &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; by Fletcher and Shakespeare. &quot;The Miller's Tale&quot; is a ribald tale about a husband, the carpenter John, who is deceived by the scholar Nicholas and the carpenter's wife Alison that a second flood is due. In this tale, a prospective lover is deceived into kissing a lady in an unusual location. And, recalling the response from our reviewer from London, apparently this Tale should not be read by people from London (or Lake City)!"},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"Over the years, this book has been banned upways, sideways, and down.

It's still a beautiful example of writing.

Reading this version takes the work out of it and makes \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" a pure pleasure.Chaucer writes about everyman and his stories represent one of the motliest crews in English literature: the Wife of Bath who has put away five husbands and is looking for a sixth; the pardoner, the reeve, the clerk, the knight, and a host of others from all walks of life. There is something in here for everyone; my three favorite stories are the Pardoner's Tale; the Miller's Tale (reading this in Coghill's translation, I could see why it has been excised from the bowdlerized versions used in high school English classes; it's rude, crude and downright lewd, but it's so hysterical they had to sew my sides up again when I finally stopped laughing), and the Franklin's tale of the knight, the squire and the magician who outdo each other in chivalry.Antisemitism was commonplace in medieval Europe and Chaucer is no more free of it than anyone else of his time; but to say that The Canterbury Tales is not worth reading because Chaucer was true to his time is overstatement.

Translated into Modern English by Nevill Coghill. 504 pp. Penguin Classics. ISBN : 0140440224 (pbk.)Nevill Coghill's brilliant modern English translation of Chaucer's masterpiece, 'The Canterbury Tales,' has always been a bestseller and it's easy to understand why. Chaucer was an intensely human writer and a great comic artist, but besides the ribaldry and sheer good fun of tales such as 'The Miller's Tale,' we also know he was capable of other things. His range was wide, and the striking thing about Coghill's translation is how amazingly faithful it is to the spirit of the original - at times bawdy and hilariously funny, at other times more serious and moving when Chaucer shifts to a more poignant mode.But despite the brilliance of Coghill's translation, a translation so effective that it was even made into a successful musical, and despite the fact that it remains the best possible introduction to Chaucer for those who don't know Middle English, those who restrict themselves to Coghill are going to miss a lot - such readers are certainly going to get the stories, but they're going to lose much of the beauty those stories have in the original language. The difference is as great as that between a black-and-white movie and technicolor.Chaucer's Middle English _looks_ difficult to many, and I think I know why. It _looks_ difficult because that in fact is what people are doing, they are _looking_ at it, they are reading silently and trying to take it in through the eye. This is a recipe for instant frustration and failure. But fortunately there is a quick and easy remedy.So much of Chaucer's power is in the sheer music of his lines, and in their energy and thrust. He was writing when English was at its most masculine and vigorous. And his writings were intended, as was the common practice in the Middle Ages when silent reading was considered a freakish phenomenon, to be read aloud. Those new to Chaucer would therefore be well advised, after reading and enjoying Nevill Coghill's rendering, to learn how to read Middle English _aloud_ as soon as possible by listening to one of the many excellent recordings (one of the best is by Robert Ross on Caedmon).Coghill certainly captures the spirit of Chaucer, but modern English cannot really convey the full flavor and intensity of the original. Learn how to roll a few of Chaucer's Middle English lines around on your tongue and you'll soon hear what I mean. You'll also find that it isn't nearly so difficult as it _looks_, and your pleasure in Chaucer will be magnified enormously."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"The Canterbury Tales were almost ruined for me by my freshman English Lit class. They insisted on making us read it from The Norton Anthology of Literature, which of course is untranslated. This is pointless. Unless one is a specialist or going for a doctorate there is no point in reading The Canterbury Tales in Middle English with all those endless footnotes. It takes one of the greatest books in English Literature - or World Literature, for that matter - and makes it torture. I have no need of \\"thilke\\" or \\"willhem\\" or \\"clepen.\\" That is why Nevill Coghill's translation is such a boon. Now we can enjoy it in our own language the way the fourteenth-century English did (in truth, it is not that hard to translate as many of the words stay the same). I have taken to reading it, not as a novel, but as a collection of short stories - skipping around as I please. I think it is agreed that the best parts art the Miller's Tale, The Pardoner's Tale, and The Wife of Bath (and the Prologue, of course) which makes for excellent starting points."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"\\"Brilliant\\" is the right word for Chaucer, I think. Not \\"magnificent\\" - it sounds too authoritative, and authority was one thing Chaucer had little regard for. I mean this not in the sense that he devoted himself to passionately tearing down authority - simply that his ultimate motivation was to parody, sometimes to satirize, and just generally to poke fun. The mood of the work as a whole is one of a game, interspersed with various asides from both Chaucer and his various characters beseeching the readers not to take what they say too seriously and to maintain a general spirit of fun.The backstory to the telling of the titular Tales (alliteration!) is that of thirty pilgrims, each given their own unique introduction in the prologue (though some, such as several priests, are lumped together), travelling to Canterbury to the site where Thomas a Becket was killed by Henry II - of England, of course. The host of the Tabard Inn, Harry Bailey, suggests that they make a wager where they each tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two on the way back, and whoever tells the best tales gets a dinner to be paid for by the rest of the party. But this is fairly unimportant - what is important is the characters, the tales, and Chaucer himself's relationship to both.The tales snowball off one another in such a way that, while it is certainly possible to read them non-chronologically, the best understanding of the work as a whole is achieved by just reading straight through - and then once more after that, as some earlier stories reference characters not fully given a chance to shine until later in the work. For example, during the Knight's tale of courtly love, he himself pokes some very subtle fun at the typical absurd purity of his Medieval romantic characters, which prompts the Miller to tell a fabliau tale in which similar high romantic rhetoric is used simply for the purposes of hot, dirty, extramarital sex at the expense of a poor, old, foolish carpenter, prompting the Reeve (himself a carpenter) to revenge himself on the Miller by telling a tale in which a cruel, stupid, thieving Miller's daughter and wife are both raped by young students whom the Miller has tricked. The cycle of degradation of the romance finally ends when the Cook begins a tale of a prostitute, Chaucer trailing off the tale without ending it, presumably because he has already made his point - namely, the dichotomy between ideal views of romance in the eyes of higher, aristocratic figures, and the realities of romance (or, rather, lust) in the eyes of the common figures of the day. And yet, despite this, the dirty, crude, ribald fabliaux of the Miller, Reeve, and Cook actually reinforce aristocratic feeling of superiority.I could quite easily go on, and on, but I will not. Suffice it to say that this is perhaps the greatest (in terms of sheer worth, not puffed-up self-importance), most entertaining, most rewarding work in all English literature. I intend to read the untranslated version as soon as I can. Speaking of which - Coghill's translation is quite excellent, with smooth-flowing rhymes and handy footnotes (although sometimes their placement did seem a bit arbitrary - why did he feel it necessary to explain what a Summoner was, but not what a Manciple was?) My one criticism was that he decided not to translate the prose tales of the Parson and Chaucer's Tale of Melibee, giving a self-written summary in their stead. While the summaries were fine, and perfectly informative, I want Chaucer, dammit!

For instance, the first tales such as the miller's and the reeve's are cleverly linked to one another. Sadly, soon enough afterwards, no structure is perceptible and tales simply follow one another with no apparent logic.In addition, the unabridged version includes lesser known tales, some of which are dismally boring, such as the Tale of Melibee or the Parson's Tale, both in prose. They are closer to a long series of quotations than an actual narrative. Was Chaucer being ironic in including them? Or else, are they later additions that Chaucer did not write himself?Overall, listening to the Canterbury Tales is a unique experience that is highly recommended to all, for sheer delight but also to realize how much, and how little, our culture has evolved since medieval times."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"At the Tabard Inn, thirty travelers from a diversity of classes and occupations are planning to make the annual pilgrimage to Becket's shrine at Canterbury.

Of course, a few commonly used words and a greater number of rare words have not survived into modern English, and the reader needs to learn these; a list is provided. But that is much easier than having to also decipher virtually every word because its spelling is not recognizable.Naturally, pronunciation changes over time, as does spelling, so some of the rhythm and rhyme doesn't quite work.

The book may be twice as thick, but this way you can both read it the way Chaucer intended it to be, and read the translation right under the original words in case you're completely baffled by the vocabulary. I recently found a copy like that at a garage sale for 50 cents.

As such, you're ready for a dry and dusty tome, struggling for every page. But that's not what's here.The Canterbury Tales is much more entertaining, much more visceral and much more fanciful than many of the works that have followed it (and most of the classics). It is a collection of short stories that runs the gamut, from precious religious narrative to bawdy toilet-humor. Most all of it is in verse (usually couplets) and the reading is fast and fun. My personal favorite comes first in the Knight's Tale, but the whole is filled with surprises and engrossing stories. Reading the Tales, you'll also have an interesting perspective into a society many hundreds of years past--a society that turns out to be not far different from our own.I'd also like to take this opportunity to recommend a modern fantasy/sci-fi novel that is kind of a take on the Tales entitled Hyperion by Dan Simmons.So, to conclude, if you are sitting up in your dorm room, staring at the Tales, trying to figure out how to approach: just start.

Chaucer was well-read, well-phrased, well-mannered, industrious in literary and legal/administrative pursuits, as I trust I will become, if not already so qualified.As one can see from the above examples, English has changed much over the past 600 years, but not so much as to make these passages unrecognisable. Compare for yourself with a modern translation such as this, and see how much you can decipher.Chaucer is one of the first great English authors of name; most (but not all) literary output in English prior to this time was anonymous. Living in the 1300s, he held administrative posts of importance under Kings from the time of Edward III to Henry IV. Never one to shrink from spending too much money (he had to reapply for pensions and ask for advances several times in his life) or shying away from controversy (he fell out of and came back into favour several times). When he died, he was laid to rest in Westminster Abbey, in a section on the south side that has since become Poet's Corner, largely due to Chaucer, the first great English poet, having been buried there.In addition to his magnus opus, 'The Canterbury Tales', a collection of stories with prologue told by pilgrims on their journey to Canterbury (car radios and in-flight movies were rare in those days), Chaucer wrote minor poems to suit various occasions (his first record as poet comes from having written a poem as elegy on the death of John of Gaunt's first wife, Blanche, in 1369), and the major work for which he was noted for 'Troilus and Criseyde', which showed his sense of humour, power of observation and attention to detail, and keen dramatic skills in language. This work is often compared to Dante and Boccaccio, perhaps the most famous poets of the day. 'The Canterbury Tales' is actually intended to be much longer - 120 tales told by 30 pilgrims (two each on the way to Canterbury, and two each returning). As it is, there are only 24 tales plus a prologue - had it been completed, it would be by far the longest poem in the English language.There is a strong, practical side to Chaucer's writing, sophisticated yet not aloof and removed from the affairs of the world, cultured yet in tune with the better (and more interesting) aspects of the common people, too.This edition by Nevill Coghill is designed for those who only want the Canterbury Tales, not the other writings of Chaucer, but want a set of the complete tales and prologue from standard texts. This is a fairly standard version that is useful for students - the Penguin classics have long been a staple for undergraduate and general readership, and this volume fits the bill nicely.For those who want the Canterbury Tales in good form, this is a good volume to get."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"Have you ever sat amongst friends, or maybe even strangers, and swapped stories with each person attempting to make their tale appear to be the most impelling. This is in essence the design of Geoffrey Chauncer's &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, a collection of stories told by a group of travelers on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. Of these stories the most noted are &quot;The Knight's Tale&quot;, &quot;The Wife of Bath's Tale&quot;, &quot;The Miller's Tale&quot;, &quot;The Reeve's Tale&quot;, and &quot;The Parson's Tale&quot;. Chaucer, born in the early 1340s (the exact date is unknown), lived a most notable life and had a profound impact on English literature. Much of his works are influenced by love and his distain for the Church in the form of satirical humor.

If you don't know what it's about, the Canterbury Tales is a collection of stories told by a group of pilgrims on their way to Canterbury Cathedral. The tales are told as a way to entertain each other on their journey and the one who tells the best tale will earn a fine meal paid for by the other travelers. This is actually an incomplete work as Chaucer died before completing it, but it is a fine example of early English literature and one of the most important pieces of the English Canon.The tales here vary in length and content as to the prologues and epilogues containing the goings on of the party members. Chaucer writes with a great sense of humor and, since he is writing in the language of the common folk, the content contains many lewd and bawdy jokes and events. It is a very entertaining read and if one wants more than just entertainment, there is a lot of social commentary about life in medieval England that can be gleaned throughout the text.I was a little unsure what to expect when I read this and don't be turned off by the introductory prologue in which our narrator introduces all of the characters. It can be a little long and dry in parts, but it helps to give a clear picture of the characters in the party as they interact with one another and tell their respective tales.Added note: I had to read this again for another class and this time we read it in the original Middle English. Having read the Canterbury Tales earlier, I appreciated the fact that I already had a handle on the general storyline of the tales and could instead concentrate on the nuances of the language and the beauty of the rhyme scheme.

Kent Hieatt and Constance Hieatt. This volume includes a critical introduction and a helpful glossary written by the editors.The text is arranged in a format utilizing a facing-page translation.Chaucer spoke and wrote in the London dialect of Middle English which was popular during his time. In THE CANTERBURY TALES he used the device of having a diverse group of people tell two tales each while traveling together on a pilgrimage from London to Canterbury, the location of the Shrine of St. Thomas A' Becket.Almost every social type of the fourteenth century is represented among the pilgrims such as a knight, lawyer, doctor, cook, miller, nun, merchant, monk, priest, squire and several others. Chaucer is also one of the pilgrims. Readers will recognize many of the characters as being reminiscent of their twenty-first century contemporaries. The physician, for instance, loves gold and makes a lot of money during times of pestilence. He also has a close and mutually profitable relationship with an apothecary.Anyone who recalls being introduced to Chaucer as a student long ago will find the modern texts and translations a welcome change.The result is a Chaucer who is understandable and very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"I suppose that any freshman college student has read some of these Tales.

Being a Medevial book of litererary renown written in poetic language, and a book about people on, well, a holy piligramage, I expected it to be more nurturing to the soul.If you ask me, it is no better than a late-night television cartoon written in a deceptively intelligent language and given a medevial setting There is nothing really noteworthy about the plot, and while its characters were colorful at times (in the case of, say, the Wife of Bath) they were the most assembled from stereotypical moulds (for instance, the Knight.) Many of the stories were choppily done, in fact, a few of them were left half-way unfinished, which was highly annoying. There is no sense of real momentum at all, as it is merely a bunch of randomly assorted short stories that have no connection to eachother and rarely possess deep meanings, and most of the stories are morally disgusting.Really, the book has little purpose other than to give the occasional thrill if you ask me, though I suppose it does achieve something in introducing the unlearned to more vile and double-dealing aspects of human nature (wether or not that is necessary is arguable.) Even the Nun's story had stupid thing against it- the Jews connive to kill a little boy, and in the end \\"are all put in jail.\\" I'm not even talking about Jewish characters, the author just put \\"The Jews.\\" The only truly inspiring story I could think of is the Second Nun's, or perhaps the Knight's.

A lot of the stories have a interesting details and storylines (such as the lavish Knight's tale and the expressively ridiculous Wive's tale). By saying that the book had little plot, I meant the book as a whole. Quite of a few of the stories did have good twists and turns. A great deal of their entertainment value, of course, came from their lack of morality. They are replete with who men who switch beds with other men's wives and old men who marry young girls who deceive the old men and lay with younger men.

There seems to have been a product crossover between this and a modern English tape.Having read the Canterbury Tales I think Shakespeare, the \\"canonical\\" classic English writer, does not compare to Chaucer. The Canterbury Tales are so extensive, whimsical and vibrant that I they should overturn Shakespeare as the celebrated English texts.Chaucer presents us with an entire universe - the England of his time. Over a dozen people from all walks of life tell their tales, women and men, rich and poor, criminal and saintly. Reading the Tales is like reading a textbook on medieval England, but one that's come to life and had been soaked with the warmth of Chaucer. He mocks any and all aspects of society and is not above toilet humour - but for me this hardly detracted from the work, instead making it more real and unelitist. In fact it is largely due to Chaucer and his unelitist use of the vernacular English that the movement of using the language of the people for literature started.Of course there are difficulties. The work is in Middle English. But please please please don't read a \\"translation\\" into Modern English! The original is so musical, so understandable that the extra effort in decoding does not compare to how it appears. I'd imagine a translation to be very flat unless the translator was almost divinely inspired. Chaucer's language is not that difficult, just read aloud and phonetically and follow the rhythm and rhyme of the verse. This will make most words easy to understand.Some tales (esp. the 2 prose tales) have been considered boring by many readers. Still, get an edition like this that includes them all. In Chaucer's overview of England, you won't find everything interesting. You won't laugh at all the jokes, some of the humour will be lost on us all through the 6+ centuries separating us and him. Sometimes he will be overbearing, pompous, dogmatic. But as a whole, the work still does an amazing job at describing medieval life: in terms of satire, language, poetry and meaning."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"I read Chaucer's \\"Canterbury Tales\\" in Middle English in college.

Still, I was very impressed with the way Chaucer told his story. I confess I was awed that a writer from 700 years ago could frame his tale around a long journey and people it with specific characters, each of them very, very real, from how they looked to how they spoke. On top of that, I was impressed with the way each traveler's chosen tale revealed something about that particular traveler: the Miller's Tale could not be told by the Prioress, for example, or vice versa. Each tale said something about the values of each teller.I don't know how the versions I read relate to this particular \\"translation.\\" My review is really about \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" themselves, not about this particular edition.

How 'bout that? This book has been out six centuries, so I guessed another 15 years would not hurt me. Chaucer's facility with language, his ability to rhyme, his familiarity with the human condition, and his ability to link the human conditions to elements of people's trades and careers at this time truly make this book one which paved the way for many other satires, multi-person narratives, and rich, nuanced tales of particular events at particular times.This book is endlessly satisfying. I found Chaucer's poetry to be very intelligent, with allusions to the work of the day, to cultural references, to fashion, to religious beliefs, to prominent figures in the world at that time, and most of all, to allowing his imagination not to be limited by expectations on the limits of his writing. The stories in the book come via the relating of experiences told by travelers on their way to Canterbury. At times, the stories are considered too dry or too preposterous or perhaps they are too derivative. But Chaucer imbues the multiple characters, the minister's wife, the metalworker, the barrister, the civil servant, with characters who respond as mentioned to stories, if the stories are not seen to be up to scratch. Many of the stories concern sexual hijinx. Some concern convoluted family relations, some concern work concerns. Chaucer's currency with the lives and ways of many in 14th century England make the book rich and satisfying. He was a master poet and it seemed that Chaucer enjoyed spinning these tales for the more privileged who would have read this book at first. It is not surprising, however, that the book has remained current. The interests, themes, and topics from which Chaucer very ably spins his tales remain relevant today."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"The Canterbury Tales is so appealing due to it's diverseness. Chaucer was involved with every level of society during his time. This is shown with how the characters are so well-rounded. The short, but insightful description of the travelers is also helpful in picturing this group riding on thier way to the shrine of Becket. A great book everyone should read, but one of those you have to be in the mood for.

A storytelling contest between pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. This is probably the best translation I have read. It does have some downfalls the author excluded some of the tales including the Parson's tale which is actually meant to be a conclusion(Chaucer died before he could finish the tales). Other than that the book is very good. It does break some myths and sterotypes we have about people of that time and some of the stroies are rather humorous and could still be considered humorous in todays society."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"This version of the Canterbury Tales (Everyman) contains all of the tales (including the rather tedious prose tales), and is in the original language. As anyone planning to read the Tales will be aware, old English is not easy! This book takes a lot of time to read. Is it worth it?Yes. But a qualified yes. As an insight into life during this time in history, and particularly as a demonstration of how little humans have changed over the centuries, this book is very useful. Many of the tales are quite amusing and interesting. On the other hand, many tales are filled with rather drawn out, tedious sections, and a couple are just plain boring.For a person who wishes to read most of the major English classics, this book must be read, and I think the only way to really appreciate it is in its original form, not in modernised English. For this purpose, the Everyman version is excellent, as it features convenient gloss on each page, so looking up difficult words can be done at a glance, which disturbs the flow a lot less. I would highly recommend trying to read the book in as short a space of time as possible, though, because you do get used to the grammar and vocabulary, and while it is fresh in your mind, it allows you to read the rest of the book with a lot less glossing.Be aware that I read this book for personal interest, not as part of any particular course, so I am reviewing from the point of view of a general reader, not a literary scholar."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"The book stated in was in \\"good\\" shape, but I was say it is a little less than good, but still useable.

I look forward to reading the other tales independently. For all who like to have people raise their eyebrows as they see you reading such a prestigious sounding book (which, unlike Shakespeare, requires little explanation if you are familiar with the times) you should look into this work. Chaucer does an excellent job hiding sub-plots within the compelling tales. This is a classic which I will read without being forced to by my own will for a 4.0 GPA :-).

In The Wife of Bath, the portrayal of women is extremely controversial. The question of whether Chaucer was a misogynist or supported women's liberation is a passionately discussed topic. Based upon Chaucer's various portrayals of women, he was not a male chauvinist who desired superiority over women. Chaucer portrayed women through his opinion as an Englishman in Medieval England, where the common view was that women were subordinate to men. This is seen in the Wife of Bath's contradictory personality as well as the characters of her tale.To understand the importance of feminist criticism, it is important to know what it is and stands for. Feminist literary criticism is the term for analyzing literary works through the examination of female points of view, concerns, and values in comparison with the time period and culture. In Mary Wollenstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights Women, she asserts the observation \\"Women, I argue from analogy, are degraded by the same propensity to enjoy the present moment; and, at last, despise the freedom which they have not sufficient virtue to struggle to attain.\\" One of the primary purposes of feminist literary criticism is concerned with \\"uncovering the contingencies of gender\\" as a cultural, social, and political system and instrument of domination. (Jehlen) Meaning, that their goal is uncover any iniquities placed upon women due to cultural setting, political standpoints, or social foundations.Although there are immutable biological differences between men and women, these differences create various social differences in different societies. One society may be completely different than another, at least in their treatment of the separation of gender. Also, in a patriarchal society, such as England in Chaucer's time, the separation of gender involves more than just social differences, but also the idea that sexual differences are the same as sexual inequality (. Rigby) It is inequitable to be judgmental of Chaucer and his views of women, as anti-feministic as they are, because Chaucer was from a completely different social construct and historical time period.Through Chaucer's Wife of Bath, as well as the characters in her tale, he portrays various views of women within Chaucer's time. He represents women as unchaste and unruly in the Wife of Bath, Dame Alice. He also depicts women as helpless and overlooked in the raped maiden of The Wife of Bath's Tale. The queen within the tale is shown as gracious. However, the women questioned by the knight portray a sense of only worldly desire. The old woman shows the wisdom of women, although it seems that she is submitting herself to her husband, she has control over him.His portrayal of Dame Alice is the antithesis of the stereotype for women in Chaucer's time. She was not pure an innocent, as she confessed that \\"I won't remain altogether chaste\\" Alice was not submissive to each of her husbands, she chose to rule over them. She strikes fear into the town and its parish to the point where she gets and does whatever she wants. The fear and respect the town has for her is seen in lines 459-463 of the General Prologue: \\"In all the parish not a dame dared stir, Towards the altar steps in front of her, And if indeed they did, so wrath was she as to be quite put out of charity\\" The Wife becomes such a powerful feministic force, at times, by being able to masquerade around town with the qualities and luxuries of being a man and appears to be so happy not following the typical and stereotypical roles set for women at her time and throughout most of history. The Wife of Bath is a zealous woman who freely admits to all the lust, the conniving and the egocentricity that defines her. Dame Alice has radical views about women and their position within a marriage, especially for a time when women were expected to be passive within a marriage. This direct opposition to previously set roles for women is what defines her character.However, the Wife of Bath, while seemingly an example of feminism in all of her qualities, is actually inconsistent with herself.. She is, instead, a mockery of herself. The Wife of Bath is inconsistent in her belief structure. While, at times, she claims to be able to beguile her husbands into doing whatever she wants, creating a view of herself as strong and independent, she often gave into what her husband would want. She freely admits that men are far more intelligent than women appear to be in lines 440-442 of her Prologue \\"One of us two must give in, without a doubt; / And since a man is more reasonable/ than woman is, youmust be patient \\"Nevertheless, since I know your pleasure I'll satisfy your physical pleasure\\". In this quote the Wife of Bath not only concedes that men are more reasonable than women, but also that a good woman and wife will do and give up whatever is necessary for her husband to be satisfied. If the Wife had really been what she appeared to be externally, she would not have admitted that men, in a general stereotype, could contain more reason and intelligence than women could. This quotation leaves an unanswered contradiction about the Wife of Bath. Chaucer easily contradicts the Wife of Bath by showing and telling more personal sides of the Wife of Bath and thus proves her to be much more of a hypocrite and much less of a archaic feminist then originally thought. The Wife also diminishes herself, and all women, by explaining that all women can be bought, in lines 413-417 of her Prologue. \\"And Therefore I tell every man this truth,/ Let whoever can, win, for everything is for sale,/ With an empty hand men cannot lure hawks,/ For a price I would endure his lust,/ And make myself a pretend appetite\\" The other travelers within The Canterbury Tales also accept her as a rebellion of women's position. The Pardoner requests that the Wife teach them. This also defies biblical and cultural standings on women's positions, as teachers, that they are not to teach over them, as explained in 1 Timothy 2:11-12 of the Judeo-Christian Bible.The Wife of Bath also reverses the roles of Husband and Wife in some of her descriptions of her marriage, as in lines 154-159 of the Wife's Prologue:\\"A Husband I will have, I will not desist, / Who shall be both my debtor and my slave, / And have his troubles along with it/ Upon his flesh while I am his wife, / I have the authority all my life/ Over his body and not he\\"She is dictating that she will have total control over herself, her husband, and their household, contradictorily to cultural and biblical standards, as discussed by C.S. Lewis in his work \`Mere Christianity', \\"The function of the husband is to see that this natural preference if hers is not giving its head. He has the last word to protect the other people from the intense family patriotism of the wife\\" The Wife sees the relationship between men and women as a battle in which it is crucial to gain the upper hand. She uses tactics, which were seen as the only stereotypical form of defense for women: sexuality, duplicity, and vulnerability. Her armor was indeed necessary. Medieval England presented women as second class citizens, viewed as goods and chattels, with no financial independence. They were often beaten, and it is clearly in the Wife's nature to protect herself. She uses weapons like her sexuality and her youth to make her husbands suffer, so much so that they feel impotent. This weapon was highly effective with first three husbands who she managed to dominate, \`But since I had them completely in my hand' and they handed over all of his land and property as she withheld sex in order to get her own way with them.The Wife also used a weapon of deceit and she claims that women have this weapon from birth. She tells her audience that she would deliberately pickarguments and accuse her husbands of the very sins she herself is guilty of, because she admits that attack is the best form of defense. The Wife claims that all the other wives are better treated than herself, and commonly uses her weapon of nagging. She accuses her husbands of being cheap, complaining about extravagance of the neighboring women. She easily attains power over her first three husbands in this way, as they usually submitted for the sake of peace, as she notes, \`They were most happy when I spoke fairly to them,/ For God knows I nagged them spitefully./ The Wife ruled over her husbands.The maid in The Wife of Bath was a small character role, and yet her fleeting moment in the story is extremely important. The characteristics of this woman seem to have the ability to go to all women. She is vulnerable and innocent, as she is still a maiden. The only thing known about this woman is that she was overpowered by the knight and severely taken advantage of. \\"From which maid at once, in spite of her protests,/ By sheer force he stole her maidenhood\\" This example of male domination within a tale is not atypical. Chaucer shows women's weakness in her.In the Queen, Chaucer shows the graciousness of women, as fickle as it might appear. Despite the fact that the Queen knows of the wrongdoing of this man, she begs for his life. It is ironic that she, a woman, is fighting for this man's life after what he had done to another woman.The various women that the knight questioned provide insight as to what Chaucer thought about women. The majority of the answers that the knight acquired were monetary or tangible, such as money, fine clothes, lust, or beauty. Once the idea that women \\"take we great delight/ in being considered dependable and trustworthy. / and able to hold steadfastly to one purpose, / and not betray things men tell us\\" However, this idea, which was the only virtuous answer was quickly dismissed because it was allegedly \\"not worth a rake handle\\" It was not plausible for a woman to be considered virtuous, which is ironic, since being virtuous was the feminine stereotype.The old woman, which gave the knight the correct answer, shows the wisdom of women. She required the knight to pledge his honor to her before she revealed the answer. This was wise of her; it caused the knight to base his later decisions on everything he stood for. She was foul and haggard in appearance. The knight was excruciatingly upset at the fact that he needed to marry her due to her appearance, age, and class.Women were portrayed in various different ways, through the Wife of Bath as well as the characters of her tale. Chaucer did not hold any animosity against women or strongly desire to subdue them, he merely believed what he knew, which was female subordination within his society."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"Why did I think this rendition of The Cantebury Tales was translated into modern English?

Truly if one wishes to understand how English became an important literary language, then the best place to start is by reading Chaucer's &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"In the General Prologue of The Canterbury Tales, the descriptions of religious characters resemble some of Boccaccio's characters, in the sense that a pious title and appearance does not make a pious person. The characters with holy occupations run the full spectrum of good and evil. The Prioress and the Monk are benign characters, with mostly harmless vices and tendencies. The Prioress attempts to be dainty and \\"to counterfeit a courtly kind of grace\\" (6). The Monk is described as a \\"fat and personable priest\\" who enjoys hunting and eating to the scholarly life in cloister (8).The first corrupt pilgrim we meet is the Friar, who \\"knew the taverns well in every town / And every inkeeper and barmaid too / Better than lepers, beggars, and that crew\\" (9). For a fee, the Friar grants confessions. He avoids the downtrodden in favor of the wealthy and \\"anywhere a profit might accrue\\" (9).Unlike the Friar, the Parson is the ideal country priest, living by example. He is poor \\"Yet he was rich in holy thought and work\\" (16). \\"Holy and virtuous was he, but then / Never contemptuous of sinful men\\" (17). Along with the Parson rides his brother, the Plowman, also an honest worker who lives by the Gospel: \\"he would help the poor / For love of Christ and never take a penny\\" (17).The Summoner rides with the Pardoner, and neither is described as a good man. With a pustular face, the Summoner scares children. He is \\"hot and lecherous as a sparrow\\" (20). His job gives him power over the diocese, since he summons people for excommunication. The Pardoner carries relics with him, and makes his money by selling \\"Our Lady's Veil\\" and a \\"gobbet of the sail\\" of St. Peter's boat (22). A salesman and a charlatan, the Pardoner reminds us of Brother Cipolla in Boccaccio's sixth day, tenth story.The pilgrims rationalize their weaknesses with their beliefs. The Wife of Bath says that Jesus \\"spoke to those that would live perfectly, / And by your leave, my lords, that's not for me\\" (261). Controlled by passion, she \\"never used discretion when in love / But ever followed on my appetite\\" (275). She quotes Paul's teaching to justify her many marriages.The Wife of Bath is not the only one grappling with the scripture to justify her behavior. Even Chaucer at the end makes a retraction of the text, possibly because of his personal faith or to prevent a backlash. In the final page, he prays \\"that Christ have mercy on me and forgive me my sins\\" (489). His retraction contains similarities to the \\"Author's Conclusion\\" in The Decameron. If his readers enjoy the tales, Chaucer urges them to praise God. If they were displeased with the tales, he invites them to blame his ability as a writer. He lists his body of work, retracting it all. However, as clever as Chaucer proves to be in the previous 480 pages, this list seems more like an advertisement than a renouncement."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"This is a very enjoyable reading of The Canterbury Tales, rendered into modern English verse.

This version is actually preferable to the Riverside Chaucer and the Norton Critical edition for simply reading and enjoying Chaucer in his original language. The Everyman's library edition is NOT a translation, and includes ALL the tales (unlike the Norton ed.). It's worthwhile reading Chaucer in the original Middle English, despite the difficulty for a modern reader, because of the beauty of the poetry, which can't be translated. The Everyman's edition is the easiest to use, as all the footnotes and glosses are complete and easily accessible on the same page with the text, not in back as with other editions. This edition is hardbound yet affordable and will last several lifetimes.If there were ever a \\"desert island book,\\" Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is it. His story-telling ability is without parallel, and his poetry is magnificent, even better than Shakespeare, which, of course, is not a completely fair comparison, since Middle English is a more musical language than Modern English. Compare, for example, the sound of Italian to the sound of modern English, and you'll know what I'm talking about. Check out, for starters, the Pardoner's Prologue and Tale (the basis for Bogart's Treasure of the Sierra Madre), the Nun's Priest's Tale, and the incomparable Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale. Chaucer's Tales cover a wide tonal range, from hilarious farce, to mock-heroic, satirical, bawdy, to horrific, autobiographical, to High Chivalric and so on.

The two texts run together making reading almost impossible."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"Most people probably associate \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" with stuffy hoary old English professors and musty craggy libraries. It doesn't help that many english classes assign the Middle English text to students. Though the original language of the Tales doesn't present insurmountable difficulties for the modern English reader, many may find the task daunting nonetheless and completely miss out on all of the good stuff. This edition presents the tales in modern verse (while still maintaining the rhyming couplet form of the original). Numerous footnotes also illuminate the vocabulary of Chaucer's time (he worked on the tales from around 1387 up to his death in 1400).The tales trace the path of a group of pilgrims from the \\"The Tabard\\" Inn in Southwark, England to just outside the town of Canterbury. A host of interesting 14th century characters all agree to ride to the shrine of the martyr together. The host of the Inn decides to join them and makes things interesting with a contest: the person that tells the best tale along the way gets a free supper upon their return. The rest of the book then consists of twenty-four tales (Chaucer had planned over two hundred, but never finished the project) each told by a specific person linked by comments of the company. Thanks to his position as a foreign diplomat, Chaucer probably found inspiration from Bocaccio's \\"Decameron\\" (written around 1350) in the structure of this work.In the tales themselves, the culture of 14th century England comes alive. Not only that, great stories unfold. The Knight's tale, one of the longest, explores painful medieval love. Two brothers, Arcite and Palamon, in ancient Greece spot a beautiful woman, Emily, from their jail cell. They both declare their undying love for her, and vouch their lives to winning her hand. And since both men want her the two of course turn from loyal brothers into mortal enemies. With some strange luck and the help of the gods, one of them eventually triumphs.Some of the pilgrims don't get along too well. The Miller and the Reeve almost attack each other after hurling insults back and forth. The Miller tells a hilarious tale about Nicholas the Gallant who wants to sleep with an old carpeter's young gorgeous wife. He convinces the old man that another flood (akin to Noah's) is pending, and that he should sleep in a bathtub on top of his house. The old man buys the story, and Nicholas sets to his task. Another wooer of the young woman disrupts the couple, and ends up a victim of flatulence (but the giver of the stink ends up even worse). Since the carpenter was depicted as a fool in the tale, and the Reeve is a carpenter, he counter attacks with a tale about a stupid miller.The tales weave incredibly diverse stories. Some end in tragedy (e.g., the Physician's Tale in which a noble Knight must choose between turning his beautiful virtuous daughter over to a corrupt and lecherous judge or killing her out of respect for her honor), some in comedy. Others relate miracles or demonstrate a simple moral point. Yet others show the prejudices of the time, (the Prioress' Tale contains some nasty anti-semitism) or the fashions of the time (the Canon's Yeoman's Tale declares alchemy a fraud). At least one has a surprising feminist bent (The Wife of Bath's Tale, although 14th century values ultimately win out). Some of the more comical characters are the wards of the 14th century Church: the Pardoner, the Summoner, the Friar, and the Monk. All of them get depicted as hopelessly corrupt and hypocritical (in that they don't practice what they preach while having scruples about profiting from their church offices; corruption in the church was a fiery issue of the day).Two of the original prose tales, Chaucer's tale of Melibee and the Parson's tale, only appear in summary here. Chaucer's first tale gets rudely interrupted by the host who complains that \\"Your dreary rhyming isn't worth a turd!\\" Whether the character called \\"Chaucer\\" (the narrator in many sections) actually represented Chaucer himself remains controversial. The Parson's tale, the last in this book, reflects on the Seven Deadly Sins. Chaucer's \\"Retraction\\" appears directly afterwards. In this he excuses himself for any sin he may have committed in this book. So are the Canturbury tales supposed to be meditations on the sinful and sinless life? Since Chaucer didn't complete the project such questions remain somewhat speculatory (also, Chaucer didn't actually write most of the tales himself - this is a collection of tales mosty from other sources in the manner popular at the time - but he did rewrite them with his own vision in mind). What the Canterbury Tales ended up as, nonetheless, is a collection of romantic, baudy, raucous, tragic, and vastly entertaining stories that gorgeously reflect and effectively evoke Chaucer's times. This, maybe more than anything, helps explain why the book has seen continual publication since the fifteenth century."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"Every English-speaker should read Chaucer. As Dante did for Italian, Chaucer did for English - making the English vernacular an accepted language to write literature with, standardizing usages by inspiring imitation, and making up or adopting literally hundreds upon hundreds of words into the language. Chaucer is where old English ends and Middle English begins.This translated version is okay if you just want to get the story out of the tales, but if you find you like Chaucer even the smallest bit I would strongly urge you to try reading the original Middle English. It honestly is not all that hard if you give it any effort at all and you will be richly rewarded - Chaucer's poetry is simply breathtaking. This translation is decent, but know that you are missing half the show."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"If you've ever considered reading this quintessential Chaucer classic in the original Middle English, don't. Read this version instead (unless you just happen to be really into Middle English). Neville Coghill does a masterful job of bringing the text into a form that is easily absorbed by the modern reader. The narrative flows smoothly in an inobtrusive meter, yet retains all the charm of the original version and enough of the old vocabulary to lose none of Chaucer's intended flavor. Helpful endnotes are sprinkled throughout to offer explanations of some of the more obscure allusions.As to the substance of the text itself, what can one say? The story is straightforward: a motley band of unforgettable characters from every walk of English society, brought together on pilgrimage, and entertaining themselves along the way with a friendly contest about who can spin the most rousing tale. Their offerings range from the noble to the cynical, the bawdy to the pious, and all shades in between. If you've never experienced the richness of The Canterbury Tales, this translation is an excellent choice. Heck, it's an excellent choice even if you have read it before.

It brings out Chaucer's playful language in a way that's more entertaining, because it's easier to understand. Re-reading some of the stories in this book, I was surprised by beautiful statements, amusing turns of phrase, and the sheer bawdiness of his writing.However, I gave this book three stars first becuase I don't put Chaucer on a level with Spenser or Malory, and second because this is a standard Penguin book, which means it's more stripped down than I like. I prefer footnotes to explain references that I might not be able to take in context.

Chaucer was well-read, well-phrased, well-mannered, industrious in literary and legal/administrative pursuits, as I trust I will become, if not already so qualified.As one can see from the above examples, English has changed much over the past 600 years, but not so much as to make these passages unrecognisable. Compare for yourself with a modern translation, and see how much you can decipher.Chaucer is one of the first great English authors of name; most (but not all) literary output in English prior to this time was anonymous. Living in the 1300s, he held administrative posts of importance under Kings from the time of Edward III to Henry IV. Never one to shrink from spending too much money (he had to reapply for pensions and ask for advances several times in his life) or shying away from controversy (he fell out of and came back into favour several times). When he died, he was laid to rest in Westminster Abbey, in a section on the south side that has since become Poet's Corner, largely due to Chaucer, the first great English poet, having been buried there.In addition to his magnus opus, 'The Canterbury Tales', a collection of stories with prologue told by pilgrims on their journey to Canterbury (car radios and in-flight movies were rare in those days), Chaucer wrote minor poems to suit various occasions (his first record as poet comes from having written a poem as elegy on the death of John of Gaunt's first wife, Blanche, in 1369), and the major work for which he was noted for 'Troilus and Criseyde', which showed his sense of humour, power of observation and attention to detail, and keen dramatic skills in language. This work is often compared to Dante and Boccaccio, perhaps the most famous poets of the day. 'The Canterbury Tales' is actually intended to be much longer - 120 tales told by 30 pilgrims (two each on the way to Canterbury, and two each returning). As it is, there are only 24 tales plus a prologue - had it been completed, it would be by far the longest poem in the English language.There is a strong, practical side to Chaucer's writing, sophisticated yet not aloof and removed from the affairs of the world, cultured yet in tune with the better (and more interesting) aspects of the common people, too.This edition by A. Kent Hieatt and Constance Hieatt is designed for those who want the major portions of the Canterbury Tales. Be advised, this is not a complete or annotated set, and the translations from Middle English to modern idiom, while good, do not come with notes to explain possible choices and phrases. This is a book to give the flavour of the major stories, and is designed for readers who want the story rather than the details. As a Bantam book, it is designed for the undergraduate or general reader, and serves this audience well.For those who want the Canterbury Tales in basic form, this might well be the volume to get."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"...combines reviews. One person reviews the CD version of the book, while another reviews a modern interpretation of the middle english. I am here to review the book at hand, which is \\"Canterbury Tales\\" by Geoffrey Chaucer, published by Everyman's library.First off, the book is complete, and rendered in middle English, so it is not for the faint of heart. Notes are given in the margins, although these generally seem useless (if you read the book aloud, you will understand most of the phrases they \\"translate\\", even though your eyes won't believe what your mouth just spoke). Of far greater value are the footnotes to many of the lines, which render in a modern sense some of the more obscure greetings, curses, idioms, etc. the reader is likely to find. Unfortunately, looking down at the footnotes will break your rhythm, and it can be difficult to find your place again, with so many unfamiliar words staring at you. I wish the editors(presenters?) would have put THESE footnotes in the margins, instead of the simpler fare found there (however, I understand that some people may not read the book as easily as I did).The work itself seems complete, however, although I am no scholar of Chaucer. Even the Parson's Tale is found here (it is deleted in many works, since it is little more than a maudlin sermon), although I would skip it if I were you. The poetry is incredibly pleasing to the ear, if offensive to the eye; I cannot stress enough that one should read the book aloud to hear its greatness.I won't review the work, since I feel I have no right to criticise Chaucer. However, the presentation here is good, with the exception of the footnote problem. While this edition is not for the faint of heart (it takes real work to read), I would recommend it to anyone who wants to actually hear the words Chaucer heard in his own head as he wrote this."},{"Title":"Geoffrey Chaucer (Bloomsbury Poetry Classics)","review":"This is not easy to read in Kindle format.

But the selections are winning, and Barbara Cohen's telling, which reduces Chaucer's Middle English to charming fairytale language is well done.Equally effective are the color illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman.Not having seen William Blake's 1809 illustration of Canterbury Tales, I was surprised and disappointed to see he only did one illustration (the pilgrims leaving the Tabard Tavern for their journey to Canterbury), and Ms Hyman has him beat a mile. She even makes some of the implicit elements of the stories refreshingly clear.Take, for example, the illustration in the Pardoner's Tale of the three rogues discovering gold coins under the tree. They had left an alehouse in search of Death, who had just killed a friend of theirs, and had met a withered old man on the road. With great insolence, they insulted, accused, and threatened him if he would not tell they where they could find Death. The old man directs them to a tree in a grove.Ms Hyman, in her illustration, shows the old man was really Death in disguise.

Half a century ago Kennedy warned against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and he took the first serious step toward arms control by ratifying the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. It has been 47 years since the death of President Kennedy, but his legacy lives. When JFK was president, I was very young and did not live in the United States. So, it was interesting to read about the 1960 presidential campaign climate: the difficulties Kennedy faced running as a Roman Catholic and the very narrow margin by which he won the election.Sorensen\\"s book is 758 pages long and exhaustive.

Maybe there was a secret agreement between politicians and the media on reporting events and styles, but it seems that todays world of immediate desire for news and analysis compared to President Kennedys administration of realism and understanding goes a long way to explain why politicians today are viewed in a lesser light.

During this dialogue (in which Bartlett urges Obama to 'get mad'), Bartlett has to tell Obama that he, Bartlett, is a fictious character. It is difficult to list the number of depressing attributes of this column, an opinion writer relying on a screenwriter to use a TV character to give a real, though ethereal, presidential candidate advice about tactics. It seems to me there so many people turned off by Bushworld ( the reality, not the book), that they take refuge in a nostalgia neverland, which has shades of Camelot and JFK.I think that Sorenson - JFK's speecwriter and advisor, is in the same trap as Sorkin/Dowd. I did not know of this book - unlike \\"A thousand day's\\" - before I read 'Counsellor', Sorensons 2008 book. I bought Kennedy, written in 1965, hoping to get a glimpse of what made Kennedy such an inspirational leader. It is however, a hagiography, - take his view on Vietnam \\"in a sense, Eisenhower, Ho Chi Minh and Ngo Diem all helped to shape Kennedy's choices in Vietnam\\". Oh dear, the problems were very difficult; at least Shlesinger's view was that Vietnam was Kennedy's greatest failure. Sorenson's book suffers from too much deference to be credible.What does recommend it are the insight it gives into America in 1960 - the public's perceptions/fears of Kennedy's religion, the overall economic fear projected about rising population and increased automation. Both seem incomprehensible now. I did know something about Dixiecrats, and so Nixon's Southern strategy really doesn't seem like more than an outworking of the obvious, once Civil Rights became an explicit Democratic party principle; I think JFK can take credit for this, even if he took to this platform cautiously. I did not know about Kennedy's tax cut and the confrontation with US Steel.There is a lot to be gained by reading the book, in particular it seems to me to be good primer on Presidential decision making - ask all the questions, role play the possible outcomes, above all apply restraint. But the book is too close to the subject to be in any way objective, and is marred by its lack of objectivity.It does seem to me that Kennedy was inspirational in his speeches and his actions, in the main, were well-judged and effective. But the presence of one does not imply the other, and we are in danger today, of mistaking Obama's elequence with effectiveness.

There is no more &quot;terra incognita&quot; on the maps, and ballooning, sailing, or crossing Antarctica are often reduced to webcasted stunts. If you long to go through jungle, battling snakes and mosquitoes, to find previously undiscovered ancient sites, Hugh Thomson can tell you were to go: Peru. In fact, twenty years ago, he was working in a pub, and a drinker there told him a story involving an Inca fortress that had been discovered, but was so poorly documented, it had gotten lost again. &quot;Not only was it a glamorous idea, it was, unlike most of those told in the pub, a true story.&quot; Finding that ruin seemed more attractive than continuing to tend bar: &quot;I had nothing to lose. So I went.&quot; This is the start of the story of Thomson's _The White Rock: An Exploration of the Inca Heartland_ (Overlook Press). It is no surprise that in this lively and intelligent exploration memoir, Thomson does re-discover the re-lost archeological site, but it is surprising that this is only the first part of the book, not the climax. By the time the book has finished, he has hiked to many lost cities in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador, and reviewed the remarkably complicated Inca history all along the way.Of course the book is full of recountings of mistakes and scares, from embarrassingly split pants to humorous misunderstandings between the gringos and the natives (including a young girl who precipitously falls in love with the author). This is not a how-to manual, but those preparing to explore the area would do well to heed Thomson's words on snakes, guinea pigs, gnats, pack mules, and especially, guides. Much of the book is not just a history of the Incas, but a history of exploration of Inca sites. There are fine summary portraits here of an assortment of strange characters who have trekked some of these paths before Thomson. A prime one was Hiram Bingham, the discoverer of Machu Picchu, who thought erroneously that it was a religious monument to the Virgins of the Sun. This has sparked a lot of New Age nonsense. It was a winter camp for the Inca court, and Thomson's own view of the exalted position of Machu Picchu is simply that the Incas had a fondness, just as we do, for magnificent mountain views.Thomson's exhilarating and self-deprecatingly humorous account of his own travels vies with the ancient history and modern history revealed here. All are expertly told. Thomson follows a trail of Inca history to the almost forgotten site of Vilcabamba, still unexcavated and obscured by thick vegetation. It was the last remnant of the great Inca Empire. Digressions of descriptions of the modern towns he goes through, and a welcome appreciation of the great Cuzco photographer Martin Chambi, are easy bypaths on the way. The book has excellent maps, a glossary of terms from the Spanish and the local Quechua language, and an genealogical chart of the Inca emperors. This is a thoroughly enjoyable book to put our currently fashionable fascination with Inca sites in a realistic context."},{"Title":"White Rock","review":"For a well-written, informative, and painless way to learn a lot about the Inca civilization of Peru and the explorers who discovered it, this may be the best book around.The writer is a British bartender who mounted an expedition to the Inca country in the early 1980s. Retreating -- as did most foreigners -- from the region during the reign of terror by the Sendero Luminoso he returned in the late 1990s to continue his explorations. The author is refreshingly candid, irreverent, and much less pretentious than most explorers and archaelogists. He avoids the \\"gee whiz, I was the first white man ever to overcome incredible hardships and discover a lost civilization\\" claims of many writers.The subject matter is magnificient. The remains of the Inca include far more than the well-known ruins of Machu Pichu and Sacsahuaman (Sexy-Woman to the tourists). The Inca heartland in Peru and the ceja de la selva (eyebrow of the jungle) is as mysterious, little-explored, and rugged as any chunk of real estate on the planet. The author's accounts of his rediscoveries of long forgotten ruins are fascinating, not least for his tales of hardships and humor (...)his way over 14,000 feet mountain passes and through trackless jungles with a variety of feckless companions.

Bedazzled by stories of cities built of stone and overflowing with gold, children dream of hidden treasures in South America. Tales of the conquistadors --- the culture they conquered and the riches they took --- are told throughout the world, inspiring young men and women to leave their homes and venture into the South American mountains. British explorer and documentary filmmaker Hugh Thomson was one of those adventurers.Lured to Peru by the story of Llactapata, a ruin discovered by noted explorer Hiram Bingham but lost again beneath the vines and trees of Peru's jungle, Thomson and his team embarked upon a journey to rediscover the missing ruin. Accompanied by local guides, Thomson hiked the Inca trail through the Andean Mountains to his destination --- encountering entertaining locals, interesting cuisine, swarms of gnats and the occasional snake. Nearly twenty years after his first excursion, Thomson would return to Peru to resume his studies of the Inca ruins.THE WHITE ROCK is not only the story of Thomson's explorations, but also the history of the Inca culture and the archaeologists and explorers who have recorded it. Thomson never hesitates to give credit where it is due, a notable contrast to the often overblown egos of explorers. True to documentarian form, Thomson offers an unbiased, honest account of his travels in Peru, highlighting various aspects of its culture, arts and inhabitants. He also points out what he believes are discrepancies in the historical chronicle of the Incas and offers plausible alternatives. A combination of a history text and travel memoir, THE WHITE ROCK offers the reader much more than other books in either of these genres. Thomson's balance of humor and scholarship makes for an enjoyable reading experience, and the forty-five black and white photographs beautifully illustrate the mystical draw of the Incas.--- Reviewed by Melissa Brown"},{"Title":"White Rock","review":"While planning a trip to Peru, I bought a copy of Thomson's book to get a different spin on the place than that offered by the typical guides and histories. I am delighted that I did. Thomson's witty writing stays away from overly PC sentimentality while still demonstrating a deep respect for the culture and the people of the Andes. Thomson also avoids dry academic discourse and gives the reader some insight into the vibrancy of Andean culture and the richness of its history. Although the book will not tell you what hotels to stay in or what time the train leaves for Machu Picchu, I highly recommend it for anyone considering a trip to the region."},{"Title":"White Rock","review":"Reviewers have noted Thomson's strengths and occasional lapses. I read this after &quot;At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig,&quot; John Gimlette's comparable Paraguayan travelogue, and both books feature young British who find themselves returning to a land they happened upon in their youth (circa early 1980s?) in decades since, contrasting the changes and recording that which endures. Thomson's account avoids Gimlette's overwritten prose, but its own lack of adornment may fail to keep all readers excited. He eschews New Age dippiness or &quot;us vs. them&quot; cute encounters for a more workaday narrative. He tells what he saw, who saw it earlier, and what we know about it--given the wide lack of hard evidence. He always relies on the locals, has an admirably nimble way with translating his excellent Spanish as he conveys his conversations with them, and avoids stereotypes on all sides--except for those ubiqitous German tourists we've all encountered ahead of the rest of us in the most remote places!I wish he had invigorated his account a bit more with less recapitulation of his own often humdrum reactions, but he does this to counter the often romanticised visions of Hiram Bingham, Victor van Hagen, and many others who have explored the terrain before him--and not always as thoroughly as he has. The encounter with the titular White Rock, for example, is nearly subdued, but it sets off the mystery better than purple prose."},{"Title":"White Rock","review":"If you are looking for a book that will entertain, educate, and take you on a trip all at the same time, this is the book for you. Thomson has that dry British wit that is understated and very funny, and his writing is superb. He fills the book with interesting details about Incan life and culture. I am not usually fond of travel books but this and books by Tony Horwitz are great reading."},{"Title":"White Rock","review":"\\"The White Rock; An Exploration of the Inca Heartland,\\" by Hugh Thomson is a probing insight to the heart and soul of the ancient Inca people. The author is an explorer, historian and filmmaker. However, since the Inca civilization left no written records...Thomson constructed his understanding of the Inca piece by piece...step by step and day by day. Consequently he is now arguably one of the world's foremost experts on Peru's early society.The author is modest. He acknowledges that luck played a large role in his successful find of Llactapata. First discovered by the legendary explorer Henry Bingham in 1911...(but he was never able to find it again.) Hence it was lost for over a half century until the remarkable discovery by the young tenderfoot from England. Moreover, Thomson playfully admits in the early portion of the text that luck was evident throughout his humble early beginnings in Peru.The author took twenty years to write this book and provides a seasoned eye to help the reader understand why the Inca build where they did. I was particularly impressed with the meticulous research from beginning to end of this book. To this end, the text has a scholarly quality to it but Thomson's irreverant writting style keeps the narrative lively. Overall, Thomson brilliantly manages to document the Inca people's dramatic civilization and the terrible annihilation of the vast empire by the 16th century Spanish Conquistadors. Recommended.Bert Ruiz"},{"Title":"White Rock","review":"_The White Rock_ by Hugh Thomson is a fascinating, well-written account of both the author's travels to Inca sites in Peru and Bolivia and his efforts to address the big discrepancies between popular conceptions of the Incas and the actual evidence of what they were like, an effort complicated by the fact that the Incas left no written record and much of what know about them comes from the often biased accounts of Spanish conquistadors and from the supposition of archaeologists.Though Thomson visited a number of Inca sites throughout the book, Machu Picchu clearly dominates, as it is most famous Inca site, the one most likely known to the average person. The very familiarity of the place he wrote can lead to misleading impressions of the Incas and Thomson regretted that few visitors to Peru traveled beyond it.The author recounted a number of misconceptions regarding the site. Many suppose that it is a major site for archaeologists; it is not, as the site was thoroughly excavated by the famous (and some say \\"over-enthusiastic and cack-handed\\") Hiram Bingham in the early years of the 20th century, who acted \\"with the over-confidence of an age of certainty\\" and so thoroughly excavated the site that little was left for later researchers. In addition, later restoration efforts to prepare the site for tourists were often done with little thought for archaeological preservation.Speaking of Hiram Bingham, he is famous for having discovered the site. Thomson wrote that it would more accurate that he should be famous for having publicized the site. A geographer by the name of Antonio Raimondi had a site labeled as Cerro Machu Picchu on a map made in 1875 and in 1902, a full ten years before Bingham visited, Don Enrique Palma of Cuzco visited the site and left an inscription on its walls.Tour guides and many popular books on Machu Picchu speak of the city's great religious significance, but Thomson interviewed archaeologists who said that the site was not a religious shrine at all. Occupied for less than a hundred years, largely forgotten after it was abandoned (something the Incas would not have done if it was a religious or especially a pilgrimage site), it was basically a winter quarters for the Inca emperor (known as the Inca), a country estate or leisure complex, a \\"gigantic hunting folly\\" that was \\"both too impractical and ostentatious\\" to maintain, basically an old country house and pleasure resort built on a grand scale at the height of the Inca Empire and then \\"left to fade away as royal tastes and fashion moved on.\\" While the site was attractive both for its milder and warmer climate that Cuzco and its abundance of game, it was an expensive locale to live in.Those who maintain the notion that the site was religious point to the great number of female skeletons unearthed at the site, labeled by many as \\"Virgins of the Sun.\\" In fact later studies showed that the proportion of male and female remains was about equal; this misconception dates back to one of Bingham's colleagues, George Eaton, who in 1912 wrongly identified most of the remains as female.Another misconception (albeit one that the Incas themselves promoted) was that they were the only or the first Andean or South American civilization. Incan rulers like the famous Pachacuti (originally known as Inca Yupanqui but who took the title Pachacuti or \\"Transformer of the Earth\\") promoted within their own society powerful origin stories, as Pachacuti, though important as he led the first wave of Inca conquests to Bolivia and Lake Titicaca, bringing an area from Colombia to Chile, some 3000 miles and about the size of continental Europe, under Inca control, carefully promulgated official versions of Inca history.In reality, the Incas were adept at incorporating whole tribes into the Empire, as large numbers of people or even whole populations were taken away from their homelands to serve as tribute labor elsewhere in a system called mitamayo (the workers were called mitimaes). Thomson compared the Incas to Stalin in the way that they moved around client peoples, shipping them from one part of the empire to another to do jobs, moving potentially difficult peoples into new, uninhabited (and distant) areas, even splitting towns into upper and lower sections and having them compete in providing services to the State and the town itself.The Incas were noted for appropriating the ruins of previous civilizations, altering them as they saw fit, manipulating and distorting the meaning of the ruins and of history. In reality, the Incas, \\"[f]ar from imposing order on an unruly bunch of savages, ...were merely the latest dominant tribe (and a short-lived one at the that) in a series of Andean civilizations\\" that had existed for over 2000 years previously. The Incas built their achievements on earlier civilizations such as the Moche of the north of Peru (noted for their magnificent pottery), the Huari, and the Tiahuanaco culture (who produced magnificent stone buildings) near Lake Titicaca.Thomson also recounted many other aspects of the Incas. He noted their careful uses of terraces and canals, giving them the ability to support thousands where only dozens now live today. I had heard of Peruvian mummies before, but I had no idea of their role in Inca society; when each Inca died, his estate or panaca continued to maintain his palace as if he were still alive, with the Inca's mummified form resident in the old palace and brought out for feast days and coronations (Thomson wrote that the\\"mummy lobby\\" was very powerful towards the end of the Inca empire and was a system open to much abuse). Other interesting topics covered include the building, planning, and maintenance of Inca roads, Inca architectural methods and styles, and the course of the Spanish Conquest, particularly the struggles of the last Inca Emperors.The book is also a great and witty travelogue particularly of Peru, with maps and many photos."},{"Title":"White Rock","review":"If you are going to Peru... get this book.I live six months a year in the Andes, in Peru. My house overlooks the beautiful valley of Cachora, and from my porch I can look up at the mountain where the newly excavated ruins of Choquequirao are (a \\"must see\\"). Now, when my friends come to Peru, to see Machu Pichu and/or the ruins of Choquequirao, I give everyone a copy of \\"The White Rock\\".Hugh Thomson has done a great service to all those visiting these ruins. He has not only written an engaging, and often funny travel log, but he has given us a history of the Incas. He shines a new light on Inca life and customs. Their principle cities: Machu Pichu, Choquequirao, Vilcabamba and Chuquipalta [the White Rock] are discussed in the book..But, this book isn't just about Cusco, Machu Pichu or Choquequirao - but it really is. It isn't about the Inca's culture and their vast empire (c.1438-1572) - but it really is. It's not about various unique, brash, daring, larger-than-life individuals who Thomson encountered, but it is. Nor is it about Hugh Thomson and his extraordinary journeys through the Inca heartland - but, then again, it really is. This Book is an incredibly accomplished blending of all of these, as well as a lively, dauntless travel log of an exception explorer.Thomson's pendulating writing has the unique ability to freely swing back and forth between various perspectives. He writes as an anthropologist, a historian, an archeologist, an explorer, and a traveling bum. He weaves these perspectives together while never losing the story line - The White Rock.Thomson's ultimate destination (Chuquipalta [the White Rock]) takes him on the famed Inca Roads, transversing the Inca empire, yet all the while gathering information and simultaneously reflecting on the beauty and uniqueness of their culture. He reveals how the Incas were brilliant administrators, masters at constructing roads and stone cities while never discovering the wheel, the arch, or developing a written language. Thomson clearly chronicles the conquest of the Incas from the time of Francisco Pizzaro (and his murder of the Inca Atahulpa) through Pedor de Cieza de Leon and the execution of the last Inca, Tupac Amaru, in the main square of Cusco.Bottom line, If you want to journey though the lost world of the Incas, then this book, matched with a solid guide like \`Let's Go: Peru, Bolivia &amp; Equador' (see my review), will enrich you as you explore the Inca heartland. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"White Rock","review":"I read this book some years ago and as a fan of travel literature placed it near the top. However, I did not write a review at that time. Now, having recently returned from a two week vacation in Bolivia and Peru, I can see what a fine book it is. The Incas were the last of the world's great civilizations to be \\"discovered.\\" Since they developed in isolation and were not literate, we must try to interpret their mind set from what has survived these 500 years. Mr. Thomson manages by observation, rigid scholarship, many miles on the trail, along with canny speculation to get inside the mind of the Inca as well as anyone. For all of you romanticists out there this book comes as close as is possible to the modern possibilities of adventure."},{"Title":"White Rock","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot more than I thought I would. I had just finished reading 'the Last Days of the Incas\\" and...let's say it didn't have a happy ending: the good guys lost! So I read this mostly to educate myself about present-day Peru--because I'm hoping to go there next year.Well this book just captivated me. I did some backpacking trips in my youth so I could relate to the author's rambles about the back country of Peru. I was thoroughly entertained by his tales of Quechuan market-women, bar-room characters, eccentric archaeologists, sweaty bus-rides and tiny Peruvian towns with one or 2 dusty bottles of beer for sale. This lucky author went to a Peru that us 2-week tourists will never be able to see.Even more I enjoyed Thompson's depictions of the last Incas, hiding out like bandidos in this wild country. He makes us see their nobility and defiance, and oh gosh, what a great movie it would make!The only thing I didn't enjoy about this book was Thompson's attempts to tear down our romantic image of the Inca civilization by telling us that they were tyrants who oppressed the Andean cultures that they absorbed into their empire. Um, yeah I suppose they did have to oppress a lot of peasants to build their mighty stone works! We know that the Incas had a system of labor taxation in which the subjects contributed a few months of labor for the State. Was that oppression, or was it about the same as the 5 months' labor every year that goes to pay our federal taxes? Or was the Inca 'mita' system more to be compared with 'public works'? We do know that the Inca system of roads, terraces and storehouses enabled them to keep everyone fed in times of famine. I guess that is like our modern 'welfare' system?Anyway, I wanted to tell the author \\"lay off the Incas already, whatever they did, the Spaniards were 100 times worse!\\"Other reviewers have noted the sense of anticlimax: Thompson's prose fails to convey the drama of actually being in these mysterious, legendary ruins. Yet he writes evocatively about the mountains, the gorgeous vistas, and his thoughts about the Incas' relationship with mountains and stone.The most memorable part of this book was the last few pages, wherein Thompson writes of the messages woven into Peruvian textiles: the story of the execution of the last Inca Tupac Amaru and the hopes of vengeance against his executioners. \\"The idea of an Inca who would return and set his people free became a cult called the Incario, which kept a rebellious fervour going for long after Tupac Amaru's execution.\\""},{"Title":"White Rock","review":"A good travel and exploration book, if not a great one.Hugh Thomson regales readers with two periods of exploration he took into the deep Andes to rediscover and discover Inca ruins. First as a twentysomething &quot;it beats working&quot; trek with like-minded buddies, then later as a more mature filmmaker who returned after a few decades to visit areas he missed the first go around.This book has the same theme as some of Bill Bryson's or David Horwitz's travelogues. The history is interspersed with tales of the journey, giving background and understanding as to why certain places are worth visiting. Thomson does not have the wit or humor of either, nor does he try to force it. Some humorous events are recounted because they happened and happened to be humorous, but this author does not ply the wry observation or witty discourse.The result is a solid travel book, if at times less than entertaining. The reader is treated to a good geographic illustration of the high Andes as well as snapshots of life in and around those mountains today. The history of the Inca people after contact with the conquistadors is interspersed with tales of Thomson's journeys in a way that I suspect will give almost every reader a much better understanding of what happened during the clash of these two empires. Flashbacks are also provided of the famous explorers who led the way toward western appreciation of Inca roads and cities and whose material allowed Thomson to discover some sites only hinted at in the 1800's by his predecessors.The author does delve into what apparently is an age-old enmity between archaeologists and explorers. In Thomson's telling, archaeologists are a bit miffed that explorers go careening around and get credit for discovering sites when archaeologists are the ones who must spend the hard, laborious years understanding them. Explorers see archaeologists as a bit blinded to the forest by the trees -- you could spend a lifetime uncovering Machu Picchu with a toothbrush and miss the lost cities waiting under jungle cover just a ridge or two away. Although Thomson gets along well enough with the archaeologists he bunks with early on, the explorers of the past who uncovered the lost Inca cities and whose treks serve as both the guidon and inspiration for Thomson's own, were anathema to contemporary archaeologists and remain so.This is a long book that does drag in parts. Sometimes, when the action the author is describing isn't very interesting, the reader is treated to its unfolding anyway. Editing could have helped weed out some parts that didn't seem to enlighten the story. However, overall this book does what it sets out to do. It tells the story of an intrepid explorer and the finds he makes, describes current life in the high Andes, and tells the story of the demise of the Incas."},{"Title":"White Rock","review":"I found this book to be very similar to Thomson's A Sacred Landscape, still a good read though, I enjoyed the combination of exploration, history, and archaeology. His description of Boliva in the 1980s was captivating."},{"Title":"White Rock","review":"In 1982 at the ripe old age of twenty-one, Hugh Thomson sets out to explore the Inca ruins of Peru and Bolivia. Quite the achievement!Trekking here and there throughout the Andes, oftentimes at altitudes above 12,000 feet or plunging straight down into the jungles, Thompson rediscovers lost ruins, pieces together past and present theories of these vanished remnants, consults with locals, imbibes indigenous beverages and puts this all down in writing twenty years later.It is also a great history of this long-ago civilization...from the conquistadors to early and present-day discoverers of the ruins. Thompson peppers his story with wit, humility and reverence.Enjoyed it."},{"Title":"White Rock","review":"Simply fabulous.

While many similar books will mostly focus on specific aspects such as the Inca conquest, the Culture, the rediscovery of Machu Picchu by Bingham etc, this covers it all and then some.I thought it struck the right balance between not being overly detailed nor an oversimplification. Yet on saying this I found Hugh's thoughts on the 'Mystery' of Machu Picchu to be the most plausible of several books I have read on this subject.I really enjoyed reading about some of the characters Hugh writes about that were involved in many of the recent discoveries in Peru, as well as his wanderings in the areas around this region.It was also refreshing to read an honest and funny account of what goes into mounting an expedition such as this, I grow tired of the bravado and self promoting you endlessly come across.

It was recommended by a fellow Earthwatch explorer. After working on the dig, my travel companion and I explored many areas in the Villacabamba. My singular disappointment in traveling Peru is that I missed the sites of Llactapata and Choquequirao. This book spiked such interest in those locations that I felt a deep urgency to see them for myself. In spite of that miss, I don't think Peru would have been the same without the experience of this book. I also thoroughly enjoyed the author's switch between his history, Inca history and more present history.

By reading it, you will know what awaits you up there(including bowel problems and insect plagues) and get a feeling for the country and its inhabitants. The White rock tells the story of about twenty years of treks by Hugh Thomson and his British pals in the Andes region, mostly along ancient Inca paths. About all the interesting sites, both natural and man-made, are covered: Machu-Pichu, Cuzco, Lake Titicaca, etc.If you are interested in the Incas but only moderately so, in other words if you want to know more about this ancient people but do not have enough time or enthusiasm to read a detailed scholarly study about it, you may consider buying this book. In its pages, you will get small doses of Inca history interspersed among more contemporary material.You will also learn about the ancient and contemporary explorers of the land, starting with Pizarro and ending with present-day archeologists,travelers and photographers like Von Hagen, Chambi, etc.If you are looking for a finely written travel account with strong literary flavor, this book is NOT for you. Contrary to what is stated in the reviews on the back of the book, the author is a not a great writer at all. He is quite incapable to describe either the landscape or the inhabitants with real talent.Also owing to his poor writing skills, he completely fails to conjure up the magical atmosphere of the great ancient sites and recreate for you the lost world of the Incas. The travel narrative itself, besides being quite uneventful, is quite plain and completely lacking in romanticism. At many points, it is even anticlimactic, like when, in his first expedition, Hugh Thomson rediscovers the lost Inca fortress of LLactapata.They suddenly see it at the end of an exhausting hike, they camp there, clean up the place a little bit and then off they go...! I had expected Thomson to give more details about what was after all the stated goal of his first expedition to Peru but the fact is that the rediscovery of Llactapata takes less than one page. Unfortunately, the rest of the book is little more than a succession of similar superficial sketches.The digressions about the Incas are not without interest but quite unoriginal. Considering the author's complete lack of training in history, archeology or anthropology, some of his peremptory judgements about this ancient civilization sound pretty silly: was Machu Pichu nothing more than a holiday resort for a hedonistic emperor and his court? Did the Incas choose the location of their buildings in order to enjoy the great views that they could afford? I doubt it...To put it briefly, this book is really nothing more than a long and rather mediocre National Geographic article. It is a good companion to kill time on the beach or in the dentist's waiting room."},{"Title":"White Rock","review":"This book is more about the self absorbed author than Peru or the Inca.

The selection is excellent and of interest you the young reader. The commentary is quite relevant as are the pictures which accompany it. I find that often now, our young people go all the way through the early grades in school and many of them have never heard of Browning, much less read his poetry. This was the sort of stuff my generation and the generation before it grew up on and cut our teeth on. I do not feel I am any worse for the wear. I am fearful that we are bringing up an entire generation (rightfully or wrong, although I feel it is the later) of young folks who will have no appreciation to this great art form and will miss a lot. This book helps. This entire series helps, as a matter of fact and I certainly recommend you add this one and the others to your library. Actually, it is rather fun reading these with the young folk and then talking about them. Not only do you get to enjoy the work your self and perhaps bring back some great memories, but you have the opportunity to interact with your child or student. It is actually rather surprising what some of the kids come up with. I read these to my grandchildren and to the kids in my classes at school.

The main argument is that TRIPS emerged primarily as a result of good organization and transnational consensus building on the part of a small group of leaders of multinational corporations called the Intellectual Property Committee (IPC), and the coincidence of the perceived interests of that group with key governments such as that of the United States. In the last chapter, Susan Sell shows how these circumstances did not exist for other Uruguay Round agreements and that, as a result, those agreements were weaker. She also argues that the TRIPS agreement represents an overly aggressive interpretation of intellectual property rights to the advantage of multinational corporations and that a political backlash against this is already underway.This is a real contribution to the field for the following reasons. There is a very good overview of the rationale behind the granting of intellectual property rights and a very careful analysis of who wins and loses with strict enforcement of laws protecting intellectual property rights. There is also an unusually detailed analysis of the slow evolution of intellectual property laws in the United States that set up the conditions for a change toward more extensive grants of rights in the last two decades. The analysis of the politics of negotiating the TRIPS agreement is an excellent and original contribution to the growing literature on the Uruguay Round. Finally, there is a very good theoretical discussion, relevant mainly to theorists of international relations, about the so-called \\"structure-agency\\" problem.I would compare this book favorably with Wayne Sandholtz's excellent work, High Tech Europe. It also holds up well in comparison with Laura Tyson's Who's Bashing Whom? I don't think it is a blockbuster book, but rather a solid piece of scholarship in an important and somewhat neglected area and that it will represent a standard for future scholarly work on its subject."},{"Title":"Private Power, Public Law: The Globalization of Intellectual Property Rights (Cambridge Studies in International Relations)","review":"This is a very important and highly topical book, which shows in an accessible and persuasive manner how big business has played a decisive role in guiding the international regulation of intellectual property protection. It should be read not only by scholars and students of international politics, but by all those interested in how intellectual property relates to and impacts on international trade, the global expansion of the US entertainment, software and drug industries, and also the health needs of people in developing countries including those suffering from HIV/AIDS.One of the book's strengths is that it is very well researched, being based on interviews with many of the key players. Another is that the author lets the facts speak for themselves rather than rams home a particular point of view. Nonetheless, the book is bound to make the reader feel indignant in the way that the global intellectual property regime seems to favour the interests of the rich and powerful over those of the poor and powerless.In short, the book is now the definitive guide to the politics of TRIPS, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Private Power, Public Law: The Globalization of Intellectual Property Rights (Cambridge Studies in International Relations)","review":"This book changed the way I look at intellectual property rights and conceive of their protection. Before reading it, I had a rather naive view of the subject. I assumed that IP rights were necessary incentives for innovation and that their protection was a desirable and welfare-enhancing objective. After all, intellectual property comes with heavily loaded words, and its constitutive terms (\\"intellectual\\", \\"property\\" and \\"rights\\") are associated with positive values: the liberty of intellectual pursuit, the sanctity of private property, and the inalienability of rights. On the opposite, infringement of IP is described as copying, as piracy and as theft.My first surprise upon reading Susan Sell's book was to discover that this conception of IP rights as being pro-business, pro-market and pro-trade was fairly recent. At the end of the nineteenth century, when the Paris and Berne Conventions first put the issue on the international agenda, IP rights were construed as \\"grants of privilege\\" that were explicitly recognized as exceptions to the rules against monopolies. Through much of the twentieth century, US courts held to this conception of property rights as a kind of monopoly privilege, and their concern was to limit abuses of monopoly power. It was only in the early to mid 1980s that the courts quit referring to patents as monopolies and began applying stricter terms on copyright infringement. At about the same time, the US government began to vigorously pressure violators of such property rights abroad by threatening trade retaliation under Section 301 of the US Trade and Tariff Act.My second shock was to realize that strong IP protection can be detrimental to the interests of developing countries and that it can even reduce welfare in developed countries. Again I am stating the obvious: if patents and copyrights are monopoly privileges, their direct effect is to restrict competition and to limit the externalities associated with knowledge as a public good. Historically, Japan and South Korea have developed by using foreign knowledge and technologies without always paying due royalties, and developing countries oppose the strengthening of the international IP regime. For much of its history, the United States developed within a climate of weak IP protection and was a net importer of technologies. As Susan Sell states, \\"the notion that one set of uniform standards is appropriate for all countries and all industries defies both economic analysis and historical experience.\\" Another argument quoted by the author is that \\"in so far as innovation is no longer driven by external breakthroughs but by the routine exploitation of existing technologies, property systems designed to protect and exclude have a chilling effect on innovation because they hinder vital diffusion of existing knowledge bases.\\"This book was an eye-opener for a third reason: as the title suggests, in the case of intellectual property private power made public law. Private sector actors succeeded in getting most of what they wanted from a global agreement on IP protection, which now has the status of international public law. This is how the plot can be summed up. Initially, acting primarily through industry associations in the 1970s and 1980s, US firms urged the government to pressure foreign government to adopt and enforce more stringent IP protection. They sought and won changes in US domestic laws - most notably Section 301 and 337 of the US trade laws. A handful of US-based transnational corporations formed the Intellectual Property Committee (IPC) and spearheaded the efforts to secure a multilateral instrument codifying their interest in stricter IP protection. They redefined inadequate IP protection abroad as a barrier to legitimate trade, and worked to build an OECD consensus for a multilateral trade-based instrument. To codify this instrument, they were able to appeal to an existing organization, the GATT, eschewing the traditional venue of the World Intellectual Property Organization because WIPO lacked enforcement powers and was dominated numerically by less developed countries. The culmination of these efforts came with the adoption of the 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) administered by the World Trade Organization. The transnational leadership of the IPC was decisive in the achievement of TRIPS. The eventual collapse of developing countries' opposition to the inclusion of intellectual property further facilitated the IPC's goals. Developing countries were willing to accept the IP agenda in exchange for concessions in agriculture and the Multi-fibre Arrangements. They also hoped that cooperation on TRIPS might lift pressure they were experiencing from the United States through Section 301 and other bilateral means.The story of twelve US CEOs who changed the course of world intellectual property law and policy is an engaging one: a drama with the archetypal elements of wealth, position, and power. Suitable for readers in law, politics, and the wider social sciences, Private Power, Public Law is an articulate, highly readable, and engaging account of the evolution and making of the TRIPS Agreement and of the impact that global norms for intellectual property have had on the welfare of the world's poorest populations. This book will appeal not only to scholars interested in law, economics, sociology, political science, and anthropology, but also to the general reader. It may also change the way you look at intellectual property rights in the future."},{"Title":"Private Power, Public Law: The Globalization of Intellectual Property Rights (Cambridge Studies in International Relations)","review":"This book provides a fascinating perspective on the politics underlying the TRIPS Agreement.

StebbinsThis 1961 book discusses currently-made American arms, practical European products, and many interesting obsolete arms (\`Foreword'). It tries to state the basic principles on what makes a good handgun or cartridge, and what doesn't. The author thanks those who helped in this book, and those who support the right to keep and bear arms. America has the biggest market for pistols in the world (Chapter 1). Other countries restrict their people by oppressive laws. Pistols proved practical in Korea (p.1), and civilian life, such as in the wild (p.2). Chapter 2 discusses the features of many pistols, and the trade-off between a revolver and a self-loading automatic. Chapters 3 to 9 go into more detail. Chapter 10 discusses the deadliness of handgun cartridges. Even a blank cartridge can be harmful at close range. Chapters 11 to 13 discuss each type of cartridge.Hand-loading cartridges, gunsmithing, and care of a handgun are in Chapters 14 to 17. Chapter 18 discusses \\"Plinking\\", shooting as an informal sport or practice. Handguns for women and children are the topics in Chapters 19 and 20. Chapter 21 explains the choice of a target pistol (as does Chapter 5). Competitive shooting on a target range is covered in Chapter 22. Hunting with a pistol depends upon the game (Chapter 23). While the military may not condone personal sidearms for non-officers, may will keep one for personal defense in combat (Chapter 24). \\"Safety Measures\\" are explained in Chapter 26. You should always be cautious to prevent an accidental shooting. Good gun-handling is best taught to youths. A gun can be dangerous if loaded with high-velocity cartridges. This applies to very old guns, or those in poor shape."},{"Title":"Matriarchs: Great Mares of the 20th Century","review":"You should already be somewhat knowledgeable about the history of American Thoroughbreds before reading &quot;Matriarchs&quot;. Otherwise this book will probably remind you of a long Sunday School spin through the 'begats' in the Book of Genesis.However, Bowen has produced a treasure for those of us who like to flip to the back pages of &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; every week and pore over the genealogy charts of the stakes winners. If you catch a loved one doing this and muttering phrases like, &quot;Inbred 3x4 to Nijinsky II, eh? No wonder she toes out,&quot; then &quot;Matriarchs&quot; could be 'the' perfect birthday gift.Edward L. Bowen is an Eclipse Award-winning Turf writer, formerly editor-in-chief of &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; magazine, and currently president of the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation. I believe his most recently published book is &quot;Nashua,&quot; which is volume eight of the 'Thoroughbred Legends' series.In &quot;Matriarchs&quot;, Bowen ambles gently through the race records, sales histories, and 'begats' of 20th century America's twenty-four most influential Thoroughbred matriarchs. There are also black-and-white photographs and (of course) genealogy charts of the mares and their famous descendants. The author fleshes out what could have been a very dry volume of statistics with anecdotes about the mares and their colorful owners, and some of the theorizing that goes into the breeding of these beautiful, courageous animals. Here is his riff on The Bride, a foal of Somethingroyal:&quot;In 1969, Somethingroyal foaled a Bold Ruler filly who went to Ogden Phipps [as part of a foal sharing agreement]...Named The Bride, she was unplaced, but produced stakes winners At Ease and Heavenly Match. Short of winning the Derby or rescuing children from a burning building, there was little The Bride could have done to avoid being known in history as the one-who-was-not-Secretariat.&quot;&quot;Matriarchs&quot; should be savored for its rich detail, not read in one sitting. I suggest you dip into its pages at bedtime and drift off to Bowen's amiable and knowledgeable tale of La Troienne and her descendents, or the perils and triumphs of the imported Rough Shod II, or the career of the great champion, Cicada."},{"Title":"Matriarchs: Great Mares of the 20th Century","review":"Well written and reasearch by a leading expert in the field of thoroughbred horse racing.

Each proverb also has a pronunciation guide above the proverb, and the equivalent Western expression listed in the back.Intelligently organized and beautifully displayed, this small collection stands out in my small library of proverbs as a precious find. While some proverbs can easily be guessed giving them a more universal and perhaps practical appeal, I appreciated the number of paradoxical proverbs that made me think.Proverb addicts, students of Japanese culture, and tourists will find \\"Even a Stone Buddha Can Talk\\" a fascinating, fun book.

In this book, REVIVAL GOD'S WAY, you will learn not only that we need revival and that revival only comes as we turn our eyes away from sin and the world (1 John 2:15-17) and we turn to Jesus in passionate praying.For those who feel that they are weak in prayer, this book will challenge you to take serious the words of Scripture that call us to pray such as Matthew 6:5-9; Mark 11:22-24; Luke 11:1-13; 18:1-8; John 14:12-14; Acts 2:42; Romans 12:12; Ephesians 6:18; Philippians 4:6-7; Colossians 4:2-6; 1 Thessalonians 5:17; Hebrews 4:14-16; James 5:16-17; 1 John 5:14-15; Revelation 5:8. You will see how prayer can break the chains of sin and bring us into a powerful relationship with Almighty God. You will see how prayerlessness is a sin (1 Samuel 12:23) and that the Lord moves on those who seek His face (Isaiah 55:6).Truly this book is a great book and a timeless challenge to the Church. So many modern churches have turned away from the Word of God to embrace postmodernism, technology, and money but how we need the Church to shake off this slumber and embrace her true calling to preach Christ and seek His holy presence.

Written in non-technical language, it's very clear and accessible to the educated reader.Written by a psychologist from Harvard Medical School, only treats Greek-, Jewish-, Italian-, and WASP Americans, using case studies, some of individuals and some of \\"mixed\\" marriages (made up of the preceding [sub]cultures). Valuable because it treats a subject regarded by some as a blindspot in the American social sciences, but doesn't ride the hobby horse of political correctness or engage in a polemical denunciation of \\"mainstream\\" American culture (but *doesn't* pathologize non-mainstream ones either).Very readable (I read it in two days); also broken up into different sections so you don't need to read it straight through if you're only interested in certain parts.

It deals with the intersection of race and gender expectations in the nursing profession of the US, up till 1950. In many countries, nursing was a predominently female occupation, and it had to struggle for level of responsibility and recognition, against a male medical profession.But in the US, there was an overlay of race. Negro women also entered the profession. Or at least tried to. Hine describes how the white female nursing associations responded, by imposing racist exclusionary requirements. In part to try and garner some \\"respectability\\" from the white male doctoral hierarchy. A pernicious choice that led to the formation of parallel Negro nursing groups. For those of you who may have heard of the Negro baseball leagues, there are clear parallels."},{"Title":"Black Women in White: Racial Conflict and Cooperation in the Nursing Profession, 1890-1950 (Blacks in the Diaspora)","review":"This is a very powerful and informative book.

Bravo!"},{"Title":"JOHN MILTON COMPLETE POEMS AND MAJOR PROSE","review":"Others have suggested the Norton is the edition for college students. I disagree. The Hughes edition is definitely worth the money. The notes are the best -- in reading criticism on Milton, there's usually plenty of references to Mr. Hughes's notations themselves. This is the standard, accepted text. This is the complete poems, with his Latin and Italian poetry appearing ajacent to an English translation. There's a generous selection of Milton's prose, too.Spend the wad and buy the book. If you're reading this, then you're a bibliophile, no doubt. For the rest of your life wouldn't you prefer to have the best edition of Milton on your shelf, or will you be satisified with a $9 Signet Classic? (I tossed mine.)Check out the Dore Illustrations for PL, too.BTW, after reading Areopagitica, I believe that everything Jeffereson said was a debt to Milton."},{"Title":"JOHN MILTON COMPLETE POEMS AND MAJOR PROSE","review":"This is still the most extensive, best-annotated, one-volume Milton set available. As the blurb above indicates, Hughes presents all the poems and prose in chronological sequence, so it is easy to trace the great poet's increasing facility, and later mastery, in both areas. We start with Milton, the fifteen-year-old student, translating Psalms from the Hebrew as well as passages from the love poems of Ovid and Properius. We then follow him to Cambridge, where he really starts assimilating all his classical studies, first fashioning imitative Latin elegies followed by his first poems of native genius, &quot;On the Morning of Christ's Nativity,&quot; &quot;On Shakespeare,&quot; &quot;L'Allegro and Il Penseroso.&quot;Hughe's edition is invaluable as a tool for students, scholars, or general readers. The notes never get in the way of the text, but will lead the reader to relevant sources should he/she desire to learn more about a given allusion or want more background. If the reader is patient, and actually reads all the material that comes before &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, he/she will be rewarded with a richer understanding of Milton's magnum opus. Please be advised that if you have made it that far, don't stop there. &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; and &quot;Sampson Agonistes&quot; are powerful examples of epic poetry as well. I personally feel that &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; has had almost as large an impact on modern fiction in particular (Dostoevsky and Flaubert are prime examples)as has &quot;Paradise Lost.&quot;Blake said that Milton was of Satan's party without knowing it. Actually Milton's prose does open up some interesting possibilities in that sphere. In &quot;Areopagitica&quot; he advocates for the necessity of evil. He was, as history has amply recorded, hardly a defender of central authority. He was emphatic about individual liberty and wouldn't be dictated to by Pope or King.There are several short early biographies of the poet at the end of the book. All paint a portrait of an idiosyncratic genius who suffered numerous setbacks both physical and political, particularly in his last decades. He was an extraordinarily brave man, who has taken some heat from Virginia Woolf and later feminists for his &quot;ill use&quot; of his daughters, who, the line goes, he kept in ignorance and near slavery so that they could aid him as ameneunses after he went blind. If such detractors had actually done any wide reading on the subject (Shawcrosse is an excellent source) they would not have made such charges. Though not what could be described as a &quot;loving father,&quot; Milton certainly never inveighed against his daughters to remain &quot;indentured&quot; to him, nor did he subvert any marriage plans they arranged (none were forced into &quot;arranged marriages&quot; either, though the practice was still common in that era). He didn't tutor them in the Languages he asked them to transcribe, per se. But this begs the question, if they were'nt taught Latin, Greek and Hebrew, how would they have been able to act as scribes in those languages in the first place?I'm sorry to see that this volume is now almost $100. In this day of large trade paperbacks, perhaps a more affordable edition will be forthcoming."},{"Title":"JOHN MILTON COMPLETE POEMS AND MAJOR PROSE","review":"Coming from someone who was so frugal that my choice of major in college was influenced by the fact I could find most required reading for a dual degree in philosophy and English literature in the library rather than pay my hard earned money for books that were not worthy.... this is my strongest possible recommendation: This was one of the few texts I actually shelled out money for in college without regret and would even purchase AGAIN!

The writing is good and well-paced, the characters are engaging. One can't help feeling for the brother even though he deserves the worst punishment. The heroine is not too silly and hero is HOT! His angst is believable and the ending - although a little abrupt - was satisfactory (of course!)Usually I fall by the wayside in romantic Westerns, but this time I was fully engaged throughout. I even felt sorry for the Deputy Marshall!Not strictly a keeper, but I did enjoy it and the cover was extremely enticing LOL"},{"Title":"After the Ashes","review":"I've not read this author before.

Lorelei, the novel's protagonist, reads like a Kentucky cousin of Scarlett O'Hara's who heads west after the Civil War's conclusion.

Will be looking for more books by Cheryl Howe."},{"Title":"After the Ashes","review":"The characters are very human, fallible and damaged. Cheryl draws you in nicely, and with plenty of twists and turns she keeps you involved."},{"Title":"After the Ashes","review":"This book is probably more of a 3 1/2 star rating in my estimation. However, it is refreshing to read a newly written Western romance novel by a promising, new author.Christopher Braddock, the hero of this western, is a bounty hunter during the years following the Civil War. He is looking for a gang of robbers that recently killed while robbing a stage coach. He is particularly pursuing young Corey Sullivan, hoping that once he finds Corey, he can be convinced to tell Braddock about the leader of the gang - his true prey.When Braddock finds Corey in the opening pages of the book, it is at Corey's New Mexico ranch. Corey's sister, Lorelei, our heroine, has just arrived from the East to make a new life with her brother. Lorelei confronts Braddock and makes certain he does not find Corey. She believes that Corey is innocent and tells Braddock the same. Thus the stage is set for the beginning of Braddock's and Lorelei's romance.This book captivates you within the first few pages. It is an enjoyable story that keeps rolling. We have the hero swearing he will never love and he lets the heroine know that in the beginning, halfway through the book, and several other times. I guess he reasons it is okay to pursue Lorelei if she understands that whatever happens between them - it is just for today. Lorelei is hurting from the loss of her fiance back east and finds herself drawn to Braddock although she realizes that he is not the type to ever settle down with her.Lorelei is a very likable, sweet, and genuine character. Her devotion to her possible outlaw brother is deep and she foolishly risks her life, Braddock's life, and Corey's life more than once attempting to protect her little brother. Braddock is a very interesting character, sexy, and I enjoyed being in his mind - seeing things through his eyes. You come to really like both the hero and heroine in this story.Corey, conversely, is a real brat. He was, on one hand, very selfish, and on the other hand, very protective of his sister. He can see when someone else could hurt her or expose her to danger but has a difficult time seeing that he does so himself repeatedly. Usually, I don't enjoy secondary characters much. But Corey is a stinker and at the same time, has real spunk. He was so mean and ornery to Braddock, standing up for his sister, that it was actually amusing. I guess it is mostly a love/hate relationship that the reader most experiences with Corey.Although Braddock and Lorelei are likable and you can understand their mutual attraction, their relationship fell a little into the Blah category. I believe this is partly due to the fact that both leads believed their relationship was only for the moment with absolutely no future. I know this is an overused plot line in romance novels but it seemed to have more of an impact in this story. Possibly it is that we see both Lorelei's and Braddock's vulnerability. The sensual scenes between the two rate about a four out of five (see More About Me for rating guidelines)and were placed well within the story.Another reason this book fell short of a higher rating is that it is written as a romance novel but little time is spent on the actual romance. The personal time, between the leads, fill few pages. There are satisfying scenes between the two but this book spends a lot of time with or on secondary characters. Although all of the parameters are there for romance writing, this comes off more as a historical novel.I liked the characters and saw that the relationship between the leads had great potential. Somehow, it just didn't live up to a great romance. It is not one I will keep to read again although it did have many great moments. I look forward to future books by this new author."},{"Title":"After the Ashes","review":"Liked the characters and the story line was unique. Felt badly that lorilei's brother Corey was such a loser!! He didn't deserve her. The few love scenes were very explicit. Braddock and Lori were both dealing with the past trauma and uncertain whether there was a life ahead for them, as individuals or together. It was a very good book. See HK's review. It's on the mark."},{"Title":"After the Ashes","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The characters are three dimensional and interesting people. The secondary characters are fully developed interesting people also. The author did an excellent job with building up [intimate moments] throughout the book. The first [intimate moment] happens towards the beginning of the book, which usually means the rest of the book will be boring. Not so in After The Ashes. The [intimate moments are]hot and exciting throughout the book. This is a wonderful debut for the author. I highly recommend this for lovers of western romance."},{"Title":"After the Ashes","review":"In 1872 New Mexico Territory, bounty hunter Christopher Braddock seeks out stagecoach robber Corey Sullivan, the weakest link of a gang that killed the driver. At Corey's spread, he meets the outlaw's sister Lorelei who will do anything to keep her brother safe. Although he believes nothing she says as he hates southern belles, Christopher makes it clear that he will take her brother to jail, but his prime goal is to catch the gang leader Mulcahy.After talking with Corey, Lorelei visits Braddock in his hotel room to offer a deal if he would keep her sibling safe. He ends up buying her food and protecting her, pretending she is his wife when temporary Deputy Marshal Langston arrives to arrest her for abetting a criminal. Soon Braddock accompanied by the Sullivan siblings is on the lam from the law even as he falls in love with Lorelei.Western romance fans will appreciate the fine story line of AFTER THE ASHES. The tale is filled with action, but it is the strong cast that makes it fun to follow. Braddock is the brooding hero who still is fighting the Civil War inside his head until Lorelei returns him to the living. Lorelei is the ultimate family loyalist perhaps too much so because her manipulative brother does not deserve her love or her assistance. Cheryl Howe writes a charming American romance that will please sub-genre fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"After the Ashes","review":"This is one great American historical read, you get family drama, conflicts,love great sex and I could go on and on about what this book has but I think you need to read it for yourself.

After the Ashes was the first book I downloaded and started reading. It's about a hot bounty hunter and it was free. It's now available for $3.99 on amazon or you can borrow it for free.The book starts off with Christopher Braddock on the hunt for his latest bounty, Corey Sullivan, who is wanted for robbery and murder. Reaching Corey's ranch he comes upon Corey's sister Lorelei. Lorelei knows her brother is in some sort of trouble but refuses to let the bounty hunter in her home and protects her brother the best she can since she believes he is innocent. Little does she know that she's being played by her own brother.\\"Riding away, he wasn't sure if he had just met the stupidest woman in the West, or the bravest.\\"Now I hate reviews that go on and on, paragraph after paragraph, about what happened in the story. I won't give away anything other than it was a good story. There's always a chance that when you get a free Kindle book, that book is going to be crap because of horrible grammar errors. This wasn't the case with this book. I found myself rooting for Lorelei and Braddock to get together and to admit their love for one another. I also found myself wanting her to beat the hell out of her brother for the mess that he gets them all in but she doesn't do that. She does something better. Something that is right.One part in the book that I found enjoyable is when Corey sends her to Braddock to talk him out of hunting him down. He pretty much tells her to take care of him anyway she can. Even if that means sleeping with him. Though nothing happens during this meeting you can tell the sexual tension is there between the two and it's only a matter of time before something is going to happen.\\"Sweetheart, next time we meet, I'm going to be looking for a lot more than a meal.\\"There's an awesome love scene outside that makes me all of a sudden want to be in the company of a bounty hunter or at least go camping. Maybe camping with a sexy bounty hunter? Maybe even camping with a hot guy who has a fake badge?Anyway, let me push that fantasy aside and finish. I liked this book. The loves scenes are sexy and will get you going. The hot guy in the cowboy hat on the cover is pretty great too. Seriously I can't stop staring.

However, as with other books such as Plato's Republic, we are ultimately dealing with undercrediting human beings for their complexity. It seems that Hobbes is only able to see humans capable of being evil, brutish, and short, while not considering many, many, many other qualities a human can take on. I cannot blame Hobbes for being appaled at the sight of the war he fought, but this is only one face of human kind- a violent expression of the will to power if you will. Besides, if humans are so corrupt what guarantees that the people under the supreme ruler will not ultimately destroy the ruler with their brutishness? Above all, if all men are evil brutish and short how is it ever possible to find a ruler that may take over the people?I cannot however discredit Hobbes for his influence on the more correct philosphers, such as Nietzsche (remember the Ubermensch?) and fortification against anarchists. We could have, however, done with out his obvious influence on nihilism, though it is not his fault forbeing misread.A note on the edition: as always I was satisfied with the quality of Penguin Classics in introducing the text and the annotations.

The only difference from the original is that there are fewer capitals and italics. Hobbes used them for emphasis very much more than a modern writer would, and their pruning in this edition makes the text easier to read.Modern political philosophy begins with Hobbes. Before Hobbes, writers for centuries had accepted the divine right of kings or did not think much about the origins of government. Hobbes provides reasons as to how and why men come together to form government. He starts with the assumption that the organized state is a choice. The alternative is the \\"state of nature\\", where there is both a \\"right\\" of nature and \\"laws\\" of nature. Hobbes uses these terms in a very individual way. The \\"right\\" of nature is \\"the Liberty each man hath, to use his own power...for the preservation of his own Life\\". The \\"laws\\" of nature dictate that each person should seek to live with others in peace, and should only retain the right to as much liberty as he is willing to permit others. These \\"laws\\" are found by reason, and are utilitarian rather than moral. Hobbes is simply saying that if men think about their situation, reason tells them that giving up their natural rights in exchange for others doing likewise is the best means of self-preservation, even though actually doing it is contrary to human nature.On human nature Hobbes is cynical. Reason suggests advantages stem from co-operation, but unless men are constrained by an external authority this is outweighed by instinct. Men are fundamentally competitive and selfish. They are also roughly equal in ability so no one person can impose his will on others, and the most one can hope for is to protect oneself from others. Life in the state of nature is \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.\\" Men are therefore driven to create government via a pact with others to give up their natural rights to a sovereign authority, which may be either an individual or an oligarchy (Hobbes prefers the former). Hobbes uses the concept of a \\"social contract\\". It is not an historical event but a logical device to describe the ongoing basis of consent to government. Hobbes' view of human nature is such that he allocates absolute power to the sovereign. Limited government, he believed, is unworkable for men are too prone to division and selfishness, and \\"a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand.\\" Influenced by the divisive years preceding the English Civil War, Hobbes grants the sovereign the power of censorship, including the ability to prevent discussion of religion because such discussion leads to conflict. Anybody seeking to preach a new religion should be treated as a criminal.Had Hobbes been writing a century later then religion would almost certainly have played no part in his writings. He himself was not a religious man. His concern with religion stemmed from its role in the conflict leading to the English Civil War, a period during which he lived.Is there an ultimate right of rebellion against the absolute ruler? The answer is to be found in the nature of the social contract. Men give up their natural right to self-preservation to a sovereign in order to to better achieve it. If a situation arises where the sovereign cannot ensure that safety then society is dissolved. Can any action by the sovereign be challenged? Yes, if a man is conscripted into military service (an obvious threat to life) in circumstances where the survival of the state is not threatened. If the survival of the state is threatened then so are the lives of its citizens, and in these circumstances the sovereign can impose conscription. Hobbes adds that even in this case a citizen should have the right to replace himself with a volunteer if one is available.\\"Leviathan\\" is not an easy book, not helped by the fact that the English is that of a man born just 24 years after Shakespeare. However, it is an important work that makes a good study companion to Locke's \\"Second Treatise\\", which argues for limited government."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"What you first need to know is that the word \\"Authoritative\\" used in this edition refers to the fact that it utilizes several different manuscript versions to capture what Hobbes meant to convey. However, what is not mentioned is that this is an abridged version of the text. Much of parts III & IV are omitted. Which is a bit disappointing.I gave this 5 stars because Hobbes himself deserves 5 stars for his provocative ideas. If you're familiar & comfortable with Shakespeare's language, you won't be put off by the cavalier spelling & grammar rules of Hobbes' era. This is not to say that Hobbes writes in blank verse (haha), but that the language is a bit arcane & takes some acclimatization.Footnotes were, for the most part good - in the body of the text, foreign phrases were translated for those woefully ignorant (like me) of Latin & ancient Greek. However, in the post-ceding criticisms, this very positive practice was discontinued. As in, whole footnotes in Latin & German were not translated. So, get your browsers set to Babelfish, baby.The accompanying criticisms are a mixed bag - some worth reading, some, not so much. They help elucidate some points - which is great for a casual reader like myself. Others just serve to annoy.Eitherway, if you're looking for a definitive edition of the Leviathan, don't look here because you will miss about 1/3 of the actual text which Hobbes wrote down. If you want to skip the parts about theology & much of that which was tied into the Christian Commonwealth, then this is your edition."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"I finished reading Leviathan a couple months ago, but cringed every time I thought about writing a review. The book is large at over 700 pages and covers so much ground, a review would have to be a book in itself to do it justice. Due to Leviathan's philosophical content and somewhat antiquated language, it's very slow going. Each page needs time to digest.So I'm not going to bother writing a real review. I will just say that Leviathan is a 5-star classic and worth your time, if you can deal with reading political philosophy. Hobbes divides the work into four major sections:Of Man, in which he discusses human nature and why civilized people prefer peace to war. Here Hobbes establishes the primary reason that people form a government to rule over them: to safeguard them from enemies, both external and internal.Of Common-wealth, in which Hobbes first talks about the several forms of government and the pros and cons of each. He then explains the rights that a government has over its people; according to Hobbes, the government can do pretty much anything it wants to. Finally he goes into the things that tend to weaken or dissolve a government.Of a Christian Common-wealth, the longest section, in which Hobbes accepts the Bible as the word of God and quotes from it numerous time to bolster his position in support of a powerful government.Of the Kingdome of Darknesse, the shortest and strangest section, in which Hobbes veers away from the topic of government and instead focuses on religious practices and beliefs of the day that he deems improper and inconsistent with the Bible.It took me months to read this, but I came away with great respect for Hobbes and a better understanding of politics. I can't say that I agree with everything I read, but I think the majority of his arguments are sound and convincing.Five stars, no doubt in my mind. But it's a dive into the deep end, so you'll probably only finish it if you really appreciate and enjoy philosophical discussion!"},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"Hobbes' sole claim to fame these days is the out-of-context quotation from him that life is &quot;nasty, brutish, and short.&quot; The full quotation from chapter 13, section 9 which inveighs against the state of war, in concluding the statement on man's condition in such a state, is &quot;and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.&quot;-Beats me why &quot;solitary&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; are left out of the popular quotation-The point is, this is the condition Hobbes wanted to AVOID, not to justify! He had just lived through the bloodfest known as the English Civil War in which many of his friends were horribly slaughtered because of their religious beliefs. His whole point in writing this book was to advance arguments that one should not go to war over differences in religion. His controversial alternative is absolute obedience to the state and secular authorities. This alternative combined with the quote, noted above, so maddeningly and frequently taken out of context, have given Hobbes and his work the undeserved reputation as, well, curmudgeonly. One might ask what sort of book you might write if you had just witnessed the horrific slaughter and loss of esteemed friends that Hobbes had. You would probably write a book urging peace at any price even if it meant undue subjugation to the state at times. This is exactly what Hobbes did.-Hobbes belongs to that majestic, good-natured and unflappable tradition of brilliant English heretical political and religious writers including, among others, David Hume (well, Scottish too) and Bertrand Russell who seemed merely humored by the ecclesiastics calling down hell-fire upon them and similar dire threats from men in power. Scholars are STILL trying to debunk the work of these prominent men, among others more obscure, with little success it must be said.- Yes, the prose can be rough-going at times. But if you want an argument against war, specifically war over religion. This is the masterpiece to set your nose to. Once you've finished, it's hard not to smile when you think of Hobbes and his essential decency amidst the turbulent times in which he lived."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"Like most books, Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan is divided into chapters. But it is also divided into four \\"Parts.\\" The Prometheus edition (not to be confused with the Penguin edition) includes only the first two parts, though they sell it as if it were the entire book instead of only the first half. Any other edition would be better than this.If you want a good edition, you could go with the Hackett edition, edited by Edwin Curley, modernized and with the important variants (translated into English, of course) from the Latin edition of the Leviathan published during Hobbes' lifetime. A good edition that is not modernized is the Cambridge edition edited by Richard Tuck. (Having an editor does NOT necessarily mean that the text has been reduced; they often serve to rid the text of previous publishing typographical errors.) Which of these you should get will depend upon two things: Whether you are interested in the variants from the Latin edition, and whether you are comfortable reading something written in the 1600's. For most people, probably the modernized Hackett edition would be best, as many people have difficulty with 17th century English. But if you want Hobbes' exact words, I recommend the Cambridge edition. Whenever buying classic texts, which edition you buy can be extremely important, as the dreadful Prometheus edition demonstrates."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"Leviathan is one of the first books written after philosophy begun to detach itself from the Catholic inspired medieval thinking, also marking the beginning of the influence philosophy received from the scientific thinking, a point not suficiently y explored by Thomas Hobbes but which one we can get with the benefit of hindsight.Leviathan is an old Fenician word for a mythical crocodile, quoted in some verses of the biblical Book of Job, an taken by Thomas Hobbes as meaning the representation of a powerfull governor totally devoted to do his most to the benefit of the Commonwealth. In Hobbes mind the most efficient form of government was monarchy, but he takes a lot of time to analyse also Democracy and Aristocracy. One has to keep in mind that the time the book was written was one of internal revolt, a civil intestine strife in England, and the objective of Hobbes was to lay the foundations for human actions conducive to an equilibrium within the state, ending war.His book can be also be taken as one where many important aspects of Right and Laws are aprehended, from the perspective of a deeply religious anglican man, that tried his best to separate, in his words, the Kingdoms of men (where civil laws are imperative) from the Kingdom of God (Naturall Right). He does extensive analysis of God's Laws and its importance to the balance in the relationship between men.The edition is a very good one, with a good introduction and is a copy of the text as written in the 17th century, exhibiting an archaic English sometimes difficult to understand. Also, some quotations in Greek and in Latin are not translated, despite all the effort the author makes to turn them inteligible to the reader.The book could be understood as antipodal to Machiavellian's The Prince, because power is not taken here as something good in itself, but only as a means of carrying the security and hapinnes the kingdom subjects deserve."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"While I enjoyed the text itself very much, I cannot recommend this particular copy of it. I read parts of it for a class, and wanted to read more on my own, but I simply could not make it through 736 small pages of miniscule print without getting frustrated (as well as getting a headache). Further, the margins are practically nonexistent, making it a poor copy to buy for anyone who likes to take notes in the book. Additionally, the binding is quite weak.I would encourage any interested parties to continue pursuing the 'Leviathan,' as it is a very rich text indeed, but I would recommend finding a different copy."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"To understand Hobbes' LEVIATHAN, the reader must first focus on 'fear.' His contemporaries were terrified of chaos and anarchy and would move heaven and earth to preserve the continuity of the state. Nowhere does he mention the word 'fear' but his real, if underlying purpose becomes clear enough as the reader plows through his dense tract that has as its purported goal to explain the origin of political institutions and to define their powers and proper limits. Hobbes sets up this thesis by first insisting that all of men's ideas originate from sense impressions, which take their cue from the external universe infringing on these sense organs. This emphasis on sense impression led Hobbes next to consider how the external universe manages this neat trick. Motion, according to Hobbes, is the key. Motion naturally leads man, for good or ill, to impact on other men. This impacting may be beneficial, as in man agreeing to help one another respect their respective rights, or it may be harmful, as in man being in a state or war. It was this fear that humanity might start to question the wisdom of the ruling nobility that caused Hobbes to write the longest defense of the royal right of kings ever written. Hobbes cleverly compared man to a wind-up clock: 'That great Leviathan is but an artificial man with an artificial soul.' As the reader follows this geometric logic, he is pressured to accept Hobbes' true premise: that it is better for the common man to put up with the occasional despot than to risk what he terms the horror of 'that condition which is called Warre, and such a warre as is of every man, against every man.'Even if that regime becomes so thuggish that its citizens wish to break it, Hobbes says 'No way.' If these citizens do break this covenant, then Hobbes warns that their lives will be 'solitary, nasty, brutish, and short.' Clearly Hobbes was a man of his times, one who was a paid shill of the crowned heads of Europe. Such a man today we would label as a fearful toady who desperately needs to maintain his own precarious hold on power. So why is LEVIATHAN still read today? Perhaps Hobbes points out the road that humanity might have once chosen to travel. We, like Robert Frost, have thankfully chosen the other less travelled by."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"Tommy Hobbes was Francis Bacon's favorite secretary, and it shows in the math-like precision with which he attempts to build a model of human political interaction -- one that justifies the need for a strong state to hold human &quot;appetites&quot; in check. Hobbes' argument reads like a geometrical proof, which goes something like:We take it as a given that people, like Galilean celestial bodies, are in perpetual motion, moved by appetites for power. The power of a person is his or her present means to obtain some future good. Every person's power resists and hinders the effects of other people's power. Thus, if all people are created equal in a hypothetical state of nature, then:1. From equality proceeds mutual fear.2. From mutual fear proceeds warfare.3. In such warfare, nothing is unjust.4. But reason suggests a better way to self-preservation (to peace): the right and laws of nature.5. The right of nature is the liberty we have to use our power for self-preservation.6. The 1st law of nature is that we ought to strive for peace, but when we cannot obtain it then it's war.7. The 2nd law of nature is that in the interests of peace we will lay down our natural right to give us as much liberty as we would allow others to have against us (the golden rule).8. This mutual laying down of our natural right is a social contract.9. There must be a coercive power (the commonwealth) to enforce this contract.10. The commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign who embodies the will of the people and is granted certain inalienable rights to enforce the social contract.In short, those who fear authority (anarchists, libertarians, etc.) will revile Hobbes, because of power's potential for abuse, but Hobbes would argue that a true Leviathan could never abuse its subjects because it is actually made up of those same subjects (in other words, a roundabout defense of liberal democracy)."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"While most readers pay a great deal of attention to Hobbes' political theory in this work, they fail to realize that the early half contains some of the most ground breaking and revolutionizing treatment of philosophy ever written. In a philosophical atmosphere dominated by Cartesian metaphysics and epistemology, Hobbes' emphasis on the way we use language, rather than &quot;clear and distinct ideas&quot; is simply mind blowing. Hobbes, like Descartes, was interested in laying some &quot;extra-scientific&quot; foundation for the new sciences of Newton and Gallileo. Whereas Descartes seems to have found such a foundation in his relation to God, Hobbes saw it in language. In this sense, it anticipated &quot;The Elimination of Metaphysics through the Logical Analysis of Language&quot; by 4 long centuries. Hobbes' fascinating account of what constitutes &quot;truth&quot; and answers to traditional philosophical problems that apply his theories on language are astounding. While Hobbes' political theory is wrought with the very ambiguities he sought to destroy in philosophical and scientific discourse (e.g. what concretely constitutes the &quot;leviathan&quot; and the &quot;soveriegn&quot;), the ties between language and political theory stayed unexamined for a number of decades, if not centuries. Hobbes' highly original and innovative thought are an inspiration to us all."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"I'm not going to comment on the contents of this book, but I will say that the combination of the binding and the cut of the paper is rather low quality.

The reader, however, must update Hobbes' basic argument by including non-state actors, such as transnational religious groups, drug gangs, etc."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"First off, this is a review of Richard Tuck's Cambridge Text edition of Hobbes' Leviathan. This is one of several excellent editions of this powerful and disturbing work. I can also recommend the Hackett edition.Hobbes is on the short list of philosophers that every person should try to read. This is so for several reasons. He is a superb and witty writer who is capable of expressing his thought in unforgettable phrases and with ruthless logic and consistency. The result is a book that had enormous influence on political thought, on epistemology, on diplomatic thinking and on legal theory. You can trace his influence on Grotius, on Locke, on legal positivism and analytical philosophy among others.And the best part is that in spite of all that cultural impact to read him closely and with attention to his moment in our history is to still feel some of the shock of his effect on his contemporaries.Over his lifetime, Hobbes observed Europe and his own England tear themselves apart. This was the Europe suffering from the effects of The Thirty Years War and England plummeting into revolution and regicide.Hobbes, who started out a great classicist, looked around at his contemporaries and took solace in Thucydides. He developed a theory of a humanity that required strict control to overcome its inherit individualistic rapacity. Hobbes, who was a excellent student of the sciences, read Descartes and Galileo's physics and developed a materialist philosophy that based everything on matter and motion. Even God was material. If He wasn't then He wasn't at all. Hobbes was an excellent mathematician who used geometry and Galileo's work to develop his own methodology for philosophy. Hobbes had seen what religious and political faction could do and developed a theory of absolute sovereignty that gave that sovereign (whether king or Parliament) full control of the public expression of religious observance, of political thought and of justice. He put this all together in a coherent and consistent theory of the state- one of the first. Along the way, Hobbes attempted to purge the language of the obfuscations of Aristotle, the Schoolmen and of all talk of spirits and spiritualism.All that in just the first half. The second half of the book is basically submitting the Bible to a rational pruning and cutting in such a way that he can claim that Scripture backs up the reasoning he used to justify his political philosophy. It can be read as one of the opening salvos of Deism, of a subversive and surreptitious atheism or of just good clean fun for you rational humanists out there. I see you out there.Leviathan is a heady and challenging book, at once frustrating and fascinating. It is far too grounded in a faulty physics (Descartes) yet is worth the read just for the way he defines terms and teases out the implications of those definitions. There are some people who we read (like Plato, Nietzsche, the Buddha or Machiavelli) just to get them inside your head. I have found that there are times in my personal life that I needed help from the Buddha or the Stoa or even Machiavelli. Sometimes in my corporate life, I have needed help from Nietzsche (that usually didn't go very well) or Hobbes or the Nichomachean Ethics. Life is tricky that way.The Cambridge edition comes with an excellent introduction, a glossary for most of the historical and Biblical characters who are mentioned and a good bibliography. But like I said earlier, there are many good editions of Leviathan. Read, read, read, my friends."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan was the first modern political theorem written in the English language. Poetry, essays, plays and a few academic analyses on Politics existed before that, but it was Hobbes who fathered modern political thought in all its rational and logical stipulation. It was Hobbes who questioned and fought the traditional notions of political understanding; nobody prior to Hobbes had ever cross-examined the foundations of a Monarchic structure within society and the genesis of government. In the introduction itself, Hobbes asserts his assumption that an organized state of life is a choice, just as chaos is a choice as well. He makes it clear in the start that nature predisposes everyone with certain rights and a prerequisite set of laws. Every man has a right to defend his life with all his ability and the law that nature imposes on every being is to live a life of peace and to treat others as one would like to be treated. He states that for self-preservation, man must bind himself in contract with other men to give up our birthrights to be protected by a collectively elected sovereign power. This sovereign power must have unconditional authority in every single aspect of life; there is no entity that boasts more strength or questions the elected sovereign power; everything else besides the sovereign is reigned by the sovereign.According to Hobbes, the nature of man is motivated by his passions, and there is no greater and intense passion than fear. Fear triumphs over all other emotions and man's primal fear is of losing his life by force, which can even make him take irrational decisions. It is this logical prognosis of his that made him believe that whatever can go wrong, will go wrong, unless man follows the law of nature; to live in peace and preserve his life in unison with his fellow citizens. His cynicism for human nature is established when he states that the state of nature is \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\\". He says the only way to overcome the innate fear of death and the knowledge of the nature of human nature is to bind oneself in contract with the State so that everyone can be protected and life can go on without the pre-dominant instinctual fears that corrupt men into malice. Hobbes' approach to all his findings is very mechanical and stems from deductive reasoning. And as no arguments and understanding prior to him existed in the field of his discourse, a majority of his conclusions are axiomatic in definition. Because he wants his audience to think with the same rationality that he commands, Hobbes explains in microscopic detail the machinations of human civilization, beginning with an acute explanation of Man and his senses. He geometrically divides and disassembles our understanding of ourselves and then chauffeurs us to a perspective change that is required to comprehend all Hobbesian deduction.While the twenty first century's modern man might question Hobbes' reasoning behind granting all power to the \\"State\\", one must have an understanding of the epistemology of the Hobbesian thought that stemmed from an elongated suffering due to prolonged war, which arose due to the weakness in the Government that commanded during his youth. Thus, to evade the chaos of civil disagreement, Hobbes yields his logic and grants all existing power and importance to one sole entity. He grants power to the sovereign to literally do anything without any repercussions and also grants it an authority higher than that of God. All this is done because the sovereign is the selected representative of the whole population of his state, making this sole source of power also a theoretical manifestation of the state. This concept of the all-powerful state, an entity that embodies the constituency of all its citizens, officials and the sovereign power collectively is called the Leviathan; A form of a living and breathing beast that nothing in this world can oppose. Hobbes states that the existence of such a state is imperative to subdue all its' subjects in obedience, because fear is the only emotion a human being will submit to unconditionally, especially whence it is from a behemoth to the likes of a Leviathan.Hobbes' diction and grammatology is an arduous passage to cross, but the ideas and theories he is postulating required him to twist his words in his times' verbatim. One must always acknowledge the colloquial dialect of the English language Hobbes' time nurtured him with. He creates layers of ideas upon layers of laws that are meant to take the reader to precise conclusions. The purpose of his loquacity is to reach at one sole conclusion only, and that is what makes Leviathan a timeless study of logic.It is quiet evident that even after five centuries of radical polarization in the perception of government and politics, Leviathan still stands like the name of the entity it bears. It was this book that inspired almost all political theoreticians for many centuries to come. Students and admirers of both liberal and conservative political thought will benefit from reading Leviathan."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"Leviathan is, of course, a classic so I won't waste words on its merits. The issue is this edition. This version retains the original spelling. If you are Ok with this then it would probably be OK for you. If not, not. I'd prefer a more scholarly edition with an introduction decent footnotes as, I suspect, would the average reader."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"I'll preface this review by saying that I've only read Books I-II of Leviathan (about half), but as a close friend recently told me, \\"That may be a new record.\\" Although the title refers to the ideal leader of state, it could easily be attributed to the book itself; it's a truly exhaustive, and exhausting, development of Hobbes' theory of political government, and it took me more than 2 months to sort through the first 400-odd pages.Besides its girth, the first thing that I would say usually dissuades readers from Hobbes' masterwork is the fact that many of its theories on government have been discarded over the last 300 years. He was not a fan of representative democracy - he held a largely pessimistic view on collective human nature - and viewed absolute rule under one centralized authority as the only form of government capable of controlling large groups of people with conflicting goals and opinions.That said, what kept me reading the first two books was how rigorously and completely he develops his theories of government from very basic anatomic principles and universal truths. It goes something like this:In Book I, entitled \\"Of Man,\\" Hobbes uses the scientific principles of his time to show how the human body operates in the world, gaining knowledge and competing with other human bodies for supremacy; this is, in the parlance of Locke, Rousseau, Hume and other 16th and 17th Century philosophers, the State of Nature, which in Hobbes words makes every human life \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\\"(I suspect that Hobbes, while using biblical references and terminology, was a closet atheist, as his view of human nature and survival was Darwinist well before Darwin. I've found at least one religious zealot in my book inventory who agrees with me, a missionary named Paul Hutchinson who wrote a book called \\"The New Leviathan\\" directly after WWII comparing the communist governments of Russia and China the ideal all-powerful state power Hobbes set forth in Leviathan. Of course, Hutchinson doesn't mind playing both sides of the coin, also referring to the fascist regimes of Mussolini and Hitler in Hobbesian terms in one chapter entitled \\"The Worship of the \`Mortal God'.\\")It's interesting and ironic that Hobbes in Book I derides educators and philosophers such as Aristotle, Cicero, and St. Thomas of Aquinas for your use of metaphors, which are to his empirical understanding not absolute and thus not reliable (\\"For words are wise mens counters, they do but reckon by them: but they are the mony of fooles\\" - Chapter 4), since Book II of Leviathan, \\"Of Commonwealth,\\" relies entirely upon the metaphor of government functioning as a human body. To his mind, every functional nation of the world is in the state of nature (in other words, the state of war) with every other nation. This, to his mind, is why nations are formed - [CUT] to protect the citizens, i.e., the parts of the body, from harm by other nations, i.e., political bodies.The only way Hobbes saw to do this - and this is where Hobbes has aged worst - was through enforced dictatorial rule, as the only way to keep people from breaking civil and natural laws was through fear of retribution (to be fair, Hobbes wrote Leviathan while in exile during one of England's bloodiest civil wars, so his primary political motive was ending internal conflict). I think the reason this opinion is universally decried is that most ideologies from either end of the political spectrum have something not to like - free-market advocates see the competition Hobbes wanted to eliminate as the ideal ruling power; his centralized oligarchical rule is exactly what liberal constitutionalists created social contracts against; religious fundamentalists are continually up in arms when the government conflicts with their own tenets.Jane Jacobs in the introduction to The Death and Life of Great American Cities rails against urban planners of the time she wrote it (it was first published in 1961) as \\"earnest and learned men, dealing with complex phenomena they do not understand at all and trying to make do with a pseudoscience.\\" I probably wouldn't use such strong language about Hobbes' political philosophy, but the principle is similar - Hobbes may have gotten it all wrong, but he got it wrong better than most of us have gotten it right."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"The Leviathan is one of the most important books ever written on political and solcial philosophy and it explains what the first duty of government is: to maintain stability and avoid anarchy.The USA is the world's largest democracy. Yet, a natural disaster in New Orleans is sufficient to create anarchy. Reading Hobbes one can very clearly and simply understand that government is the only guarantee to avoid this anarchy. This is why one of the world's most stable country, Switzerland, has such a large public administration. As you can see, the Leviathan can lead to many conclusions of what happens in today's world and help us understand it better.The Leviathan is a challenging read, which you can read on the surface, but also read in a substantial detail. Hobbes is an author that uses a very simple English (for his time), but says a lot more than he seems to say. Obviously, the English is not very accessible for everybody and can take some time to read fully. However, it is definately worth reading this book properly, as it will allow you to derive a lot of conclusions and help your understanding of current affairs as well as your studies of economic and social sciences.The introduction to this book is very good, although some of the conclusions drawn there could be argued. On the whole this is an excellent book, especially to all those interested in the matter."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"This huge work is the foundation of classical liberalism; it is the basis for Locke, for Smith, and all economic neo-liberalists all the way up to the current period. Written during the English Reformation, Hobbes was confronted with the problem of absolute individualism; he begins this work of political theory with a demolishment of objective truth swift enough to impress any post-modernist. He then proceeds to demonstrate the logical conclusion of man in a state of nature, and compels the modern world to enter into his social contract, or Leviathan out of necessity and fear. It is tempting to write off Hobbes as a cynic, but who can deny that much of what motivates individuals in the modern world is simply a fear to maintain survival and acceptance. It is the driving force of modern societies in terms of economic competition, and inter-national conflicts. Hobbes was a thinker of true depth and insight, though his ideas are so commonly ingrained in modern society that it is difficult to see why they were revolutionary when they were composed."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"I have serious issues getting past the misspellings and the psychotic notions of Hobbes (or the translator's doing as far as spelling is concern).

However, just because a book is hard to read does not mean that the content is bad or worthless. I would suggest the opposite, if our very simple thinking and poor intellectual abilities do not allow us to crack it open at the first attempt we should keep trying. That effort is what keep us moving forward.Great book, needless to say. Take your time and enjoy. If it gets difficult just leave it on the table, think about it and read it later.

Firstly I admire Thomas Hobbes for his bravery during the 17th century when this book was written and secondly for his grim view of humanity. Atheism during the height of the Catholic Church was strictly taboo and he had to write this piece very cleverly. Leviathan is a must for those whom are interested in the philosophical ideology of who we are and what makes us strive for things that we do and generally what makes us as men tick.This book is complex. The common &quot;run-on&quot; sentences used in philosophy and the Old English style makes the book difficult to understand at times. It almost seems to be pure thought with no organization which has been jotted down in 728 pages.In all, I like to call Hobbes Leviathan the &quot;Atheists Bible&quot; (though perhaps Hobbes would not like this type of name for one of his works) and I truly believe that this work is just as essential and important to philosophy as Plato."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"I got interested in Hobbes because I was reading a lot about the Founding Fathers of the United States and I wanted to familiarize myself with the books that influenced them.Reading Leviathan is not easy.

Before Hobbes, writers for centuries had accepted the divine right of kings or did not think much about the origins of government. In Hobbes we find the concepts that have become standard in political thought: state of nature, social contract, absolute and limited government, civil disobedience, censorship, etc.Hobbes supposes that the organized state is a choice. The alternative is the \\"state of nature\\", where there is both a \\"right of nature\\" and \\"laws of nature\\". Hobbes uses these terms in a highly individual way. The \\"right of nature\\" is \\"the Liberty each man hath, to use his own power...for the preservation of his own Life\\". In addition there are a number of \\"laws of nature\\". The first dictates that each person should seek to live with others in peace, and the second is that each person should only retain the right to as much liberty as he is willing to permit others. These (and other laws that follow from them) are found by reason and are utilitarian rather than prudential. Morality does not enter into it. Hobbes is simply saying that if men think about their situation, reason tells them that giving up their \\"rights of nature\\" in exchange for others doing likewise is the best means of self-preservation, even though it is contrary to human nature.On human nature Hobbes is cynical. Reason suggests advantages stem from co-operation, but this is outweighed by instinct. Men are fundamentally competitive and selfish. They are also roughly equal in ability so no one person or group can impose his will on others, and all can hope only to protect themselves from others. Life in the state of nature is \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.\\" Hence men are driven to create government via a pact with all others to give up their \\"right of nature\\" to a sovereign authority, which may be either an individual or an oligarchy (Hobbes prefers the former). Hobbes uses the concept of a \\"social contract\\". It is not an historical event but a logical device to describe the ongoing basis of consent to government. Hobbes' view of human nature is such that he allocates absolute power to the sovereign. Limited government is unworkable for men are too prone to division and selfishness, and \\"a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand.\\" Hobbes was influenced by the divisive years before the English Civil War in which he lived. Among the ten rights Hobbes awards the sovereign the sixth is the power of censorship of opinions harmful to the state. Control of religion is not among the ten rights but Hobbes later argues that the sovereign must seek to restrain discussion of religion because it leads to conflict. Anybody seeking to preach a new religion should be treated as a criminal. Had Hobbes lived a century later religion would have played little or no part in his thinking because he was not himself a religious man, and he was concerned with religion only because because it played a major role in politics in his lifetime.Are there circumstances in which people are justified in breaking the law, and is there an ultimate right of rebellion? The answer is to be found in the nature of the social contract. Men give up their natural rights to self-preservation to a sovereign to better achieve them. If a situation arises where the sovereign cannot ensure that self-preservation then society is dissolved. On civil disobedience Hobbes says that a criminal going to his execution has the \\"right\\" to resist. He is not, however, saying he has a \\"moral\\" right, only that it is proper for him to seek to assert his \\"natural\\" right, adding that the sovereign should indeed execute him. As for whether men have the right to resist conscription, Hobbes seems at first sight ambiguous because he declares that a man's right to protect his own life extends to refusing to die in military service if conscripted. However, further reading shows that the sovereign has the right to require people to risk their life if the existence of that state is threatened. On the other hand men should have the right to put a volunteer in their place (if one is available) and the sovereign does not have the right to demand that I lay down my life if the existence of the state is not threatened.\\"Leviathan\\" is not an easy book, not helped by the fact that the English is that of a man born just 24 years after Shakespeare. However, it is an important work that makes a good study companion to Locke's \\"Second Treatise\\", which argues for limited government. Those who prefer a version with modernized spelling should consider the edition edited by Gaskin."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes. Published by MobileReference (mobi)Hobbes political writing influenced other philosophers like Spinoza, Hutcheson, Locke, and Hume. He is an excellent writer and his theories are easy to understand."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"I won't repeat the details of Hobbes' biography. In addition to the foregoing, a deep familiarity with this book is invaluable if you intend on studying political science in any serious manner-- either if you are an undergraduate poli-sci major and you intend on being noticed favorably by your professors, or-- needless to say-- you intend to do any post-graduate work in political science. I wasn't a philosophy major; but, if reading this book fails to improve your life, I'll double your money back.I'm only half-kidding about that (well, more than half on the money part-- you aren't sending me any).Personally, I was fascinated by Hobbes and I've always enjoyed reading; so... that's my disclaimer. I concede that it takes a little getting used to reading the archaic style; but, the truth of his statements and the way that they fell into place seemed to me just about as mathematical as such a subject could be. In the end, just the fact that I could demonstrate legitimate, intimate understanding of this book ultimately impressed the Hell out of no end of professors, etc.Political science majors all ultimately meet the same folks: Descartes, Rousseau, Adam Smith, Plato, Socrates, Locke, Machiavelli, etc., and the more familiar you can be with them, the better. But, in my opinion, the one who had reality figured out was Hobbes. If you find a rabid Rousseau fan writing a similar review on \\"The Social Contract,\\" I'm not going to slam the competitor's product-- but, if you only have time to wade into one tough read, I suggest that you make it this one.*BUT* One bright, shining ray of hope for the over-burdened scholar is that I only recommend exerting yourself on Part I (\\"Of MAN\\"), which only constitutes 1/3 of the book. My personal (very) simplified synopsis is that Hobbes spends the first part of his book doing an excellent job describing the nature of essentially the broad spectrum of reality, most importantly Man and Power in its multitudinous forms and how that motivates Man in his selfish desire to garner it unto himself. Then, after essentially describing what a despicable creature man is after absolute power has corrupted absolutely, his recommendation is, incredibly, to hand over absolute power to one of those absolutely selfish creatures and toss a crown on his head. After Part I, I release you from your bondage. Feel free to read on-- in fact, I recommend it. But, if the style of prose is overwhelming to you, you are really prepared for whatever may come with a thorough understanding of \\"Of MAN.\\"Hobbes uses \\"Of MAN\\" as the pigments with which he attempts to paint a portrait of what society should be. If you have a real understanding of the materials with which he was working, you have what you need to understand his scheme, or to engineer a better one. I perceive the rest of Leviathan mostly as a basis for critiquing Hobbes-- which is of questionable practical value except as an academic. My first impression upon reading \\"Of MAN\\" was that I seemed to be reading the equivalent of an enormous geometry proof. I later found out that that was no coincidence.

He expects him to do good because it is his role in society-- the Soveraign appears as a deus ex machina to solve the problems of managing his society, which may have been the best idea that could occur to him, but, given the hindsight from the 21st Century, the idea's weaknesses are obvious to us.

Required reading on Political Science degree courses the World over, it is almost unthinkable that any serious (or even casual) student of the field would deprive themselves of its insights. Not always the easiest of reads, it, never the less, rewards the reader more than adequately with its insights and observations."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"I won't go into a great deal of detail repeating what has already been said. In addition to the foregoing, a deep familiarity with this book is invaluable if you intend on studying political science in any serious manner-- either if you are an undergraduate poli-sci major and you intend on being noticed favorably by your professors, or-- needless to say-- you intend to do any post-graduate work in political science. I wasn't a philosophy major; but, if reading this book fails to improve your life, I'll double your money back.I'm only half-kidding about that (well, more than half on the money part-- you aren't sending me any).Personally, I was fascinated by Hobbes and I've always enjoyed reading; so... that's my disclaimer. I concede that it takes a little getting used to reading the archaic style; but, the truth of his statements and the way that they fell into place seemed to me just about as mathematical as such a subject could be. In the end, just the fact that I could demonstrate legitimate, intimate understanding of this book ultimately impressed the Hell out of no end of professors, etc.Political science majors all ultimately meet the same folks: Descartes, Rousseau, Adam Smith, Plato, Socrates, Locke, Machiavelli, etc., and the more familiar you can be with them, the better. But, in my opinion, the one who had reality figured out was Hobbes. If you find a rabid Rousseau fan writing a similar review on \\"The Social Contract,\\" I'm not going to slam the competitor's product-- but, if you only have time to wade into one tough read, I suggest that you make it this one.*BUT* One bright, shining ray of hope for the over-burdened scholar is that I only recommend exerting yourself on Part I (\\"Of MAN\\"), which only constitutes 1/3 of the book. My personal (very) simplified synopsis is that Hobbes spends the first part of his book doing an excellent job describing the nature of essentially the broad spectrum of reality, most importantly Man and Power in its multitudinous forms and how that motivates Man in his selfish desire to garner it unto himself. Then, after essentially describing what a despicable creature man is after absolute power has corrupted absolutely, his recommendation is, incredibly, to hand over absolute power to one of those absolutely selfish creatures and toss a crown on his head. After Part I, I release you from your bondage. Feel free to read on-- in fact, I recommend it. But, if the style of prose is overwhelming to you, you are really prepared for whatever may come with a thorough understanding of \\"Of MAN.\\"Hobbes uses \\"Of MAN\\" as the pigments with which he attempts to paint a portrait of what society should be. If you have a real understanding of the materials with which he was working, you have what you need to understand his scheme, or to engineer a better one.

Without cooperation, there would be no such thing as society (and so no social sciences, philosophy, history, etc.). Hobbes was the first political theorist to tackle this question.While Hobbes is long-winded in parts, and his spelling and grammar not consistent with modern standards, this book is still worth reading. Alfred North Whitehead quipped that the entire history of western political philosophy consists of footnotes to Plato. I respectfully differ, as I believe Plato is now studied purely for historical interest (nobody takes seriously his ideal of a 3 class society led by philosopher kings). Hobbes, however, is the root from which all subsequent western political philosophy has sprung. Locke's Treatises were a direct response to Hobbes, and helped solidify the social contract tradition. Nowadays, nearly all western political theorists either accept social contract theory, or at least have to discuss it in-depth in order to show why they reject it.Hobbes examines the fundamental issue of \\"how do humans manage to get along peacefully?\\" In an age of terrorism, serial killers and vicious divorce battles, it's still a good question. Obviously humans do get along together most of the time, but that doesn't make it obvious why or how we do.You don't have to accept Hobbes's ideas to get a lot out of this book. His stark contrast in describing the alternatives available to humans is unparalleled. While evolutionary theory has gone a long way toward scientifically explaining some types of cooperation, it still hasn't fully explained how strangers in a large society manage to cooperate when, in strictly rational terms, it would be advantageous to screw each other over. So if Hobbes didn't satisfactorily answer the question either, he at least made a very compelling argument."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"the essence of Hobbes critical thinking and evaluation is commendable except that the book is extremely difficult to read because it is in Old English.

There are no long passages and it can be a little disjointed to the modern reader.
