It will leave you rolling on the floor, doubled over in laughter!If you're a bit down in the dumps, depressed, or merely suffering from a slight case of the blues, these marvelously observed stories and essays will put a smile back on your face and make you forget why you were blue in the first place.If you've never experienced the humor and wit of David Sedaris, grab your wallet, purse, or pocketbook, get out your credit card, and order up any or all of his books - Barrel Fever, Naked, Holidays on Ice, or this wonderful new collection, Me Talk Pretty One Day. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I always look forward to spending time inside the mind of David Sedaris. I don't know how many times I have read Naked and Barrel Fever ( if you haven't read either get thee to thy shopping cart! ) He doesn't disappoint this go around either. Marvelously twisted and dead on. From being tagged a &quot;future homosexual&quot; to foul mouthed siblings, you will laugh out loud and then read out loud to anyone within earshot. If you've ever watched his equally wicked sister Amy's show on Comedy Central, the equally perverse,twisted, and hilarious &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot;, you will wonder what went on in that house? And wish you had been part of it. If I could invite three men to drinks it would be Bob Smith, Dan Savage and David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"What can I say about this author's new book that hasn't been said already? It's a wonderful and wickedly funny book. David really knows how to write and is probably the funniest author around today. The first part of the book begins with his North Carolina childhood and the second half moves to Paris. What a wonderful collection of essays. I especially enjoyed \\"Today's Special\\" and \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster.\\" But really all of the essays are so funny, and true to life. To be able to put these everyday events into words that are simple yet so funny, is truly a gift.Believe it or not I haven't read his previous book \\"Naked\\", but now its being pulled off my library shelf to be read immediately. When you start to read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" you will want to sit and read it right through, forget about dinner and everything else. This book deserves more than 5 stars. David, we await your next collection with eagerness."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Summary:The book is a collection of short stories, all of which I believe are based on the author's actual experiences. Some of the stories are about Sedaris's childhood and his life just before leaving for France, but the majority about his time spent in France.My Comments:All of the stories are well-written, engaging, and entertaining. As is the case with 'Holidays On Ice', the author never reveals when a story is fictitious or not, but I was inclined to believe that all of these were non-fiction (though there might be an embellishment here or there).I'm also not sure what, if anything, I missed because I listened to this book on CD, but the live recordings for some reason were even more funny than his normal writings. Listening to them live is definitely a boon for the CD version.I was impressed by the author's candorabout his personal life. To be willing to reveal one's quirks and even poke fun at them takes either a lot of money or a lot of self-security. I'm not sure which is Sedaris's motivation, but whatever it is, it's nice to hear someone being frank about life.Though the stories jump all over the place and don't really seem to have a common thread, I don't think anyone can argue that Sedaris has a gift for telling poignant and humorous short stories. The stories are a bit outlandish and the author is blunt, meaning they probably aren't for everyone, but I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is my second David Sedaris book, and after the mixed feelings I have regarding Barrel Fever I can say this is much better overall. Sedaris describes, through vaguely connected essays, his own often difficult battle with communication, and the insights he gains are painfully funny. A bit like an autobiography, &quot;Me Talk&quot; is layered throughout with Sedaris' bits of wisdom and wit, and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I didn't find myself rolling in the floor with laughter except on a few occasions, but the book as a whole is a good look at the difficulty we all have on occasion to say what we really mean, or let people know what we're thinking. The parts about Sedaris' efforts to learn French and justifiably cited as the funniest parts, but I also enjoyed the essay dealing with his stint as a college teacher, assigning writing projects on soap operas. This is a good introduction to Sedaris, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Interestingly, this is the most serious funny book I've ever read. It will make you laugh out loud, no matter where you are, it made me cry (I never cry) and it sweetly describes everything that is lovely and depressing about the world we live in.What I also found is that this book fairly speaks about the true nature of France and the French. It speaks honestly to the dilemmas Americans face when dealing with the French, without resorting to stereotypes and doting, blind admiration.But make no mistake- this is not a book about international relations, gay issues, greek heritage or the trials of being poor in New York. It is a book about a life, played out and described in simple, self-deprecating prose, by a man who is halfway through and still learning to talk pretty."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'd give this book 10 stars if I could. Need to revive a dead fish? Read him a chapter of &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day.&quot; I picked it up at an airport bookstore this summer after previously bumping into David S. on NPR from time to time. I read it cover to cover virtually nonstop in about 3.5 hours. I laughed, and crying laughing, uncontrollably many times - part of the attraction. I started reading entries aloud to my friends in the weeks that followed. Any potential lulls in laughter are certainly the result of laughter overload and will, thankfully, give you a chance to refuel and read on! - Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Rarely is the utter hilarity and irony of life captured so perfectly in a novel, but David Sedaris meets, and triumphs the challenge in his newest book, &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;. From his experiences growing up in a family of six children in North Carolina, to his adulthood in New York City and later to a small town in France, Mr. Sedaris writes like most of us think, with a wonderful comedic touch and a zany take on the most routine of activities. His strange, but close-knit family is a story in itself; a sister with an un-humanely knack for suntanning, a father who eats things wayyyy past their expiration date, and a mother who can smoke without ever removing the cigarette from her mouth, just to name a few. Guitar lessons taught by a midget and speech therapy, he has the childhood we all have but none discuss openly. Even more hilarious are the tales from France, where he studies France medical terms (&quot;It is now time to deliver the afterbirth&quot;) and discusses the items brought back from customs (guides to skin rashes or suede fetus w/umbilical cord, anyone?). This book had me in stitches, and instantly became my favorite of all time. I'd recommend anyone who doesn't mind crying of laughter in public, and who needs another person to assure them that their view on life isn't crazy...A must-read!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Man, this book is funny! This guy is a genius at highlighting the humorous aspects of everyday life. I could totally relate to his experiences in France. Not so much the language issues as the general experience of living in a foreign country (in my case, the U.S.).I also had a good time reading about the author's experiences in the art world. It was nice to find out that my own suspicions about conceptual art weren't totally off the mark.Highly readable!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have recently discovered David Sedaris and I am all ready a huge fan. However, he is even funnier when you LISTEN to him read. I strongly recommend that you buy the Audio CD of his work if you can. The version I have of Me Talk Pretty One Day is ABRIDGED. I do not know if they make an unabridged version. It is missing the story Big Boy, which is many people's favorite. On the other hand, there are bonus tracks from Sedaris live that are VERY funny and not available anywhere else."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The pieces gathered in this collection of humorist David Sedaris's writings are all interesting, insightful (into the human condition), and funny. But behind the humor, I suspect, is a deep well of pain. Sedaris is a gay author who writes about things other than being gay; and when he writes of his own homosexuality, it is always without any fanfare. In fact, the unifying theme of these stories seems to be the pain of being \\"odd\\" or an outsider. In some cases, Sedaris's outsider status can be clearly linked to his being gay (as in the opening story, \\"Go Carolina,\\" which describes the ordeal of being one of several sensitive boys in his school who is singled out for speech therapy for their lisps and effeminate speaking patterns). Elsewhere, his outsider status is due to being a northerner who moved to North Carolina, or an American who spends summers in France. On top of this, just being a member of his family seems to automatically qualify him for instant alien and mutant status. In fact, because of this many of his stories reminded me of souped up (some may say \\"vulgarized\\") versions of James Thurber's classic stories of his eccentric Ohio relatives. In fact, one story about his struggle to give up drinking, \\"The Late Show,\\" reminded me of \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.\\" As Sedaris struggles to make it through painful nights of insomnia he fashions a variety of outlandish identities for himself. While exagerated humor is a constant in Sedaris's stories, there is always something else present just below the surface that almost anyone can identify with. In flaunting his eccentricities and outsider status, Sedaris has presented himself as a universal type, a true everyman."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"'Me Talk Pretty One Day' is my first exposure to the work of David Sedaris, and it will surely not be my last. It's a book which is consistently humorous throughout, and at times devastatingly accurate in it's assassination of character flaws, delusions of grandeur, and idiocy in general - quite often of which is the authors own.The magic of Sedaris' writing, is, that while he can make light of normally heart-breaking subjects like drug addiction or the death of his mother, it's only when he describes his ordeal of trying to flush a 'big-boy' - (not his own), that you begin to feel sympathetic. He treats everything with the same level of amusement without going over the top. Some writers of humour are extremely witty and insightful but they don't really make you laugh. Sedaris is one of few that has the gift of inciting genuine laughter without seemingly trying too hard - and for that he has my full endorsement. Keep 'em coming David."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris has the gift. He knows just how to use understatement to pack the biggest bang into every laugh. You don't see the punchline coming around the corner, so when it gets there you're surprised and tickled at the same time. He's particularly hilarious when talking about his redneck brother who has adopted the nickname \\"The Rooster\\" and when discussing his trials in dealing with a stopped up toilet at a civilized dinner party. Those two short segments alone are worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was one of the best I had read in a long time. It was funny and sad and beautiful and you couldn't help laughing out loud. My favorite essays were the ones that took place in France, which I felt were perfect in describing the way one feels when they are transplanted in a new place."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have heard David Sedaris on PRI's &quot;This American Life&quot; a few times, and was always sad when his autobiographical essays would come to an end. Always the highlight of any show in which they were featured, these hysterical accounts of expatriate living in France, growing up in North Carolina or what have you even forced me to pull my car over one day for fear of laughing myself into an accident.This collection of essays incites the same feelings, though thankfully this time I don't have to fear a collision while I enjoy them."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have never recommended a book so highly, to so many people. I read this book on a long flight and I am quite sure others on the plane thought I was mentally retarded, emotionally unstable and totally socially unacceptable for my constant, hysterical laughter.Don't borrow it. Buy it! In fact, buy TWO! You will want a copy to keep and one to give a stubborn friend who refuses your repeated attempts to read them your favorite chapter.Definitely the funniest book I have ever so completely identified with."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"It takes a lot to make me laugh outloud when I'm reading, but as the people that were on the same flight with me this week can attest, this book has what it takes. This collection of essays is well written and one of the most entertaining books I've read in a long time. The chapter on lisping gets the ball rolling and it just picks up speed from there. Be prepared to laugh outloud!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris' typical irreverence takes a new, French turn in his latest book of essays. Reading through Sedaris' struggle to be a fluent American-in-Paris is truly hilarious, and his gift for communicating the irony and comedy of humanity (both his own and that of the people he encounters) reaches its pinacle in this book. A must-read for anyone!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I can't imagine anyone being less than fully entertained by this book. It has its sophomoric moments, but one thing that has developed in Sedaris' writing since his early days is generosity. He is generous and forgiving while still being ascerbic and witty. I found the sensibility in books like &quot;Barrel Fever&quot; and &quot;Naked&quot; a little bitter. With the earlier books, I got tired of reading about dysfunctional monsters and horrible people page after page. With &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day,&quot; Sedaris has become human. He's still biting as ever, but he somehow manages to forgive at the same time."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I wish that I had purchased the tapes because part of the enjoyment of David Sedaris's stories is hearing him tell them. I still enjoyed reading the book, but found myself trying to hear his voice reading it to me as he does on NPR. I was amused by every story and often laughed out loud."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I took this book with me on a plane trip and found myself laughing out loud! I hope the people next to me didn't think I was crazy. A couple of chapters fell flat with a dull &quot;thud&quot;, but the majority of the book was quite entertaining. I was amused by how he is able to rank on the French culture without coming off as an entirely arrogant American. Remembering how I felt in Germany having studied the language only two years, &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; really hit home. David Sedaris is able to describe situations we can all relate to, and then put is own unique twist on them. I'm now inspired to read &quot;Holidays on Ice&quot;."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is the first time I've ever experienced any of David Sedaris' work. Some stories were more hysterical than others, but overall it was really refreshing. Sedaris is dark and critical of almost everything, including himself. He has the gift of looking at completely ordinary things and describing it in a way that paints hilarious. (i.e. when he scores low on his IQ test, he describes it as about the dollar amount to buy 3 buckets of chicken.) I did find it strange however, how the book ends so abruptly, and also how he manages to make himself look like such pure loser. He never discusses his success in radio or writing. (I guess going on and on about how successful you are just isn't as funny.)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The typical problem with humor is that it appeals only to certain groups; while one group finds a work the pinnacle of intlect, another may find it a pile of stewing unamusement. Sedaris writes fairly universally-appealing humor. His essays are very clearly written, witty and even insightful. He has displayed his capabilities very well with this work"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris has once again created a laugh out loud journey through his own unique life. I was really lookingforward to this bk, and once again he delivered! What's next for Sedaris? I'd love for him to take on a subject other than his own autobiog. Maybe he should write about a nonfiction subject outside his own life, where humor and fact mix together into a strange and funny and unique concoction, like typical comedy essays on various subjects as seen in books like George Carlin's BRAINDROPPINGS, Jon Stewart's NAKED PICTURES OF DEAD PEOPLE or even the one-subject history via humor of Jessica Pallingston's LIPSTICK. Whatever it will be, I eagerly await it. If you love to laugh, you'll love his book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'm new to this author and thought he would be funny, but found it to be a little too liberal for my taste. I got through the first few chapters, then donated it. It wasn't for me - I'm a little too conservative, I think. If you don't mind potty humor, this book may be good for you."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"While the essays are intelligently written the book lacks the funniness that the reviews make it out to have. The only essay that made me laugh out loud was Big Boy, I guess bathroom humor is funny no matter how old you are. I had such high hopes for this book but was disappointed."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"...Need I say more? He is hilarious. I have many books from him and this is really funny."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I originally bought this book a few years ago. Read it. Loved it. This week I reread it and it holds up and was a complete joy to rediscover! Sedaris is bright, funny, bittersweet. He's one of my fav's!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I came to ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY by David Sedaris after first reading his DRESS YOUR FAMILY IN CORDUROY AND DENIM then NAKED. Like those collections of stories drawn from his life, the author and frequent NPR contributor begins with childhood experiences and progresses into adulthood. Each collection is loosely organized around a theme, and ME TALK's is just what it sounds like, the ability to communicate oneself to the world. As in those other collections, Sedaris is scathingly funny and frequently bratty but he has his somber moments. Playing off the absurdity of his personal history he connects with universal truths about being human. Several of the stories are about being an expatriot in France, which bequeaths lessons in American identity and how we are perceived by others in general.I gave the other two collections 5 stars each. I'm nicking this book just one, only because by comparison it just does not seem quite as tightly knit as the others, though the individual stories have his usual spit and polish."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"If you plan to read this at night in bed and your bedmate will be upset if you start laughing so hard that it looks like you're having a coronary, don't read this book. If they don't mind then read it!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Suffice it to say that Sedaris is not to everyone's taste. However, you would have to be pretty humorless not to appreciate his unique perspective on subjects as diverse as his family and his experiences as a not-so-innocent abroad in France who initially has no interest in learning the language--then six years into his French experience, finally takes on the mother tongue with all he has--which he is quick to admit isn't much.A lot of fun, and if you're having a tough personal time, Sedaris will show you how much better off you are than he is! (But really, the man's a best-seller, so he can't be too bad!)If your humor goes a little left of center, this is a good read for you."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"What some people find incredibly funny, others find boring and just plain stupid. Good humor writing is one of those things that you either get, or don't.That said, for me, David Sedaris is one of, if not THE, funniest writers out there today. His voice shines through in every story, and the sometimes insane thoughts that run through his head never fail to get at least a smirk out of me, and quite often a laugh. It is very difficult to write something funny enough to get people laughing out loud, but Sedaris does it over and over in this collection of short stories. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris is at his best when writing about his family, as he does in many of the essays in ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY. When he is not funny is when he is being self-depricating. (sp?)I really enjoyed this collection of essays - they are laugh outloud funny, and some, such as the story of his parents' Great Dane, or \\"My Childhood in Africa\\", where Sedaris attempts to replace his boring childhood memories with his boyfriend's: field-trips to slaughterhouses, having a pet monkey, etc.They get particularly annoying, however, when Sedaris starts picking on himself. Sedaris is an incredibly capable writer, one who can tell a mundane story in a way that will have even the most stoned-faced person spitting milk out of their nose, and yet he continues to ruminate on his own stupidity, which makes average writers like myself hate him. He also seems to possess aa sort of vain attachment to his faults, and this too is annoying.This collection is highly recommended, but don't expect to enjoy every essay."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"If you don't like laughing out loud in public with tears rolling down your cheeks, don't read this book. I hate to read out loud, but I ran to my wife to read Sedaris' stories to her. I started reading this book on an airplane and found I couldn't wait to get home to share some of these precious, hilarious stories with her."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book has made me laugh more than any book I have ever read. I was constantly interrupting my husband's work to say, &quot;you have to read this.&quot; I would read him bits and he would be cracking up.Every ounce of his commentary on the world around him is just histerical and so true. He can turn even something as tragic as drug abuse into sidesplitting humor. I couldn't pick a favorite chapter because each one is as funny as the last.I plan to pass this book along to all of my friends and family. Anyone with a sense of humor, and even those without one, will fall over laughing."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Because you laugh so hard at practically every other sentence. This was my first taste of the wonderfully insightful and incontinence-inducing David Sedaris. After reading Holidays on Ice and Naked, I'm still a fan of his latest. I picked up this book from a pile of crap from Costco that my mom had bought and scanned the book jacket blurb. Referring to Sedaris as a &quot;spooky man child&quot; was what hooked me. This became my favorite book because I could read it 100 times and the humor would still be fresh and hysterical. I fell in love with David Sedaris while I read it and would often flip to the back cover to smile at his cute little face. READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Every one of David Sedaris' books has given me moments of pure joy. Humor like his is wonderful. With only words, it is very difficult to be funny. But, Sedaris does it.His is a rare gift.This book stands out among his others in that most of the last half deals with his encounters with French language and culture. In this group of essays, he explores various related themes -- the difficulty of being unable to master the language, feeling insecure in an unfamiliar country, etc.Sedaris isn't afraid to let us know who he is. By opening up to us, we get to see the world his way. And find the humor in situations which he tells us about.The best thing about this book is that by allowing us to see things his way, we experience something like what he tells us he dealt with in regard to French encounters. And, this opportunity to see from a new perspective is great!Keep in mind though -- this is not a boring World Cultures book of essays. This is first rate, intelligent humor."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read David Sedaris' book NAKED this past summer. Now, I have to read it for a class I am taking at UMass-Amherst. So, to get a discussion going on the writer, I decided to pick up his newest book. All I can say is that this book was hilarious. My favorite story was &quot;Go Carolina.&quot; It was about David and his speech impediment. I could relate to this story because I had a speech problem when I was young. The first half of the book deals with David living in the US, and then goes into his life in France with his boyfriend Hugh. All of his stories are entertaining. The most memorable people in the book were David's father and his sister Amy. I hope David Sedaris continues writing witty and memorable stories like in ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY and NAKED."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The book has some slow moments, but David Sedaris' Easter description makes me laugh just to remember it. I heard him reading parts of this on NPR, which really adds to the enjoyment of the book (look them up on the archive site - you really need to hear him sing the Oscar Myer song.) Its not great literature, but for pure reading pleasure, this book is it. He goes on my short list of &quot;hardback&quot; authors."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is hands down one of the funniest books I have ever read. I was totally unfamiliar with David Sedaris until I saw him interviewed on David Letterman and found him mildly amusing. At the end of the interview they flashed this book up and I didn't think about it again. I saw it the next day at the book store and just from reading the dust jacket I was so hooked I purchased it and another of his books, Naked. Both are very good but I prefer Me Talk Pretty One Day to Naked. I have recommended this book to dozens of people. If you need a pick me up this is the book to do it!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Possibily Sedaris' BEST work in conversational masterpieces. So funny I couldn't read at times. I would recommend this book before Naked, as Naked was not as focused as Me Talk Pretty.."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"They say that laughter is good for your health. Read ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY and you'll be feeling healthier! I read this book when I was having a very bad day and I felt myself starting to guffaw!David Sedaris' experiences in France and learning to speak French and feeling stilted and awkward made me laugh! Thirty years ago I studied French and I remember the French people correcting me in such a way that seemed humilating at the time, but pretty funny when I read about David Sedaris' similar experiences. I felt like calling him up and saying, &quot;I know just what you're talking about!&quot;This is the first book that I read of his, but I'm going to get the rest... FUNNY!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"After having read a friend's hardcover copy, and listening to the author on NPR, I decided to make my first audio book purchase. His unique voice adds another dimension to the humor.I'm told that audio books are usually abridged, but there are six chapters not included. They are as follows: Big Boy; You Can't Kill The Rooster; The Great Leap Forward; Genetic Engineering; Smart Guy; The Late Show.Regardless of the omissions, I highly recommend the audio version of this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris is amazing. The north meets the south and decides to move to France. . .This is a book only for the individual who can appreciate smart humor. If you have ever taken a look at yourself, your family and your past and still had the character to laugh this book is for you."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was the first David Sedaris book I came across. After reading Me Talk Pretty One Day, I immediately needed more Sedaris. I've never laughed out loud while reading before finding this gem and became addicted to Sedaris' storytelling. Simple observations and family related memories are delivered with wit and enthusiasm. The only thing better than reading Sedaris is listening to Sedaris. Luckily, he reads his stories in the audiobook versions, which adds another dimension of character to what is already sublimely funny."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"It's the old dave at best. This book is for anyone with a decent sense of humor who enjoys a good heart being spilled out into text."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"(Three-and-a-half stars)Sedaris has a death-grip on popular creative nonfiction. This is refreshing, in a way. Looking at the Grishams and Pattersons that dominate popular fiction, it's nice to see that a collection of personal essays can succeed without similar melodrama and weak writing. Sedaris tells stories of irreverence in an irreverent way, giving us the humor and sparing us the saccharine when writing about his childhood speech impediment, putting animals to sleep, or being addicted to drugs whilst hopelessly tangled up in Raleigh's performance art scene.That's not to say the collection is hilarious. Sure, Sedaris gives us humor, but it's on the page funny. It's funny like Martin Amis or a Monty Python script. It's all very clever, with the randomness arranged so that it looks like it wasn't arranged. So, while Sedaris really is a funny guy, I don't remember laughing while reading the book.I said that the essays succeed without the melodrama and weak writing of popular fiction, a true statement, for sure. However, the essays don't always escape some form of over-the-top and flawed writing. The reason my chuckles remained internal--and my main complaint about Sedaris--is the visibility of his craft.There's a lot to be gleaned from studying the essays found in Me Talk Pretty One Day: how to set up a forward-moving story and write it using language and images that go just far enough without being obtrusive. This collection is such an easy read because the essays are, essentially, all the same. Some are better than others (\\"Twelve Moments In the Life of an Artist\\" and \\"Go Carolina\\" are both very entertaining and well-written), but it's Creative Nonfiction 101. I'm not saying that everything needs to be dense and literary--to darken the humor and thicken the craft here would surely segregate the audience, and I imagine that only a portion of Sedaris fans would enjoy something like Hot Water Music or The Stranger. Books like that attack something visceral in the reader as opposed to merely giving him/her a quirky little read that might press lightly on the skin.This is the third collection of essays I've read by David Sedaris (the other two being Holidays On Ice and Dress Your Family In Corduroy and Denim), and even if he seems to be getting more cookie-cutter as I look at his work chronologically, the essays in Me Talk Pretty One Day are worth a read. The second half of the book in particular is very well done, and when he has a strong tie from one story to the next he gives himself more room to develop an idea. This act of trying to tell us something other than a good story is when he's at his best. That said, these are often good stories and nothing more, which isn't too bad of a backhanded complement if you think about it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is laugh out loud funny. It got me through a long day of air traveling. Me Talk Pretty One Day is almost like a collection of short stories put together in one book because it doesn't follow the beginning-middle-end format. Each chapter is more or less a chapter in David's life. Either way, the things written in this book will make you laugh so loud others will stare and ask what's in it. I read it in one day, and might read it again if I need a good laugh."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I've read most of David Sedaris' books and this is my favorite. I bought this one because I loaned my first copy out and can't remember who has it. I'll happily read it again and laugh."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"For anyone who has ever been to France, or anyone who has suffered the indignities of learning a foreign language, this is the humor book for you! Only be sure to read it in private, because if you're like me you might find yourself laughing out loud on public transportation, which can be embarrassing! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"As much as I'm a fan of biographies - particularly historical ones - I've never been really enamored of autobiographies. Generally, they are too self-serving, which is to be expected: you can hardly be really objective when writing about yourself. Indeed, David Sedaris's Me Talk Pretty One Day is self-serving, but at least it's not in the standard way. Instead of being the hero of his book, Sedaris is often the lead buffoon.Of course, that is to be expected. This is really a collection of semi-autobiographical essays which often does obvious fact-bending to get some good humor. Does the humor work? Usually, yes, and that's the key to success for a book of this nature.Me Talk Pretty One Day is divided into two parts. The first part - titled \\"One\\" - is a series of essays about Sedaris's life in the United States, coping with speech therapists (due to a lisp), drugs and teaching. The second part - \\"Deux\\" - deals with life in France, where Sedaris goes with his lover (it is no secret that Sedaris is gay and he gets some humor out of this, but most of it has less to do with homosexuality as with relationships in general).The typical problem with these sorts of books is that they are best read in small doses, maybe an essay or two at a time; otherwise, the humor begins to acquire a bit of sameness that dulls it a bit. Unfortunately, this conflicts with my cover-to-cover-and-on-to-the-next-book attitude, which may have cut into my enjoyment a little. But I still found this to be a breezy and funny read; it may not be a riot, but Me Talk Pretty One Day is good enough to get the occasional chuckle and have you at least smiling the rest of the time."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have never read a book this hysterical in my life. In this quirky autobiographical piece Sedaris tackles everything from a speech therapist who is out to correct every lisp in the boys with homosexual tendacies, to his galavanting in Paris where he visits all the movie theatres but none of the tourist attractions, to his prank playing sister who finds it amusing to create shocking situations (she yells out \\"good luck beating that rape charge David\\" right before he steps out of his subway car).Some of his stories border on the absurd but his true talent is for finding humorous twists and perspectives on the mundane parts of life that many of us have perhaps pondered in a similar fashion but never had the true courage to vocalize. I read half of this book out loud to my husband and he and I were both gasping for breath as we shook with laughter. Read just one chapter and I dare you to put it down. This is one of those books I know I will return to again and again because it isn't a linear plot but a collection of great moments that you want to share with those around you.My only regret is that it took me this long to pick up one of his books. I plan to read them all and you should too. Unless you don't have a sense of humor or are uptight when it comes to being politically correct in which case I highly recommend you stay away from this."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Its a great book, although some parts had me grimacing rather than laughing, I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The book was purchased as a gift so I have little info to share except it arrived in good condition in a reasonable time."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I work in my car a lot- I have gone thru 5 oSedaris' audio sets and feel like he and his family are close friends of mine!I have laughed out loud in traffic jams- and lingered in driveways- great stuff! Thanks!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I picked this up in a used bookstore while I was on vacation just so I'd have something to read during my downtime. I'm so glad I came across it! Literally every story made me laugh out loud! I love to read in bed, and I'm sure my roommate on the trip didn't appreciate the hysterical laughter at bedtime, but what the heck... IT'S GOOD STUFF! It's very rare that any writer can make you lose your breath, make your jaw hurt, and make you lightheaded from laughing too much. Sedaris is a rare breed! If you have the chance to read this, please do!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"It would seem fitting for David Sedaris to narrate his own life story, but I find myself annoyed from time to time with how he reads it. Like he's complaining about everything. Maybe he is, but it's not fun to listen to.But I can ignore it and laugh at the hillarious stories."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I loved this book! I couldn't put it down and I would find myself laughing almost manically at times. I bet people on the city bus thought I was crazy, but this book was absolutely worth the stares I got from my fellow commuters."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read Naked and loved the book. So, I bought another one of his books and it wasn't so good. So, I decided to read one more and this one is hilarious. I think him being out of the country and the language barrier makes this even funnier. Good stuff here. Very funny."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"What is there to say? If you like David Sedaris, you'll like this book. I first discovered him many moons ago, the first time he read \\"Santa Land Diaries\\" on public radio's \\"This American Life\\". When it was re-broadcast I recorded it, and I still have that cassette tape. Played that for my daughter, who then read the story. She knows it by heart. I even photocopied that story from the book \\"Barrel Fever\\" and used it in a high school English class I was teaching.When I recently noticed that \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is the only Sedaris book we do not own, so I got a paperback on Amazon, then noticed a hard cover 1st edition that had been in my \\"save for later\\" basket and immediately got that as well at its original, much lower price, which had been saved in my basket. (Discovered on arrival that the book itself is 1st edition, but the dust cover is new -- but it doesn't matter, as I'm not a \\"collector\\". Both are in mint condition. This was in great condition too.)This is not the only Sedaris book of which we have two copies, either on purpose or by accident. They're worth having, giving, lending.Then, after buying this one and looking it over briefly, I realized I had read it before. Must have taken it out of the library many years ago. But it's just as good now as before. Maybe better.Hey, what else is there to say? If you like David Sedaris' stories and essays you will enjoy this book. 20 years ago, listening to audio tapes of a different one in the car (Sedaris reading, of course), during one story we had to pull over to the side of the road because I was laughing so hard. Seriously.I encourage all who read this review (what a ridiculous thing to write -- a REVIEW!) to buy this and his other books as well. You will love them.And I hope his father, Lou, is reading this, as he calculates the grains of sand on the beach with a stick and many equations. (Inside joke -- you have to read the book.)"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The tip of the roots of Sedaris's witty, crafted writing. I'm an avid fan of his work and Engulfed in Flames is still his best. At least it is for me."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"So glad I put the book on my Kindle. Now I have something to laugh at in any situation. Sedaris is definitely the funny man of this generation and brings humor to everyday life as well as special occasions spanning cultures with a global grin."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Naya Rivera recommended this book in People Magazine. I loved it. I have never laughed out loud at any book and this book was really funny. I got some strange looks from my coworkers when I read in the break room at work. I snorted, giggled and chortled with abandon! I will have to find out how to get in touch with Naya to see what she's reading now. She knows how to pick good books!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Bought this book because 900 reviews suggested this book could be hilarious. I found David Sedaris after reading all of Augusten Burroughs books (HIGHLY recommend!). He was frequently compared to Sedaris.The difference being that Burroughs is actually funny and Sedaris is, quite simply, not. In this book, the chapters are broken down into what are like mini-stories. They don't even seem like they TRY to be funny. You find yourself flipping page after page hoping that there will be some kind of redemption for the 15 pages you just read to find out that the conclusion is just as blatantly boring as the beginning and middle.It sucks that I spent $10 on a piece of literature I cannot and will not finish. It should be like other products- returnable (I bought it in Kindle form.)Save your money and your brain cells- read Augusten Burroughs train-wreck literature if your looking for a humorous read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris absolutely cracks me up! His stories of his family and growing up in Raleigh are particularly fun for me to read since I grew up in Raleigh (and now live near his brother). He is a master spinner of tales!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"While Mr. Sedaris' humor may not be for all...I enjoyed it because I am a sucker for self- deprecation. I applaud the author for his honesty and candor no matter how strange it gets! Highly recommend all of his books thus far...started with Naked, Holidays on Ice saved me through the holidays...Me Talk Pretty was just the icing on the cake and yes...I am now almost done with Dress Your Family...Hoping to see him live in Boston in the Spring!! Keep up the good work Sedaris...I admire your ability to tell it like you see it no matter how foolish it may make you look!

Imagination is such a giftRead it if you would like to have a good time and marvel at writers like Sedars."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Fabulously funny! Just what I needed right now. It lifted my spirits and put a smile on my face. I would definitely recommend this book to friends, so long as they aren't easily offended by \\"language\\". Will get more of his work for sure!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Laugh out loud funny but somewhat lacking in plot or theme. Reads more like stand up comedy than a novel, so depends on what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"SIMILIAR TO NAKED. A UNIQUE AUTHOR WITH A UNIQUE STORY. I WAS HIGHLY AMUSED WHILE READING. ENJOYED EVERY SENTENCE. YOU WILL LAUGH OUT LOUD."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I've heard Sedaris read a story or two from this book on This American Life, and now every single word I read in this book, I heard from his voice. This is a great book, and I very highly recommend it. Maybe look into buying the audio version to hear him read it to you?Either way, great book, awesome author, excellent stories."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"If you like David Sedaris, you'll like this book. If you're reading him for the first time, you'll be alternately amused, shocked, in complete agreement and in total opposition to what he puts on the page. Not for the conservative-minded reader! It's dark comedy, and you may leave laughing with a heavy heart."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I loved this book. I laughed out loud a lot. My family looked at me funny each time. This is definitely a book to read. I can't wait to read another one of his books."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One DayBy David SedarisThis book is about a gay boy and his experiences through life. It follows the hilarious memories and horrible times in his life. I chose to read this book because my sister recommended it. She said she really enjoyed it and that it was funny and well written. David Sedaris' memoir, Me Talk Pretty One Day, is an outrageously funny account of his life from childhood, through adolescence, and up to adulthood.In his elementary school days, David Sedaris had a speech impediment and had to take speech therapy. He hated his speech therapy lessons and decided to avoid saying \`S's for the rest of the year. He bought himself a pocket dictionary. At the end of the year the speech therapy teacher tried to trick him into saying an \`S'. With many failures the speech therapy teacher decided to tell him a very sad story of her life. After the story, David Sedaris said, \\"Hey, look. I'm thorry.\\" \\"Ha, Ha\\", she said, \\"I got you.\\" [pg. 15]. This was a memorable time in David Sedaris' life because he became more self conscious of himself because of the speech therapy and the teacher drawing attention to it.Also, in his elementary years, his father enjoyed jazz so much and was convinced all of his kids were very talented in music and that he wanted to start a family jazz band. He enrolled David and two of his sisters into music courses with David playing the guitar. David tried to play the guitar but ended up with much failure. Finally, he had enough. He came home one day and heard his sister, Lisa, playing her flute from the living room \\"it sounded not unlike the wind whipping through an empty Pepsi can.\\" [pg 24] He also heard his other sister, Gretchen, down in the basement. She was either practicing the piano or \\"the cat was chasing a moth across the keys.\\" [pg. 24] Finally, the not so talented \\"Sedaris trio had officially disbanded\\". From this experience David learned that his talent was not in music and that in order to find his true talent he would have to search through many things such as art and play writing.Another interesting episode in David Sedaris' life is when he tried to learn French. He took classes with a very strict teacher and other people from all around the world. In this chapter, everything said in French is translated literally into English. For example, \\"I know the thing that you speak exact now. Talk me more, you, plus, please, plus.\\" [pg. 173]. During this chapter he and the other students start to feel self conscious of whatever they say in French because of this teacher's strict rules so they learn to barely talk at all. The reason the book is called, Me Talk Pretty One Day, is because it is a literal translation from French. This part of the story is very important to him because in these classes he learns what people think of the United States, and he realizes how he is labeled by other nations.The book also describes David Sedaris' drug experience, his time living in New York, his homosexuality, and his relationship with his family. David Sedaris does not learn a whole lot from his odd experiences. It is basically just what he has been through. But in the last chapter he explains what he has truly learned from his entire life: that he's no good and will never be anything big."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I just discovered Sedaris about 3 months ago, and I am wondering how I thought my life was truly complete before I started reading his works... ok, not REALLY, but anything by Sedaris is a good read, and this one is the best. NAKED had been my favorite until I read ME TALK PRETTY... there are not many books that cause me to laugh out loud when I read them, but this was one of them - the dog looked at me very strangly... Pick it up, buy it read it, then share it with a friend... you will be glad you did and so will they! I just wish that Me Write Pretty One Day..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This is not a novel as such, but more a series of short stories from various phases of the author's life... and being raised by Greek immigrant parents, before moving to France, via a series of odd jobs gives plenty of opportunity for some hysterical anecdotes.This book has the same feel as an entertaining acquaintance recounting his experiences over a drink or the dinner table, and even the events that aren't that funny by nature are transformed by this natural storyteller."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I read this back-to-back last fall with Sedaris' then new book, DRESS YOUR FAMILY IN CORDUROY AND DENIM, mostly because I didn't want the first one to end as quickly as it did.They're both wonderful books, full of the same universally-appealing quirkiness, biting humor, and gym-regular prose. It's really hard to know where one ends and the other begins. I've yet to read a third David Sedaris, but when get to it, I now know enough to go ahead and buy number four at the same time, because I'll likely finish my third one after the local Borders has closed, but have a strong desire to keep reading."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is the 3rd book I've read by David Sedaris in short succession, and it's the best one thus far. Like Holidays on Ice and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, it's filled with the Sedaris trademark self-deprecating humor. But unlike the previous two books, it has much less of a dark-side. The 28 stories are almost divided in two. The first part of the book is dedicated to American living. The second half deals with his trying to survive as an American living in France.The stories about France are the funniest of the bunch. The French think Sedaris represents all Americans, and they're quick to scold him that American's are prudes (during the Clinton impeachment) or that their tariffs are too high (when the price of American products goes up). The French are sometimes seen as aloof. \\"The French have decided to ignore our self-proclaimed superiority, and this is translated as arrogance. To my knowledge, they've never said that they're better than us; they've just never said that we're the best.\\" Even more confusing is trying to figure out the French language. All nouns are assigned a sex, and it's often something that defies logic. \\"Hysteria, psychosis, torture, depression,\\" Niagara Falls, Georgia, Florida and New England are all feminine.\\"Murder, toothache, and Rollerblade,\\" sandwich, corn, string beans, the Grand Canyon, Montana, and Utah are all masculine. Sedaris gives up trying to figure them out, and just orders things in two or more. By using the plural, one uses the plural article rather than the article that reflects gender. This gets a bit expensive when Sedaris starts ordering two appliances, chickens, etc. It's also hard to store everything.One funny story has Sedaris taking an IQ test with Mensa. He is crushed when he receives the results and discovers that he's not even close to being classified a genius. Still, I think that Sedaris is a keen observer of life and a brilliant writer. In the long run, I think those things are more important than IQ any day."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris, if you have not read him, is more than worth your while.Very, very, very funny. Very real, very poignant. Somewhat this is the story of his life as kind of a gay Everyman- an alternately-oriented Charlie Brown if you will. The orientation issue is never overpowering, more woven in as it is added to the list of things that life has thrown at him that he must make the best of. The family is dysfunctional, but with a lot of character and even love, and keeps the stories from just being about a sad, rootless soul. The encounters with the machinery of southern public school, northern private commerce (as a pre-Will Farrel elf), and with France are exquisite. His life is one that we can identify with, maybe with a substitution here or there. His observational humor is clever, and his classic self-deprecating wit helps the reader to always want to root for him. There aren't, and I guess never have been, a lot of great humor writers out there (once you get past the Simpson's writers), but to me Sedaris can take his place with the best of them. I'm pretty conservative, but I know a good laugh when I see one, and a good book when I read one, and this is a very, very good book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was in a college course for Education majors about Sociocultural studies in education. A classmate read the short story entitled \\"Jesus Shaves\\" from Sedaris' book. The whole class was in stitches. This particular piece is about Sedaris' struggles in an American school in Paris where the students (all from differing cultures) are struggling with the concept of Christianity. I thought this story was absolutely hilarious and was on a mission to purchase the book for myself and read the rest of Sedaris' anecdotes.Upon actually procuring the book, I learned that the theme of the book is sort of an autobiographical sketch of Sedaris' own trials and tribulations in life, starting with his problems in primary school (talking about his lisp) and extending into his adulthood (with situations dealing with his sexuality).The book is wrought with humor, some more off color than others... for instance \\"Big Boy\\" is an entire story about a piece of excrement. Don't let this scare you away, though. Weaved into each of Sedaris' tales is a lesson to be learned, though presented in a comical manner.After having my mom read \\"Jesus Shaves\\" she confronted me with the usual, \\"What did you take from this?,\\" and gave me insight to a more morally based meaning of Sedaris' retoric. Thinking back, all of his tales in this book have a deeper, more serious message that we all can learn from, and appreciate."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was the funniest I've read in years! In fact, I actually laughed out loud for several minutes quite a few times. What made it so good for me was I could really relate to his family and their quirks, having grown up in dysfunction myself. Although, some things in the book touch on difficult subjects it never gets too dark, only more humorous. The chapter Big Boy was one I still think about and chuckle, but my favorite parts of the book involved his sister Amy and brother \\"Rooster\\".I feel sorry for people who gave this book negative reviews based on their homophobia. I can understand some being squeamish about the subject, and I don't judge them for that, but Sedaris never gets explicit. I don't get in this day and age the outrage over an author mentioning their boyfriend or dealing with prejudicial remarks while growing up which is the extent of the homosexuality in this book.I wish there were more books as hysterical as this one. I recommend it for everyone with a sense of humor and an open mind."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I had heard so much about David Sedaris that I had to go out and grab a copy of \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" to see what all the hype and kudos was about. I found my answer in no time. As soon as I got into the book, I was chuckling with laughter and wincing with fascination. Sedaris has to have led one of the funniest, most bizarre lives Ive ever heard of. His father's over-zealous attempts to foster a talent in each of his children (in spite of their glaring lack of talent in any of the fields he respectively assigned them) is a source of much laughter in the book. David's encounters with his midget guitar teacher had me on the floor, gasping for breath from laughter. But I think the story that stood out for me the most is \\"You cant kill the rooster\\" about Sedaris's foul-mouthed, monosyllabic, rap-loving brother....that one's a real hoot, I read it and re-read it!!Actually, there were so many good stories that its hard to choose a favorite. I love \\"Twelve moments in the life of the artist\\" about Sedaris' phase of amphetamine addiction...his trips on speed are hilarious. Then there's the one after which the book is titled, which chronicles Sedaris' struggle with the French language while residing in Paris. Generally, the first half of the book is better than the second, but overall a really great read....very entertaining, and in my opinion, very endearing as well. Sedaris writes about his human foibles with no shame, there is a loveable honesty in his work, plus he manages to draw humour out of the most mundane of events. Something about him reminds me of Henry Miller, maybe the story called \\"Big Boy\\" about a giant turd swimming in his friend's loo.....very reminiscent of the famous turd scene in \\"Tropic of Cancer.\\"And while Im rambling on about the book, I just have to mention the opening story (entitled \\"Go Carolina\\") about Sedaris's attempts to avoid any word with \\"s\\" so as to evade the trauma dished out on him by his speech therapist whenever he lisps. Hilarious !! At one point, teh therapist asked him what his family generally does on New Year's eve, and he replied \\"on the final day of the year we take down the pine tree in our living room and eat marine life\\" to avoid saying \\"seafood.\\" Haaaaaaaaaaa!! Go get your copy readers, this book's a keeper !!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The title story of this collection never fails to send me into fits of laughter, and I am not one to laugh easily. If you have not heard David Sedaris on the radio, then you really must try to see him at one of his readings or book signings. His stories are best heard out loud, and no one tells them better than Sedaris himself. That being said, the written stories are excellent and this collection in particular must be owned.The standard Sedaris fare is here as he mercilessly picks on the members of his own family (as well as on himself) for humor's sake. My favorite stories, however, all concern his misadventures in France among the French as well as among the Americans he meets abroad. His sadistic French teacher (of several stories including the title story) and the American couple on the subway who assume he is French and speak openly about him in English are just classic foils for Sedaris's misanthropic character. Humor writing doesn't get any better than this.Jeremy W. Forstadt"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"My sister-in-law suggested that I try David Sedaris's books, and now I am hooked. The title essay of \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" had me laughing so hard that tears began to flow. Sedaris has a genius for describing the absurdities of life, and a real talent for for getting himself in (and out) of very odd situations."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I just finished this book and I thought that it was great-entertaining, funny, and unique. David Sedaris has certainly led an interesting life, even if at times you are left wondering how he managed to get off of drugs and survive a bout of less-than-satisfying jobs (mover in Manhattan, personal assistant to psycho rich lady, apartment cleaner).His family's bizarre idiosyncracies are hysterical and telling. I especially like the story about his sister fulfilling her life-long dream of wearing a fat suit and his father's obsession with hoarding and eating all kinds of food whose shelf lives have come and gone.The stories about France are funny as well, though some of they seem a bit too cliched and typical-the hateful French teacher, the challenges of learning a new language, the unbelievably uncouth and ignorant American tourists, etc.Overall, I would definitely recommend this book if you are looking for an easy read that will make you laugh. David Sedaris is a great storyteller who is able to chronicle the ups and downs of his life with humor and wonder."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I too feel like the gushing reviews somewhat dampened my otherwise pleasant experience with this book. For me, it would have been better without so many critics insisting I would love the book. But that said, he IS funny and this book is well worth reading. His self-deprecation grounds the story, and his characterizations of his family are incredibly vivid. I just wish future editions would pare down the reviewers' comments."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is an appropriate follow up to David Sedaris' &quot;Naked,&quot; and gut-busting hysterical as a warped series of essays can get. Sedaris' struggle with learning French is peppered throughout the book, which gets funnier as you go along. I drew stares as I read this on an airplane trip, as my fellow passengers wondered what I could be reading that would have me laughing so hard. This is by far the funniest Sedaris collection of essays available, from the chapter about the author trying to explain the rabbit's role in the American celebration of Easter to his speech therapy sessions to his observations of the midget who taught Sedaris how to play the guitar. This is great bedside, bathroom or airplane reading, enough to entertain you in the most twisted and pleasant of ways. Right up there with &quot;The Santaland Diaries.&quot;"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have never read a book so consistantly funny. I wasn't laughing at every page, but there was at least one line or paragraph in each essay that honestly made me laugh out loud. I won't give any away; enough are posted here. Any more, and I'd give away half the laughs.I'll admit, I wondered what was going on in Sedaris' head at some points, but at others his thoughts so closely mirrored my own that it was just too funny. His one-liners and anecdotes are wonderfully witty (my favorite was the American tourists in Paris who arrogantly think no one else on the train speaks English). He accurately points out negative qualities of Americans in the second half, yet he doesn't talk down to his readers as he himself is a lazy loaf who spends most of his time in France in a movie theater. Just wonderful. You'll laugh your way through it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was laughing out loud while reading this book--the people around me kept asking if it was really that funny! It certainly was! What a light, refreshing read of about 3-4 hours that went by all too quickly. This book would be great to take to a beach or somewhere where you could not get into deep reading.This was my first Sedaris novel and I am now eager to read the rest, hoping for more pleasant afternoons spent giggling at his hilarious stories."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris' take on everyday life, work, growing up in the south with decidedly northern parents, and life as an American living in Paris is an amazingly witty and entertaining read.His observations on the obsurdity of everyday life is often much more entertaining than his ficitonal essays, like those that fill the majority of one of Sedaris' other books Barrel Fever."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I recommend that you dash out and purchase a copy of Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris. I've been reading this one, snuggled under my duvet, and it's hysterical. David takes us on a comic journey growing up in the deep south of the USA, then though many tragicomic adventures as he follows boyfriend, Hugh, to Paris. Good books are often pretty, interesting and useful. This one defiantly qualifies for all three."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris does it again. This one is not as entertaining as &quot;Naked&quot; but still does the job. Sedaris writes about the full spectrum of human feelings and makes it funny, hysterically, at the same time. So good, you can barely put it down, I promise you that."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I haven't read something this funny in recent memory. Through all the essays in the book, Sedaris talks about his world from a completely outside view, like he's been stuck here in a vaguely mean-spirited joke. He does this in the first part of the book explaining the equally bizzare worlds of his education, his family and his art. In the second half of the book, telling the story of living in France, the outsider-ness is magnified. It is hysterical.Any time he tries to explain Americans, he does with this strange combination of ownership and disdain. Sort of like someone telling stories about the family screw-up. It's no problem for one of them to call Uncle Joe a loser, but heavan forbid one of us does. In aspects like that, its clear he's not writing comedy exactly. He's got some warmth for his subjects, some love for it all. And he's trying to figure himself out, trying to make sense of everything. I think its that aspect, the solidity of his observations, that makes this a really interesting book. Which is not to say I wasn't laughing out loud, tears in my eyes reading about the Pickapocketioni on the Paris Metro."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is a bunch of short stories about a gay man in France. I know this last statement doesn't exactly sell the book, but somehow the author has wound his life into an unusual twist of little adventures that will keep you laughing through out your plane ride. Clever and funny.

(Plus having this book in your collection will impress your indie friends)."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris will have you laughing out loud. This is pure satire from a gifted mind. I read this on the airplane recently and I completely forgot to be nervous or afraid. I was laughing so hard, I had to run to that tiny bathroom. Other passengers must have wondered if I was on drugs... It's just that funny."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"as a fan of david sedaris from this american life, i was ready to devour this book from the moment it entered my hands. the problem was, i just couldn't chug it down. havinf heard several of the early stories read for that show, david's voice in my head kept preventing me from reading without distraction. i also noticed that many of his essays take on more life when he read them than when i was. luckily, this changed as i read on. by the time i got to the later stories from france, the ball was rolling and i was in stitches."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I LOVE David Sedaris. I have all of his books, and tape him when he's on NPR. I think of all of his books of essays, this is the one that's best-organized, and best-structured. His views and insights remind me of my best friend. During times like these, it's good to have some comic relief, and as far as books go, this is my choice. My favorite essays in this book are &quot;Youth in Asia&quot;, &quot;Big Boy&quot;, &quot;Picka Pocketoni&quot;, and &quot;Jesus Shaves&quot;."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Enough has been said about this book that I don't really need to tell you I laughed out loud constantly, or that Sedaris has mastered that rare feat of being funny AND literary all in the same book.

Looking forward to experiencing more great stuff from him!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Good, but slightly repetitive of his previous works. A recommend nonetheless. J&gt;"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have all of David's books - think I'm a bit of a fan? Yes. But of them all this was easily my favorite of his collections based primarily on the second half (the book is divided into parts &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Deux&quot;) which recounts his time spent living with a partner/boyfriend in France. I nearly burst a spleen when he recounted his difficulties with shopping. David's caustic, observational. and self depricating humor is not for everyone - though everyone I know thinks his stories are laugh out loud funny. If you've enjoyed any of his earlier works, don't miss out on this one!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris has found a way to take the subtext of life and put it on paper in a shameless, self-revealing way that leaves the reader gasping with laughter. To take all the little, disjointed comments that you run through your head, but would never say aloud to anyone, whip them into chapter/book form, and find the courage to publish them so that millions of readers can see how absurd you are takes a rare form of courage, a strong sense of self, and great talent. David does it with a flair. If you can't find something to identify with and laugh about in this book, then you are a pompous stuffed-shirt, and you'll probably show up as a character in David's next book!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was on a plane to NYC reading &quot;Naked&quot; for my next book group meeting, when I heard someone a few rows down from me burst out laughing. As I exited the plane, I took a peek at what he was reading and it was &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day.&quot; A few weeks later, on a road trip, I listened to &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day,&quot; and at one point, I had to pull the car over to the side of the road, because I was laughing... so... hard! Reading (or listening to) his books may put you in some embarrassing situations, but it will be worth it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is an apt title for Sedaris' well written book. After reading the reader is forced to admit that David has in fact learned to talk pretty through his lucid writting, yet his humor surpasses even his excellent grasp of the english language. The book would be amazing even if it had been written in simple declaritive sentences. The only problem I found with the book was that some of the stories started to drag on, and I wasnt engrossed as I was in some of his other books, notably Barrel Fever. Despite that flaw, David Sedaris' book easily deserves to be on everyone's shelf. The cost may be high, but you can't put a price on laughter..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"An observer of life and exactly what is wrong with it can be studied right here in this hilariously twisted book. No subject is sacred with Mr. Sedaris; he chronicles his own mishaps and the foilbles of his loved ones with a gently bladed tongue. He forgives the cruelty of life's mishaps and his own place on this Earth - especially his unfortunate command of the French language."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Another more malcontent malcontent!!Keep this on your bedside table and read in stages.

I had heard David on National Public Radio and thought he was fun and funny. I read the book and this collection of short stories just gave me hours of entertainment.

I found this a great pick-me-up book and would recommend it to anyone who just wants some light and fun reading."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was sitting in Goodyear, waiting on my car, making a complete fool of myself hysterically laughing out loud as I read this. It's been a LONG time since a book has accomplished this.No, Sedaris' family isn't really all that different from most families. A little more twisted perhaps, but not all that different. What makes this book so funny is Sedaris' way of portraying these family events. I think that like most things in life, the event is not as entertaining as the re-telling of it. I think my favorite thing in the book is his description of the French vocabulary he developed. It sounds like something I would do. Great words, but completely useless in everyday life.I will admit that I was reluctant to read this book. I don't usually go for autobiographical type work, but I kept seeing the book in magazines and newspapers and finally heard an interview with Sedaris on This American Life. That's what cinched it for me. I figured that if he was that funny and quirky on the air, the book would be as well.

Somehow, Sedaris manages to avoid that deadly cutesy-ness that wrecks most American humor collections. His arched detachment and deadpan delivery remind me of the best moments in Dave Eggers' A Heartbreaking Work... Unlike Eggers, and others, who clobber you with emotional pain, poignancy lies below the surface with Sedaris. He never stoops too low or wrings emotion out of a scene. Wish I could write like this...awesome books, all of them."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"somewhere in your abode and get comfortable. This book is so funny and clever that you will want to read it from cover to cover and and laugh to yourself. Then you will go back to Amazon.com and order all the other books by David Sedaris. Better yet, order a bunch for all those friends who need a rousing, cheerful read."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is an absolute hoot! I laughed out loud, loudly, more times than I can count. His description of his dad, mom, siblings, pals and enemies are hilarious. I haven't laughed this much since reading Forrest Gump."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I was in tears I was laughing so hard during this book. David Sedaris is a wonderful writer. He keeps your interest and the words flow so well throughout. Sedaris is great with dialog. Every conversation is realistic. You only have to read his stuff once.Whether he is describing music class when he is young or apartment shopping when older Sedaris speaks with realism, wit and that ever present bit of sarcasism.I am not prone to peeking into other peoples windows but I love to walk through the 'rich neighborhoods' and sort of NOTICE how those other people live. Sedaris describes his similar experience but with the humor that I never thought of.But this is a memoir not a novel so at times the book losses a bit of focus. It doesn't really go anywhere. Even so it is really fun to read and that's why I picked it up, to be entertained. And I was. With that in my mind it is worth reading. There are not many books today that give you a good laugh and are well written too."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A hilarious trip down memory lane for David Sedaris, shared with us through clever, funny, insightful essays. Glimpses of his childhood, family, therapy sessions, guitar lessons, career challenges, adventures in Europe easily makes him everybodys favorite underdog.

Oops- excuse the pun."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have become acquainted with David Sedaris through his commentaries on NPR and various magazine pieces. This book is a collection of many of those, with some really laugh-provoking spots. Nutcracker.com is a treat (minus the last 4 paragraphs), as well as laugh out loud pieces The Learning Curve, City of Angels, and Giant Dreams, Midget Abilities. There are also wry , introspective, even touching pieces such as The City of Lights in the Darkand genetic Engineering. Sometimes, you get the feeling Sedfaris is indulging in writing along the same lines as he indulged art (Twelve Moments in the Life of the Artist). I cannot find serious fault with anyone else who is enamored with One Life to Live ( I only wish I could have taken his writing class) and who remembers the Vicki fainting at her class reunion story line."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Mr. Sedaris has done it again. His wit, warmth and irrevent style, had me laughing, crying and reflecting. The essay entitled &quot;Big Boy&quot; had me recalling a similar incident, which happened to me on a friend's boat! Mr. Sedaris has the capacity to make his readers uncomfortable. Why? Because his reality is not so far removed from ours, if we are honest. He is wonderful and so is this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was Mink's favorite Sedaris book since B.F. The writer is at his prime, his voice never more confident, his wit never sharper. And the whole Paris thing is wonderful material for him to work with.

Mink still feels that the little elf story is his best story ever."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Dave is a master of the uproariously fake confessional. Plus, it's nice and short."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"First of all, props to Sedaris for revealing so much about his life.... It wouldn't have been easy. Especially about his dark days when he abused drugs and what not. When I picked up this book, I saw all the quotes of reviews on and insides the book. The reviews were very favorable. They all said that this book is so funny that you won't stop laughing. I guess it wouldn't be a lie if I said that I decided to read this book solely on the reviews. Maybe that was my mistake. Maybe I just didn't get what Sedaris was talking about. The book did have some clever and funny parts. But I didn't think that the book lived up to my expectations.Me talk pretty one day actually pretty easy to read. I liked how Sedaris did not use big fancy words to impress who knows what? Oh, I appreciated how he talked about the drugs he had used. It was as if I was right next to him when he was high. Naturally, I promised again to myself that I really shouldn't touch any drugs.Even though his stories can get very strange, Sedaris does a very good job in painting a picture in readers' minds of what is going on in his life.The part of the book I enjoyed most was his childhood life. His odd interpretation of the world was very interesting and also hilarious. But I was disappointed as the story went on.I recommend this book to anyone who is open minded about life. This book is amusing and makes you appreciate YOUR LIFE! When you read this book, you just compare your life with Sedaris's and you will thank God you're not David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Save yourself from embarassing moments and read at home.

Perfect reading for those moments when you think life really sucks."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"maybe its just not my type of humor. i didnt particulary find any of the essays funny enough to laugh out loud, in fact some of them i wondered why others considered them to be funny at all. i read plenty of reviews on the book and the author and was very excited to start reading the book. i am sad to say that i am left very disappointed."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"\\"I know the thing that you speak exact now. Talk me more, you, plus, please, plus,\\" Says David Sedaris, \\"talking pretty\\" in his book, Me tAlK PRettY ONe DAY. (page 173) The quote above is from a story about the absurdities of taking French lessons. The book is a collection of funny memoirs about such awful experiences as speech therapy in elementary school, his father forcing him to take guitar lessons from a midget and moving to France and not being able to speak French. Most of the stories center around his bizarre siblings and parents, including his obsessively swearing brother Paul, his alcoholic, chain-smoking mom and his drama-obsessed sister Amy. As the book progresses the stories take place later in his life and follow him into adulthood. We see him growing older but still being the same timid, disturbed outsider. While this book is not part of a series, David Sedaris has written many other humor books like it, such as Naked, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, Barrel Fever and Holidays on Ice.I think this book is extremely well written and hilarious. It wasn't only the events in the book that cracked me up, but the way he wrote them. His style is very subtle and his jokes sneak up on you. For instance, in the story, \\"Go Carolina,\\" when he is trying to keep his speech therapist from hearing his lisp he desperately avoids using the letter S. \\"On the final day of the year we take down the pine tree in our living room and eat marine life,\\"he says, to avoid saying \\"New Years,\\" \\"Christmas\\" or \\"sea food.\\" (page 14) I listened to part of the book in audio form and it is great to hear him read it because of his calm way of telling the jokes and the way he impersonates his characters.David Sedaris grew in Raleigh, North Carolina with his five siblings. He later lived in New York City and now lives in France with his boyfriend. These provide the settings and material for many of his stories. The only people I would not recommend this book to are little kids or people who are easily offended by language because it contains obscenities. If you like comedy, have ever felt like an outsider or just want to know how not to speak French well, then read this book."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This was probably one of the funniest books that I've ever read. No, his is not \\"politically correct\\" and yes his family is bizarre and no, you wouldn't want to read this to a room full of third graders. However, if you're an adult, a thinking adult who loves good stories, this is the book for you.I liked it so much that in less than a week I bought ALL of his books and am waiting for another one soon."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"After reading the rave reviews in the front of the book, and then the glowing reviews on here, I thought I was in for a treat, especially since I love humorous books. Unfortunately, this humor wasn't for me. I found the writing self-absorbed and tedious. I didn't need to find a private place to read it since I didn't laugh out loud once. I struggled to get to the end. The first chapters were mildly amusing, but it was a slow tortuous roll downhill after that. To compare this to the writings of Mark Twain is to gravely insult Mr. Twain. Luckily, everyone has different tastes and different things tickle different funny bones, but my funny bone remained untouched by this collection."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"From reading the reviews for this book it is clear that this book isn't funny to everybody. I was expecting at least a couple of laughs out of the 270 pages, but it never really happened. This book is written as an autobiography about someone to whom nothing significantly interesting happened in his entire life. The book is composed of banal anectodes that could happen to anybody but that nobody would ever think of writing a book about. The first part of the book is definitely not funny, whereas the second part is slightly better. I got this book as a present and I'm glad I didn't spend any of my own money on it. If you want to read a biography, read one about someone who lived an interesting life!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I guess I missed something when I read this book. I didn't find it funny at all.... in fact... I never laughed to myself let alone out loud. I was highly disappointed in this book. Having never read any other of his works so I have nothing to compare this to, I would not buy any other of his works."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Let the Sedaris fans lap it up, but for me, this book has no edge whatsoever. What's the difference between a performance monologuist such as Sedaris or Spalding Gray and a stand-up comedian? The latter at least has punchlines, but the former just drones on and on. This is cutesy, soft, overly-pleasant stuff - the same people who watch &quot;Mystery&quot; on PBS will love it - perfect for readers who do not want to be disturbed or think too much."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I love a funny read more than anything. But this is too distracting. Okay, he wants to go to Paris-- big deal. The first half of the book almost lost me. I don't think a story has to be so mindless to order to get a rise. There are a lot of other funny writers who still have something to say. Take Orozco's &quot;Delano.&quot; It's funny in the tradition of Catch 22, and it makes some important observations about society and education."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I'm not without humour however, I do know humour. This book simply leaves something to be desired. Its not terrible but more importantly, its not that great. It has been touted as laugh out loud funny, but it lacks the ability to, in most places, crack a smile. Don't waste your time or prepare yourself for a dissapointment. If you lower your expectations then you can be better prepared for &quot;laugh inside, without smiling&quot; funny."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I wish I had read the one star reviews before buying this book. They are right -- it wasn't funny, wasn't cohesive, wasn't interesting. I had to force myself to read to page 50, hoping it would redeem itself, but I finally gave up. There are way too many good books out there to waste my time trying to get through this one."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A complete waste of time. One wannabe funny story after another from a guy who people revere as the humor writer emeritus. I got angrier and angrier after every chapter and said to myself 1.) why am I wasting my time and 2.) why has everyone I ever met liked this book and held it up to some higher standard of humor. And the worst part is that you get from Sedaris the feeling that he doesn't even care about writing or being funny or being human. His stories are no better. funnier, or more strange than anybody else's. This book was on a 'to read' list of mine for years and it was such a let down. I hate myself for having read it."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I bought the book with much anticipated expectation. Its reviews promised a funny-can't-put-down-must-read-book.All I can say is that I read it. Now I want a refund so I can buy something REALLY FUNNY. And belive me, I LOVE DARK HUMOR. But this felt short. If your readers really want to read A FUNNY BOOK, READ &quot;e&quot; by Matt Beaumont or any of the three books by Margot Kaufman. Now THOSE are funny!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I hate to say it, but I'm tossing the Sedaris book aside. I find it absolutely dreadful--not to mention boring.

Yawn!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The item came in the exact description as was given to me at time of sale.

This is a &quot;laugh out loud&quot; funny book! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Mr. Sedaris has a great talent--unfortunately he puts little of it to use in Me Talk Pretty One Day. Compared to his earlier works, the best of which exhibited sardonic abandon tempered with genuine humanity, his latest autobiographical foray will most likely disappoint eager readers looking for a good laugh.Sure, there are moments where the author whips off a zinger, like when he conjures an image of his heavily accented speech therapist (\\"Her people undoubtedly drank from clay jugs and hollered for Paw when the vittles were ready...\\"). But more often than not, Sedaris gives readers uninspired chapters devoted to base topics, like large turds that won't flush down the toilet. (Okay, fecal humor is not my bag, but even if you get off on this sort of thing, the execution is flat.)In previous works a sharp wit like Sedaris would have made something more out of an Information Age commentary or a vindictive French teacher, but what he offers up in \\"Nutcracker.com\\" and part \\"deux\\" of his book is surprisingly flaccid and not just a little bit predictable.It seems to me that the big idea for this book was to sell massive amounts of product. That being the case, our author should have wrapped the pages around a roll and placed them on the shelf in Aisle 5, along side the other packages of toilet paper."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I usually get a laugh from David Sedaris, but this book seemed a bit sparse in that department. Still, he's the funniest essayist since James Thurber, so who's complaining?"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book was hysterical! I knew when I read the first chapter that I would love the whole thing. So many times I laughed outloud, and I had to tell people around me what was so funny. I think im going to buy this book, so I can read it when Im down. I can't believe that someone would not like this book, at least a little. The only thing I can say negative about this book is that I feel that the second part,\\"part deux\\" was not as funny as the first half. Still I would give any one of his books a try!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"The story is rather interesting until you hit the last few chapters where you realize it's more of the same. The author is able to communicate his sense of humor and life experiences and I was engaged until I realized that I was not going to get any insightful life lesson learned from his stories."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Yes, this book is undeniably funny. However, it's the literary equivalent of Doritos (ie: Pretty good, but leaves you hungry. And too much will make you feel vaguely ill.) Borrow it and bust a gut laughing for an afternoon. But don't spend your own money on it, because the vignettes become increasingly stale and vacuous with successive re-readings. Anyway, in a few years you'll be able to find this book for cheap in bookstores' remainder bins, along with Tama Janowitz and David Foster Wallace novels."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"This book is a pretty darn good read...quite funny even. I really like reading it on the bus because the essays are just long enough to get through in one trip. For some reason I can really relate to his cynicism; it takes a real talent to despise much of the world and still be happy. It also take real talent to write about the biggest turd ever..."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Though I didn't find it laugh out loud hilarious, the stories in this book were all very entertaining and amusing in a snickering sort of way.

I plan to try his other books."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"\\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is Sedaris' fourth collection of stories. This book contains some hilarious moments in \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster\\" about his brother, Paul, and \\"Jesus Shaves\\" about French lessons.

I normally don't laugh out loud at books, but in one chapter, I was laughing until tears were streaming down my face."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I have read books, the way some people devour bags of potato chips, all of my life. In my younger, more pretentious days, I thought a book had to be depressing to be smart: Sartre's No Exit, Camus' The Stranger, Kafka's Metamorphosis, stepping stones to the masochism of reading feminist tracts, spiraling ever downward to the study of law and theology. Then a friend lent me a copy of Me Talk Pretty One Day.,I've paid my dues in France and laughed like a madwoman at Mr. Sedaris' take on the language conundrum. I personally like myself and everyone else better when I'm in France for the reason he so brilliantly illustrates: I don't know enough French to understand when they're being nasty and I lack the vocabularly to wallow in my own customary cynicisms.In the chapter &quot;Remembering My CHildhood on the Continent of Africa&quot;, the bit about the field trip to the Ethiopian slaughterhouse had me punching my fists into the couch pillows in a futile effort to stop laughing. Ditto, for his rant about eco-capitalism. I marked a half-dozen pages in a twenty-minute read so I could call friends and give them a laugh. Hot damn!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"It is very rare that I laugh out loud whilst reading. I laughed out loud several times while reading this book--read it in one day. Only people who have no sense of humor would not enjoy it. It is wonderful. I wished I had read it more slowly, but I couldn't stop myself."},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris manages to give us both a laugh-out-loud read and a wonderful portrait of a man and the way he relates to his world. His characters are vivid (in particular his siblings, the Rooster and Amy). His stories are typically self deprecating with a hint of regret or sadness. But he manages to keep it light, leaving you laughing the whole time. The myriad of essay subjects manages to portray so many aspects of one person's life.Since reading the book, everyone I run into who has already read it and I have spent time retelling the stories Sedaris tells. This will not be the most intellectually challenging or deep book you read this year, but it might be the most fun!"},{"Title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"David Sedaris has such a way with words and wit, he makes all of his stories hysterical.

She is appalled to learn of the murder of a young police officer shortly after she has interviewed him for an article. When the body of a well-known businessman is then discovered in the very park where she had observed the officer at work, she makes no immediate connection between the two.An attempt is made on her own life, and Sutton continues to investigate, determined to find an answer to the growing mysteries. Her research takes her to Florida where she uncovers information which takes her back home to D.C. She interviews a judge and a congressman, copes with the jealousy of a co-worker, and, of course, becomes increasingly, although reluctantly involved in a relationship with a widowed police officer who has a small son.The ongoing conversation Sutton has with the little voice in her head is particularly enjoyable, a nice touch.Affaire de Coeur"},{"Title":"Corruption of Justice","review":"The life of Washington News reporter Sutter McPhee covers the Fairfax County police beat, which never seems to have a dull moment. Currently, to gain a story she accompanies Patrol Officer Dan Magruder on his rounds. To Sutter's dismay, the only thing Dan accomplishes besides wasting gas is the arrest of a drunken flasher.That same night, someone kills Magruder in his apartment by shooting him at point blank range. A couple of days later, someone finds an abandoned body in the woods of a person under federal investigation. Subsequently, a teenager dies when he steals Sutter's car only to have the vehicle explode. For some unknown reason, an assailant wants the reporter dead. To save her life and to find out what the hell is happening, Sutter conducts her own investigation, knowing that she might even be in more danger now.CORRUPTION OF JUSTICE is an extremely well done amateur sleuth mystery that exposes political corruption by officials on all levels of government. Sutter remains a well-balanced individual who can be sensitive or hard as necessary. Readers will adore the intrepid journalist and relish the fact that her personal life has moved forward as the series begins to live up to its potential.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 Bible","review":"Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 Bible (DGL3B) is a good book if your expectations match its content. This can be difficult when the cover bears this somewhat misleading quote by Debian founder Ian Murdock: \\"This book contains everything you need to know to get the most out of Debian, from installing it to tapping into its vast repositories of software.\\" That quote should have been applied to Martin Krafft's book \\"The Debian System,\\" which I read right after DGL3B. Those new to Linux will like DGL3B, but those experienced in Linux but new to Debian should read Krafft's book instead.Why is DGL3B a Linux beginner's book? Consider the installation recommendation given on p 25 that says \\"all files in one partition is the best choice.\\" This is really not the \\"best choice\\" for anyone in my opinion. If you're new to Linux and you just want to get an operational system, then following this recommendation is acceptable. I found the installation instructions in chapter 2 to be weak. It spent far too little time on the peculiarities of Debian installation, which is very different from the slicker GUIs seen in Red Hat or other distributions.Beyond the installation chapter, DGL3B covers all of the topics one would expect to see in a book for new Linux or Unix users. Ch 3 describes using a command line shell and the Linux filesystem. Ch 4 covers software management. Ch 5 discusses basic system administration while ch 6 gives advice on performing backups. I thought the explanation of std in, std out, and std err on p 67 was helpful. The backup section introduced me to rdiff-backup, which I now use on FreeBSD. With the conclusion of Part I, readers will not see truly Debian-centric material again until Part V.Ch 7 begins Part II, with 6 chapters on Linux as a desktop. Topics include graphics, sound, desktop environments, Web browsers, mail clients, publishing software, multimedia apps, and games. Almost all of this material could have appeared in any Linux or Unix book. Since I don't run Linux or fancy desktops, I learned of a few apps that had passed under my radar like Epiphany, Boa, and Vsftpd.Ch 13 begins Part III, with 6 chapters in Linux as a server. Topics include security, email/Web/FTP/DNS servers, and remote access. The discussion of SSH forwarding taught me a trick about reverse tunnels.Ch 19 started Part IV, with 6 chapters on Intranet services. Again, these could be applied to any Linux environment. DHCP, NFS, Samba, OpenLDAP, IMAP, POP, CUPS, PostgreSQL, and MySQL make appearances.Part V finishes the book, with 3 chapters on the Debian community, building packages, and the Debian archives. I welcomed this material as it was more Debian-centric than the previous 18 chapters.Your opinion of DGL3B depends heavily on what you want to learn from reading the book. If you're new to Linux and want more of an overview of doing common tasks on a non-Windows platform like Debian, then DGL3B is for you. If you're an experienced Linux or Unix user who wants to learn deeper insights into Debian, I recommend Krafft's book."},{"Title":"Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 Bible","review":"I had already installed Debian 3.1 on my home PC's, and had several years background using Linux / Debian, at a medium user/administrator level. However, all my knowledge from Linux came from scattered on-line manual and pieces. Thus, I purchased this book to have a printed, consistent reference, specially for Debian Sarge (3.1).The pros:- The book gives you a general overview of what you can do with Debian 3.1.- The most useful chapters for the newcomer are at the beginning of the book (bash, debian package system).- It is not hard to read (I am a Spanish speaking user).The cons:- I expected a deeper insight into the Debian/GNU Linux system itself: there is no reference to runlevels, treatment of processes and process management is almost missing, and the same about other common themes such as filesystem handling (mount, fstab), and other important Linux commands. Of course, no mention about installing Windows and Debian on the same computer (e.g. using GRUB loader).- I found the book is sometimes more a catalog of Debian's bundled applications than a coherent description of Debian for the beginner user. Many times it ends redirecting the reader to the corresponding application's documentation if you want to use that application.- According to previous points, the explanation about some applications/tools - e.g. Apache web server - tries to cover the essential aspects but is too weak...- On the other hand, it curiously assumes sometimes you have a background about the subject discussed (in contrast to the beginner approach in other parts of the book).My opinion:You must have a minimal background on computers, and a bit on Linux. It is neither a \\"manual-for-dumb-beginners\\" book nor a reference for intermediate users. I think the authors could have dropped many chapters about setting up things as DNS servers, Apache or things like that (if you want to include that, do it more complete).They could have provided more solid foundation about the core of the Debian System, so after reading the book you had become an intermediate user for your daily tasks. In fact, if you want to seriously set up database or web servers you will have to buy/download the specific books/manuals - you want it or not.Anyway, you can buy it. One more piece of information you will get on Debian."},{"Title":"Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 Bible","review":"From reading the first five chapters, I have mixed opinions of the book. On the \\"good\\" part, a Debian book that gives a high level overview of everything is welcome, because the documentation sometimes loses the forest for the trees. A Debian book is also a good investment because of the system's stability. if Woody is any indication, this book should be current for the next quarter of a decade.On the \\"could have been better\\" side, this book suffers from a certain lack of focus -- is it aimed towards the rank beginner in Linux (in some chapters, it is assumed that the reader is a rank beginner). Or is it aimed towards an intermediate reader? (witness the more complex discussions of APT). While the discussions of apt were involved, they were not IMHO as good as the freely available APT-HOWTO. Any discussion of APT should have been _preceded_ by a discussion of the structure of a Debian repository.The main author himself admits that he came into the book at a late stage to pick up the pieces and put it together. He has explicitly admitted what is implicitly recognizable -- the book has been put together by multiple people at different points in time.Finally there are two CDs in the back of the book -- one a minimal Sarge install, and the other a Knoppix CD. The reader would have been better served by one DVD of a full Sarge install. After all, Knoppix is not really based on Sarge, which is the topic of this book.A better strategy for Linux authors will be to separate their Linux writing into two separate kinds of books -- one kind of book discusses only distribution-specific detail (such as apt and friends). Another kind of book discusses only general Linux programs that are common across distributions (e.g. using ls, vi, etc)."},{"Title":"Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 Bible","review":"I liked this book, it is easy to look up what you want, and it is nicely divided to setup a desktop PC, a Internet server and a intranet server. It puts you on the right track and will get you started. It is however a starter book, and I would not call it a bible. Maybe a beginners bible...? The book comes with Knoppix to let you play without installing and the Debian 3.1 CD. I installed from the CD and it downloaded nicely the other packages I needed through the internet. The book was a good place to setup most things and I believe this is the only book many users will need. If you want to start using Linux and are curious, Debian is great, and I am certain these people will enjoy this book to go with it.Good book, easy to read but lacks depth for more advanced users."},{"Title":"Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 Bible","review":"This book is definitly not intended for professionals, and definition of \\"bible\\" is questionable when book deals with big things such as Debian. Of course this book can't solve every possible problem or show you everything. In order to achieve that, it should have few thousands pages :) However, it will serve you well if you wish a complete guidance in installing debian on common pc platforms and configuring it. It will give you good practical understanding of all linux and debian specific things needed for fast start and will cover most of things you might want to do. Some things You can no expect from this book: this book won't teach you for instance how to build stealth internet server and cover detailed configuration of every aspect of it, it won't teach you how to become supreme administrator etc.But it will give you ability to set up system(desktop, internet server, intranet server), set up desktop, set up samba and connect your server with windows machines, set up dhcp the way most of people need, set up mail system and tell you most things you need to know about it, set up apache and lot more... If you prefer theory, it can also be found in the book.To summarize, it will cover almost every aspect of system that normal beginner/intermediate user will need to set up whether you need to set up desktop system or server. And most of all, it will give you a solid base for solving any additional problem by consulting other resources such as internet, newsgroups etc. It is written in plain, understandable English so anyone could read it and start using this fabulous os."},{"Title":"Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 Bible","review":"A new user of Linux, especially Debian (which doesn't necessarily cater to the needs of new users), might easily feel swamped by the enormous amount of information one is faced with. I was skeptical about the book, having had bad experiences with other titles that promised to be \\"bibles,\\" but I was pleasantly surprised. The chapters are logically arranged, and the writing is very clear. The reader has to do his/her part, of course, and go beyond the examples provided and start doing things alone. The book does a great job of giving the reader \\"the idea\\" about how things should be done. Quite a large number of topics are covered in the 600+ pages, but I've seen tomes well over 1000 pages that could have been reduced to less than half as much, and would have benefitted in clarity as a result.For an overview of how and why Debian is different from other distributions, The Debian System: Concepts and Techniques by Martin Krafft explains it all. For those wanting to learn more about development (programming) after reading Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 Bible, then I would also recommend Linux Programming by Example (by Arnold Robbins)."},{"Title":"Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 Bible","review":"I think a book costing this much money should provide in-depth coverage of the topics.

I wouldn't have so much of a problem with it if I hadn't purchased it. But I did.I did see some value in this book. The authors organized the subjects well. I also found a few tidbits like how to connect to X remotely over ssh. The configuration of DHCP was nice.Here's the but. To cover the topics appropriately, the publisher should have broken this into a series of books.

I can and must say Gospel.True, there have been many before him; Marcel Proust, Oscar Wilde, Truman Capote, Strom Thurmond, but Jason Johnson has eclipsed all other gay intellectual aesthetes. He has exploded out of the closet on onto the page, blowing his steaming load of truth onto the faces of the liberal media, athletes, and other sub-humans.

When he heard that the Duke of Milan was planning to honor his father with the statue of a bronze horse, he knew he had to be the artist for the job. &quot;This would be his mark on history.&quot; Unfortunately, because of events often beyond his control, the sculpture was never completed, and it is said that Leonardo died in 1519, grieving for his horse. Hundreds of years later, in 1977, an artist and art lover, Charlie Dent, read a story about Leonardo's horse, and it became his dream too. He decided to complete the project, and give the horse to Italy as a gift from the American people. Charlie studied horses just as Leonardo had, and worked tirelessly on the project, but he too became ill, and died in 1994, before its completion. Friends of Charlie's wanted to see his dream fulfilled, and so they contacted a talented sculptor, Nina Akamu, to finish the project, and soon it became her dream too. On September 10, 1999, Leonardo's and Charlie's dream was finally unveiled in Milan. &quot;At last Leonardo's horse was home.&quot;..... Jean Fritz has written a marvelously intriguing story, part history, part biography, and part art book, that captures the imagination and takes the reader on an amazing 500 year journey. Her tender, simple, and easy to read text was obviously a labor of love, and is full of imagery and magic. Ms Fritz's words are beautifully complemented by Hudson Talbott's spectacular, detailed artwork, that uses da Vinci's drawings and notebooks, along with his own expressive illustrations, combining pen and ink, colored pencil, watercolor, and collage. Together they've authored a dramatic masterpiece that's sure to peak the interest of history buffs and art lovers everywhere. Perfect for youngsters 8-12, Leonardo's Horse also makes a wonderful read-aloud story the entire family can share. Definitely one of the very best of 2001, this is a book that shouldn't be missed.

Leonardo is shown as a person interested in many different areas of intelligence. This book focuses most on his painting and sculpture. A duke wanted him to make this gigantic bronze sculpture of a horse. Leonardo studied and studied, and he finally made a clay model of what the bronze horse would look like. He never got around to finishing it because the duke took all of his bronze for war supplies, and Leonardo was working on his famous painting, The Last Supper. As the French invaded Milan, they destroyed the clay horse. Even to his deathbed, Leonardo regretted never being able to finish the horse. The rest of this story relates the two artists that sought to honor Leonardo's legacy by completing the horse and presenting it as a gift of American friendship to Milan. Those artists were Charles Dent and Nina Akamu.A couple interesting features of the book are its shape and illustrations. The book has a half circle on top of the normal square shape. The illustrator makes good use of the irregularly shaped pages by making the top of the page the inside of a dome, an arched doorway, and more. There's a step-by-step chart to show how a sculpture is casted from clay to plaster to bronze. Overall, Jean Fritz and Hudson Talbott (author/artist) complement each other perfectly in this work."},{"Title":"Leonardo's Horse","review":"If you thought you knew everything about Leonardo Da Vinci, you may not have known about the horse that he was never able to finish. This disappointment in his life adds a bit of humanity to a man that we often felt attained perfection.That a man separated by centuries would want to complete Leonardo's dream is very touching. He tried to create the horse with the dignity and care that Da Vinci would have used, but not being an artist, his horse was flawed. In stepped another artist, this time a woman, who was finally able to create a horse to be given to the people of Italy. Unfortunately, the man who started the project, Carlton Dent, did not live to see its completion.The illustrations are absolutely gorgeous, and fitting of this story that stretches from the renaissance into modern times. The shape of the book is used ingenoiusly to create illustrations that would not have the same impact in a rectangular format.

Although the information presented in the book is good, it is very basic and does not go into much detail. The information included in the book really only amounts to a thumbnail sketch, and the author seems to concentrate his discussion more on the shortcomings of General Short than Admiral Kimmel.The author bases his arguments from information obtained from the several Pearl Harbor inquiries, mainly the Army and Navy board inquiries. For example, in the chapter entitled &quot;Accountability&quot;, each charge against Short is listed, along with an analysis of the response of Short. What perplexed me is why a similar approach was not taken in regards to Admiral Kimmel? I felt that by reading this book, much of Admiral Kimmel's story was omitted.There are some interesting parts of the book, however. The author presents compelling evidence about the inter-service rivalries that existed between the Army and Navy, and how these rivalries directly lead to the disaster on December 7. Also, the failure to coordinate training and liasion activities between the two branches is effectively discussed.Overall, I found this book to be interesting, but very basic. The information presented is good, but only the surface is scratched and the author doesn't go into great detail on any subject. I would recommend this as an introductory book, but there are other books about Pearl Harbor that discuss these same topics in much greater detail than this one does."},{"Title":"Defenseless: Command Failure at Pearl Harbor","review":"This is a short, crisp book that can be read in a single sitting outlining the failures in the Hawaiian command structure of the Army and Navy immediately before and during the attack on Pearl Harbor. It does not address the issues of failures in intelligence, communications, and command in Washington. For those see Clausen, \\"Pearl Harbor Final Judgement\\" and Victor, \\"The Pearl Harbor Myth.\\" I do not recommend Prange, \\"Pearl Harbor, The Final Judgment\\" due to its many errors in fact and analysis.Over time the Pearl Harbor debate has divided authors into two general camps; those seeking to blame Roosevelt and the service commanders in Washington while absolving Kimmel and Short, and those attempting to present the situation with blame passed around to everyone. The charges against Roosevelt usually center around the idea that he pushed Japan to attack the US, knew when it would occur, and failed to notify Hawaii so the effect of the attack would galvanize the American people into entering the war (against both Japan and Germany.) The corollary to this is that Kimmel and Short were sacrificed as scapegoats to keep scrutiny away from the truly guilty parties. Books such as Kimmel's \\"Admiral Kimmel's Story\\" and Theobald's \\"The Final Secret of Pearl Harbor\\" take this point of view. Leyton's postumous book \\"And I Was There\\" adds to the literature but contains inaccuracies designed to deflect blame from his intelligence and cooperation failures.This book simply focuses on Kimmel's and Short's command failures and treats all other exogenous failures as of little consequence. There is much merit to this approach in that it shows what the Hawaiian command did and did not do to prepare for war and to defend itself without getting bogged down in other issues. A military commander is charged to do the best possible job with the resources he has, including intelligence, and this book, in a very cut and dried manner, rates Kimmel and Short (Short primarily) on this single responsibility. The conclusion is that both commanders were woefully derelict in their duties.There was little (or none) cooperation between the Army and Navy commands even though Kimmel and Short enjoyed a very friendly relationship. The right hand did not know what the left hand was doing, and critical functions fell through the crack as both thought the other was taking responsibility for those functions. Yes, the lack of an overall commander was a deficiency that can be attributed to inter-service rivalry and a command failure in Washington, but the two commanders on the ground could have done much more to alleviate the problems. Unfortunately they didn't. Turf wars also raised their ugly heads among subordinates as discussed in this book, and were not addressed by the commanders.This book shows that the Hawaiian command was given a healthy number of first line aircraft for defense and reconnaissance, but failed to put them into service and use them effectively. In addition, the radar system and the Aircraft Warning Service (AWS) were operable but Short failed to integrate then into an effective defense system. In both cases, blame must rest with the Hawaiian commanders and their subordinates, most of whom enjoyed subsequent promotion and rewarding careers.The Navy spotted and sunk a hostile submarine an hour before the attack, but the communications procedures were so poor that no action of any kind was taken by Kimmel's staff on this incident before the Japanese air attack. Nor was the radar warning heeded by the Army staff, apparently in part because fighter aircraft and their pilots were not on alert and in most part the aircraft were parked without combat ammunition loads. There was no system in place to identify the incoming planes due to a lack of Army-Navy liasion, and no system of communication to operational commanders or their staffs. Truly, the Hawaiian commanders were taking their responsibilities at a glacial, peacetime pace and not attending to details and the resources they possessed.An item of note is that the authors accurately mentioned that Short lowered the alert level from 2 to 1 prior to the attack, but failed to state that Short communicated this to General Marshall in accordance with his instructions. Unfortunately, this only lulled Marshall into believing the Short had placed his command on the highest possible alert status. The problem, unstated in this book, was that Short had reversed the alert status numbers from 1-highest to 3-lowest to 1-lowest to 3-highest without notifying Marshall. This was another communications failure that must be attributed to Short.The authors dismiss the charges against Roosevelt and Marshall saying they \\"... would never have risked the loss of the Pacific Fleet and Pearl Harbor's naval facilities for the mere pretext of America's entry into World War II.\\" Maybe not, but Marshall thought the Hawaiian command was on the highest possible alert status, possessed sufficient air power through both the Army Air Corps aircraft and Naval Aviation to repel any possible attack, possessed early warning systems including a state-of-the-art radar system, the AWS, a fleet of submarines that could be used as pickets, and sufficient long range reconnaissance aircraft to patrol the likely avenues of attack to prevent any surprise attack. The commands had been given a \\"war warning\\" and told that the most likely time of attack would be at dawn on a weekend, most likely Sunday, but Short and Kimmel continued with their peacetime activities and pace.Nonetheless, the authors' statement is fatuous since MacArthur was specifically ordered not to make any aggressive moves or fire the first shot. Clearly, Roosevelt wanted the Japanese to open the war with an attack on American facilities, but he expected his commanders to have done sufficient due diligence to avoid heavy casualties and a crushing defeat. Unfortunately, that was exactly what they hadn't done. Among the higher commanders, Stark was kicked upstairs and relieved by King, but Marshall was deemed by Roosevelt to be too valuable for removal. One wonders.It is perhaps important to note that it is extremely difficult for a military commander to take appropriate and unpopular action when faced with the possibility of hostilities commencing. In 1965 a radio transmission from an US agent in Soviet Russia was received by an US intelligence unit indicating that hostilities were imminent but this information was not acted upon or even passed up the chain of command for action by higher headquarters. The operations officer handling the information feared the information might be a miscalculation by a relatively new agent and was unwilling to risk his career by passing it upwards. Subsequent debriefing determined the agent had sent the message as a test of his communications capability, but no amount of second-guessing can absolve the operations officer of his dereliction of duty. Unfortunately, such officers abound in peacetime, and many were in evidence at Pearl Harbor. I mention this incident only to explain the dynamics of peacetime operations and that another Pearl Harbor can happen without due diligence on the part of the peacetime military and intelligence establishments. Unfortunately, turf wars and career advancement are usually more important than readiness to defend the country in peacetime. And God forbid that anyone should die in training.Another point to make in passing is that Short neither sought nor wanted the Hawaii assignment. This tour of duty was to be his last before retirement, and it should have been apparent that his performance would be more of a caretaker than an aggressive commander. Marshall chose poorly, even when considering that Short had a good reputation in training commands. So did Fredendall, the General picked by Marshall to be II Corps commander and who performed so poorly at Kasserine Pass. With war being almost certain, young, aggressive commanders should have been placed in those operational commands likely to be on or near the front lines.In short, this is an important book that adds to the Pearl Harbor literature inspite of its limited scope. I recommend that individuals interested in Pearl Harbor add this book to their library. The lists of available aircraft, before and after the attack, are particularly illuminating. There is an obvious dependence on a few participant accounts such as those by Bergquist, Taylor and Tetley. These may be accurate, but such accounts must be subjected to the same rigors of examination and confirmation as those by Kimmel and the higher commanders. It is not evident that the authors did this."},{"Title":"Defenseless: Command Failure at Pearl Harbor","review":"There are countless books about Pearl Harbor, and even a few good ones. Whether this counts as one of the good ones really depends on what you are looking for.If you are looking for tales of dauntless daring, look elsewhere. If you are looking for dark conspiracies, look elsewhere. Above all, if you are looking to absolve General Short and Admiral Kimmel of responsibility for having failed to defend their commands, certainly look elsewhere.\\"Defenseless\\" really has only one strength, but it's a very important one. The key to effective defense of Pearl Harbor would have been a modern air defense system (modern by 1940-41 standards, that is). Lambert and Polmar show clearly that Short was given the materials and personnel to build a good system, and adequate time, but failed to get it in operation by 7 December, basically because he didn't place much emphasis on it. In this he was abetted by Kimmel, who didn't hold up his relatively minor responsiblities for the system.The book also lays out lesser but still crucial failings regarding reconnaissance, fighter readiness, and AAA readiness. By the letter of existing regulations both officers should have been court-marshalled for all this, rather than being given the slap on the wrist that they got. (Of course MacArthur in the Philippines should have been given a good old fashioned American tarring and feathering rather than a Medal of Honor, but that's another story.)Whether Kimmel and Short were given adequate and specific warning really has nothing to do with it. They failed to properly prepare their commands for defense and put them in a defense posture appropriate to what they fully knew the general situation to be. This book does a good job of showing that."},{"Title":"Defenseless: Command Failure at Pearl Harbor","review":"This guy make a hell of a case that both Kimmel and Short deserved everything they got in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor. He systematically reviews pretty much everything from the aircraft available to the alerts and orders issued to the arrival dates of the various RADAR sets in theater and pretty much proves both Kimmel and Short had their heads up and locked. Based on this book, it wouldn't have been out of order to shoot the pair of them on 8 December.I was shocked to find out that Pearl had a complete Air Warning Service set up that basically replicated the set up that served Britain so well in the Battle of Britain, but there was too much inter-branch squabbling between the Army Air Forces and the Signal Corps over who would control it to fully man it while Kimmel refused to detail Navy officers to liaise with it or allow it to exercise control over Navy AAA assets.In the final analysis, the defeat at Pearl Harbor was caused by a peacetime mentality as much as anything, as one officer said about the difficulties manning the Air Warning Service; \\"there was a sense that when the war started we'd begin taking it more seriously\\".Readers should note that the book doesn't cover the actual attack, only the incredible inter-service rivalry and peacetime mentality that allowed the Japanese attack to be successful."},{"Title":"Defenseless: Command Failure at Pearl Harbor","review":"This concise read has only 156 pages plus and an extensive Appendix. The authors confine their study to the culpability of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. This is the obvious place to start an investigation but the investigation shouldn't be limited to it and for that reason a rating of three stars was almost given to the book. Another reason for the potential three star rating is the automatic exclusion of FDR from the investigation. Obviously FDR didn't want the death and destruction of December 7th but if he thought our defenses were ready and could handle an attack who knows how far the President would go to get the US in the war. There are incidents, like the oil embargo or the war drills, that make FDR look manipulative and eager to find a way to enter the war that would be acceptable to the American people.The introduction was well laid out by the authors. The rise of nationalism and then imperialism of Japan is described well, the burgeoning role of the US in the Pacific after the turn of the century is also covered. The recognition of a potential war with Japan was noted decades before with the planning of Orange and Rainbow. A brief history of the new US commanders to Pearl is then delivered. I find the choosing of Adm Kimmel and Gen Short to their new posts extremely curious. Kimmel, a friend of FDR and a former employee of his while FDR was in the Navy, was junior to many other candidates. Gen Short was nearing retirement and presented a disinterest in the position. Though both had good prior records, both were not the best choice with a war close at hand.The authors do a nice job of giving the reader an understanding of the conditions leading up to war before delivering their reasons why Kimmel and Short were derelict of duty and why Marshall and Roosevelt were under the misunderstanding that the Pacific Fleet was ready for war.Both officers had been in service for many years, the fragile relationship of Japan and the US was known to both men; they should have taken that relationship more seriously. Though not receiving as many planes and weapons as desired, they did receive planes, weapons and the new radar in sufficient quantities as to be able to defend themselves against an attack by air or sea. The authors list a litany of offenses and errors of omission by the two commanders to prove their thesis that they were derelict.I know for decades the commanders, their friends and family and other advocates, claim their innocence and the Senate finally exonerated them but the authors prove, at least to me, that Kimmel and Short must shoulder the bulk of the responsibility for the disaster. If military standards, like patrols and alertness levels were being followed, if the two commanders took the Washington communications seriously, if the two communicated with each other and more honestly with Washington, if the radar was faithfully used, and many other problems that escaed their attention, December 7th would have turned out much differently. To make matters worse, early on Dec 7th, there were two provocations, a Japanese midget sub was sunk and a Japanese scout plane was sighted and still no defensive action was taken.The Appendix is extensive, supplying evidence to back up the authors' claims. It includes key personnel, dates of Pearl Harbor air raid drills, a list of official investigations, a list of planes stationed on the islands. There is also a list of Japanese planes involved in the attack as well as their casualties. There is a list of US warships destroyed as well as planes and the number of casualties. There is a good Bibliography and a large photo section.The book is concise and easy to follow as well as convincing, if you are looking to read about the Pearl Harbor disaster concerning dereliction of duty or the rising hostilities between the two countries or looking to add to your collection, this would be a very good candidate."},{"Title":"Defenseless: Command Failure at Pearl Harbor","review":"This book is an excellent examination of a system failure that prevented the U.S. military from mounting an effective defense against the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. It is concerned exclusively with failure of the U.S. Air Defense System which had been carefully designed to defend against such an attack.The air defense system designed for Hawaii was an integrated and modern (at the time). It incorporated such newfangled sub-systems as air warning radars (five sites) and a centralized control center serving as filter and ground control intercept (GCI) center staffed by both army and navy personal with direct communications to the radar sites, army air pursuit (fighter) squadrons, army anti-aircraft regiments, and the U.S. Navy warships anchored in Pearl Harbor (fire direction for their ship borne anti-aircraft guns.In addition there was an air reconnaissance sub-system that would utilize both army and navy long range patrol planes to reconnoiter probable Japanese attack routes. All in all a very effective system that would have probably done a good job of defending Oahu.In the months prior to December 1941 all the hardware for the system was in place and the control center was up and running. Unfortunately, like intelligence systems, this air defense system was only as good as the command structures it served. Neither the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Admiral Kimmel nor the commander of the Army's Hawaiian Department demonstrated any interest in the establishment or operating procedures of the system. Since they did not understand it they made little effort in the months before Pearl Harbor to ensure that their senior subordinates cooperated with and supported the system. Not only did the navy opt out of an active role supporting the system, but so did the army. Neither service was wiling to supply either the long range reconnaissance patrols essential to the system nor the personnel needed to adequately man the control center. In the absence of any senior direction intra- and inter- service rivalries and parochial interests hamstrung the air defense system.As is often the case with system failures of any type there is plenty of blame to go around. The authors of this book are especially hard on Admiral Kimmel, General Short and their senior commanders and staffs. It is certainly true that the senior army and navy commands displayed a remarkable lack of interest in or curiosity about what was after all the first line of defense for Hawaii. It is also true both commands appeared to lack strategic sense in their blindness to the possibility that the Japanese might attack the American fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor. On the other hand, the normally brilliant Chief of Staff, General Marshall, does not appear to have made any effort to correct their strategic misperceptions. Further, the brilliant young officers who were really responsible for creating the air defense system appear to have made no effort to explain and \`sell' the system to the senior commands."},{"Title":"Defenseless: Command Failure at Pearl Harbor","review":"The ending sentence on the dust jacket has \\" ... in one final probe into the command failures leading up to 7 Decmeber 1941.\\" As a \\"final probe\\" into aspects of Pearl Harbor, this text published in 2003, is far from being even adequate. The partial oath \\"The Truth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing but the Truth\\" is ill-served by the authors.For example, on page 12 there is an emphatic paragraph which reveals the book's obvious slant - \\"Roosevelt and Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall would never have risked ... It would have taken a conspiracy not of two men, but of thousands over several decades to pull off such a far-fetched scheme in perfect secrecy.\\"Emphatic - no; wishful maybe. Why? Are the authors ignorant or did they obligingly just neglect some facts, for example: (a) the Stimson diary entry about manuevering the Japanese into firing the first shot without causing too much damage to ourselves, and (b) just how many people knew for over sixty years that the Lusitania was carrying contraband - FDR for one is certain? Or how many tens of thousands of people kept the ENGIMA/ULTRA secret for many decades?Another of their complaints is a \\"lack of preparedness\\" - here the authors miss or conveniently forget saliant operational facts. For example, on long-range aerial reconnaissance, that a transition in type (between PBY-3 and PBY-5 variants) was underway, that there were \\"break-in\\" problems with the PBY-5 engines, that spares for PBY-5s were almost non-existent, that fully trained aircrews were small in number. And, the authors, while noting that many more PBY-5s were asked for ... do not mention the fact that well over 200 of these birds were sent to England in 1941 under the Lend-Lease program by order of Harry Hopkins. That the spares and trained crews went along is well-known; the PBY-5's pilot which spotted the Bismarck was an America. [A far more worthy treatment of this topic is found Gannon's \\"Pearl Harbor Betrayed\\" (e.g., see page 323, note 56).]For better \\"preparedness\\" - perhaps if the Hawaiian commanders were made aware of the \\"Kita Messages\\" (aka \\"Bomb Plot\\") read in Washington in the Fall of 1941, or of the true status of negotiations with the Japanese in Washington, or if Kimmel/Short had access to a PURPLE machine (by October 1941, England had three and Hawaii none), or if the Knox \\"midnight\\" (midnight of 6 December 1941) message sent from Washington to Kimmel was received, or ...And, where is that Knox message today?

The book was written by an American, Bert Hall, who volunteered to help the French when WWI broke out in August 1914. Initially he spent time as an infantryman but eventually wound up in the \\"Flying Corps\\" - one of many outdated terms used in this book. However, I felt that these archaic words or phrases really gave it a sense of charm, and also let the reader know this is a genuine, first-person account of WWI. The author never calls a plane a \\"plane\\" or an \\"airplane,\\" like we would today; instead he usually refers to it as a \\"machine\\" but sometimes also calls it an \\"areoplane.\\" The Germans, France's enemy in WWI, Hall often labels as \\"the Boche\\" - another oudated term that was mostly used only during the Great War. And so on. As I mentioned, the book is riddled with descriptions such as these.Hall wrote this book while the War was still raging and he was recuperating from injuries back in the States. He gives no sense of whether or not he thinks the Allies will win; instead he just mentions that he wants to continue the fight when he heals...\\"I must go back to good old France!\\" he writes in the first chapter. The book is rather short at only around 150 pages, but I'd say there are two invaluable parts to it. The first part has to be when Hall talks about his \\"dogfights\\" in the air, and his methods of attack. The whole idea of combat in the sky was still relatively new; many of these first pilots were just figuring out how to do things. Some planes didn't have any guns; others were \\"two-seaters\\" with a pilot up front and a gunner in the rear; bombing runs consisted of the pilot bringing some bombs with him and throwing them over the side of the plane. Fascinating stuff to read, really, for those interested in aviation history.The second noteworthy feature of the book is that Hall makes mention of some famous episodes in history, e.g. the murder of Rasputin, and what he witnessed of the Russian Revolution. So from that perspective it serves as an important historical document. Interestingly, and somewhat surprisingly, another figure is conspicuous by his absence - Hall does not mention the most famous pilot of WWI, and arguably, of all time - Manfred Albrecht Freiherr von Richthofen, more famously known as \\"The Red Baron.\\" One might think that Hall might have something to say about the Baron, even if boastingly, as he does about the Germans/\\"Boche\\" in some passages of the book. But there is no mention of the Baron at all. I suspect he might have realized that anything negative he said about Richthofen might come across as foolish, as Richthofen was clearly a very good pilot. So perhaps Hall decided that some things are better left unsaid.I gave this book four stars, not for Hall's prose (serviceable at best), bur for it's interesting look into early wartime aviation history. Those wanting to gain some insight or understanding of this period will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"I have read a few book on witchcraft and have recently been getting back into wicca. this book is a wonderful way to remind you of how important nature is.

In Witchcrafting, Ms.Curott's explains not only what we do, but the in's, out and why we do what we do and that through these things (and certainly not the only way) we can connect with the Divine and deepen our spiritual relationship.Another aspect of this book I like is that she boldly rejects the ever so popular \\"Three fold law\\". Not since Doreen Valiente have I seen or heard of someone who claims the title of Wiccan and rejects or at the very least, questions the \\"Three fold law\\" so that for me was refreshing as I too am one who rejects fear based \\"spiritual guidelines\\" as I see no purpose for it as I am a firm believer that if your heart is led by the Divine, then your actions should be guided by it as well.\\"Personally, I've always been skeptical about it because it doesn't seem to me to make sense.

I thought it was a wonderful book for my budding practice. The writing is a step up from much of what I've seen and I enjoyed the inclusion of some science in it (even if it is mostly pop physics). It really gave some weight to the ideas for me, to see the ways that they connected to the physical world in theory as well as in practice. I felt like her understanding of her own practice was a bit higher than that of some other authors I had read. Perhaps she just explains it more. Either way, I get a better understanding from her.I actually like the radical changes she proposes, but see where it could turn some off. I didn't really understand spellcasting in the way it's shown in books like Buckland's. A lot of books say &quot;here's what to do&quot; but not &quot;here's why&quot;. I never felt comfortable with following recipes mindlessly and didn't really see the point. Her assertion that magic is that which takes place when you commune with the Divine fits better my own experiences. I didn't feel like she was anti-magic. I just felt like she treated active living and introspection as the first step to solving a problem and as a form of magic in itself. I think it gives the practitioner a much greater sense of efficacy. I don't mean to say that a seasoned group of spells that people have practiced effectively and fine-tuned are meaningless or should be ignored. I just feel that many of those books don't go into their reasoning as much and it makes it harder for a beginner to learn as much about what he or she is doing.Though Curott presents her opinions as truth, she does a good job of presenting them as *her* truth. She admits her positions aren't always popular, but explains clearly why she chooses to believe that way. I'd also agree that there's a feminist bent to it, as well as more information on Goddess than God, but I think that the information on the God aspect is wonderful and certainly an adequate place to start.If you want a primer on Traditional Wicca, this isn't the book to choose. It's certainly eclectic. I like this, but if you're already interested in a particular tradition, you'd be better to look elsewhere first. If you're looking for a good exploration of issues and ideas, though, and don't mind an eclectic approach, I think it's a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"So I'm sitting in my little Witchcraft shop thumbing through this book. I didn't read it because these kind of books aren't my cup of tea. No value judgment, just the facts. BUT, I did manage to hit the brakes on what was perhaps the most refreshing thing I've seen in a mainstream Witchcraft book in a hell of a long time. Our hero Phyllis, bless her, has managed to dump that three fold law crap! Finally a Witch who doesn't buy into that cleverly disguised Christian concept of a punishing deity. I know, I know, that's not really what the three fold law means. Well, yeah it is. As long as there is some force balling things up and throwing them back at you three times over, you've got a judge in heaven. If the three fold law meant anything, the pope wouldn't have lived so long, Ryan White would have lived a lot longer, and George W.'s head would have exploded a LONG time ago. So thanks Phyllis. It's about time."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"I loved this book!! Very well written and well put together. Her ideas make sense, and I was thrilled to see her views on the Threefold Law of Return, which match what I have felt all along. She touches on the ethics and whyfores in a way that is sorely lacking in many of the other witchcraft, new agey books out there."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"As a solitary book-trained Witch, I have always felt held back out of fear in that I was not quite doing it right. In her new book &quot;Witch Crafting&quot;, Ms. Curott has laid those fears to rest by carefully explaining not only what Witches do, but why and, using her own life experiences, thoughtfully describes what types of experiences one should expect when practicing this religion. Ms. Curott is an excellent teacher who sprinkles numerous practical exercises throughout &quot;Witch Crafting&quot; so that one can hone one's skills. In the pleasant, down-to-earth tone that she used in &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;, Ms. Curott tackles tough issues about spirituality and ethics (topics missing in many popular books on the Craft) without being preachy or know-it-all. Janet Farrar aptly declares on the back cover that &quot;Witch Crafting&quot; is &quot;destined to be a classic.&quot; &quot;Witch Crafting&quot; is a welcome addition to my library."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"I'm not Wiccan, but my girlfriend is. I picked up this book without telling her, because I wanted to gain a better understanding of her beliefs and practices. I found the book to be extremely helpful-it gave me insights that a year of hanging out with a Wiccan never did. The book was very well-written, and I the author's voice allowed me to get a true sense of her (and my girlfriend's) deep sense of joy and well-being that Wicca provides them.I would recommend this book strongly to non-Wiccans who want to learn more about this fascinating way of life. And I think Wiccans will find the book to be a wonderful affirmation of their beliefs.To me, there's no stronger magic than the experience of reading a good book. This book is truly magic."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"This is a very interesting book. I fully recommend it to anyone looking for \\"mystical\\" answers. You may not agree with everything -- and that's OK. But take whatever you get from this book and simply make it yours. Try it. It works.Also recommended: \\"What Did Jesus Really Say, How Christianity Went Astray: [What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information]\\" by Peter Cayce"},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"While the author has some wonderful excercises in expanding and deepening your journey into Wicca, one can help but feel a little misguided. She talks about how the concept of the ThreeFold Law is outdated, inappropriate and inaccurate. Ok, that's the way that she feels. But it sounds like she's slapping people such as Gerald Gardner in the face. Is it outdated? Maybe. But it is no more outdated than the Qabalistic ritual that makes up most of Wiccan ritual. While it's true that the ThreeFold Law isn't Wiccan, that doesn't mean that it doesn't belong in Wicca. After all, isn't the Qabalah a part of Judaism and Hebrew philosophy?Her idea of \\"What's wrong with the ThreeFold Law\\" is just not represented right. What's actually wrong with the ThreeFold Law isn't what it's about or what it represents, but the way in which people who aren't educated in that field interpret it and relate it to others. If you don't know what it is you're talking about or don't understand it, of course you're going to end up misrepresenting it. I just think she could have spent a little more time researching Judaic magickal systems and philosopy before she wrote those pages, and a little less time making those like Gardner and Valiente (after all, she did edit his Book of Shadows)look like utter fools. Yes, even they were prone to mistakes. But if they felt that something such as the ThreeFold Law were inappropriate to Wicca, I'm sure that they were intelligent enough to have left it out."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"If you need another beginner's book on the Craft, then this is probably about as good as it gets these days (and that's not necessarily a compliment). You won't find much new material here, if at all, but it is well written and much less fluffy than the majority of books on this subject.I must say that I did specifically enjoy the bits of material that addressed spirituality, as it was a refreshing change of pace from the mass market books that peddle mostly spells and such. However, the exercises given were a bit too weak in my opinion, and the &quot;advanced techniques&quot; simply bordered on silly. It was also disappointing to feel that the author seems to view herself as THE spokesperson for the Craft today, and sets out to change some of the basic tenets such as the Three-Fold Law. Well, time will tell, I suppose.Basically, what you have here is a general presentation of various aspects of modern Witchcraft as seen through the eyes of this particular author. I personally felt that some sections of this book seemed designed to undermine and derail the beliefs of those that see the Craft as something older than this author understands it to be. But then again, that's modern politics in the community these days. Hey, welcome to the we're right and you're wrong club!."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"When I saw Witch Crafting I thought it looked serious. I've grown tired of \\"13 steps and you're a Witch!\\" and spell books that don't teach ethics, even give out dark spells to cowans.So I saw this, and thought it looked real, the religion Wicca, not the cheap flashy version, and it was, sort of.I enjoyed it's fresh take, it was light on the how to and heavy on the why. Not for beginners, but an interesting read for intermediate or higher.But as I read on I found it somewhat preachy and biased. These views are definetly Phyllis Curott's views, and do not represent Wiccans in general. If you're interested in Ms. Curott's tradition of Wicca then I say read on, but to everyone else I say keep in mind this book costs a fair bit just to have someone else tell you how they think Wicca should be."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"This book is wonderful. I simply cannot recommend it enough. I have read the other reviewers comments that the book is preachy or that Ms. Curott sees herself as the spokesperson for Wicca, and honestly I never got that impression at all. To each his own, but these comments may reveal more about the reviewers and their own hangups then they do about Ms. Curott. Whether someone is a hereditary witch coming from a long family tradition is not only unverifiable, but irrelevant. Witchcraft may have been around for ages, but Wicca is a new religion arguably based on ancient practices. It is still a young religion, evolving, and &quot;finding&quot; itself. Ms. Curott brings up many good points and arguments in her book, things to get you thinking, which is never a bad thing. She also addresses something I find sorely lacking in most books on the Craft. She talks about spirituality, grace, and divinity. Wicca is a religion afterall, if you only want to cast spells, and have no interest in developing a deeper relationship with the divine, then well, just study magick, why bother with Wicca? Bravo Ms. Curott!Brightest Blessings!"},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"I'm a beginner and have found this book very enlightening and helpful. Ms. Curott's writing allows the reader to feel relaxed about witchcraft and to enjoy it. Sometimes I find myself in a race to the finish line. \\"I need to this, so I can do this\\". And freak out if the techniques aren't coming to me easily as they should be. Not so with this book. Smelling flowers or watching bees at work can be part of the learning process. It definitely has a holistic view to witchcraft than some books in the market. Each exercise can both a beginner and intermediate level. I disagree with people who say that you have to read X amount of 'Wicca 101' books in order to read this one. This is what worship of the Goddess and communion with Nature is all about. Not athames, ceremonial robes and degrees. My only problem is that urban practioners may feel a little left out. This is definitely for people with access to greenery, water and privacy."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"A book that not only shows you how to do magick, but also why. It does not stop there, however. At it's heart it's much more about the deep philosophy and spirituality of Wicca as a religion and a science, and how to work in harmony with the universe. It covers a very broad array of subjects, including a great section on the God (often an afterthought in many books). Most importantly, it challenges some Wiccan dogma that many take for granted (karma, 3-fold law) and makes you think."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"This is a book that is an &quot;either/or&quot; for me. While it is thought provoking and interesting, it is not for beginners. I agree with the reviewer who said beginners could be confused by the controversial suggestions she makes (discarding the three-fold law is one). Beginners also may be intimidated by the exercises in the book.Curott also contradicts herself in some places. What I think bothers me the most about this is that she suggests a more 'shamanic' approach to Wicca, which I am all for, even if she uses the term 'shamanic' rather loosely (to signify a more &quot;Earth-centered&quot; spirituality). She decries the use of elaborate ritual and pseudo-archaic language in ritual but turns around and proposes one of the more intricate and elaborate ritual scripts I have seen in a while.She also appears to decry traditional spell casting, in favor of more New Age concepts like meditation, visualization and prayer &quot;In circle&quot; mind you, while giving traditional correspondences anyway. I am a firm believer in writing your own spells and there are no &quot;spells&quot; as most Wiccans understand them, in this book. This is also a point that could be incredibly confusing for a beginner.A reviewer mentioned that she implies that only Wiccans honor the Goddess, which is true as well. There is no mention of other Pagan and Heathen religions or non-Wicca Witchcraft. She does seem to claim the word &quot;Witch&quot; for those who practice Wicca only, at the same time preferring not to use the word &quot;Wicca&quot; because it is &quot;too masculine&quot;.Another reviewer mentioned that there is a definite feminist slant to this book, which is also very true. A man might find himself excluded from Witches in this book, in an anti-patriarchal stand that almost reduces men to an inferior status, which is definitely not okay. Another point that might confuse beginners and possibly annoy male beginners.On the flip side, she does make some really great statements and some are even quotable in this book, such as: &quot;Wicca is the jazz of religion--its beauty and power is in the freedom it grants you to play and improvise.&quot; Unfortunately, she seems to contradict this one and many others several times in the text of the book.If you have extra money and want a book with a highly individual spin on the Craft in your Wicca library, go ahead and add it to your collection. If you don't have a lot of money, pass on this one and pick up a good beginner's book like &quot;The Real Witches Handbook&quot; by Kate West or a good Wiccan philosophy book like &quot;The Heart of Wicca&quot; by Ellen Cannon Reed. If you're interested in a book of spells, try &quot;The Real Witches Kitchen&quot; or see if you like &quot;Natural Magick&quot; by Sally Dubats, which I am planning to pick up soon when I have the money, since it looks like a very nice book (and I would like to have at least one decent book on spells in my library).Since I don't have a lot of money, I am returning &quot;Witch Crafting&quot; to my bookstore and getting something else I know I would like better."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"Ms. Curott's book is rich with much-needed detail: in-depth circle casting, solid foundations and motivation for spellwork, and broadly-defined Wiccan theology. I would consider \\"Witchcrafting\\" a worthy addition to the magickal library of anyone who is hungry for a more profound and powerful relationship to the God and Goddess.As many other reviewers have noted, her dismissal of the Threefold Law only goes so far. I've always viewed the warning in the Rede as a somewhat one-dimensional means of helping lesser-skilled witches resist the obvious temptations of spellwork contrary to \\"harm none\\".My jaw literally dropped, however, when reading that I and my Wiccan brothers should embrace the Goddess because \\"...She restores aspects of men's humanity and divinity [...] sacrificed to an unbalanced and unhealthy conception of masculinity...\\"; and, later on, that She offers us all \\"sexuality and eroticism that is whole and integrated into the realm of feelings, instead of isolated and objectified in body parts, magazines, porn flicks, one-night stands, and strip clubs.\\"At no point does the author make the slightest effort to clarify this sweeping, blatantly sexist stance, nor does she quantify her description of All Men's Failings to exclude those who cannot be so described. I confess, I had to go to Wikipedia to learn that the gender opposite of misogyny is misandry: the hatred or contempt of men.This totally offensive and appallingly inappropriate gaffe aside, the other 98% of this book is an extremely worthy read; enriching in its content and very well written."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"I hope folks will think twice before believing Ms. Curott is setting herself up as some kind of \\"ultimate Wiccan authority\\" with this wonderful book. As she states on page 4, \\"This book is not the gospel according to St. Phyllis. Not everyone will agree with the conclusions I have drawn from my journey, and I'd be appalled if you did-I'd immediately feel compelled to start rethinking most of it. My goal is not to convince you that all of these ideas are right, but to stimulate dialogue, innovative thinking, and creative practicing - to stir the cauldron of magic.\\"There is absolutely no \\"we're right you're wrong\\" thinking in this book. I will always be a fan of Ms. Curott because, like Starhawk, her writings on Witchcraft and the Goddess are down-to-earth, sensible, intelligent, practical and *real*. I wish this book had been around 5 years ago when I first began my own Goddess journey! I do think an intelligent beginner would not find it at all daunting. And it does indeed serve as the \\"Wicca 102\\" text that many of us have been hungry for - we are so weary of the tired old cookbook approach of \\"stand here, say this, do that\\"! She emphasizes that Witchcraft is a form of spirituality and not merely a method of manipulation to get what you want (attention all goth girls who've seen \\"The Craft\\" one too many times!)I don't feel she is discounting the historical legacy of Witchcraft at all; she does acknowledge its vitality and importance, but as she states on page 7: \\"I want to suggest something radical, realistic, and re-directing: The legitimacy of modern Wicca as a meaningful, powerful, and real religion does not depend upon unbroken, hereditary, organized lineage. The fact is that the greatest and most profound cultural and historical phenomena is the birth of a new religion. Witchcraft may, in a real and romantic sense, be the rebirth of an ancient religion, but ultimately the phenomenon of modern Witchcraft is the birth of a new religion.\\" Amen and blessed be to that!And yes, the Three-Fold Law desperately needs to be consigned to the dustbin! The reason you don't do negative, manipulative magic or otherwise cause harm is *not* because if you do, it will \\"turn back on you three-fold\\". You don't do it because - it's *wrong*!! Let's leave the \\"retribution of a wrathful God\\" theories to the patriarchal religions, shall we?This marvelous book receives my highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"Phyllis Curott is my favourite wiccan author, who inspired many of us with the story of her journey in \\"Book of Shadows\\". Now in her latest book, \\"Witch Crafting\\", she focuses on YOUR journey. In it, she covers the basics of wiccan lore and liturgy, which makes it an excellent wiccan primer. However, she also goes much deeper, questioning the very basis of wiccan ethics and thealogy. This is not a book on how to make yourself feel mystical with obscure herbs and candles. It is a book about growing as a person. About becomming the best person you can be. About crafting your SELF. Hence the title.As a witch down undah, I was very pleased to see that she gave correspondences and directions for both the southern and northern hemispheres. At last, authors are beginning to realise that for half the world, the equator (and therefore fire) is to the north!I love the author's down-to-earth style. I love that she doesn't pretend to be anything more grandiose than a human being. She makes wicca accessible and meaningful and invites us all to use our own intelligence and intuition in the continuing evolution of the wiccan religion. Blessed be."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"I have been reading books and studying Wicca for 14 years. This is the book I have been waiting for, wishing someone would write it.FINALLY a book that dares to speak the truth about Wicca. Wake up folks, it is NOT some unbroken, handed down religious tradition from prehistoric times. It's not all spells and incense (thought that stuff is lots of fun). It IS based on age-old concepts and techniques, what little we've been able to dig up anyway, and what's more important (as this book says) Wicca is a new religion for a new world. That's something to be proud of, not something to cover up with lies about history and authenticity.People who have been practicing Wicca for a long time know that there is a deeper side to what we do than the majority of books out there would have you believe. Thank you, Phyllis Curott, for having the guts to write about it and working so hard to get it out there for the mainstream!This book is a solid, thoughtful introduction to Wicca for newbies, and has a little something extra for more intermediate-level practitioners. Ms. Curott makes you really think about what she asks you to do, because you can speak the right words and burn the right candles and feel nothing...if you don't know the meaning behind what you're doing! Following the practices in this book is a beautiful way to experience Wicca...don't just READ about it! DO it. Experience is the best teacher."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"I've had this book for several years now, and as I have evolved in my spirituality I have come back to it with new eyes every time I read it. Overall, I love it. There aren't many rich, spiritual books out there for those new to Wicca, and I hope all new practitioners get the chance to read and absorb this.I do have some of the usual issues (as with other reviewers), such as the idea that recognizing the divine in others means we won't hurt them. I can't say I feel that way, considering how much I want to beat the daylights out of some people sometimes. But morality is a very individual thing, and I think eventually all well-balanced people reach their own sense of inherent morality and find ways of behaving that don't harm others; whatever the motivation or reasoning behind their belief. If you need the threefold law, or don't, or something else, then whatever works for you is fine - as long as you can justify your choices.----------------------------------------------------The biggest issue I've developed with this book as I re-read it; is something I've been having trouble with in a lot of books I've read lately, and an issue that is really starting to rub me the wrong way the more I think about it. In this particular book it isn't a big issue, and you might even miss it if you aren't reading too closely. But it is what made me think of this, so here I am.The author mentions, when talking about behavior and morality and such, that nature-based indigenous cultures didn't engage in the \\"evil\\" destructive behaviors that humans seem to be so good at today. I cannot even begin to explain how this idealistic, perpetuated belief is wrong - and from The Earth's Children series (Clan of the Cave Bear) to other non-fiction works (especially Pagan based), it is quite pervasive.Imagine, if you will, you are living a very long time ago in human history. You are with your family group, living in a harsh world and trying to survive the best you can. You're lucky to have reached your 25th birthday, and if you are a female, you're very lucky to have survived childbirth. Just the other day, your group came across a lone wanderer - but you didn't take the time to get to know them. Who they are, where they come from, it doesn't matter. They were a real and direct threat to your existence and survival, so your family killed them without a second's hesitation. If you were to ever get lost from your group and come across another, the same fate would await you. In your own group, you face the threat of deadly disagreements, and of course any neighboring tribes that you do know will be considered enemies.This is what early human life was really like - harsh, brutal, and short. People didn't sit around worshipping the Goddess and singing kum-ba-ya with every stranger that came calling; they did everything they could (including their fear and reverence for the land and divinity) to survive.Think to a bit later, the whole of human history until now in fact, to the times that people were constantly at war with each other, and barbaric acts were committed against humans on a regular basis.Now think about the world you live in today. Sure - people are still waging war and hurting each other. If you believe evolutionary behaviorists, it is in our nature. But you should also consider the real statistics (discount the inflammatory media machine) - and you will realize that we live in a much safer, more cooperative world then ever before. It was unheard of in early human history to live in a neighborhood of so many strangers and get along with them, much less the amazing communities we have created. We are an evolving species - and if you compare the humanity of today to the truth of yesterday's humanity, you'll have a much more positive outlook on where you are at.I simply cannot understand how we can glorify and idealize all of these periods in our history, and with equal intensity vilify the wonderful times in which we live. We will never be a perfect species, none are. But we are unique, and as such carry much responsibility for the Earth we live on and for each other. Considering what has come before, I think we're doing quite well, and I'd much rather live in a world where I can choose the actions I take, and the ways I live, than in a world were I didn't have a choice. I can choose to use technology, or discard it; I can choose to harm another, or help them. I'm glad I know better, and have the beliefs that give me that choice. If I lived in the past, it wouldn't be so."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"After studying the Craft for seven years and being initiated for five of them, I was experiencing difficulty finding suitable books. I had covered almost everything in the easy to find Wicca 101 books. I wanted something that would delve into the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of magick while leaving room for creativity and individuality. Witchcrafting is such a book and more.Curott departs from the usual spell cookbook format to challenge our thinking, go into a discussion of ethics within a truly Pagan framework, discuss the nature of deity, and analyze the how and why of magick (spellcasting). She also presents new definitions of &quot;magick&quot; and &quot;Witch&quot;. The views expressed in this book are bound to step on a few toes and draw criticism, but it is important for us Witches to be open minded and discuss both our common and differing views as we shape the future of our religion. She wisely warns against letting our beliefs become dogma and never acts like her way is the only way.The only problem I see with this book is that while Curott presents it as suitable for both beginning and experienced Witches, I doubt that it would be suitable for someone just starting out on this path. Some of the exercises, especially near the beginning of the book, would be OK, but most of the book would be difficult to understand for someone without a basic knowledge of the Craft. I would suggest first reading several Wicca 101 type books, such as Book of Shadows by Curott, and living the magickal life for a year or two.I would recommend this book to anyone who is open to new ideas, willing to be given a lot to think about (I sure was), and isn't content with simply reading something from a book during ritual (at least part of the time). It would also be an interesting selection for a Pagan book discussion group."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"This book is unbelievable. It opens you to all that is possible spiritually. It is the step past just spell crafting and going to the understanding of the regilion behind of spell crafting.

It allows you to see where the power comes from.I would recommend this book for the beginner."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"For anyone just getting into Witchcraft, there is no *one* book that I would recommend, I'd expect that they'd read at least a couple of 101 style books, and then move onto a more specialised reading list.This is one of the books I'd most highly recommend, maybe not as the first book, but perhaps 2nd or 3rd - it's more 'Witchcraft 102' if anything.An example, I was quite bemused by the presence of divination as the focus of the second chapter. Why so early in the book?And then I realised - when you first ask the universe a question, and unexpectedly, *get an answer*, that can be one of the most powerful first experiences of communion with the Divine. Knowing that you can ask, and receive answers, is indeed a valuable tool for a beginner, although one to be used cautiously.It's this, and other revelations, that make it an excellent book, because like the saying, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink, and while you can't directly show anyone connection to the divine, - they have to find it for themselves, this is one of the better books to provide that insight, and lead them to that spring."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"This book is an excellent, well written book for anyone beginning to really get into spellcrafting and witchcraft.

As a practicing occultist of many years I frequently buy books from many different systems, so I try to stay away from the light, fluffy, mass market publications,(starts with an L, ends with an N). As a book on Wicca, I found it to be very refreshing. It's gratifying to see a book on Wicca written with this kind of thoughtful depth. The book not only succeeds on the level of a wiccan book, but as a book about living a magickal life, as well. While I wouldn't agree with some of her views, she makes it very clear that she isn't the be all and end all of Wicca, and I assume magick in general. I found her views on the quantum nature of magick interesting and thought provoking, and the exercises in the book are both simple and effective. I've always felt that magick is best performed from a basis of understanding rather then mechanics, and this book makes that point very effectively.

Miss Currot's sexism is a little unnerving, and I also don't agree with some of her ideas. But that's also a good thing that I don't agree with her in some areas. That's the purpose of this book, and why it's so much better compared to most other Wiccan books on the market. This book is meant to be thought-provoking, and even controvesial. Phyllis isn't setting out to change our minds, and certainly the book is slanted to her views, but she is out to make us think and debate about the spiritual aspects of the Craft in a mature way. In that, I think she succeeds. We need people like Phyllis, and people like Bonewits, and so on. We need people with radical ideas in the Craft, but who also, while breaking from tradition, recognize that's a good thing and a stimulating thing for the Craft, and helps keep it vital as the growing modern religion it is."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"I recommend this book highly to the seasoned practitioner of wicca who is already extremely familiar with the basic form and structure of ritual work and has a strong foundation of meditation practice as well as a wide knowledge base of the who, what, when, where, why and how of witchcraft. It urges us to return to basic practices with a fresh approach that breaks through crustiness. It questions long standing beliefs, invites discussion, and urges us to take a look beneath what may have been lying dormant too long. A practical and extremely effective handbook, it provides a good magical workout. However, I believe it is irresponsible to market this book as intended for beginners. It is too deconstructive and controversial. I believe it could be confusing and unhelpful for those not properly prepared.

For any lover of spirituality and mysticism, the ideas coincide well with the law of attraction as well as many things I've come to learn in eastern religions and mysticism.

Unlike so many other books on witch craft and paganism, the focus is not centered on history and facts as it is the real experience of embracing the divine. I have learned through the author's teaching how to have a deeper relationship with the divine and a better understanding of myself. At no time did I get the impression that I was being scolded or looked down upon. This book is one of the few that has earned a permanent place in my library."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"Like Book of Shadows, Ms. Currott's first effort, this book is packed with personal experiences and perspectives. Ms. Curott, like many others, and myself has rejected the idea that Wicca is rooted in an unbroken line of practitioners within the mysteries of the past. Instead she lists the components, both ancient and modern, and exposes the fallacy inherent in clinging to outdated thoughts of purity of lineage as a basis for Tradition. She also puts forth the wonderful idea that Wicca isn't the resurgence of an old religion, but the birth of a new one. She also outlines what I think is one of Wicca's greatest strengths: Wicca teaches us to embrace our shadow side, to learn who we are, warts and all, and to acknowledge rather than repress those shadows that make us whole humans. While I agree with the premise of throwing the Three-fold Law out on its ear, I DON'T agree with what she feels should replace it. The concept that ALL acts of Magick are Divine in nature and that the Divine can't possibly harm anyone or anything are totally incomprehensible in a mind that otherwise is sharp as a tack with the business end up. Magick simply IS....it's neutral, what makes it evil or good depends solely upon it's prescribed use by the practitioner. Intent is 9/10 of the makeup of magick. The other 1/10? Fate or Destiny or whatever other word you want to use to fill in the blank with. While I found this book readable, and certainly entertaining, I DO NOT recommend its viewpoints. I simply can't. Sorry Ms. Currott. ..."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"Phyllis's second book at least admits that there are men in Wicca, a big improvement over her first book. However, she still has a way to go before admitting that men in Wicca are acceptable. She admits that men are there BUT says men must change, which is another way of saying that men are not okay, which is another way of expressing deeply held misandrism. Sexist prejudice is an unfortumate inclusion in a book about Wicca, a religion that usually rejects sexism and other kinds of prejudice, and I expected better from Phyllis. Men such as Gardner, Sanders, Buckland, Fitch and others have always been among the leaders of Wicca, and probably always will be. Its a shame that Curott can't seem to write a Wiccan book that accept the male half of Wicca. Men do not need to change to be acceptable.Other than her continuation of sexist theology, the rest of the book is pretty good. It does include recent political positions on history, accepting claims of recent revisionists. On the whole its probably good to add to a collection of Wiccan books for histroical and teaching purposes.

Her descriptions of magical events seem exaggerated at times, (mostly in her Book of Shadows book) which I can excuse.

Still, most of us do believe in our own karma, regardless if we follow the Law.BUT she then has the ovaries to say experiencing the divine will be what keeps you from doing harm. Once you experience them, you won't want to harm again, because that is when you fully realize the divine is in everyone! No. I know many people, and I know they are as divine as me.

Blessed be."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"I found Witch Crafting, by Phyllis Curott, to be an interesting and very worthwhile read. The author provides sound advice for beginners concerning many areas of practicing modern witchcraft. The chapters are titled: Real Magic, Divination, Nature, Sacred Space, The Goddess, The God, Witchcraft without Rules, Secrets of Spellcasting, Potions-Notions &amp; Tools, Energy, Solitary Practice, Groups and Covens, and Sabbats.For the more seasoned practitioner, Curott discusses such topics as the relationship between magick and quantum mechanics, which has been an area of my own interest as well. Overall the book was an informative and delightful follow-up to her previous work, Book of Shadows.Now, turning to another matter - I found much of the critical reviews of this book to be totally unfounded. Curott makes it very clear in the introduction that she is NOT setting herself up as the authority on anything. In the book's introduction she writes: &quot;This book is not the gospel according to St. Phyllis. Not everyone will agree with the conclusions I have drawn...&quot; Curott then goes on to explain that her goal in writing this book was &quot;not to convince you that all of these ideas are right, but to stimulate dialogue, innovative thinking, and creative practice.&quot; It appears that the stimulation has been successful.Regarding the allegations that this book attacks the hereditary witches' lineage claim, I don't really see it that way, per se. What Curott says is: &quot;...there have always been individuals who claim they were initiated in traditions which remain hidden behind the veils of secrecy - and there may indeed be hereditary traditions waiting for a safer time to emerge.&quot; Her phraseology does seem to indicate that she does not believe that any current claims to being from a long family witch lineage are valid. However, it does appears that she believes hereditary witches may exist but have yet to come forward. As a hereditary witch myself, who did come public in my own book, I would respectfully disagree with her overall position. And as an Italian witch, I admit that I was disappointed that Curott chose to recommend Leland's negative portrayal of Italian witches over any positive books on the topic. Still, I do not believe that Curott intended to offend the Italian witchcraft community, so let's please be careful about pointing fingers in return.I think we all need to remember that everyone is entitled to their considered opinion, and I would not want to live in a country where such is not the case. Personally, I don't feel that her few isolated remarks impact the quality, integrity, nor importance of the work as a whole. I highly recommend this book specifically for those who want to view and to practice Wicca/Witchcraft as a modern religion."},{"Title":"Witch Crafting: A Spiritual Guide to Making Magic","review":"Phillis Curott is an excellent writer with an easy to read style that makes concepts that would be difficult for beginners easy to digest. I am no beginner, but I was once and I know that I would have welcomed her writing.A really great thing about this book is that it is not yet another compendium of spells and potions and herbs, etc. These books exist ad infinitum and if you read any two Wicca 101 books you've read them all. I am certain that many of you reading this who have purchased many books on Wicca will agree with me. This book is a book about the spiritual dimension of Wicca, its metaphysics and why Wiccans do what they do. Don't worry, Phyllis is not saying that her way is the only way. In fact, she admits that there is no way to really get Wicca wrong and that you are supposed to come to your own understandings.Phyllis is a bright star on the Wiccan horizon and will, if she maintains the quality of her writing and the knowledge she imparts will, in short order be one of the true luminaries of Wiccan writing specifically and magickal writing in general.If you want to deepen your spirituality, your relationship with the God and Goddess, read this book and let its ideas pass into you to inspire you. Sometimes, just sometimes someone who possesses the title of High Priest or High Priestess actually, through their apparent knowledge and expertise has actually earned the title.Buy this book!

Phyllis takes us into her circle in her new book, &quot;Witch Crafting&quot;, and explains how one can make everyday magic using the practices of Wicca, a shamanic tradition of ecstasy and communion with the Natural World and the Sacred Universe.Unlike so many books on Witchcraft which merely explain how-to, Phyllis thoroughly explains the theological underpinnings of &quot;why&quot; Witches do what they do. Rather than downplay subjects like divination and spellcasting, she reclaims them as spiritual practices used by Witches to communicate with the immanent divinity and religious rituals where Witches &quot;co-create reality with the Sacred.&quot; Tackling serious ethical issues, Phyllis urges Wiccans to abandon dogma and reframes Wiccan ethics to harmonize with sacredness in the world. Going beyond the standard rhetoric regarding nature and the elements, Phyllis provides exercises for both the beginner and experienced practitioner that allow one to experience rather than merely imagine these potent elements.Bravo, Phyllis, for providing a groundbreaking primer in Wiccan theology!

I have found the vast majority of such works to be infantile, riddled with lies, and absolutely insulting to the intelligence of those who understand Witchcraft as a religion. To my great pleasure and certain amazement, I chanced upon Ms. Curott's book while browsing a Halloween display at a local bookstore. After thumbing through its pages for a short while, I sat with the book and have been nothing short of impressed ever since. The author's investigations into the spiritual essence of Witchcraft, the validity of certain tenets, and the importance of bridging the gap between mysticism and science have proven stimulating reading. Her honest approach to 'hereditary Witchcraft' comes long overdue, especially in a movement which, misguidedly, attempts to draw validity for its theology and practices through the fantastical illusion of historical roots, long disproved by the works of historians, anthropologists, archaeologists, and the seeker with a taste for reality.

Like Curott's Book of Shadows, it is very different. While most books explore the &quot;how-to&quot;, instead she explores &quot;why-to&quot; side of the craft. Her ideas gave me new thoughts while making me re-think old ones. And even if I disagreed with her on some level, I always knew why she feels the way that she does.

Other than for a piece or two in an anthology, I had never read Ferlinghetti, period. Having enjoyed the hospitality of the upstairs poetry room, that seemed somehow ill-mannered of me.Simply put, I liked this collection. The images and meanings are more subtle than a lot of poets with Beat roots. He can really paint a word picture to put you in the scene. You instantly soak up the nuances of the whole. Then maybe he'll nudge you, ever so slightly, into seeing the absurdity in it. Or perhaps he'll interject a reminder of your own mortality in a simular subtle way. It is appropriate that one of the poems deals with Edward Hopper. I get that Hopperesque quality of an observer in an existential urban landscape with much of the collection.About the only difference that I detected from the first 27 poems (written by 1955) and the 18 new ones (new in 1995) is a difference in rhythm. The older poems have much more of that classic coffee house beat- at least in my head. Of yes, he also uses the term &quot;cyberpunk&quot; in one of them....

The only reason I can come up with is the extensive use of surrealist imagery and references to other poets, painters, sculptors etc., that the poems are full with. But in \\"Coney Island\\" there is a similar creative procedure--even the line order is \\"floating\\", as in \\"Pictures\\", so why is this book less known than \\"Coney Island\\"? It is probably not a matter of quality; probably more people feel attracted to read a book about Coney Island than one with a title which at first sight doesn't seem to say too much about its content.The poems incuded in \\"Pictures\\" are nevertheless great. This collection of verse is probably one of the most representative works during the Beat generation, along with Ginsberg's \\"Howl and other poems\\" (also published in City Lights Books) and Kerouac's \\"On the Road\\". Ferlinghetti succesfully intertwines surrealistic and dadaistic tendencies with oral speech, complex verbalization processes such as ekphrasis, which show the poet's skills at his best.This second edition brings us 18 new poems, which every Beat fan must get. Some of these new poems are quite remarkable, such as \\"Surfers are poets too\\", and there are some \\"addenda\\" to the previous ones. For example, no. 6 includes a whole new stanza, and words in no. 1 have been changed.

The main character, Felix Fabri, starts out by overseeing a group of galley slaves who fish a bloated, drowned German guy out of a harbor and parade him through the streets of town to his burial site. Later on, he helps a cohort slice open another dead guy and pull out his intestines. And all through this book there is plenty of vomit, rotten things, people burned alive, human waste, worm-infested water, decaying bodies, hacked-off limbs, pus-filled wounds -- and there's Fabri's beloved Saint Katherine, whose decapitated body shoots out milk instead of blood. Oh, and Fabri carries a dried human tongue around in a pouch that he wears around his neck. Not that I choose books by their gore-index mind you. I simply say all this to drive home the point that the events Holman describes are vividly corporeal. The reader is drawn close to the action and really sees, hears, smells (usually gross smells, by the way), tastes (also often nasty) and touches the things the characters encounter. I love to read about life in other eras, and this book, along with being a great read, put me right into the center of the action. And lo and behold if I didn't learn more than a few interesting facts about medieval life, too!"},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"I've read some wonderful books this year, but the one which sticks in my mind is The Stolen Tongue. Friar Felix is one of the most finely etched characters in historical fiction. And wow!--what a journey he goes on. Felix is on a pilgrimage to the Sinai desert to meet with his spiritual wife, Saint Katherine. Along the way, we have relics, lots of relics, lice, mad men and women, devotion, love, prayer, and of course, death-- all written in fine detailed language! It's one journey I won't easily forget and Sheri Holman writes it with great skill. She is easily one of the best writers I have read. Don't miss this book. It's a great story."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"A STOLEN TONGUE is a brilliant first novel. The complexity of character, motive, setting, and intrigue is technically magnificent, and the rich historical fabric and the philosophical/theological asides are nothing short of ingenious.The emotional involvement of Friar Felix with an idealized St. Katherine and her demented avatar, The Tongue, compel the reader into the novel's underlying sense of spirituality, while the matter-of-fact descriptions of everyday fifteenth century hardship ground that spiritual mood in a real and very difficult world.I read this novel after THE DRESS LODGER and was immensely pleased at the differences in narration, setting, and overall mood between the two books. Ms. Holman is a very talented author."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"A quick note to the reviewer before me: whether you spell Catherine with K or C has to do with the tradition you come from: C is the Latin spelling, which made its way into English and French; K comes from the Greek, which made its way into German (English is influenced by both of these traditions so we see both of these spellings in English). Felix Fabri is a German so it's not improbable that he would refer to Katherine with a K; &quot;the Tongue,&quot; Arsinoe, is also (I believe) a Greek woman. In any case, I picked up this book because of professional and pedagogical interest in the topic, and by and large, I have to say that I enjoyed reading it. Some things about this book are really excellent: the description of the material conditions of the middle ages, the pilgrimage descriptions themselves (some of which, esp. the complaints about the immorality of fellow travelers, are taken from Fabri's own comments), and the interactions with Muslims. However, the sort of achingly romantic tone that the character Fabri takes when speaking of his spiritual bride, Katherine, is out of place. While there was a mystical quality to late medieval piety that we might today term &quot;romantic&quot; (in the wake of the 19th century), the statements that the character Fabri makes about wanting to have sex with his spiritual bride, Catherine, or admiring her breasts, etc., are out of place--these would have bordered on heresy in the middle ages, which used these concepts at most in a highly figurative way. Holman seems to confuse the figurative chivalric &quot;romantic&quot; qualities of the late middle Ages with an overstated nineteenth century romanticism that would have been foreign to the period itself. Another issue that bothered me: Fabri's continual reference to how dirty everything was, which I think is overstated. Everything in the MA was probably indeed dirty and disgusting--but it was that way because it didn't bother people to the extent that it appears to bother Fabri. To sum up: the author uses a lot of authentic detail taken from Fabri's own words, but she misinterprets significant aspects of it. For the historian, the fact that she tells an exciting story does not entirely mitigate this problem."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"This is the story of Felix Fabri, a Dominican from Ulm in Swabia, daring a 1483 pilgrimage to the obscure tomb of Ste. Katherine of Alexandria somewhere in the wilderness of the Sinai Peninsula. He imagined himself betrothed to the saint and it is this spiritual marriage that drives him to find her earthly remains. Lugubrious Felix was an actual historical figure (1441-1502) whose compulsive yearning was recorded in Aubrey Stewart's The Wanderings of Felix Fabri (1896; reprinted AMS Press 1971). It would have helped the reader to discover the historical orientation at the very beginning of the book instead of hidden away in the &quot;Author's Note&quot; on p.341. But Holman prefers to startle the reader by beginning in midst of one of the dreadful days of the journey and then feeds bits of information until the reader gets the idea. Alas, this is not a mystery novel where you would expect an unravelling of &quot;who did it?&quot;. Instead the story moves exceedingly slowly through a world of superstition and religious mania with few noteworthy events. Felix narrates on several levels: with his fellow pilgrims, with the imaginary presence of Ste. Katherine, but mostly ghostlike with his confratres back in the Ulm monastery. It's likely that most readers will initially experience confusion and wonder who is talking to whom. There is a gimmicky element in Homan's style, as if she intends to vex, even confuse, the reader. Perhaps her acrobatic narrative skill tries to conceal the fact that there isn't really much of a story. And fickle Felix isn't much of a protagonist - there are no conflicts to be solved, no values to be defended. In short, there's no hero with whom the reader can sympathize or identify. Uncanningly clever metaphors and similes try to make up for this lacuna. Unfortunately, the effort stuffs the story so chockful of deliria and hallucinations and obscure metamorphoses that its pace slows to murky meanderings. When Felix finally says, &quot;I can play this game no longer, brethren,&quot; many a reader might concur and seek a quick end to the book. Nonetheless, Holman's talents as a writer cannot be dismissed. Language's malleability achieves genius in her narration and her stunning vocabulary. She is an obedient follower of writers' workshops that insist on casting exposition into lively dialogues and even clever word games (the pilgrims associated saints with spices: St. Dominic = hot pepper; St. Anthony of the Desert = oregano). Holman's surrealistic scenes are interesting; for example she juggles metamorphoses of the woman Arsinoe into her own husband, into Ste. Katherine, and into a number of other vague entities. It is apparent that Holman thoroughly researched the physical and cultural conditions of the Middle Ages. (Among tidbits: In 1969 the Catholic Church annulled Friar Felix's spiritual marriage and Ste. Katherine was removed from Catholic canon). This is a difficult book to review as it mingles genius with gimmickry and leaves important dimensions unfulfilled."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"The path of the pilgrim, in historical and fictional treatments, has been marked by guideposts of greed, of lust, of avarice -- any number of deadly sins. Yet Sheri Holman's Felix Fabri, a holy man of mortal fallabilities, clings tightly to a fierce brand of faith on his pilgrimage to Mount Sinai. Holman has endowed Felix with a spiritual desire so strong, and a sense of humanity so true, that we are swept up in the journey to face the mysteries and horrors when the sacred and profane collide.Holman's research and remarkable eye for detail -- historical, religious, and personal -- never fail. A very strong debut by a new voice in historical fiction. This is one &quot;Tongue&quot; that must be bitten."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"The first commandment of historical fiction is: Make it real. Make it seem like the reader is there in that time period, and this Sheri Holman does exceedingly well with her first novel. In 1483 a friar travels from Germany to the Sinai desert on a pilgrimage. The clothes, the modes of travel, the smells and tastes are drawn well enough to bring the reader into the time period, but here also the author has created the mental landscape, the beliefs, misconceptions, fictions, prayers and foundations of medieval knowledge that seem so wrong and at times humorous to us.

I found myself having to reread paragraphs at times to make sure I understood the true meaning of what Sheri Holman was saying.

Supposedly, it is based on the real life of Friar Felix Fabri (1441-1502) and his search for the remains of his wife/Saint Katherine of Alexandria. But, since I had the book, I began reading it. For some strange reason (possibly a religious epiphany?) I couldn't put the book down. My lack of religious training made a bit of the book incomprehensible to me, but on the whole this adventure, the severe challenges facing the pilgrims, the blood-curdling descriptions were entrancing. I will now search for another Homan book."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"At first I found the prose slightly tedious and awkward, not due to the inflection or topics but more in the voice of the character not meshing for me 100% but, as the story unfolds I was drawn in and eagerly reading to find out what happens next.It was a true adventure and I never guessed what was coming next. Each detail had purpose, either to fully engage you in the environment or to overwhelm you (in this case it was a positive overwhelming - like when you walk into a bakery and the smell of bread is thick and luscious) with the circumstances, actions and boundaries of the world.The research for these details and relationships is very evident with movements, landscapes, reactions, objects, history etc you wouldn't be able to know unless you had. Which compels you more.If you have a fondness for adventure, mysticism and mysteries - you will enjoy this book.Sheri Holmes' book, \\"Dress Lodger\\" is a fantastic read! That one, for me, was perfect. Prose, story, pace! A true haunting gem."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"Sheri Holman's book, A Stolen Tongue, 'spoke' to me from shelf after shelf of a used bookstore where I was overwhelmed by their volume of inventory alone, and found myself unable to concentrate on too many items, and read the dustflaps indepth enough to capture my attention. Yet, somehow, this book is one of the few that made its way into my grasp.I have been a fan of Umberto Eco's works ever since reading 'The Name of the Rose', 'Baudolino', and 'The Island of the Day Before', and Sheri Holman's effort here ranks up there with Eco's storytelling in terms of historical fact, authenticity of tone, and conception of setting and surroundings.Concerning a friar of actual historical existence and his pilgrimage to recover the remaining relics of his spiritual bride, Saint Katherine, which have begun to disappear. On this quest, Felix Fabri finds himself embroiled in a mystery that is part Eco, part Chaucer, and part original Sheri Holman. Playing out like a twisted Canterbury Tale, Friar Felix finds himself on board a ship with a beguiling woman, Arsinoe, who claims that the friar's 'wife' speaks to her in her mind. At once intrigued and repulsed by this woman, who is surely to touched and wanton to house the spirit of his beloved Katherine, Felix nevertheless finds himself unable to forget her, or to depart from her side voluntarily.Felix is then drawn into a greater mystery than he ever imagined, as this enchanting yet portentous witch draws him further and further into her spell.Peppered with the words of the actual friar himself, Sheri Holman's story is as well written as a Medieval mystery comes.Critics here on Amazon call the book extremely well written, yet 'boring' - however, it would appear that many have missed the point that a Medieval pilgrimage was rarely a big, sweeping, Hollywood-esque 'epic' - and perhaps the true engrossment of this tale is the blurring of the lines between fantasy and reality - where Friar Felix claims to be 'wedded' to the Saint, and the woman Arsinoe claims to embody her voice and spirit...how can Felix help but be besotted by her tale?A top-notch story, well worth investigating. My hope is that author Holman continues to write in such a vein."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"A medieval monk undertakes a pilgrimage to Mt Sinai to visit the major relics of his spiritual \\"wife\\", St Katherine of Alexandria. Along the way, he encounters a mysterious woman claiming to be \\"St Katherine's Tongue\\", because she hears the voice of the saint giving her messages to disseminate to the present day world. After one day's acquaintance, this mystic inexplicably vanishes. At the same time, the small relics of St K, such as her ear and yes, her tongue, are stolen on the very days that Brother Felix visits them in their holy shrines. Intriguing, no?Intriguing, no., which is unfortunate because this plot holds such promise. This short (352 pages) novel's downfall is the absence of any real action. Lots of talk, lots of prayer and philosophy, lots of getting on and off the ship, but while Felix attempts to solve the mystery and restore to his \\"bride\\" her missing parts, he fails to convey any sense of adventure or excitement. The details of medieval life are there and seem accurate enough, but the life itself is lackluster. The back cover promises humor, but it is as well hidden as the pilfered relics. Perhaps the story would have better been told by a 3rd person, but we'll never know. And who okayed the title?This is the fourth of Holman's novels that I've read, two of which (Mirabilis and The Dress Lodger) were equally flat. The Mammoth Cheese, set in modern America, is much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"I was expecting another descriptive, intriguing book by Holman. The Dress Lodger is one of my favorites. This book disappointed me. The plot was weak and the conclusion was lacking (although without a good plot it would be difficult to write a great end)."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"Throughout my educational days, I have never read a book which has brought my intellect to such a high extreme. I am overwhelmed by the amount of research, thought, and imagination brought by this author. For a first book, or even a 10th book, this author deserves all the highest praise available for this book. If you miss this one, you have surely missed a winne"},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"There's no doubt that Sheri Holman's promise as a writer shines through the pages of this, her debut novel. She has crafted an intricate, historical story with detailed characters and fascinating medieval anecdotes.Nevertheless, I didn't find the book very exciting, and I don't know why. It just didn't do it for me. Maybe I'm just used to the suspense and sheer intellectual power of an Eco novel, and since Holman has been compared to Eco, perhaps I was expecting too much.But as you can see many other reviewers liked the book, and i was persuaded by their arguments to get it. If you're an Eco fan, however, you might be a bit disappointed."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"I wanted so badly to like this book. I read so many positive reviews on Amazon, and I like historical fiction generally.The main character, Father Felix, is a sniveling, demented crybaby and sissy. I wish I would have been there just to smack him upside his head. I doubt the real Father Felix acted this way.I expected there to be some mystery involed in the plot as well, but Holman was very transparent in this area.I wonder what this book would have been like had Ian Pears written it. (hint: MUCH BETTER)If you are a Holman fan, read it. If you have a long bus ride, and you have a copy of this book, read it."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"I am a big fan of The Dress Lodger, so I had high hopes for this novel. But it didn't deliver. I gave up on it a third of the way through. Neither the characters, nor the plot, nor the style grabbed me. I don't care what happens to anyone. Hopefully The Mammoth Cheese will be better."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"I read this book about 4 or 6 yrs ago and I enjoyed it. I have since looked for books by the same author."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"Hmmmmmmmm.....Catherine with a C or a K........Who cares? Holman is a talented writer which makes this an enjoyable read. However, the story became tedious at times and confusing. Friar Felix is an entertaining, well developed character, while others I kept asking myself, why are they here? The images of the 15th century, created by Holman with her vivid descriptions of vomit, pus, ooze and any other vile concoction is effective and had me wrinkling my nose at all the appropriate times."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"What a treat it was to find this richly detailed novel of the personal and spiritual journey of Father Felix Fabri. This very human man of faith pulls us effortlessly into his world and along the uncertain and dangerous road of his pilgrimage. Holman has presented us with a character who serves as confidante and moral center of his traveling party, but without the off-putting piety of some in religious service. As he (and the reader) become embroiled in the mysteries and dangers of the journey, Felix questions his sacred beliefs as many of us have, and emerges with a stronger and more temperate view of all faiths, the secular world and his fellow man. A mature and thoughtful reader will surely count this novel among his or her favorites."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"Excellent first novel by SheriHolman. I loved her favor ofdetail, the little things matteredyou could taste the food, smellthe air, and almost live it.This book is wonderful andcomplete, no triliogy needed."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"This book does an excellent job of conveying the mindset and worldview of someone who is participating in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in the 1400s, as well as all sorts of details about what the pilgrim encountered when there. Having a window into that world was interesting, for a while.However that is not enough to make a good book. The primary disgusting aspect of this book is the constant theme of reveling in dried up body parts of supposed saints, but there are other disgusting aspects as well.The book starts out interesting, conveying how very different the bizarre world view of a religious christian at that time was to the world we live in today. And there is a problem introduced that seems like it is going to be a mystery that will drive the plot. But then after the first say 1/3 of the book, the middle of the book is succession of boring and tedius groveling and praying at various holy sites. (This could be interesting if this is of meaning to you.) Then at the end, aspects of the problem return, and things get really grim and disgusting. There is no mystery and ensuing detective thought and insight, there is just straightforward progress in dealing with the problem. Oh yes, a touch of \\"magical realism\\" that jumps in out of the blue at a critical scene at the end.It is too bad there is so little plot, and what little there is has such a unpleasant taste to its resolution. The author has gone to great effort to provide a well-written and excruciatingly detailed picture into the world of 1400s pilgrimages, which I did find interesting. But it reads more as a boring travelogue framed by a bit of plot distastefulness at the beginning and end.Also, in an afterward, you read that it was based on the translations of this real guy's journals. So then I wonder how much of it was actually conceived by the author, or just put into good narrative form from what was extant in the journals."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"Wow! Holmen's A Stolen Tongue is wonderfully witty with unforgettable characters. Friar Felix's pilgrimage to the Holy Land is rendered in perfect detail, you can taste and smell the experience. The actual mystery keeps you guessing to the end."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"A rare and delightful find, this book takes us on a 15th century pilgrimage from Germany to the Orient. Along the way we, along with pivotal (and actual) character Father Felix Fabri, are quickly embroiled in a riveting theological mystery. Tracking body parts of the martyred St. Katherine of Alexandria with a candor equaling Patricia Cornwell while displaying a knowledge of history rivaling Barbara Tuchman, Sheri Holman adds her own beguiling style and wit into a breathtaking display of story-telling genius"},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"As a fan of great historical fiction (e.g. anything by Dorothy Dunnett, Eco, Anya Seton), I had high hopes for this book. Alas. The writing here, while noble for a first effort, is ultimately mediocre, the plot obvious and distasteful."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"This book is like a cheap paper back 15th Century travel guide. &quot;Pilgrimages on $15 dollars a day or less&quot;. It was uneventful. The characters while well crafted held no emotional connection for the reader to identify with. It seems as if there is some suspense getting into the story but this promise quickly dissipates and we are dragged endlessly towards a conclusion that by this point no one cares about. The historical accuracy and research is notable, but for a work of fiction that sells itself as a mystery/suspense it fails."},{"Title":"A Stolen Tongue","review":"This book was very interesting. This book is from a monk's point of view in the late 1400's. Sheri Holman does an excellent job of describing about Christianity, mystery, and how Friar Felix has to search the depths of his soul to find the religion in God within him."},{"Title":"Citizen Jane: The Turbulent Life of Jane Fonda","review":"This book departs from some of the mythology that persists about Ms Fonda's career and her political activities. This book treats her rise as an actress and as an icon of American film properly but also focuses an unblinking eye on her betrayal of her country during the Vietnam War. There are more than enough records of her activities during the war that clearly prove her multiple trips to Hanoi for the enemy's support and comfort, involvement with propaganda broadcasts from enemy radio stations, support for enemy activities (including her infamous serenade for an NVA antiaircraft gun crew). She went well beyond \\"political activism\\" and all the way to treason with her energetic support for the communists. History will record that she was extremely lucky not to have faced a trial and serious prison time for her treasonous activities.I am always curious how some of the other readers take this period of her life as \\"just political expression\\" or \\"youthful indiscretion\\". How would they have approached the subject of some other prominent personality that say, visited Berlin during WW II, made radio broadcasts with Axis Sally, taunted US Prisoners of War and then returned with Nazi propaganda points for the press?Ms. Fonda is a talented actress - but the rest of her history is just as important to know and this book lays much of it out for everyone."},{"Title":"Citizen Jane: The Turbulent Life of Jane Fonda","review":"I love a good bio, especially one that tries to tackle a complex and controversial subject like Jane Fonda (a brilliant actress). Yet, I guess what I also want is something that examines her approach to acting and the making of some of her films, that kind of thing facinates me."},{"Title":"Citizen Jane: The Turbulent Life of Jane Fonda","review":"This book does an excellent job in its political critique of Jane Fonda. Her hands are seriously bloody and there's no way around it. Read Snopes.com's account of her Vietnam activities because they are NOT a matter of debate. Just a matter of shame and Fonda's attempts to cover up.(...)"},{"Title":"Citizen Jane: The Turbulent Life of Jane Fonda","review":"Read Jane Fonda's autobiograhy to learn about the Vietnam expierience, what really happened. Jane's version totally fills in the blanks, and is proven. This is one Urban myth that has been used to steer people away from reacting to their government's lies, and shift total blame to Jane Fonda's mistake, which is completely ridiculous."},{"Title":"A Practical Guide to Enrollment and Retention Management in Higher Education","review":"This is without a doubt a practical guide to UNDERGRADUATE enrollment and retention management. If you work in enrollment and retention management, it's a good overview with a decent amount of new ideas but only as they relate to UNDERGRADUATES. However, the book doesn't talk about where or how to build your prospect pools. Search lists are not mentioned although they are alluded to via the search piece. It would have been good to have this information in order to make the guide more comprehensive. It would have also been helpful to have her take on what search lists are available, and what outcomes she has found them to yield. The guide was riddled with thought provoking questions that I found useful. However, if you are looking for information on GRADUATE and CONTINUING EDUCATION Enrollment and Retention management, this is not the book. These areas are only mentioned in passing and there is little useful information regarding them. I feel the title is misleading and should have been, \\"A Practical Guide to UNDERGRADUATE Enrollment and Retention Management in Higher Education.\\" I will say, the writing style is fluid and getting through this book is enjoyable, although the author's take on who can and should be an enrollment and retention manager is, in my opinion, bias and self descriptive. I might also add, that if you are new to undergraduate enrollment and retention management, it's a worthwhile investment. It's a solid place to start and there are few books out there with this type of overview. As for me, I'll be looking for the GRADUATE and CONTINUING EDUCATION sequel."},{"Title":"A Practical Guide to Enrollment and Retention Management in Higher Education","review":"Dennis simply makes lists of things that should occupy the enrollment manager's mind. She does not provide a scholarly work, and it shouldn't be expected with the title &#34;Practical Guide&#34;. But, far from practical, it does not definitely tell a decision-maker how to go about their job, only to emphasize what, in her view, stands as important. This is unacceptable in a text that costs over $80. Furthermore, only the obvious is hinted at, such as collaborating with other administrative staff. As far as retention, absolutely no talk is given about the rough and ready students who will terrify the prim and proper with tales of theft, needle sticks, and abusive husbands. It does not go into how to identify, before they self-identify by coming to you, those students who aren't vocal enough to plead for remediation and tutoring, before their last class meets. Retention management must intervene early, intensely and continuously to work, and Dennis provides no clue, if she has one, to the up-and-coming enrollment manager."},{"Title":"Biblical Mathematics - Keys to Scripture Numerics","review":"I am enjoying this book.

But even more incredibly, she cuts right through crap, and fearlessly breaks things down for us, articulating truths, hopes and dreams I have never seen discussed anywhere else. bell hooks uses her keen intellect and her brilliant common sense to examine not only the materialistic and physical constraints of racist and sexist oppression, she also identifies the psychological, spiritual and emotional; individual and communal injury and trauma that is experienced. Then, she gives us hope, for revolution, for decolonization, not just of our bodies, but our minds and hearts.Reading bell hooks, for me, is like listening to an incredibly wise and gentle girlfriend, who can both hold your hand, and beat the living hell out of anyone trying to do you wrong."},{"Title":"Outlaw Culture: Resisting Representations","review":"bell hooks does an excellent job in exploring pop culture and its relationship to African Americans.

Although I consider myself \\"in-the-now\\" with ideas on social issues, after reading this book I am left with a feeling of re-birth. hooks speaks of many issues I agree with (and some I am not so sure I swallow completely). These issues and hooks' analysis of them has made me learn to laterally think and critically observe our world. I am a woman who believes in the eradication of sexism on all levels but now I must make my belief the engine to keep the eradication machine existent. Any woman, or man, who needs inspiration to challenge the many institutions that support racism, sexism and captalism start with bell hooks. She forces you to use your brain and think.

Overall, I did like the book, but in places it does seem like she is too defensive about conflicts she has with other famous people. It is a fine line of critiquing others, so I can't say that she was wrong or anything...I just think she undermined herself in some places. Also, this was published in 1994, so it is a bit dated although I would argue, still relevant. I guess I'm only comparing this to some of her other books, so if I was to read this without comparison I would probably think it was pretty right on and daring, because bell hooks is usually right on and daring! bell hooks does what she does best in this book--great analysis in accessible terms. You don't have to be an academic to read this, but it isn't a dumbed-down polemic either. I enjoyed the book and learned a lot.

She cleverly exposes some of the subtle ways in which the powers that be maintain their power, sometimes deliberately, sometimes unwittingly, and she shows how the latter way is the most insidious one and does the most damage.At the same time, hooks is not always true to her word. She demands for herself complete freedom from censorship but in her own way attempts to censor or at least discredit those women who might disagree with her. Second, I appreciate her condemnation of black violence, but following that with a &quot;I condemn, but...&quot;makes one wonder about her true feelings.

Author Ian Bernard, who has distinguished himself as an actor, writer, musical composer and director, adds to his well deserved laurels with this book that leads the actor through the technical steps and creative nuances of acting for both big screen and small.Most actors begin their careers in amateur stage theatrics. No matter how competent their stage training may be, the transition to the screen can be disconcerting. Some aspects of screen acting make the transition easier: Voice projection, vital on the stage, doesn't come into play in screen acting. The \\"three quarters front\\" body position on stage is replaced by direct alignment, but exact positions become more vital in front of the camera, in order to remain in focus and within the lights. Much is made of \\"retakes\\" in film; if you don't get it right in take one there is take two, and twelve, and twenty if need be. But those extra takes are more often given to correct technical errors than to improve performance (especially in television where time restraints make compromise in the realm of performance common place).Perhaps the most difficult aspect of switching from stage to screen performance is the lack of continuity in shooting a movie. One often performs the love scene before the scene where boy meets girl and since there is no build up of emotion that carries from one scene to another as on stage, the screen actor usually has to stimulate his emotions by his own solitary devices.Mr. Bernard's book is a blueprint for building a bridge between stage and screen acting by providing theory and technique for making the transition.For both aspiring screen actors and those of the motion picture audience who are interested in enhancing their enjoyment through a deeper understanding of the acting process, Ian Bernards's FILM AND TELEVISION ACTING belongs on the b ookshelf right next to Constantin Stanislavski's AN ACTOR PREPARES."},{"Title":"Film and Television Acting, Second Edition: From stage to screen","review":"It's taken till the new millenium for someone to do a &quot;how to&quot; book about acting that plainly and simply zeroes in on just what it takes to be a great performer in front of a camera.

It is more about preparing the novice horse and horse-person to load &amp; unload their horse. It does not include a comprehensive discussion on the current types (and fads) of trailers, nor does it cover the &quot;horse's perspective&quot; of what makes a good trailer. The small sections on trailers and tow vechicles is okay, but not nearly as comprehensive and fact-filled as &quot;The Complete Guide to Buying, Maintaining and Servicing a Horse Trailer&quot; by the Scheves.I would recommend &quot;Trailering your Horse...&quot; as a second source for the potential trailer buyer."},{"Title":"Trailering Your Horse: A Visual Guide to Safe Training and Traveling","review":"This book helped me put together a combination of safe tow vehicle; well-equipped, comfortable horse trailer; and well-trained horse.

I believe Ms. Brooks is a former Congresswoman from New York and she seemed to thoroughly research this book about bankers' lofty ambitions through the centuries. It will open your eyes, especially when you realize, after reading her book, that the parties involved in government bailouts for mismanagement aren't that dumb, after all. I guess that's a relief, I don't know. Perhaps it's the \\"units\\" that are (you have to read her book to know what I mean).Since I've heard of Family Radio I don't get upset about what goes on, politically, anymore, but if you have some time to read it, \\"The Return of the Puritans\\" could be as influential with you as it was for me."},{"Title":"Meet Thomas Jefferson (Landmark Books)","review":"However much I thought this book would help us dig in to a bit of history thus book did its job.

As much as she protested at the start, she is now enjoying the book, and when I read a couple of chapters to her before bed, she said \\"That's all?\\" I think she likes it now. :-)This book tells the basic story of the various periods of Thomas Jefferson's life and times and is a wonderful introduction to him."},{"Title":"Meet Thomas Jefferson (Landmark Books)","review":"This is a good, basic book about Thomas Jefferson that goes a little bit deeper than an early reader. It's more of a beginning chapter type of book. It covers the basics of his life and is done in an easy-to-read way... but I just found it somewhat dry to read. Still, it's a good book for those being introduced to history. Nothing controversial in it, I felt like the author was fair.This book was recommended to me for my child's third grade history, so I decided to read it first before I handed it off to her. So comparing to many of the other history books I've been reading (a good 30 or 40 of them!), I definitely found this one a bit boring and dry. Which is why I gave it four stars instead of 5.

It's also a disturbing yet immensely compelling read. Michael Frayn does a wonderful job of projecting the tense yet excitingly secretive world that the boys (protagonist Stephen Wheatley and his more affluent friend Keith) inhabit. In some ways, &quot;Spies&quot; reminded me a lot of L. P. Hartley's &quot;The Go-Between,&quot; in that it also dealt with the similar theme of a young boy who becomes involved in the secretive lifes of the adults around him, and who had little real understanding of what was really going on, and what the stakes really were.It's true that the language with which Frayn has chosen to tell his story takes a little getting used to. But I did think that it lent itself to the ambiance of events that were unfolding before my eyes. I also liked the manner in which Frayn fleshes out the unlikely and quite improbable friendship that Keith and Stephen share: Keith is the leader and goes to the &quot;right local preparatory school&quot; while Stephen is portrayed as a follower and someone who is rather ineffectual and who also goes to the &quot;wrong&quot; prep school. As such it is true that it is a little difficult to take Stephen to heart, esp as he seems to be a rather feeble and hesitant child-hero. But we should remember that Stephen is a still a child (11 or 12) in this novel, with a child's natural fears and qualms, and that it is no wonder that he becomes totally overwhelmed by the situation.I enjoyed this novel very much. It may not be to everyone's liking, in that it does not make for easy straightforward reading. But &quot;Spies&quot; did make for a really affecting and compelling read. and if you're looking for something a little different from the same old thing, this should satisfy."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"Having read the two previous reviewers comments I can only say, well: each to his own. This is one of the best WWII books I have read in a long time, precisely because it isn't really a war book at all. Rather it is in the tradition of J.G. Ballard's 'Empire of the Sun' where there were hardly any combatants, the book instead offering a child's eye view.The writing here is masterly and the book really needs to be read twice to enjoy it to the full - as with E.M. Forster there is great use made of repetition and of symbolism. The character of Stephen occassionally irritates- but that is because we are seeing his actions and thoughts through adult eyes. To the child it all makes perfect sense.However for me the best part of the novel is its sense of period - this is exactly how my Mum describes her childhood ( though she was born just subsequent to the war ). This is a very English novel and maybe that's why it hasn't gone down well with some of the reviewers - but please : persevere. This is a truly great work. ( Really bad cover though! The UK edition is much more attractive.)"},{"Title":"Spies","review":"A fragrance, a taste, a numinous sense of deja vu--all familiar literary devices that, in a sensual rush, transport a narrator and reader to a lost moment vividly, but narrowly, recalled. In the course of the tale, the recollection expands, through paths at first dimly remembered but, over time, recovered with increasing clarity. Michael Frayn deploys these Proustian materials brilliantly, detailing with quick strokes a lost world of childhood in wartime London, of proto-suburban enclaves that are more like thatch villages than city neighborhoods, where even hidden lives seem transparent, everyone seems to be watching everyone else, and nothing escapes the attention of the village children, those custodians of every local scandal, romance, adventure, and suspicion.The story begins meekly, as a trip down memory lane, and slowly, like a Ravelian Bolero, gains in intensity and pace. One of Spies' most impressive aspects is, in the interplay between narrator and narration, the way in which Frayn withholds from the reader information that the young Stephen could not yet have figured out or understood. This allows the story, despite the older Stephen's omniscient point of view, to unfold naturally and almost perfectly from a child's-eye view, but blended with adult-perspective hindsight to provide texture and depth and, in some instances, additional layers of ambiguity.Spies will appeal strongly to readers of a certain age, who as children in a pre-television era relied on their own resourcefulness and imagination to entertain themselves, who literally assembled their own universes from found materials. Spies is, moreover, one of the very best depictions of a child's groping to make sense of the adult world from within the conspiratorial know-it-all world of childhood.I must confess, however, that I was tempted to dock Frayn a star for the unsatisfying--for me--way in which he handled aspects of the concluding 20-30 pp (it's no spoiler to mention this--plenty of reviews already have). But the sated sense of satisfaction in which I basked as I closed the book precluded anything other than full credit. With economical prose, vivid characterization, and superbly realized WWII fringe-London mise-en-scene, Michael Frayn has added another small gem to his oeuvre, one you will tear through in a sitting, pausing only, I'll warrant, to reflect on your own lost world of childhood."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"An old man struggles to recall a summer in his youth he spent living in a small English suburb during WWII. It's a beautifully written story rich in contrasts -- class differences, childhood friendship vs. rivalry, loyalty to family vs. country, reality vs. fantasy, the routine of daily life vs. life-threatening adventures -- and brilliantly evocative of the time and place. But what I found most compelling about this book was its deft examination of how memories work, especially with events of life-changing importance. What we perceive as a child may or may not represent reality, but when filtered through years of experience, it's amazing how that perception can be questioned and transformed. If the reality ultimately shines through, as it does for this narrator, it can bring surprising insights."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"I have to admit, I almost gave up on this book ninety pages in. For whatever reason, it just wasn't holding my interest. The story was only vaguely interesting and it went along at a rather mundane pace. But then, just when I thought I'd given up, something happened. The story started coming together, the characters and setting grew on me, and I discovered much to my pleasant surprise that I couldn't put it down. I raced to finish it and had to force myself not to glance down to the bottom of the next page to find out what was coming next.This is a story of secrets and lies set in a tiny English village in the heart of World War Two. An innocent child's game of &quot;spies&quot; turns into an ugly and inevitably tragic tale of wartime recriminations and unrequited love with an ending to rival the surprising and equally devastating denouement of Ian McEwan's &quot;Atonement.&quot;Frayn's brilliance is subtle and exists mostly within the seemingly innocent yet insightful observations of his child narrator, Stephen Wheatley, through whose eyes the reader experiences the story.I'm glad I persevered!"},{"Title":"Spies","review":"The ignorance of youth can be both a blissful and terrifying thing, for while ignorance of the \\"adult\\" world, with its nasty realities allows for a period of innocence, this same ignorance can lead to times of horrible terror when children are forced to play roles in an adult world beyond their comprehension. This book takes the form of an old man visiting the street he grew up on in suburban London during WWII, where he unwittingly stumbled into the dealings of adults. In flashback narrative, he tells the story of what happened when his best (and only) friend Keith uttered the words, \\"My mother is a German spy.\\"Against the backdrop of wartime shortages, blackouts, and night time German bombing, young awkward Stephen follows his friend Keith in all matters. Keith is more affluent than the rest of the neighborhood kids, but is an insufferable snob, which is why Stephen is his only friend. When Keith makes his pronouncement, the two boys engage is play spycraft, only to discover that indeed, Keith's mother is up to something fishy. As the investigation continues, Stephen starts to grow bolder, leading to Keith's snubbing of him. Stephen is ultimately propelled into a situation well out of his depth, and comes to the frightening realization that adults are not all-powerful.By recounting the story from the younger Stephen's perspective, Frayn allows the suspense to build, revealing events and information as his child-self came to understand it. The ultimate revelation is a minor letdown, as is the epilogue about Stephen's own family (which won't come as much of a surprise to readers who pay attention at the beginning and notice a few rather obvious clues dropped along the way). Still, that's a minor quibble with an altogether gripping read. Frayn brings the secret ways of young boys to life in a vivid and sympathetic portrait, replete with the cruelty of youth. Very likely to become a movie."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"Once again Michael Frayn delivers a novel which succeeds on so many levels: as a comical tale of two imaginative youngsters; as a fond memoir of wartime England; as a commentary on growing up and growing older; as a reflection on phenomenology (particularly the way our observations are coloured by our assumptions); and, more simply, as just a cracking good yarn which will have you rapidly turning the pages until way after midnight. As in his most recent \\"Headlong\\", Frayn draws us into what could be just a delightful little comedy, and then has us closing the book to discover we have been given, instead, an opus on human frailty. An opus so compelling because it is delivered in Frayn's direct and amusing voice - rather than the ponderous, self-important prose favoured by so many novelists. Frayn's genius is to edify while entertaining. Unlike so many of his stodgy contemporaries, Frayn can afford to reject obscurantism for one wonderfully refreshing reason: he knows precisely what he is doing. He knows just how much, or how little, he actually needs to say."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"What is it about these British authors that they can write about the past and their own childhoods in such a mature and adult way? Recently, we saw it in Booker nominee Ian McEwan's 'Atonement', then Penelope Lively with 'A House Unlocked&quot;, and now Frayn's 'Spies'. This is a story about how the protagonist saw a particular event during his pre-teen childhood. Puzzling, mysterious, and inexplicable. Then it all comes together in the last chapter when as a middle-aged man he goes back home and digs up his memories. That the pen that produced 'Headlong', and 'Copenhagen' can also produce such a delicious and haunting tale is even more wonderful."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"I had to write this review after noting the Publisher's Weekly and general editors' reviews. An old man recalls his childhood? Please, tell me something I don't know.The book is so much more interesting than you might imagine by hearing the 'straight' plot. Two neighbor boys become engrossed in both creating and being caught in a web of their own making. This involves observing the comings and goings of their war-time neighbors. The balance between what they see as reality in their U.K world-war homes and the actual reality, which is not the same, but not so very different from what we might suspect, is precious. I don't use the word lightly. Without giving too much away, we see people caught in a trap of others' making, dealing with the damnable conventions of their times. I found the creation of a child's view of a difficulty-laden adult world, with its very concrete boundaries and fantasies, so well perceived and expressed - it was almost as if Frayn breathed the life of a child as he wrote it. At the same time, the true reality begs a grim and humble view of how we treat those we consider outsiders in our societies. The work's lessons are for both the past and the future. Lewis Carrol made fun of such anxieties, amplifying them in his works with Alice, but the melding of a child's perceptions with a world war reality is preciously and carefully preserved by Frayn with great skill. Not as simple as it may appear, and very enjoyable. The audio book has won related awards, in addition."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"Spies is an assigned novel I have to study for English Literature at AS level.To be honest I agree with all reviews, good and bad.It is a beautiful book, but perhaps too poetic.I was extremely bored for the first few chapters, but as mentioned, once you get into it, it is very intriguing and cleverly written, and, I have to admit that Frayn is wonderful at capturing feelings of people.Although I agree with people dismissing it as boring and too poetic, which is what I thought to start off with, if you persevere with it you get to the \\"good bits\\".There's no written rule as to how long it's got to take to get into it, with Spies it just means you're more interested as the plot takes flight.A good book, but if your concentration span isn't great, it may take you a while.I think it's worth the buy but if you're not into stories that unravel in stages, it's probably not for you.In my opinion, good book :) well done Frayn!"},{"Title":"Spies","review":"This is by far the most horrible book that I have ever come across. It's just horrible. Simple as that. Read the first paragraph and you'll see what I mean. Frayn might be good at writing plays, but not novels (Spies, anyway). Its too descriptive and poetic, and doesn't make the slightest bit of sense. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"This is one of the worst World War II stories that I have every read. It is incoherent and makes little sense. It was totally a waste of money."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"The atmosphere of the early 1940's in a small town outside London becomes the setting for this novel as Stephen Wheatley, now in his mid-60's and living abroad, is drawn back to his childhood home by the \\"sweet and luring reek\\" of privet, a scent which evokes memories of his twelfth year, when he naively \\"spied\\" on his neighborhood from inside privet bushes with his friend Keith Hayward. Announcing one day that his mother is a German spy, Keith \\"crosses the frontier into another country altogether,\\" and the boys begin dangerous meddling in real lives, manipulating events which they do not fully understand.Huge, personal costs to others result from their meddling and still puzzle Stephen fifty years later. As he tries to retrieve memories, make necessary connections between events, and put his personal demons to rest, he is a sympathetic figure, and the reader both understands his curiosity as a child-spy and observes with ironic detachment and adult judgment the unfolding disasters he provokes.Frayn is in full control of his material here, recreating the rather matter-of-fact atmosphere of a suburban London neighborhood during the war--the errant bombing of a neighborhood house and killing of an old woman, the blackouts and alarms, the separated families, the rigid social distinctions, and the indifference toward those of lower class. His depiction of the child's motivation is flawless, the adult Stephen's confusion is plausible, and the dramatic ironies for the reader continue to the end.Many readers have complained about the ending, and I confess that I, too, was startled, at first, by the last twenty pages. As I started thinking about why Frayn would choose this ending, however, I began to think that perhaps, with all the secrets and spying that take place in the novel, he wanted one final irony--to show that the reader, too, is a kind of spy, a voyeur observing what takes place in the novel and jumping to false conclusions based on partial knowledge, no better than the characters. If that's the case, he certainly gets the last laugh. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Spies","review":"I really enjoyed reading Headlong and Copenhagen, but Frayn missed with this one. Frayn is excellent at satirical farce or philosophy. but neither of those forms require the generation of much emotion. Farce is really an intellectual genre that depends on speed and humor for effect. Copenhagen worked because it was an intellectual mystery. This novel needs the reader to identify and engage with the main character to care about the outcome. Instead, Frayn is too interested in suggesting the fleeting quality of memory to help us understand Stephen. Also, there is a problem writing a mystery from an adult's point of view when he knows the outcome. Withholding information under those circumstances make it seem that the author is playing unfair games with the reader and also dilutes the suspense. I think the reader never really feels what the consequences of the boys' actions are likely to be--we don't sense real danger and therefore lose interest. Read A Little Friend by Donna Tartt to see how she handles a child's coming of age where the consequences of the girl's actions are life changing and terribly frightening."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"A man called Stephen travels down memory lane, remembering his childhood in London during the war. He and his friend, Keith, lived out many adventures, their imaginations coming alive. Upon his friend's words that his friend's mother was a German spy, the two boys set out to spy on her. What Stephen discovers will change the rest of his life. The book has a slow start. Many times I doubted that I would like the book because it seemed too slow and dull, however, by the end, I was glad I stuck with it. It's a touching story about the innocence of a child who is put into a situation no child belonged in. His fear and confusion was real throughout the book, and perhaps the most honest account of someone in his shoes. He was an ordinary boy in extraordinary circumstances. The main character wasn't a child &quot;hero&quot; like so often in books these days starring children. This book isn't about a boy saving the day. It is more a tragic story. The book did not grab me the way other books sometimes do. It was a bit vague and confusing at times. However, overall, it was a good read and would be worthy of discussion in any book group."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"Spies is a lovely, beautifully written novel about childhood, mysteries and memories.

Do read it if you like good prose, an interesting story (yes, there is a story, and even a bit of a surprise ending)wonderful images, and an evocative look back."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"I've read other works by this author that have grabbed my attention from the outset. For the first few chapters I was bored, wondering if this was ever going to 'take-off'.However, once it got moving, then I was enthralled, although I did have to re-read the last few pages after I'd finished it to see what clue I'd missed first time around."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"Michael Frayn brilliantly weaves the misunderstandings of a child with the adult world during World War Two London into an astounding testament to the nave struggles of children to enter into the terrifying world of reality. The narrator, Stephen returns home to London and walks through his old neighborhood on a pilgrimage to discover the truth that was right before his eyes as a child. Stephen looks at his house fifty years later and sees himself as a boy leave, play, watch, and spy on his friend Keith's mother after Keith declares \`she is a spy'. The painful ignorance Stephen confronts during his realizations and epiphanies concerning Keith's mother and life finally resolve consciously for the older pilgrim returning home. He spells out all the horrible accidents committed and ones merely thought while intertwining the intimate fears of maturity and adolescence. Overall, a powerful read and an provocative look at one side of any war that is never told."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"We all pass through a stage in life - maybe 8 or 9 years old - in which we observe the world of adults but comprehend what we observe as children. This is the point of view that the middle-aged narrator Stephen Wheatley tries to recapture, as he tells the story of his difficult friendship with the boy Keith, as well as his relationship with Keith's lovely but compromised mother. Eventually, this battered woman asks Stephen to undertake a mission he understands only as a child, and it leads to his first experience of genuine evil in the world. Altogether, this is an absorbing story-very clean and straightforward, despite Stephen's childish miscomprehension. There are even gentle moments of Frayn wit, although not the hilarity of \\"Headlong\\" or \\"Noises Off\\". My prediction: Soon to be a good small movie at a theater near you."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"The beautiful, soft focus beginning of this book was perfectly wrought, and made me think this would be something special. Evidently, however, those were the last arrows the author had in his quiver. The rest of the book meanders at a slow pace, with little development and lots of innuendo. The suprises aren't so surprising. It becomes tedious rather than heartfelt. I rather thought this would be better done as novella or short short --it has a feel of being stretched. A for effort, C for execution."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"What a great read this is!The author has a true understanding of the transition from boyhood to adult emotions with all the hopes, fears and tribulations that go with it. Add to this a particular empathy with wartime suburban England and you have a classic of suspense, emotion in a book where Mr. Frayn actually makes you CARE about what happens to the lead character.I loved it so much that I did something I never do and sent a copy to my Mum in England who was a girl in rural England during WW2. (She spoils me by leaving me Capt. Correli's Mandolin)."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"Most readers spent much of their childhood reading mystery stories written for children, in which children or teenagers caught spies or bank robbers by carefully noting their comings and goings and making brillant deductions. Michael Frayn has taken this formula and turned it on its head in Spies. Set during World War II, Spies is the story of what happens the narrator and his best (and only) friend begin observing the friend's mother based on the friend's idiotic notion that she is a German spy. Just like their counterparts in the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew (there must be British equivalents), they start going through her things, and observing her comings and goings. Unfortunately, while she is of course not a spy, she is up to something, and the boys' investigation uncovers secrets that the adults are trying to keep quiet.The story is told in flashback, with the narrator as an old man looking back at his youth. However, he tries to report things as he remembers them. This allows the narrator to realize things the narrator doesn't, such as the flaws in some of the characters. It will also many readers to anticipate events before they occur. Nevertheless, there are a number of twists to the plot that will surprise the most. Some will find the ending, in which we learn of things hinted at in the main story, but so peripheral to the plot as not to enage our attention, too clever and unnecessary. As I like suprises, I enjoyed the final summing up. Frayn, who has written on a wide range of subjects, has succeeded here."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"In a marked departure from his previous humorous novel, Headlong, Frayn delivers a wonderful look at the complicated world of a child. During his own childhood (the early years of World War II), Frayn's best friend makes the statement to him, &quot;My mother is a German spy.&quot; In writing this novel, Frayn takes this true event and plays the &quot;what if&quot; game. The two friends know that this is just a game, just a means of passing a summer afternoon, but what if they spy on her and start to see actions that might indicate that she truly is a spy? It's a wonderful look at how perplexing the adult world can be to a child, and how wrong our impressions -- either as a child or as an adult -- can be when we don't explore the full picture. Frayn throws a clever curveball at the very end of the book, one which could have been predicted by the careful reader. It's unfortunate that this book has come out at the same time that Ian McEwan's book, Atonement, was issued, since they are somewhat similar in theme (the wide ramifications of a child's actions during World War II), and it may ultimately get lost in the literary shuffle. That's a shame, for reading it on its own is a terrific way to spend a weekend."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"Looking back on events of his childhood from the wisdom of old age, Stephen Wheatley recounts important events from his childhood. Frayn tells a story of 2 boys inventing a world around them, with the second world war unfolding around them, unsurprisingly they are obsessed with the idea of spies in their midst. Their increasing obsession with their game, leads them to some unexpected discoveries.This book is full of acute observations of youth. Outlandish games, the fickleness of children towards each other, the towering and unquestionable domination of adults over their lives.I enjoy stories where the innocence and naievity of youth is retold through knowing adult eyes and this book was no exception. Its part mystery, part rites of passage. Well written and incredibly evocative of childhood and days gone by."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"Michael Frayn's &quot;Spies&quot;, the 2002 Whitbread Prize winner, is a quintessentially English novel that recalls L P Hartley's classic &quot;The Go Between&quot;. Both novels begin with an old man indulging in the queasily pleasurable habit of visiting the past when as a young boy he was innocent of the tragedy his childish detective games would set in motion for the adults and end with a stark recognition that resonates with an indescribable pain we feel for the ruined lives they have caused. The rush of familiar smells and the recollection of other childish secrets like a misspelled password trigger off a flood of memories for the adult Stephen Wheatley. These in turn become the catalyst for unravelling the secrets that underlie the mystery that consumed the boy Stephen and his playmate Keith one fateful summer.Frayn flits skilfully between past to present but when we enter the world of the boy Stephen, we become child observers too. We don't have a head start in our understanding of what is happening among the adults because our senses are his. Even Keith's mother - like all mothers - doesn't have a name. The suspicious routines that preoccupy Keith's mother - her constant shuttling between home and her sister's or the post office, and her mysterious disappearance from sight every time she turns the corner - is shrouded in a mystery that deepens with vague hints of cruelty and abuse that only the adult Stephen is able to discern. Indeed, the relationship between Stephen and Keith is hardly a friendship, more an emblem of their class differences, which allow the middle class Keith to play leader to the socially inferior Stephen. In the same way, Keith's parents exude a distance and coolness that is slightly unnerving.Frayn's characterisation is flawless. His characters are all vividly drawn personalities that leap out of the pages at you. Stephen's torment and debilitating lack of confidence as a socially underprivileged child is especially resonant and a masterpiece of characterisation. Then there's Keith's mother. Her icy elegance and well groomed exterior conceals the desperate and terrible turmoil beneath it. Keith's father, constantly at work in his home garage, is a lurking and quietly menacing presence. Then there's Keith. His haughty silence and his cruel smirk, duplicating his father's, is a precursor for when he draws blood. Finally, there's Barbara. Her precocious spitefulness makes her every pre-teen boy's nightmare big sister.&quot;Spies&quot; is a delicious psychologically thriller that fans of the English novel will delight in. It is beautifully written and a real page turner. You will find your pulse racing as the story approaches its climax. But Frayn eschews an explicit revelation, so you might have to read the last chapter carefully (if not twice) to get it. Sadly though, he decides to wrap with a contrived shock revelation about Stephen's own family history that is unnecessary and brings the story to an end on a false note. &quot;Spies&quot; is otherwise an excellent and ingeniously crafted little novel that deserves to be read and enjoyed widely. I'm glad it won the Whitbread."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"I was compelled to read this story by a recommendation from an Amazon reader, but couldn't put it down from the first page. I have often associated certain earthy smells with my childhood and neighborhood. That Stephen Wheatley felt this strong urge as an old man to retrieve memories by returning to the Close, especially given the events that took place there, was a terrific and realistic conscept in which to form the basis for a story by Frayn, and he pulls it off with style. I can think of no other author who can describe the relationships of a timid and unpopular big-eared 12 year old boy. Stephen was the follower of Keith, who was the idea man, which led them into a scheme that went from childish play to true adult horror. Keith knew that his mother had a secret and recruited Stephen to help him discover what it was. But I believe that Keith was subtley calling for help, and fearing his father, he drafted his only friend. To be sure, the vision of a wounded German pilot hiding and receiving aid produced fear and anxiety in Stephen, his loyalty to Keith and his later sense of empathy for Keith's mother, caused him to have a keep heavy secret that traumatised his very soul. What are we to make of this? There is a war, there are children, and they are affected in ways adults cannot know. Sixty years later we know that childhood trauma can result in a host of lifelong conflicts within a human's mind.That the affairs were part war related and very related to matters of the heart, yet tragic to several families, does not diminish the suspense because nothing is really revealed until the end. I applaud Michael Frayn for his excellent work and look forward to reading his other works."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"Remember the stereotypical figure of a spy in his overcoat silhouetted against the night sky? The figure was pretentious, intriguing, and alluring in some romantic fashion. Michael Frayn's \\"Spies\\" is much the same.Frayn's narrator is Stephen Wheatley, a boy living in England during WWII. He and his friend Keith begin keeping tabs on Keith's mother, believing she is a German spy. What starts out as an innocent game leads to discoveries about life, love, and betrayal. The tragedies of war are funneled through this story into the damaging affects of family secrets. Stephen and Keith, our young spies, will never be the same. With finesse, Frayn leads us through the foggy tunnels of a British neighborhood and the foggier tunnels of his narrator's mind. Stephen is a complex and well-drawn creation. Symbolism plays a pleasing and unifying part.\\"Spies\\" does so many things efficiently that it's easy to overlook its faults. Perhaps my greatest hindrance in plodding through the first 150 pages was the conspicious brevity of dialogue. Too bad. When the characters spoke, I found myself actually involved in their story. We spend so much time in Stephen's head that I found it hard to know or care deeply for any of the periphery characters. Stephen is so self-absorbed with his own insecurities and logic that he gives us little time to know others around him. Sure, that may be his personality, but I found it distracting. Who, reading this book, wouldn't like to know more about Keith or Barbara or Keith's mother or...? Well, I don't want to give anything away.Having scanned reviews before reading the book, I expected to dislike the ending much more than I did. Actually, I felt the slow unveiling of the truth was well-paced and surprising without being forced. The final chapter was, indeed, a flightly sketch of Stephen's entire life. Although I wanted to know more, by that time I was so tired of being in his head that I was simply ready to turn the final page.Overall, I enjoyed the elements of story, plot, and setting. If you're ready for a jump back into childhood days of imagination, then take the time to know young Stephen Wheatley. You'll be spending a lot of time with him."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"Frayn took a simplistic wartime storyline and made it unfold for the reader like a film. The characterization comes alive with the needling of going through the visage between childhood and adulthood, and innocence and wisdom. There's a yearning at the core of the story with an ending as if it were a short story, with a meaningful return to present reflections. It is a pretty good read!"},{"Title":"Spies","review":"First of all: Frayn is a good writer. Best known as a playwright, this is not a play trying to be a novel-- there is dialogue, yes, but also lots of description and atmosphere. I applaud him for knowing which medium this story demanded, and for his versatility and skills.The six immortal words that change Stephen's life are his best friend Keith's &quot;My mother is a German spy.&quot;Of course, any adult reader doubts that right away, but Keith is so odd and creepy that as he and Stephen (the narrator) set to trailing his mother there is an awful sense of tension and looming tragedy.It's impossible not to think of L.P. Hartley's The Go-Between, if you've read it-- in that book likewise a man remembers being a child engaging in a mystery that was not what it seems. That book really does amount to heartbreak and inevitable tragedy. Partly that's because the adult reader understands what is going on better than the narrator.In Frayn's novel, the older narrator has barely more insight than he did as a child-- and there's an irritating sense that things are being deliberately held back from the reader. The revelations, when we finally get to them, are not satisfying enough for me.As a portrait of tension, suspicion and wartime paranoia, along with the awkwardness of adolescent friendships and loyalties, Frayn succeeds. But as a mystery, it's frustrating...the tension is both too much and not enough. The reader knows that whatever theory the boys come up with is wrong, and it takes too long to see that there is a mystery at all... so it never grabbed me with its urgency.If you read it for the mood and not for the story, it is well written and worthwhile... for me it never really gelled."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"Michael Frayn's \\"Spies\\" recounts a childhood incident of a boy named Stephen Weatley who narrates the story through the perspective of a now grown man. Stephen pieces the story together using nostalgic smells and sounds as a memory trigger. When Stephen's friend Keith announces that his mother is a German Spy, the boys embark on a childish game of espionage as they try to solve the enigma of Keith's mother's actions. The boys' innocence and childish mentality are exploited as they delve into issues of friendship and morality. Frayn demonstrates his skillful ability to manipulate the plot to keep the reader in anticipation, and to keep the boys in the dark long enough to keep your attention up for clues. When Stephen finally discovers the answer to the puzzle the \\"world had changed forever.\\" Frayn develops Stephen's persona, mixed up in the ongoing wartime in Britain, through a complex process of metacognition that rings of Joycian style."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"See also my review of Frayn'sHeadlong: A Novel.This is a delicious little novel about the abiguities of memory and sentiment. The story centers on the recalled events of the main character's childhood during World War II in England. The character, Stephen Wheatley, is about 10 or 11 years old and definitely a square peg. Stephen's apparently only friend confides that his mother must be a German spy and the two boys begin an adventure of \\"spying\\" on her that leads them where they never dreamed. Frayn's pacing is deliberate and precise, and each new revelation in the adventure raises more questions than answers. The novel, however, is mostly about Stephen's growing up, learning about himself, what he is capable of, and what it means to live in the world of adults. It traces a path that many children go through at that age, and I found I had a lot of sympathy for Stephen. An excellent story."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"As a boy in wartime London, Stephen Wheatley is a target for bullies. His only friend is Keith, a neighbor boy with a seemingly perfect life. Keith is the leader whose imagination leads them on a series of games. When Keith says that his mother is a German spy, the borders between imagination and reality become blurred. The boys begin to spy on her and find that she does indeed have mysterious comings and goings. Years later, the harshly seductive scent of blooming privet takes Wheatley back to that time, to evaluate his boyhood actions and their consequences. Spies is a quiet book that builds to a suspenseful climax. As an old man, Wheatley reflects on that time and notes, \\"What we did to each other in those few years of madness! What we did to ourselves!\\" I finished the book before looking at the reviews, and must admit, I found the final pages to be a less than satisfying end to a thoughtful novel. But the mood of the story and the scent of privet are what remain for me now that the reading is done."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"I was staying at my brother's house once and wanted something to read so I could fall asleep. This is where I discovered Frayn's Headlong, and no, it didn't work. I couldn't go to sleep. I was enthralled; I loved it. So it was with great anticipation that I bought Spies.The quality of writing is about as good as Headlong, yet I expected more from Spies. There was an awful lot of repetition, and the denoeument was too pat. I had to go back and re-read most of the critical scenes to really have them sink in, and said to myself, \\"Oh. Is that all.\\"If you want to see the world through the eyes of a young boy, and feel his angst, Frayn achieves this with aplomb. Almost a male version of Alice in Wonderland. This, to me, is what the book is about and I think I would have chosen a different title.I don't mean to be harsh; it's an excellent work and I could not set it down. I merely had very high expectations and was slightly disappointed."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"The book takes place during WWII and follows the lives of two eleven year year old boys as they play a game of spy. The game tests their friendship and gets one of them involved in a very grown up situation with tragic consequences. If written as a short story this book would have received four starts.

And what a lovely job he has done, too. The story is, an old man returns to his boyhood digs to relive a seminal experience from The Duration as Frayn beautifully refers to the last great war.Although it's evocative of my beloved William books, Spies is not humourous, and entirely adult, but betrays the author's (and my) enduring fascination with British boyhood.I'm Canadian but I got to have a British boyhood experience so maybe this novel means more to me than it would to someone else. Somehow I doubt it, though."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"This is a masterful tale of time, memory, love and deception seen from the memory of a child now grown.

I thought it an odd selection of 17 year old boys, but what do i know. A nice twist at the end but a little tedious at times"},{"Title":"Spies","review":"Harking back to the days when children spent most of their after-school hours outdoors, making \\"forts\\" and hideyholes on vacant land still thick with scrub, Frayn recreates the atmosphere of the early 1940's in a small town outside London. Stephen Wheatley, now in his mid-60's and living abroad, is drawn back to his childhood home by the \\"sweet and luring reek\\" of privet, a scent which evokes memories of his twelfth year, when he naively \\"spied\\" on his neighborhood from inside privet bushes with his friend Keith Hayward. Announcing one day that his mother is a German spy, Keith \\"crosses the frontier into another country altogether,\\" and the boys begin dangerous meddling in real lives, manipulating events which they do not fully understand. Huge, personal costs to others result from their meddling and still puzzle Stephen fifty years later. As he tries to retrieve memories, make necessary connections between events, and put his personal demons to rest, he is a sympathetic figure, and the reader both understands his curiosity as a child-spy and observes with ironic detachment and adult judgment the unfolding disasters he provokes.Frayn is in full control of his material here, recreating the rather matter-of-fact atmosphere of a suburban London neighborhood during the war--the errant bombing of a neighborhood house and killing of an old woman, the blackouts and alarms, the separated families, the rigid social distinctions, and the indifference toward those of lower class. His depiction of the child's motivation is flawless, the adult Stephen's confusion is plausible, and the dramatic ironies for the reader continue to the end.Much has been said about the ending. I confess that I, too, was startled, at first, by the last twenty pages, and initially, I agreed with those who felt it was too pat. As I started thinking about why Frayn would choose this ending, however, I began to think that perhaps, with all the secrets and spying that take place in the novel, he wanted one final irony--to show that the reader, too, is a kind of spy, a voyeur observing what takes place in the novel and jumping to false conclusions based on partial knowledge, no better than the characters. If that's the case, he certainly gets the last laugh. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Spies","review":"A sudden scent from the foliage in a distant city makes the narrator, now approaching old age, return to the southern suburb of London where he had spent his boyhood during the Second World War. It is more built up now, but the dozen houses in The Close still remain, next to the railway embankment which marked the limit of urban development at the time. Beyond it, through a narrow and dank pedestrian tunnel, lay wartime allotments, squalid cottages, and waste land.There were children in most of the houses, but Stephen Wheatley, the narrator's younger self, was a loner, somehow different from the others, bullied and teased at school. All the more surprising, then, that he should have been friends with Keith Hayward, the perfect son of perfect parents who sent him to a perfect private day school. Happy to be Keith's sidekick, Stephen followed him in whatever enterprise he suggested, such as building a transcontinental railway or conquering strange lands. So when Keith remarks that his mother is a German spy, Stephen eagerly joins in the routine of watching her from a hideout in a privet hedge, and keeping a secret record of her movements.Although a few years younger than Frayn (and presumably Stephen), this took me back to my own boyhood in wartime Britain and the melodramatic games we got up to in the long summer evenings, many of which could well have had serious consequences. As does the game of Stephen and Keith's, for while they are wrong about most of their first assumptions, they stumble upon other secrets that verge on tragedy. Stephen's summer as a spy-hunter turns out also to be a summer of self-discovery; besides building his reserves of empathy and courage, it also reveals his weakness and capacity for betrayal. His nostalgic June turns slowly into shame for a sorry September.This is not Frayn the farceur of NOISES OFF or SKIOS, nor the brilliant intellectual of COPENHAGEN or HEADLONG, but a much simpler writer, walking a tightrope of unassisted narrative. His success -- and mostly he is very successful -- depends entirely upon timing: the reader must discern the truth behind the boys' misconceptions a little before they realize it themselves, but only a little, otherwise there is no story. Some of the truths are easy, like the meaning of the tiny x marked in Keith's mother's dairy roughly four weeks apart. Others are simply obscure; there is a long section in the middle where little seems to happen and is hard to follow without a clearer mental map of The Close than I, at least, was able to pick up. But when things get moving again, Frayn handles the balancing act perfectly, changing the reader's view of the major characters in ways that are both deeper and more disturbing. Perhaps he exaggerated Stephen's refusal to admit the truth at the end, and I do think he left too much to be revealed in the postlude -- but he held me in my seat all the same, rapidly turning the pages to find out what happens and incidentally to revisit my own childhood joys and regrets."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"I liked Fryan's play Copenhagen, I thought it intellectually stimulating, courageously able to deal with scientific topics and I loved the unravelling of the layers of meaning.So I was eager to read this novel. Like many recent novels (Curious incident of the Dog in the Night, Vernon God Little) it is written from the viewpoint of a small boy.The setting is Second World War Britain, and while the story is involving I just did not get moved by it. I was continuously reminded of the stories of Richmal Compton - just William, about the adventures of an eleven year old boys, his friends and their interaction with the adult world. In Spies there is even an annoying local girl - Compton's book had Violet \`Violent' Elizabeth, Frayn has Barbara Berrill.Between the Just William flashbacks and the feeling that the style was following a trend, I found it hard to warm to the story. That being said, the story flows well, the book is quite a quick read, the story is told with style - shifting between first and third person descriptions as the character moves in and out of reminiscences, there are excellent evocations of the memories, smells and atmosphere however the expectations which I had on starting the book were not realized"},{"Title":"Spies","review":"This is one of the worst novels I have read in a long time. The writing, which attempts to be post-modern, is frequently pretentious and often simply incompetent. The main character becomes more and more unrealistic and unsympathetic as the story progresses - especially since he never seems to remember the most important events that occurred during the period of time covered by the narrative. The ending - where the author desperately tries to tie all the loose ends together in the last ten pages - is laughable.Normally I would have tossed this book aside after the first thirty pages, which are dreadfully slow. But I kept reading to see how bad it could get. It exceeded all my expectations.I have the feeling that Mr. Frayn wrote a single draft of this book and then turned it in to his publisher as good enough. It isn't."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"This is by far the most horrible book that I have ever come across. It's just horrible. Simple as that. Read the first paragraph and you'll see what I mean. Frayn might be good at writing plays, but not novels (Spies, anyway). Its too descriptive and poetic, and doesn't make the slightest bit of sense. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"Michael Frayn beautifully captures childhood nostalgia, compelling friendship and long-term regret in his novel, \`Spies'. A story empowered by an old man reminiscing about a certain childhood adventure and the problems he faced by investigating the chosen target (his best friend's mother) and by doing so he accidently stumbles on a secret which would change his life forever. We are introduced to the main character Stephen Wheatley as an older man, describing his current life and the family he has created. From Frayn's specific style of writing, a sense of distance emerges in relation to Stephen's past and current life, as he speaks so longingly of previous memories as a young boy during World War Two, almost wishing to relive them. With this, nostalgia and remembrance is triggered as all your forgotten memories as a child come back and makes you want to return to those joyful and exciting days.In the beginning Stephen returns to his childhood home, in an attempt to seek comfort from exploring the places he once explored as a child. From this he starts to describe a certain adventure which outshone the rest of them; an adventure construed by himself and his best friend Keith, centred on the suspicion that Keith's mother was a German spy and was betraying the British nation thus it was their duty to uncover the truth. To do so they would need to behave like detectives by following her around and noting her every move. Frayn cleverly encapsulates childish innocence and naivety as Stephen believes his best friend incredibly easily and follows his every instruction.Using first, second and third person perspective, Frayn signifies the start of the adventure, the manipulating power of his best friend and the underlying regret Stephen beholds, wishing he could of changed the way the pursuit panned out. Unfortunately, the reader is often left confused due to Frayn's quick change of perspective which continuously makes you wonder who is actually narrating. Whether it's Stephen as a child or Stephen as an older man both would generate differing thoughts, actions and descriptions.The most compelling moment in the novel is when Stephen by chance uncovers a different yet serious secret involving Keith's mother, this discovery slowly changes the dynamic of the adventure and signifies a degree of maturity especially within Stephen. The change mentioned could metaphorically resemble the time in everybody's childhood when reality overtakes playtime making it lose its escapism and excitement. Discovering this dark secret could signify the vast regret Stephen beholds as an older man; you can see from the scale of the secret, he wishes the adventure had ended quickly so he wouldn't have known the real secret Keith's mother was hiding.Stephen's unexpected revelation at the end forces the reader to question the whole story, especially due to the nationality of the suspected \`spy'; this astonishing twist in many cases could subtly symbolise the mistreatment and suspicion of German emigrants (those who escaped Nazi-Germany) in Britain during World War Two."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"Don't stop reading this because it starts off slowly. That's what I did several years ago. I'm so glad I returned for another try. Frayn sucks the reader into the half-reality/half-fantasy world of children making you smile at times with the memory of your own innocent games created with a vivid imagination. But you soon realize that there may be something else a lot less innocent afoot. This game of 'my mother is a German spy' may have real consequences that nobody in the story is ready for, neither children nor adults.This story is a page-turner once you realize the two boys may have stumbled onto something. It left me a little dissatisfied at the end and felt a little abrupt but after reflection and reading some analysis of it I now feel content with how it ended. It is, after all, told through the eyes of ~10 year old boy so the reader only gets as much closure as he does.I plan to read this beautifully written book again to get new perspectives and maybe catch some of the symbolism I missed the first time around."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"In his novel Spies which was published in London in 2002 Michael Frayn wants to show how lonely, fearful and desperate being a child often feels.Similar to time travel the old Stephen Wheatley looks back at his past and remembers unresolved events initiated by feelings of guilt. Author's untypical detailed description imitates in a very charming way a story seen through the eyes of a little boy. Once again we can see Frayn as an expert in the art of creating puns which makes the novel a deeply satisfying read full of irony. He just as well gives the reader an understanding of children by tragically misapprehending adult realities. Michael Frayn is an excellent writer who has the sense of keeping mystery unresolved at the end. By means of this skill he forces the reader to spend a lot of time on reflecting on the story and reading the novel a second time. I am bound to say that my expectations were complied. No one has accomplished a book with a diversity of perceptions and topics than Frayn.Brilliant writer!

The author does a good job in transporting the reader back in time and into the head of our youthful \\"spy\\". The story unfolds nicely. Towards the end there is some real drama, with earlier mysteries solved by our young sleuths. Unfortunately in the last twenty pages the author quickly dumps some narrative presumably to tie together loose ends of the story. It seemed a bit forced, and he resorts to the old trick of adding unnecessary/unwanted plot twists in the end. Boo!Bottom line: a genial story that gets wiped out by over-imaginative plot twists. A near miss."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"At first, \\"Spies\\" seems like an elegiac remembrance by an old man revisiting the village where he grew up during the tense but oddly halcyon days of the British countryside during World War II. As a typically awkward youth, Stephen had befriended the remote-but-cool Keith, and the pair built railway lines in the garden and explored a nearby house that had been destroyed (with inhabitant present) by a German bomb. Other than rations and news headlines, this house becomes the only concrete reminder of the constant menace of war--until Keith says the \\"six random words\\" that doom the two boys to unexpected self-discovery and mayhem: \\"My mother is a German spy.\\"Convincing each other that Keith's mother is indeed up to something, the boys in turn become spies, first playfully, then with increasing seriousness, and they unwittingly expose private secrets and local lore incidental to their investigation. And unknown at first to the boys, a neighborhood girl (with something of a crush on Stephen) is spying on them all. Even Keith's mother, the prey of their hunt, is onto them, gently chiding Stephen while visiting the boys' not-so-secret hideout, \\"Sometimes people have things they want to do in private. Just like you and Keith in here.\\" It's a bit like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\"--without the courtroom drama.Both a mystery novel and a bildungsroman, \\"Spies\\" also serves as a parable on the perils of civilian snooping, but it's best when it focuses on the two protagonists and their picturesque surroundings. The \\"mystery\\" is revealed, of course--but just when the reader thinks everything is wrapped up, Frayn discloses additional symbolism-heavy surprises in the last few pages, the seeds for which he has scattered throughout the novel. This epilogue is the only truly false note in the book, like a song that crams all its catchy hooks into the fadeout. Some of the final revelations are admittedly clever, but if Frayn had divulged them gradually, over the course of the story proper, I think the forced ending would not have overpowered what is a charming if unsettling tale of two boys growing up in a blinkered world."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"When given this book, I was told it would make me remember what it was like to be a child. I honestly didn't think that was possible. And if possible, didn't think it would be interesting. I was wrong. This divine book actually let me see things through my adolescent eyes all over again. I loved every word of it. Every second of it. As close to perfect as anything I've ever read."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"A page turner to make you think about pre-adolescence, wartime, and child rearing. The book's WWII setting is engrossing, and, while Frayne does exhibit some of the carefully orchestrated plot trickery we've grown accustomed to, the richness of his plot and his characters is a gift to all readers."},{"Title":"Spies","review":"To deal with one's daily problems one has to relegate yesterday's problems to the back burner, but is that completely possible? Stephen's father in this novel entitled \`spies\\" (lower case s on my copy, but upper case on images here) thinks it is. What his son, Stephen, thinks is rather different, however, but we don't really come to know what Stephen really thinks in this book. Yes, the whole novel is Stephen's story and he's telling it, but he's doing so from 50 years on and he's not sure himself what he actually thought about things as they happened during the eventful doings covered by this book.If there is a point to this book it is that, as Stephen waxes, that \\"just by looking at things I shouldn't have looked at, I've changed them.\\" But that can't be the point of this book; not to look at such things; or can it? Actually, I don't think that this book HAS a point so what to make of this novel I'm not really sure. Michael Frayn's writing style isn't particularly interesting, but he does put his story together well so that by page 120 or so you've become very interested to find out the answers to all the questions that seem to baffle Stephen and his best friend Keith. It's a bit unfortunate, however, that you have to read more than half of this book before you are at all interested in it.This book was recommended to me so I read it, but until I read maybe 60% of it I was not at all interested in anything about it. Then I became quite interested as the story's developments began to break in sometimes unforeseen ways. Would I myself now suggest it to another? I'm not sure. There's one protagonist character herein---let's call the person \`yellow' so as not to ruin anything for you should you yourself decide to read this for yourself---whose actions don't make much sense. And if you take out this character you no longer have any story so while developments are spun and woven in an interesting way it is only interesting if you don't question the setup presented by Mr.Frayn.Moreover, I don't think there's a really likable person in this story. Actually, I haven't thought about this until just this moment, but on second thought I still think it's true. Of course, such is not a requirement for a book to be likable, but notwithstanding that I don't see much reason to give Mr.Frayn another chance to entertain, captivate, and or move me in some way or another. (11Aug) Cheers"},{"Title":"Spies","review":"I loved the atmosphere in the novel, to begin with, but by the time I'd read a third of it, I'd come to the conclusion that atmosphere is really all it has. There is some suspense, and I do still want to know how Keith's mother can apparently move very quickly between two places without being seen. However, the 'trick' was wearing a bit thin after about the third incident and the pages and pages of descriptive text eventually bored me, so I've decided life's too short and I've moved on to another book."},{"Title":"HUXLEY: FROM DEVIL'S DISCIPLE TO EVOLUTION'S HIGH PRIEST.","review":"I've never read a book quite like Desmond's. He is an extremely talented writer and is obviously enthusiastic about Huxley, his &quot;X club&quot; cohorts, and Victorian England in general. Some of his prose is worth savoring, in fact. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, his talent and enthusiasm primarily result in a 650 page-long monograph of purple prose. It is difficult to find a single sentence on some pages that doesn't contain a simile (usually of an overwrought nature) or highly charged authorial proclamation. Although this practice certainly makes the writing lively, it also makes it extremely heavy-going and, at times, quite confusing. It is difficult to read more than a few pages at a time.As for the book's material, it is never less than fascinating. Desmond is a thorough researcher, and he never fails to explore the major events in Huxley's life in proper detail. He is also enormously well-schooled in the world of Victorian science, university politics, and culture. Although he makes even the slightest struggle in Huxley's life seem like a battle for all time, he also succeeds in making &quot;Hal&quot; a truly sympathetic and utterly unparalleled individual. I had no problem with the straight narrative structure as other reviewers seem to have had, but many, many names popped in and out of the story with little information to refresh my memory and this grew tiresome.In short, I recommend giving this book a shot. You may tolerate or even enjoy Desmond's prose. There is a lot of wonderful information about a wonderful and remarkable man to be imbibed. However, be warned that it will most likely be a murky, if hot and spicy, pool to wade through."},{"Title":"HUXLEY: FROM DEVIL'S DISCIPLE TO EVOLUTION'S HIGH PRIEST.","review":"I've read Adrian Desmond's Huxley biography several times since its initial publication a decade ago. When I first read it, I thought it was a tour de force; ten years later, it still holds up.Desmond is a brilliant biographer: his \\"Darwin\\" (co-authored with James Moore) and his studies of Robert Owen have been deeply influential among historians of science. The difference between those books and this one, though, is that Desmond obviously likes Huxley: he admires the young Huxley's drive and ambition; his willingness to take risks; his ferocious, furious determination to succeed in despite lack of connections or inheritance (Victorian Britain wasn't so far from Jane Austen when Huxley was striking out on his own); and his incredible success. As much as any single individual, Huxley deserves credit for creating our modern notion of what science can do, and how scientists should be treated-- by the state, by the general public, by universities. It's the bulldog's world; we just live in it.The hip-hop criticism is astute. The book is actually filled with references to earlier histories of science: nearly every page has a play on the title of some book or article. Insiders will get them; apparently they're noticeable, but distracting, to others.Still, the book is a model for how to write biography, and probably the best introduction to Victorian science and culture around today."},{"Title":"HUXLEY: FROM DEVIL'S DISCIPLE TO EVOLUTION'S HIGH PRIEST.","review":"What a fine book and bio! The author stated that he is most interested in placing TH Huxley into the context of his times, late 19th Century England, and the world, and he succeeds completely! From THH's humble origins with descriptions of the slums of 1840's London, through the amazing Rattlesnake voyage to Australia and New Guinea, and onward to the world's #1 Iconoclast (Nietzsche came a little later), this book reads like the best novel, with tons of biology, paleontology,history of science, theological debunking, and English history all included. Not to mention the sometimes difficult financial and family life of the founder of the famous 20th century Huxleys. THH was obvious as close to a universal scientific genius and spokeman as we'll ever have! Very strange how his many claims for science in school were accepted in Britain by the 1890's, but are still controversial in 2000's USA!"},{"Title":"HUXLEY: FROM DEVIL'S DISCIPLE TO EVOLUTION'S HIGH PRIEST.","review":"Thomas Huxley deserves better than this meandering, plodding tome. What should have been a facinating biography is lost in the obtuse style the author uses. On the plus side--there are some very good passages and pockets of wonderful information, and the bibliography is amazingly complete. On the minus side--the shining bits are so deeply hidden in the depths of the authors quagmire style you may need a machete to find them. I also agree with some earlier posts that a thematic approach would be preferrable to a strictly chronological narrative."},{"Title":"HUXLEY: FROM DEVIL'S DISCIPLE TO EVOLUTION'S HIGH PRIEST.","review":"I have been very much impressed by Thomas Huxley and wanted to know more about him, his life and his works. Desmond's book provided me with all this information and much more. I tend to agree though with some comments made by earlier reviewers. The book could have been written in an easier format and style. This could have probably been achieved by separating his personal and family life in the first two or three chapters devoting the rest of the book to his scientific and professional work. Be that as it may, the book is a mine of useful information. Huxley was a great scientist and a great thinker. His capacity to think clearly and logically is evidenced by his defining &quot;agnosticism&quot; as a way of thinking which is different from blind religious faith and outright atheism. Since we can not scientifically prove (yet) that some kind of God does not exist, it will be wrong to believe that God does not exist. Likewise, there does not exist any rational ground to believe that God does exist. Majority of human beings are in the grip of different religions which demand blind faith in the existence of God. And this faith leads humanity into a bundle of rigmaroles which religion forbids to question. Huxley and several others before him have published works to rid the human race from the terrible things that different religions demand of their followers to believe and practice. Huxley helped elevating science and rational thought to a station that they deserve. Even though the book is not easy to read, it is full of valuable information.Mohammad Gill"},{"Title":"HUXLEY: FROM DEVIL'S DISCIPLE TO EVOLUTION'S HIGH PRIEST.","review":"Rarely have I encountered such an awkward and opaque writing style. Desmond uses the sampling techniques of hip-hop, producing sentences by stringing together various quotes and quote fragments. The result manifests neither rhythm nor flow as the reader must laboriously decode even the shortest sentences. The overall result is that the book which although it has fair to good factual and analytical content has a fragmentary feel about it and is in general a chore to read."},{"Title":"HUXLEY: FROM DEVIL'S DISCIPLE TO EVOLUTION'S HIGH PRIEST.","review":"It is many years since I read this, but having read the other review, I just want to note that at the time I thought it the best science-history book I had read for many years - since the author's Hot Blooded Dinosaurs, in fact. Some might find it a bit heavy going, especially the dissection of many aquatic creatures, but it is worth persevering."},{"Title":"HUXLEY: FROM DEVIL'S DISCIPLE TO EVOLUTION'S HIGH PRIEST.","review":"While this is an extremely thorough and complete review of Huxley's life and work, I found several problems with the book. In brief, these include: A Hemingwayesque type of writing (short declaratory sentences) without H's style to pull it off. An overuse of adjectives by about a factor of three. Many sentences that, in spite of being short, were hard to disentangle grammatically. My most serious criticism of the content, though, is that the author stuck much too closely to a time-line rather than an idea or subject line. For example, he makes the statement, in several places, that finally Huxley saw the light and fully bought into evolution and natural selection as presented by Darwin. But he never seems to explain this: why the hesitancy and why the &quot;sudden&quot; conversion. There is too much mixing up of private life with scientific ideas. And no real counter is given to Huxley's antipathy to Owen whose work seems to be at least as long-lived as Huxley's (dinosaurs?). For my taste, a much more satisfying way of writing scientific biography can be found by reading Janet Browne's first vol. of a bio. of Darwin (&quot;Coasting&quot;)."},{"Title":"HUXLEY: FROM DEVIL'S DISCIPLE TO EVOLUTION'S HIGH PRIEST.","review":"Adrian Desmond is an excellent science writer (e.g.,Darwin: The Life of a Tormented EvolutionistandThe Ape's Reflexion). He wrote in the Introduction to this 1994 book, \\"'Huxley' is a contextual biography, for want of a better word: as often as not it looks up from street level to provide a fresh perspective on the people's scientist. At the outset my goal was to write it in a way that would humanize science and its history in order to make it accessible and interesting... it looks at evolution's use in order to understand the class, religious or political interests involved. It raises questions about new practices and new workplaces.\\" (Pg. xiv)He records, \\"Huxley sat in the pews of the cathedral. On Christmas Eve he watched the Catholic festivities, less with a sense of anthropological mission than with evangelical anger... The rationalist scorned this prostitution of human reason. To the young sailor priests and prostitutes were all of a piece, only standing on opposite sides of the sacred divide. At Mass the 'chanting' was 'of a most vile description.'\\" (Pg. 55)Later, he adds, \\"For Huxley, the only way forward was a competitive, technocratic society, with the science professionals at the helm.\\" (Pg. 211) He states, \\"Huxley's cadre was moving into power, but everywhere they met [Richard] Owen's imperious presence. What the scientific parvenus lacked in social strength they made up in moral posturing: hence Huxley's hallelujah, that finally 'the Lord hath given this Amalekite unto mine hands.'\\" (Pg. 231) He notes, \\"Huxley rallied Darwin... he sharpened his 'claws & beak' to tear at 'the curs which will bark and yelp'... Now Darwin was glad of it. Never one to enter the public fray, he needed a champion as Huxley needed a cause.\\" (Pg. 260)Of Huxley's famous encounter with bishop Wilberforce, Desmond records, \\"[Huxley] waited, stage-managing the event just as much. And when the shouts for him climaxed, he rose... [and said] 'If then, said I the question is put to me would I rather have a miserable ape for a grandfather or a man highly endowed by nature and possessed of great means of influence & yet who employs these faculties & that influence for the mere purpose of introducing ridicule into a grave scientific discussion, I unhesitatingly affirm my preference for the ape.' ... There followed inextinguishable laughter among the people, and they listened to the rest of my argument with the greatest attention.\\" (Pg. 279) However, he admits, \\"Perceptions of the event differed so wildly that talk of a 'victor' is ridiculous... even Hooker thought that he had not managed to 'command the audience'...\\" (Pg. 280)As far as Huxley's religious position was concerned, he wondered \\"What could he call himself? He was shifting power to an elite whose authority rested in right reasoning, not mythical realities... a cacaphony of voices proclaimed that they 'had attained a certain 'gnosis\\"'; like the second-century gnostics who professed sparks of divine knowledge. That night he came up with 'Agnostic.'\\" (Pg. 374) He adds, \\"Agnosticism helped Huxley elude his detractors. It presented the man of science as non-aligned; it deflected any inquest from his own axiomatic beliefs... And it allowed Huxley to take the offensive.\\" (Pg. 389-390)This excellent book will be of immense interest to anyone studying the origins of the evolutionary theory, and the debate concerning it."},{"Title":"HUXLEY: FROM DEVIL'S DISCIPLE TO EVOLUTION'S HIGH PRIEST.","review":"The book was quite thrilling. I bought it as a birthday present for my wife (who is a Huxley fan), dipped into it and was hooked. It made me go straight to some of Huxley's essays which I had bought in a second hand bookshop and which but for Desmond would be gathering dust on my bookshelves. Huxley's prose style is tremendous. Desmond's biography of Darwin (which I am reading at the moment) is also very good. Anyone with the slightest interest in the history of ideas should read both these books."},{"Title":"HUXLEY: FROM DEVIL'S DISCIPLE TO EVOLUTION'S HIGH PRIEST.","review":"This is one of the best bios of Huxley ever written (cf. also the more theoretical work of Shellie Lyons) and seems a natural companion to Moore & Desmond's work, Darwin: The Tormented Evolutionist.The new style of Darwin studies takes the legacy of such as John Greene and others and zeroes in on the social context of the emergence of the theory as ideologically charged.In Huxley's case one sees the generational change breaking the Anglican monopoly of the Paley-ites, but in the process creating a new establishment in the conservative revolution of Darwin's theory.What is remarkable is that Darwin's bulldog had an initial clarity that drove him to defend Darwin on evolution, but demur on natural selection. How ironic. Le plus ca change!It is hard to impossible to take theories of evolution in complete seriousness as pure science when we see the almost outrageous social darwinist cast to the whole operation. Huxley, to his credit, saw things differently toward the end in his final classic Evolution and Ethics. Would that the generations springing from his first great defense of the theory could come to his final regrets.

Less creepy-spooky than others in this series (\\"Werewolves Don't...\\" and \\"Aliens Don't...\\" are more spooky than this one), this book is nevertheless a lot of fun. Gene mysteriously appears and laughs a loud laugh every time one of the kids offhandedly wishes for something. Then, that wish comes true! While our buddy Eddie doesn't believe that Gene could be a magical creature (does Eddie EVER believe anything??), readers will be very hard pressed to explain that he's not when they find out what happens to the Kid's normally boring, work-driven teacher!The \\"...Don't...\\" series (as I call them) are all quick reads that weigh in \`round or under 100 pages.

At the house, they found a locked door and wanted to check it out. However, their grandparents tell them to stay away. Can you guess what happened? Yah they open the door and something comes out. When Gretchen and Clark go downstairs, they are locked in. Do they get out? You will have to read the book to find out. In my opinion people 9 and up should read this book. I just thought it was a wonderful book."},{"Title":"How To Kill A Monster (Goosebumps Series)","review":"This book is about two kids who go to their Grandparents house and they live in a swamp. Their is a swamp monster and they try to kill it. This book is full of surprises. This book made me keep on reading and reading and reading."},{"Title":"How To Kill A Monster (Goosebumps Series)","review":"I read the book How to Kill a Monster by R.L. Stine. It was a very interesting book because it had a lot of twists in it that you wouldn't expect. I liked the part when the monster was chasing the kids and when the kids tried to kill the monster. I would suggest this book to anyone who likes mysteries."},{"Title":"How To Kill A Monster (Goosebumps Series)","review":"First off, to people who don't like Goosebumps because its not scary. What do you expect? It's for 7 - 12 year old kids, meaning not very frightening but a mysterious ending. Goosebumps is a mystery book in a sort way, because every time you read goosebumps series, you wonder how the storyline is going to be connected to the ending. I started to read goosebumps at the age of 8, and never once did I thought goosebumps was scary. (I read almost every book of the Original Goosebumps Series). But I still love goosebumps, and R.L.Stine is the authour that made me wanting to be an authour. So the bottom line is, don't read goosebumps if you want chill on your back. If you want a chill, I'd say watch the movie \\"The Grudge\\". LOL!Gretchen and Clark has to spend another living with their grandparent's house. They hate to, because Grandpa Eddie is practically deaf, and all Grandma Rose wants to do is bake. What makes it worse is that they live right in the middle of a dark, muddy swamp. Than they find out that there is a strange room upstairs. A growling noises coming out from it. So Gretchen goes there when she and Clark were playing Hide and Seek. And voila. A hideous creature was inside the room.Anyways, I would've really given a 4 star on this book. Why a 4 star? Because the beginning was just too slow-paced. It didn't have the enthusiasm and the twist(which is very predictabe if you've been reading goosebumps for 4 years...). It suddenly gets very good as soon as they find the swamp creature.So why 5 stars? Because I loved the idea of how the kids kill the monsters. I won't spoil it, but I'll just say that it is very fun to read. But that would've still been a 4 star... so where in the heck does the 5th star come? The ending, dude! Ending was pure sweet, I couldn't predict it even if I have been reading the series for 4 years now."},{"Title":"How To Kill A Monster (Goosebumps Series)","review":"It seems to me that every Goosebump book I have read has a \\"Most Something\\" title. This books is \\"Most Action\\" of a Goosebump book. In chapter 14 , I believe it is, when they find the monster, and until the end (Chapter 31), there is nothing but ACTION! I usually read a few chapters of them and put them down, but when I start redaing this, I read it all! Anyway, this is a very good book if you like action."},{"Title":"How To Kill A Monster (Goosebumps Series)","review":"haha well dat's a scary freaky book realli good job Of R.L.STINE i fink u gotta read it it awesome ~!"},{"Title":"How To Kill A Monster (Goosebumps Series)","review":"This book is so awesome!

Coming from a well-to-do Belgian family in the age before Television, Radio, and all the other usually destructive distractions of today, the young Maeterlinck had beekeeping for his principal hobby (just ask even your high-I.Q. high-schooler today ANYTHING about the life of bees and ants and other social insects and you'll be amazed at how little they know, in spite of the 'Discovery' Channel and all the documentary films made about the subject and shown on TV), and inspired by the essays of Fabre, began a period of amateur observation and experiment with his apiary, finally publishing the results in 1901, at the age of 39, as &quot;Life of the Bee.&quot; Written in a highly poetic style that blended fact, imagination, and mystical speculation, it became the single most popular book ever written about insect life. Not that there aren't errors in Maeterlinck's observations that subsequent research corrected, but as far as the QUALITY OF WRITING is concerned, no one else can even come close to these amazing descriptions: in fact, some of the best written passages in all of literature are in this book."},{"Title":"The Life of the Bee","review":"This is the second book by Maurice Maeterlinck that I have read. He certainly has a philosophical mind and, at times, he is quite impressive. On the other hand, he seems to wander so far off topic as to be distracting. As his choice of general topic for this thesis, Maeterlinck has chosen a topic he knows well; the life of the bee.The author is a bee-keeper and one who researches his topic. He speaks of observing the bees through glass hives and he has learned a lot through his observations as well as those he cites. There were times that I was so overwelmed by his uncanny insights to life and human nature that I underlined a number of passages. His ability to compare our perspective of the bees to their perspective of us gives a naturalist's insight to life. This works well while we are discovering the wonders of the bee's society. As the book continues into the more esoteric aspects of bees, this philosophical wandering got to be a bit much for me as I stumbled to the end of the book. Others will likely disagree but that's my impression."},{"Title":"The Marvel Universe Role Playing Game: Guide to the Hulk & the Avengers","review":"This book is filled with more information about the Hulk and the Avengers then I could find on any online source. It has a lot of new profiles for heroes and villains encountered by both the Avengers and the Hulk, which naturally leads to a few villains and heroes that have encountered other Marvel characters like Scorpion and Shocker from Spiderman. It's also got a lot of new actions, options, modifiers, and a few advantages, disadvantages, and challenges. It's as big an upgrade to the game as the guide to the X-men was if not bigger. The only thing I thought I would get that I didn't was a better description of Asguard and other magical realms. Oh well, aside from that, it's a great upgrade."},{"Title":"The Marvel Universe Role Playing Game: Guide to the Hulk & the Avengers","review":"Once again the people in charge of Marvel roleplaying books have made a blunder.

I first discovered his incredible talent in his novel DEATH AND NIGHTINGALES -- it caused me to seek out other works. While his output is paced in a way to cause his fans to ache for more, the quality of it all is first-rate. More than anyone I've read, he captures the song of Irish speech and the symphony of the Irish spirit, joys and sorrows alike, in his words.The characters in these stories come to life before the reader's eyes, and in the reader's imagination, in a way that few authors have managed to master -- and they do so in such a natural manner as to make the transition from the printed page to the living, breathing world seem effortless. That's one of the marks of a great writer -- the work draws the reader in without even a 'bump'. We are transported to Ireland -- past and present -- and bear witness to the drama of these characters' lives. The unimaginably horrific times of the famine years; the day-to-day struggle not only to survive, but to do so in a way that allows the soul and spirit to continue to thrive in the body; the 'troubles' that have for so many generations threatened to claw the country to bloody bits; the conflicts between the classes.If I had to single out an individual story in this collection for my highest praise, I would have to cite the title piece, 'Heaven lies about us'. McCabe relates the story of a young girl with a terrible secret, who knows she must share it but fears the consequences -- her pain and dread, and the pure heartbreak of her story left a stone in my heart. He has captured every aspect of her situation from her point of view -- and done so with such skill that the characters and setting seem to settle into the room with the reader.McCabe, born in Scotland (his parents were Irish), returned to Ireland in the 1940s to live -- he lives and works his farm in Co. Monaghan, and writes...thank God he writes. His heart, soul, eyes and ears are at home in Ireland, and his powers of observation are keen. It's a gift that's rare -- I can read these stories over and over and they still move me very deeply.These stories are collected in this volume for publication in the US for the first time -- it's a great opportunity for American readers to experience his work. He's a true master, and I consider it a deep blessing to have discovered him."},{"Title":"How Intranets Work (How It Works (Ziff-Davis/Que))","review":"It's easy to understand a LAN ... when there's an administrator to explain.

It contains all of the pertinant and influential work on ethics, justice, virtue, and duty. Just don't expect to be spoon-fed the learning points. It is comprehensive, and seeks to provide original works to engage both sides of issues.

That book was excellent for the price and got me inspired to check out some more of Marty's branding advice.This little pocket book is quite small and extremly beautifully made (if you are a designer like me and like 2 color books with nice paper choices and use of colors). The small illustrations throughout it are beautiful and illustrative of Marty's concepts on branding.Howevere, most of the book is used to show small and brief definitions of branding terminology. Some are common sense and some are not, but it certainly help sharpen my branding terminology as well as reinforce any common sense words and terms I felt I knew.Overall, its a great, inexpensive book to have.With a cover price of $10 make sure your either getting it for less or you dont mind paying extra for a book as inexpensive as this because I paid full price plus shipping (meaning I paid more than cover price on Amazon when all was said and done)."},{"Title":"The Dictionary of Brand","review":"This is great if you want to get to terms with terms used within the design and branding sectors or if you are dealing with agencies who love their jargon! Nicely designed and useful to the novice or the professional."},{"Title":"The Battle of the Java Sea (Great battles of the modern world)","review":"A relatively good book about the sea battles which resulted in the loss of the Netherlands East Indies to the Japanese Empire in 1942. During these battles, the U.S. lost the heavy cruiser Houston, several destroyers, and the first airplane carrier Langley. The losses to the Australians, Dutch, and British were more heavy. The plum target for the Japanese were the oil of the Indies and the rich island of Java. These battles determined the fate of the Dutch Empire in Asia and placed a threat to Australia.One thing I liked about this book, which I felt lacked in some of the other battle books is the relative strength of the Allies versus the Japanese Empire. Thomas spent a large amount of page space covering this and why the Allies failed in this crucial battle.I gave this book an average rating, since the style of writing by Thomas was not page turning. The battles were detailed, but no personal experiences were written into them. One faced why the ABDA forces failed and the Japanese won."},{"Title":"The Battle of the Java Sea (Great battles of the modern world)","review":"David Arthur Thomas' Battle of the Java Sea is a comprehensive account of the decisive sea battle of early 1942 resulting in an Allied defeat at the hands of the still-surging Imperial Japanese Navy. The Allied ABDA Strike Force was cobbled together from a ragged mix of American, British, Dutch and Australian ships under the command of Dutch Admiral Karel Doorman, who died aboard his flagship during the battle. Their task was to thwart the Japanese invasion of Java; their defeat at the hands of a numerically and qualitatively superior Japanese assault force under Admiral Takeo Takagi sealed the fate of the entire Netherlands East Indies.The US Navy, of course, was still reeling from the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor less than 3 months earlier and we should remember that by the time of Java Sea the British and Australians had been at war [albeit not against Japan] and taking a pounding for more than two years and that the Dutch homeland had been occupied by the Germans since May 1940. The ABDA force was a fleet desperately short of support and supplies that found itself at the far end of an impossibly long supply line.In spite of the daunting odds, the Allied ships sold themselves dearly in a doomed effort. Their sacrifice should not be forgotten. David Thomas' book is a valuable contribution to the study of early WWII in the Far East - a period far too often overlooked. At the time of Java Sea the prospects of victory against Japan were still very much in doubt. We would do well to remember and learn from those dark days when we were heavy underdogs."},{"Title":"The People with Five Fingers: A Native Californian Creation Tale","review":"An old tale of Native Americans, coupled with abstract watercolors, comes together to form a picture book worthy of any library collection. The ancient animals have a premonition that humans will walk the earth. Coyote, the head animal, carves paths for water to flow; Gophers heave dirt to create mountains and valleys. Coyote imprints his paw in the soil to give humans five fingers. When humans walk the earth, the animals retreat to the ocean and mountains, while rejoicing in man's similarities and differences to one another.Bierhorst's retelling is simple in style, yet compelling as a story. Parker's expressive watercolors merge to showcase the birth of the land and mankind, while reveling in the wonder of nature and animals. Children, drawn into the converging artwork, will want to discover more about the animals presented in the tale. California libraries should feature this book in any children's display of Native American culture."},{"Title":"Diagnostic methods in clinical virology","review":"The seller is very effieient in sending me the book. This book is very useful in clinical diagnostic virology. Nowadays, the techniques in viral culture and serology testing are still based on this book."},{"Title":"Doing English (Doing... Series)","review":"This product came exactly as stated in the description. It was received in a very timely manner and was in excellent condition."},{"Title":"San Francisco's Potrero Hill (Images of America)","review":"\\"San Francisco's Potrero Hill\\" is one of a series of books giving an exactly 128-page photographic history of a specific neighborhood of the city. After reading eight of these books, I have to say the Potrero Hill edition has the tightest writing, the most detailed captions, and the widest scope of the lot.The book tackles the geological origins of the hill and how the native tribes, the settlement at Mission Dolores, and growing San Francisco made economic and other use of the hill. We see foraging, cattle grazing, beer-making, and ship-building. We see panoramic views, Victorian houses, schools (including the start of the Lick-Wilmerding School), early hospitals, and housing projects. There are economics, sociology, and local politics. The pictures are varied by content, provider, and date. For its size, this book is tough to beat for its topic.As a resident elsewhere in the city, I might have liked a bit more on the rise of San Francisco General Hospital (including the public emergency room and famous AIDS ward) and a bit more on the pale water tower very visible on the crest from the west, on the local parks, and on the impact of highways. All books in the series have to be selective and oriented toward the past; so this criticism is directed more at the publishers than at the authors, who did fine.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Knight","review":"This book is for people who are beginning their study of medieval knights. It isn't academic, so it's a very easy read. It is logically organized and contains some interesting tidbits like the origins of certain phrases such as \\"get on your high horse\\" or being \\"pummeled.\\" (These both originated with the knights, according to the author.)The book should have included pictures. For example, there is a discussion on various types of armor, shields and helms--it would have been helpful had they been pictorially displayed. It would also have been nice to see some of the castles in pictures; after all, the architecture of those buildings are part of the enduring fascination for medieval history.If this book were less than $10, I would recommend it for the beginning student. However, I feel the price is too steep. But take heart: the bibliography reveals the author did much of his research online--a free alternative to buying this book!"},{"Title":"The Knight","review":"My name is Cory Winslow and I am a Swordfighting instructor at a Western Martial Arts school. I am also college student working towards a career as a high school European History teacher and have been studying on my own in this subject for many years.I picked up a copy of \\"The Knight\\" by Alan Baker in my local Barnes and Noble bookstore for around eight dollars, thinking that a hardbound book on my favorite subject for that price couldn't be a bad idea, and I was wrong. Upon returning to my home I began skimming through the book looking for my favorite subject and found it in the chapter \\"The Knight's Equipment\\". This chapter began with an overview of the sword, which I found to be grossly inaccurate. There were too many inaccuracies to list but one of the biggest examples is the author telling us that the Great Swords weighed \\"up to twenty pounds\\". This is simply not true, most swords of this type weighing around 7 lbs and none weighing over 15lbs. (Any over 10lbs were most likely only for ceremonial use.)Similar and no less outrageous discrepancies appear in the sections on Bows, Crossbows, Axes, Hammers, Maces, Flails, Lances and all other sections on weapons. In fact, the inaccuracies are so numerous that the reader should be advised not to trust that any of the \\"facts\\" in these sections are true.Similarly, the sections on \\"Body Armor\\" and \\"Helms\\" are full of misinformation to the point that I asked myself if the author was even taking the subject seriously. It appears that he wasn't. He statements are simply wrong, whether due to the fact of lack of research or apathy shown to the reader, it is not known, but in either case he is giving bad information that should not be perpetuated.This book should be treated more like an opinion piece by the author than a non-fiction book. Its horrible inaccuracies are enough to fluster the learned mind of one whom steeps himself in the academics and practicalities of the history of the knight and the medieval era.If you wish to learn real information on the knight do not read this book. If you wish to be fed grossly inaccurate information by an incompetent author, then this one is for you."},{"Title":"The Knight","review":"This book is incredibly inaccurate, perpetuating some of the Victorian era inspired myths that frankly should have died with them. It is sad that someone who actually gets published, and one would presume did a tiny bit of research could state that a sword weighed 20 pounds and required massive upper body strength to wield it. Did the author ever pick one up? The actual average weight of a knights sword of normal size is between 2.5 lb. and 3.5 lbs. Even the big hand-and-a-half swords rarely weigh more than 4.5 lbs. Same about how a knight in full plate was helpless on the ground. Again not true and just another example of how poor this book is. Don't waste your time and money."},{"Title":"The Knight","review":"&quot;The Knight&quot; traces the evolution of an institution that played a key role in the formation of Western culture. Knights evolved from the early mounted warriors of which Charlemagne's cavalry was the archetype. They were powerful factors in the internecine struggles between European kingdoms as well as in the great Crusades. The influence of knights as members of an aristocratic elite persisted into recent history. The fact that West Point training was an expected activity of aristocratic men in the antebellum US South speaks to the widespread influence of knighthood.Baker's accounts are imminently readable although they are not &quot;searing&quot;. One of the most arresting aspects of the book is the contemporary account of jousts and tournaments. The casual descriptions of encounters that often were blood curdling speak to a very different mindset regarding deadly games during medieval times. Baker covers the first crusade, which shows the merciless treatment of &quot;infidels&quot; by Christian warriors. Baker's discussion of the monk knights, the Templars and the Hospitallars, provides a marvelous opportunity to explore the evolution of the pacifist religion of St. Paul into the militant movement of Pope Urban II. Unfortunately, the book is too short to explore this fascinating twist in history that remains with us to the present. &quot;The Knight&quot; leans toward the style and organization of a traditional academic treatise rather than the more gripping &quot;popular histories&quot;. Despite these limitations, the book is a good overview for anyone wanting to learn something of the evolution of modern warriors."},{"Title":"The Knight","review":"By Bill Marsano. In a time of J-DAMS, MOABs and other expressions of remote-control super-power warfare, the notion of the medieval knight will seem quaint at best to many readers. On the other hand, the knight &lt;was> the decisive weapon on the battlefields of his time. Through generations of movies, comic books and fairy tale the knight has come down to us as a purely romantic figure. Alan Baker is here with this small book to rescue these great warriors from their bubblegum image.This is a brief book, really no more than an essay for the entry-level history student, but enjoyable and informative nonetheless. Bakers gives us a clear-eyed view of how knights developed into an elite warrior class; how they trained and were armed; how they staged elaborate mock-combats--just as the Romans did in the Colosseum--to keep their skills sharp and their reputations high. For a taste of real warfare, Baker takes us through a well-organized history of the First Crusade.This book is designed to whet your appetite, not satisfy it. It does the job well: Most readers will, I think, be eager to go deeper into the day of old when knights were bold.--Bill Marsano is a long-time enthusiast of military affairs."},{"Title":"Pecorino's First Concert (Anne Schwartz Books)","review":"This is the real thing!At last, a book both you and your kids will love.The first time i read Pecorino to my daughter we both laughed outloud and upon finishing it she said \\"READ IT AGAIN!\\"The writing is fresh and original and the drawings are just beautiful and wacky.Run don't walk.

As I liked his previous works such as the Phases of Capitalist Development, so I like this book very much. Of course, the book contains many 'guesstimations' that are unacceptable to today's economists' rigor. This is more so when the author ventures into almost two millenia before 1820, for which he did relatively little work previously. But even here the book apparently provides reasonable figures synthesizing existing evidences with a lucid interpretation, providing illuminating starting points for future studies."},{"Title":"Development Centre Studies The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective","review":"In the last few years I have been searching books offering a general overview of the past, and I have realized that many books entitled \\"History of ...whatever\\" only provide information about the West, the rest of the world being almost ignored.Maddison's on world economy is different, it is truly global. It offers historical statistics of the last two thousand years and is to be read together with \\"The world economy: Historical Statistics \\" (a combined edition of both volumes is to be published on December 2007). In my opinion this is masterful work that can be savored by the professional historian and educated layperson alike, so my rate is between 5 (content) and 4 (pleasure, sometimes falling to 3, sometimes raising to 5). I highly recommend the two volumes.Other works whose scope is as amazingly global as Maddison's and which I would suggest reading (hoping that will be of use for those looking for a broad framework to understand ourselves) are the following: 1. Agrarian cultures: \\"Pre-industrial societies\\" by Patricia Crone; 2. Government: \\"The History of Government\\" by S.E. Finer; 3.

Here's a good place to start.As an [ahem] older law student, I recently signed up to participate in a mediation program through a local courthouse. As I looked around for helpful references, my eye fell naturally on this modern classic by Jennifer Beer. Continuously in print since 1982 and now in its third edition, it's probably _the_ book that did most to teach the American public how to \\"do\\" mediation.It's full of nuts-and-bolts advice on everything from what to say to where to put the chairs. And it's got something some other mediation books lack: a sense of the \\"spirituality\\" of mediation.For the techniques in this volume grew out of the Friends Conflict Resolution Programs (FCRP). And the Religious Society of Friends (\\"Quakers\\") is pretty good at conflict resolution.(It's those \\"meetings.\\" Some readers may know that in the early days of the United States, a half-century of so before the Emancipation Proclamation, the Friends unilaterally, voluntarily, and unanimously freed every last one of their slaves -- and paid them to boot, if I'm not mistaken. And anybody who has ever attended a Quaker meeting will understand why, even if they've never heard of John Woolman.)I've got quite a few Quakers in my family tree, so I'm pleased by this approach. But it's very understated and mostly behind the scenes, so the casual reader will notice only that the book has a certain mood or tone.What's really going on is that the mediation advice herein is implicitly predicated on the presumption that people are competent to settle their own disputes because each of them has \\"that of God\\" within. And the extraordinary sensitivity of the advice is based firmly on Quaker sensibilities: namely, respect for the individual conscience as the very voice of God, and a profound belief in the power of _listening_ both to others and to oneself.The result is a book of advice on mediation that looks an awful lot like a book on how to grasp the \\"sense of a meeting.\\" Even beyond the nuts and bolts, the \\"flavor\\" of the book will itself help the reader get a feel for what mediation is all about. That's a nice feature in a book on ADR, and it's no wonder Beer's book has been in print for so long.Allan Goodman's _Basic Skills for the New Mediator_ is a good companion volume, by the way. His book is more aimed at people who do mediation in \\"courtlike\\" settings, whereas Beer's is for pretty much any context (including workplace and family, both of which she discusses). The two together are a powerful combination of resources, arguably surpassing many more expensive books on the subject.And for a good history of the subject of ADR, see Linda Singer's _Settling Disputes_, which I've also reviewed."},{"Title":"The Mediator's Handbook","review":"I am a mediator, arbitrator, and trainer.

It presents a good balance of party communication and tools to help parties reach lasting agreements.* The 7 step phases of the process are clearly explained.* The specific questions to ask at various points in the process are excellent (p.106)* The last section has mediator evaluations, confidentiality forms, form letters to send to interested parties and other useful tools to use in your practice.I highly recommend this as a basic intro book - its easy to read, complete yet not overly wordy or theoretical."},{"Title":"The Mediator's Handbook","review":"As a mediator and one who trains others how to mediate, I highly recommend this clearly written,comprehensive mediation handbook.

The focus is on the process.The topics are dealt with step-by-step, and while the illustrations aren't necessary, especially for university-level courses or professionals, this is still a great textbook that adequately covers the role of the mediator and all the steps in mediation as well as tips for how to move the process along and recognize problems."},{"Title":"The Mediator's Handbook","review":"Step by step approach to mediation.

First, it is very rare and unique--a must for comic collectors and afficiandos. Second, it is a prime example of Nixon propaganda. Third, but most important, it was illustrated by the great Geo Wildman!Wildman, a lifelong resident of Connecticut, studied advertising at what is now the Paire College of Art. During the 1950s, he was a successful commercial artist, first working for an ad agency, and then becoming a freelance artist. During this time, he began producing freelance comic book art for Charlton Press in Derby, Connecticut.When King Comics ceased publication of their POPEYE title, Charlton acquired the rights. Longtime writer-artist Bud Sagendorf was busy with the daily and Sunday newspaper comics, and declined the job of continuing. George Wildman was offered a contract to produce the POPEYE illustrations, with prolific Joe Gill writing scripts. The first Charlton issue of POPEYE appears in 1969, the final one in 1977. Wildman was hired as assistant editor to Sal Gentile, and in 1971 was promoted to managing editor, and eventually executive editor. Assistant editor Nicola Cuti wrote several of the later POPEYE scripts for Charlton.Wildman's tenure as editor continued through 1985, while Western Publishing picked up POPEYE under their Gold Key and/or Whitman trademarks. Bill Pearson, by then assistant editor at Charlton, began writing scripts, and Wildman produced illustrations while off-duty from Charlton. Their crowning achievement was the epic 50th anniversary special published in 1979.Thanks to the Robert Altman POPEYE movie, a demand for Popeye-related merchandise led to Wildman's working for Random House, illustrating a classic \\"Pop-Up Book\\" which became a best-seller and later a display at the Smithsonian Institution. Wildman was also invited to produce a painted wooden Easter egg for the White House Easter event, his egg also now housed in the Smithsonian. Around this time, the National Cartoonists Society awarded him \\"Best Cartoonist, Humor Division.\\"Western Publishing ceased its comics line in the early 1980s, and Wildman retired from Charlton Comics in 1985, moving into a freelance comic book and children's book illustration career. His pencils, inks and paints graced publications featuring Disney, Hanna-Barbara, Harvey and Warner Brothers characters along with countless designs for various businesses.In 1994, George and wife Trudy Wildman were honored in a gala festival in Chester, Illinois, celebrating the 100th birthday of the creator of Popeye, Elzie Crisler Segar. Wildman received the Popeye Fan Club's Lifetime Achievement Award and performed a sketching show to a standing-room-only crowd. A return visit to Chester in 2004, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Popeye, found Wildman teamed with Hy Eisman, the writer-artist of the Sunday POPEYE newspaper strip since 1994.Today, Wildman and son Karl operate their own advertising agency, producing computer animation, greeting cards, and a wide variety of products. Wildman's work is seen regularly in the \\"Hidden Pictures\\" publications of HIGHLIGHTS FOR CHILDREN. He celebrated his 80th birthday in 2007 and continues to receive mail from Popeye fans around the world."},{"Title":"Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again","review":"...

Truthfully there are not enough books or people that encourage a person to work hard at saving your marraige. Most will tell you to move on. True, saving a marriage is hard, hard, hard work, but this book helps you see it can be done and there are people out there who are willing to help you achive this goal.

In her New York Times bestseller, Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again, Weiner-Davis takes a no-nonsense brief approach to helping couples on the verge of divorce work through their issues.Turning problems into solutions, Weiner-Davis forces her readers to work on improving communication around sex, intimacy, and money. She encourages men to roll up their sleeves and help out by doing the dishes and taking out the garbage. She encourages women to pay more attention to the emotional and social needs of their husbands by knowing when to dote, when to nag, and when to back off.Taking an inside-out approach to helping couples, rather than fixing what's broken, Weiner-Davis focuses on what works in the marriage. She teaches couples that by strengthening the healthy elements of their marriage, the problems will iron themselves out naturally.Following are several quotations from Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again which I've chosen at random:I do not get sidetracked by pessimism and hopelessness as I did in days past. Now I know that hopelessness is a reasonable response to an unreasonable situation (pg. 13).Diagnosing one's spouse as the source of the problem, a common antecedent to divorce, doesn't take into account the roles both partners play in the deterioration of the relationship (pg. 13).Research shows that except in extreme cases of abuse children want their parents together (pg. 13).For every sex-starved husband, there is a wife with a low sex drive. Every compulsive cleaner is paired with a hopeless slob (pg. 82).Take a moment to recall specific times you and your spouse routinely reach dead ends. Maybe discussions about money, sex, or careers always end in battle (pg. 106).How many people imagine utopia when they are asked about goals (pg. 113)."},{"Title":"Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again","review":"I have been married for 16 years, 3 kids, 2 dogs, great home - what I thought was the perfect life. Almost two years ago my wife came to me and told me she wanted a divorce. She &quot;loved me but wasn't in love with me anymore&quot;, was how she put it. She had been going to a therapist for over a year who had encouraged her to &quot;find herself&quot;, &quot;make herself happy&quot;. Never mind her husband and her children. I agreed to go to counseling sessions with her therapist. The counselor wanted us to explore our past and express our anger at each other. With each session our marriage got worse. I begged my wife to stay in the marriage and keep trying to make it work, not just for us, but for the children. She refused. She said it was over.I bought &quot;Divorce Busting&quot; after visiting the author's web site. I read that there was a name for what happened to me. It's called the &quot;walkaway wife syndrome&quot;. I read the book from cover to cover several times during the next few months. I immediately stopped chasing and begging my wife to return. I employed every technique in the book. I even tried what Michele calls &quot;the last resort technique&quot;. I learned that I couldn't change my wife, but I could change myself. If I changed, truly changed my behavior, it would have to change my marriage. I love how this book is so clearly written. I really enjoyed( and continue to enjoy ) setting and achieving my goals. I love how this book gave me hope. It took almost 4 months of constant work on my part, but it worked!! My wife came back. For the first month that she was back, it was touch and go. I continued to use my divorce busting techniques and mindset, and now things are better than they have ever been in our marriage. We're like newlyweds again.If you need to save your marriage and your family, Divorce Busting is the book to buy! Should be required reading before and during marriage. Thanks Michele!Justin"},{"Title":"Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again","review":"I couldn't disagree more with the woman from California. Although this book isn't everything for everybody- no book ever is- it completely changed my life. My husband was in the midst of a mid-life crisis, big time. He had an affair, lost weight, the whole bit. Everyone was telling me to leave. But I didn't want to give up seventeen years of marriage when we have 3 kids together. Call me crazy, but through the whole thing, I still knew our marriage could work. But I didn't know how to make that happen. I was so depressed. My friends were tired of talking to me. I went to a therapist who told me to leave. Nothing helped.Then I saw Divorce Busting in the bookstore. When I read it, it felt like the author had been watching my marriage from my living room. I learned so much from it, not only about getting my husband back, but about all kinds of relationships. The methods WORK! My husband and I have never been happier. I don't usually write reviews, but I just couldn't keep quiet when I read the review from that unhappy woman. I realize that some people can't save their marriages because it's too late. But even if I had not been able to turn things around in my marriage, I feel I am a better, stronger person because of this book. I have the author to thank for saving my marriage!"},{"Title":"Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again","review":"I'm a marriage columnist and author of two books on marriage: Marriage 911 and Chocolate Chili Pepper Love. I'm not a professional counselor, I'm a humorist/storyteller and write as a friend to others who are hurting in their relationships. The #1 book I recommend to those &quot;stuck&quot; in problem areas, the book that was most helpful to me during a time of darkness and confusion in my own marriage is Divorce Busting. When couples are hurting they don't usually need a course in WHY (they are already experts at that) -- what they need is HELP and RELIEF. Michelle's warm, practical, engaging advice is the medicine this writer/speaker prescribes for those who want to improve their marriage and maintain a sense of personal peace and dignity in the process. Thank you, Michelle! Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again","review":"The book details what Solution-Oriented Brief Therapy (SBT) is about and offers step by step ways to turn failing marriages around- even if only one partner is seeking to save the marriage. The book is written in a direct, non-psycobabble language and is also entertaining. (I found myself chuckling and saying &quot;wow&quot; quite often). SBT is designed to work far faster than traditional therapy- as many as 10 sessions but usually 4-6 sessions with only a couple of weeks between sessions.The author wrote the book to get the information about SBT out to more people faster because SBT really works. She has received countless letters to this effect as well as having seen successes from her own practice. It is also enlightening to know that she was a &quot;traditional&quot; marriage counselor before shifting to SBT.Plenty of examples and &quot;how to's&quot; and it is designed to work fast. The author contrasts traditional therapy versus SBT and explains why SBT works and gives some good insight as to why long drawn out traditional therapy often fails- especially if one partner is not willing to reconcile.Rather than psychoanalyze why husbands or wives are a certain way, she directs the reader to examine &quot;successes&quot; from earlier in the marriage. She then guides the reader towards seeking positive outcomes via short-term simple goals/objectives based on those things that &quot;worked&quot; in the past.The book also provides insight as to how men and women interact in a marriage environment and how men and women view and react to things differently. It also provides tremendous insight as to how a husband and wife can both be &quot;working&quot; at making a marriage successful, yet still be heading down the road to misery and possibly even divorce.I would recommend the book to couples spanning the spectrum from newly engaged to those who have already divorced."},{"Title":"Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again","review":"I saw the author on the Oprah show. My best friend's wife had already filed for a divorce and he was depressed beyond description about it. I told him to get the book. He got it, read it over and over, used what he read and she started to soften. It took 4 months of hard work on his part. He would tell me every day what technique he was using, and what progress he was making. Today, they are madly in love with each other again. She says he has become a new person. He says their relationship is like it was when they first met. They have become friends again. My wife and I have both read the book and we love the stories. We give copies of the book out at wedding showers and anniversaries. I think Divorce Busting is written in an easy to understand way.

This book was the only one worth what I paid for it.But let me get straight to the \\"saved my divorce\\" point. I won't go into details of my sitch because that's a very personal thing. All I can tell you is that this book did not save my marriage. It's over. HOWEVER, using the ideas and information in Divorce Busting saved my relationship with my ex. It also saved me from my own emotional trauma by teaching me how to avoid \\"triggers\\" that caused me to become so emotional.DB is based on something called \\"short term result oriented therapy\\". The basic concept is that it's not so important how you \\"FEEL\\" as it is what you do. The things you do in your life trigger responses not only in your spouse but also in you. This is fantastic news because it gives you a choice. You can do things that make you happy or you can do things that make you more depressed. Having this choice saved me from the trauma.No, DB did not save my marriage. But it saved me. I'm a very happy person right now. My ex has given me everything I wanted and I'm doing great things with my life that I never would have done if I hadn't read this book. Divorce isn't so bad when you know how to BE happy."},{"Title":"Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again","review":"....I believe this is an excellent book but it should not be the only source of reference. Wiener-Davis approach is perhaps the best approach when the situation has reached such a crisis level. In my opinion once the situation is out of crisis then a long term approach should be used to follow-up. Which is why I rate this book an 8 rather than 10.While I am currently going through a divorce, my wife used as her explanation of wanting a divorce, &quot;YOU DID NOT MEET MY EMOTIONAL NEEDS&quot;. I was comsumed with guilt until I read the SAME QUOATION in Wiener-Davis' book and the reason people use this as an excuse of wanting out of their marriage.DIVORCE BUSTING help me realize that this was not MY problem but my wife's own failure to interject other external activities into her life. With that I was able to arm myself emotionally and was able to confront my wife with the truth about herself and her situation. My wife's inability to turn the mirror to herself and her unwillingness to change and lack of comittment has led her to take the &quot;easy&quot; way out via blame.DIVORCE BUSTING also help save my friend's marriage. But in his case both him and his wife read the book and both decided to make changes. In fact I'd venture to say that their situation was worst. However they both are committed to each other.Another thing I'd like to point out is Wiener-Davis' assessment of counselors. I can attest to this first hand. During the crisis my counselor labeled me as &quot;passive aggressive&quot;. This labelling help &quot;validate&quot; my wife's position. Such labelling only inflames the situation and such labelling is ineffective. For example, is my 9y/o engaged in &quot;passive aggressive&quot; behavior if I have to call his name three time to get his attention. This is the type of ineffective counselling that occurs during a crisis that often assist the other party toward divorce rather than reconciliation.....I highly recommend this book. There is much too much divorce and often times, I believe, marriages can be salvaged."},{"Title":"Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again","review":"I got this book not because I was headed for divorce, but having a difficult time in my marriage as happens to everyone that has been married for awhile. As a married person, I know my thoughts of \\"should I leave this?\\" are not all that uncommon in today's society. I was at a place where I was really asking myself that question. This book was really a lifesaver for me and my marriage when I got it. Michelle Weiner states \\"No marriage is an island\\".Some marital difficulties can be precipitate by happenings outside the marriage. It is easiest to blame the one's we are close to! This book helped me see how I myself often pointed accusational fingers at my husband, when I was truelly not always the one willing to work on things. I often blamed him when other areas of my life were not going well. My relationship has actually improved greatly for the better since I read this book which was six months ago. I was able to view Michele's philosophy that all marriages are salvagable, and most are worth saving. I saw mine that way.

Weiner-Davis's quick-fix approach sounds good on the page, but in truth it just doesn't get to the bottom of any problems. More often than not, ignoring the problem seems to be the rule of thumb here, and that will just build resentment when nothing is really resolved. Also, Weiner-Davis succumbs to the very easy gender stereotypes that are so prevalent in the _Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus_ series. Basically, she says men are this way and women are that way. If you like the _Mars/Venus_ books and think critical analysis of a couple's problems is just fine, however, you'd probably like this book.

Her helplessness is what reminded me of this wonderful book which I read more than 15 years ago and which saved ME and allowed my spouse and I to save our marriage. In fact, it began a journey that changed a great deal about how I look at life and what I understand about the power each of us has to control our feelings and reactions, and make helpful choices in a crisis.I won't go into detail because others have already covered most of that. I will say, however, that the lessons in this book are universal and can be applied to any relationship. Each of us is responsible for our feelings and for our actions and going through life depending upon or allowing others to determine how we feel is a recipe for misery.If your marriage is confusing, shaky, destructive, unpleasant or at a \\"dead end\\", or if you are feeling that it's all \\"just happening to you\\" and you are powerless, this book is an excellent resource.

I firmly believe marriage is a long term committment; it ebbs and flows. I came to realize that divorce is made so easy in a Western country. Many don't take marriage seriously like where I came from. Marriage vow, morarality, honesty, loyalty, faithfulness and committment are not valued in a modern society.

It seemes to have greatly helped some people, but in some instances, could make a bad situation much worse.I have been in counseling for about 5 years and have worked very hard to address my problems and change some of my distructive behaviors by confronting my own issues, and was hoping that my husbands behavior in turn would change by my &quot;setting a good example&quot;. Unfortunately, as in my situation, one spouse may be trying to change and grow while the other spouse may be unwilling or in denial of their own problems (do to fear of change, which is common for alot of people, but especially people with controlling personalities). And using the &quot;one person can change a marriage on their own&quot; theory in a marriage situation such as mine can make a bad situation worse. My spouse has a very controling personality and so, over time, my boundries became all but non existent.With alot of therapy I finally got to a point where my self esteem became strong enough to rebuild my lost boundries. For me &quot;acting as if&quot; as recomended in this book (I have pretty much done this my whole life due to controlling parents) is what got me into a mess in the first place. I don't know any other way to put it.What bothers me most is that therapists are sometimes using this type of marriage therapy without fully understanding a couples marriage background. This is what happened to me. My husband and I went to a marriage counselor and he started with the &quot;focus on what works and not what dosen't&quot; concept and told me to buy this book. Fortunatly, I was working with my personal counselor on the issue of SETTING my boundries at the same time we started seing the &quot;Divorce Busting&quot; counselor, and I could clearly see the serious problems (in some cases) with the advise in this book, for my marriage.I'm sure that this book has helped alot of people judging by some of the other reviews. Unfortunately, I believe it could be VERY bad for others. I don't usually comment on books and realize this one is lengthy, but I do want to warn people who may be in a situation similar to mine.God bless anyone trying to save their marriage and greatest good luck to you :)Elayne wife and mother of 2 from California"},{"Title":"Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again","review":"I was amazed at the ease of implementation for the techniques.

While attending marriage councelling, my ex and I were told to read this book. I had already been the one all along to change for my partner, and this book had me do that again. Against my better judgement, I changed again to effect a change, in the hopes of saving my marriage. It suggested to try something different, anything different. I say, if you are the one who has already become the chameleon, and the other person wishes to change nothing, you are working with a brick wall. All my changes did nothing, even initiating sex with him after two years resulted in the distinct feeling of being raped. No, I recommend being very careful."},{"Title":"Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again","review":"The author repeats her ideas everywhere. Personally, I believe that if a person has truly decided to divorce no one can change his mind. This book may help those on the fence. If nothing else, the ideas might help a person deal with the marital problems and divorce."},{"Title":"Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again","review":"As with most books, the author tends to repeat ideas. The ideas are great. If you want to read this book efficiently, just skim the second half for anything interesting. The main ideas are much the same."},{"Title":"Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again","review":"This book is written from the perspective of a psychologist who uses a good method. The ideas of SBT are practical and effective. It focuses on observable behaviors rather than psycho-babble about imaginary internal processes and personality types. If the marital problems are behavioral in nature, this approach can get results.The book is well written and well organized.I especially like Chapter 7 about taking responsibility for your own happiness. In many cases, avoiding divorce is impossible, but this advice at least makes it easier for spouse who is being divorced.My one big criticism is that many divorces these days are because of affairs, not because of real marriage problems. Unilateral \\"No Fault\\" divorce became the law in most states over 30 years ago, and divorce is so easy that people do it for many reasons other than escaping bad marriages. Adultery is not only legal but politically correct, and anybody who has an affair with somebody who is younger, sexier, or wealthier than their spouse can quickly and easily divorce their spouse to \\"upgrade\\" to their new partner. \\"Irreconcilable differences\\" is just a legal fiction in most cases. If your spouse is divorcing you because of an affair rather than because of true marriage problems, then using psychology to try to avoid the divorce will just create frustration and waste your time. And don't believe the divorce-industry propaganda that affairs are a by-product of marriage problems that just happen by themselves.The story of George and Alicia in Chapter Six shows the book's lack of insight into adultery-based divorces. These are two people whom the author says were both married when they met and had an affair before divorcing their respective spouses and marrying each other purely for sex. Then -- Surprise! -- they had trouble trusting each other after they were married for a short time. It should be obvious that two dishonest people who cheated on their former spouses would cheat on each other as well or at least suspect each other of cheating, that divorce is a near certainty for a marriage between two people like this, and they deserve to reap what they sow. But Weiner-Davis instead tries to do some SBT therapy with George to save that pathetic marriage at least for a little while. SBT probably would not have helped the former spouses of George and Alicia.If your spouse really wants to divorce you to be with somebody else and became 100% decided upon it before you became aware, techniques like SBT probably won't work. But still this book might have some useful ideas."},{"Title":"Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again","review":"I found this book very helpful in understanding what I can do to make things better.

This is all about making money off of hurting people that will buyanything to give them hope. Total rip off that does NOT work. Go to her site for proof."},{"Title":"Divorce Busting: A Step-by-Step Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again","review":"If there were a 2.5 stars selection I'd give it to this book.Average in nature, it gives a reader a common sense approach, step by step, as the title touts. It is divided into three sections, first the \\"nuts and bolts\\" of the approach to helping the marriage. The second section tells the reader that communication is key and breaking the bad habits that you've made in your marriage. \\"Change yourself to change your marriage\\" is the premise. The third section primarily tells the reader to keep going with those newly formed habits and questions the reader \\"is working on my marriage working?\\" It gives a basic real world look at the union for the reader to decide if they want to keep the union together.The first section is an absolute snore, I'm a psychology major and it bored me to death. I read on, hoping it would become more interesting. Lots of clinical jargon that didn't even interest me with my college background, I studied that years ago. Not considering my jaded point of view from my studies in my opinion the average reader would not be able to wade through the clinical language and concepts presented.It tells briefly some statistics of how marriage affects children, even into adulthood. The children feel as if the marriage falling apart were their faults and it haunts them for years to come. By using scare tactics such as that it apparently urges the reader to keep the union together because of the kids but basically in the same paragraph negates itself, telling the reader to not keep a loveless marriage in tact \\"just because of the kids\\".That being considered the average reader looking for marriage advice would put the book down less than halfway through the first section. It explains the concept of Solution-Oriented Brief Therapy, a \\"quick fix\\" type therapy that focuses on the end product of what would like to be achieved rather than focusing on the path that caused you to be where you're at. My thoughts in reaction to that is for the reader to put on rose colored glasses and focus on the end product rather than the things between A and B.The second section of the book is slightly more interesting although no real brain power needed. It's the basic advice you'll find in any marriage counseling book or website. \\"Communication is key\\" communicate to your spouse using \\"I\\" statements so that it's non-confrontational. It does give some case studies showing the different dynamics for couples with the same problem, thus showing that not every couple is the same and won't have the same \\"fix\\" for their problems.It stresses breaking old, destructive habits that interfere with your relationship. This again is basic advice. Break the old, replace with new, more effective habits. Other advice is to make yourself happy and by that your spouse will be happy. Be kind to your spouse and it will return tri-fold to you, because you're kind the spouse will be pleasantly surprised and return the favor.The third section asks the reader if they feel that the changes have been effective and how they will continue to affect the relationship. Either the book has done one of two things at this point, it has helped and the changes necessary have been made or it's been completely useless and the inevitable answer to that question will be \\"no\\".\\"A particular kind of problem doesn't necessarily lead to divorce; it's the unwillingness to change that destroys marriages\\". (pg 218) Obviously change is needed to preserve a union, otherwise a reader would have never picked up this book. It questions the reader if they've given the changes enough time to work, this goes back to negate the first chapter where it states this is Solution Oriented Brief Therapy, brief being the operative word.Suggestions are made to talk to other people about it or seek counseling from a licensed family or marriage counselor. With that in mind the counselor will be using a totally different technique than that described in the book as it's not widely viewed as effective in the long run.The book offers some parting words, not necessarily a fourth section but included anyway. It offers a congratulations to the reader for actually finishing the book, urges them to seek further help and to keep those positive habits going. It tells the reader to let go of grudges that prevent them from moving forward with the relationship. Bear in mind that a stress point is to keep the reader from \\"going through the motions\\" of fixing things without really trying, obviously that's counterproductive.\\"It reminds people that the vast majority of relationship problems are solvable and the vast majority of marriages are worth the effort required to make them work.\\" Is the final words offered to the reader, it sums up what the beginning of the book explains to him/her.Overall I'd not recommend this book or technique to someone with marital problems, there are far more effective ways to solve problems in my opinion. At least I only paid $4 for it."},{"Title":"Heart Talks with Mother God (Children)","review":"In our society, God is typically portrayed as male. What we tend to ignore is that God is indefinable, a mystery, and not a specific gender. &quot;Heart Talks...&quot; gives us another viewpoint of God- the feminine, nurturing side of God that loves us no matter what-like a mother or grandmother. Beautifully illustrated, the book has 10 Bible-Based prayer stories: &quot;God Birthing the World&quot; (Genesis1:1); &quot;Mother God Watches Over You&quot; (not even one sparrow will fall without God knowing it. Matthew 6:26); &quot;Grandmother God&quot; (Psalm 128:5-6). The adults' preparation guide gives suggestions for making these stories more meaningful for childen- related play activities, questions for reflection and sharing of feelings. Children are invited to jump up in Mother God's lap as she tells them a story from her wonderful book the Bible. As the story and reflection come to a close, they are invited to give Mother God a hug and whisper &quot;I'll be back&quot; as they slide off Her lap. This is a nurturing and comforting book for adults as well. &quot;I'll be back, too&quot;."},{"Title":"Heart Talks with Mother God (Children)","review":"I am catholic & found that this book walks a fine line between what could be construed as Mary-worship or even pagan earth-mother worship but I think it strikes just the right note.

I used it in my first linear algebra course as an undergrad, and also when I taught an introductory course over the summer.I especially like that it has some options, such as details of R^n being presented at the end of chapter two as an alternative to covering those facts in the more general context of \\"vector spaces\\" in chapter 4. It is not especially rigorous as far as proving things, and does not get too in depth as far as computations though there are some good sections on dynamical systems. So if you are teaching a class that is half engineers and half math majors, it strikes a decent balance.For anyone who uses linear algebra, you will not be able to get away with having this as your only book, try Strang or Axler for more computational or theoretical (respectively) treatments. It is definitely a good intro though, it gives a decent overview of the main ideas."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"I really enjoyed learning from this book.

In other books on the subject, key topics such as linear independence and the invertible matrix theorem are merely mentioned rather than focused upon. But Lay states concepts clearly, building technique upon fundamentals to essentially ingrain concepts. However, though for the most part good, this text has its flaws. Linear transformations are tersely covered, and eigenvectors more so, leaving the readers dazed by chapter six. Nevertheless, on the overall scale, this book is excellent and should find a warm nook in every mathematician's heart. Bravo, Lay!

Unfortunately, when it comes to the proof problems, instead of just providing the reader with the answer like most other texts, the author will either mention a hint or refer the reader to the study guide (mine came with a disk which has to be installed on a computer), which could be a problem for readers not familiar with how to do proofs. Serving as a somewhat of a mediator between these two extremes are true/false questions which accompany each chapter in each section of the text. While those start out somewhat fun in the beginning, they can also get tiresome and repetive very quickly. The solutions to these, like the proofs, are not provided, but fortunately, all one has to do is read the text carefully in order to determine the appropriate response."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"This is a very good textbook to learn linear algebra from. It is actually fun reading parts of it! Lay takes great pains to give good examples and plenty of them. The solved practice problems at the end of each section are also very helpful.My only complaints would be that the book spends too little time on linear transformations and the important concept of whether or not they are one-to-one and onto. The book's treatment of change of bases is confusing at times as well. The study guide is also totally worthless."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"Dr. Lay has put out a quality textbook, worthy of a read as well as a series of challenging questions. As an undergraduate physics student at Queen's University, it is often frustrating when the course materials are lacking in study content. This is not the case with this book. The only real drawback to this textbook is the limitation of the study guide that accompanies the book. When preparing for exams, it is often best to review extra problem that were not assigned throughout the year, since it is not possible to confer with the professor or the TA with regards to every question. One must complete this task independently. Dr. Lay's student guide an excellent reference pertaining to the problems that it contains solutions for, however some the challenging study questions require a more in depth analysis than is provided.

The computational problems are good for learning the algorithms but the true/false questions represent what you need to know.After working through them and justifying your answers you turn to the back of the book and look for the correct solution but instead you find something like \\"Check your answers before referring to the study guide.\\" Unfortunately the study guide is sold seperately so many people, including myself, choose not to buy it, nor should we have to. It makes the author seem like he cares more about selling book then teaching students.I took Linear Algebra as an online course and there it is even more important that the material in the text is learned from the reading, as there is no physical lecture to supplement it. I would be more understanding if the author included just the answers in the text and left the justifications for the study guide, but to plug the study guide instead is just plain irresponsible."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"The organization and the treatment given to most subjects are well below what one would expect for a Wikipedia entry on each respective topic.Anyone who uses this book for any kind of self-study is unlikely to get more out of it more than a few examples on multiplying matrices, row reduction, and some poetry about eigen-spaces and vector spaces.Take a look at \`\`Linear Algebra Done Right'' by Alxr."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"This book is probably one of the best math books I have ever worked with.

Overall a good introduction to the subject and an excellent refresher for those seeking one.A few notes on the study guide - it would be more helpful if more problems were worked out. Also, some of the theory that I would expect to find in the text is only in the study guide."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"I used this book to teach myself linear algebra using a lesson plan developed by a teacher. A few things I found really helpful:Lay constantly admonishes the reader to carefully study the text, by reading and re-reading. He understands that students learning linear algebra are likely to to be embarking on more abstract/advanced mathematics in the future--and he cares enough to teach good study skills as well as math. I've followed his advice, and found that with proper effort, I am able to teach myself.Many of the questions are conceptual or True/False, which helps me to retain new concepts.The study guide (sold separately, but very important if you're self-teaching) only includes answers to odd-numbered exercises. However, the answers are nicely detailed.I especially appreciate that Lay refuses to flat-out offer answers to conceptual and True/False questions. Instead, there are hints and references to page numbers where helpful information can be found. This is important, not only because it (again) helps reinforce good study skills, but it encourages students to really try a problem before giving up and looking up the answer.The introduction of new concepts is always followed by one or more examples, which helps to link theory to practice. In general, there are many examples that illustrate good problem-solving techniques. Proofs are detailed and well-justified, and there are some simple proofs that are left as problems in the book. These proofs are simple enough to not be terribly daunting to the student who is new to more abstract mathematical ideas.For the student who would ask, \\"well what is it good for?\\" there are plenty of sections dedicated purely to applications of material learned in previous sections.Detail-oriented methodical learners like myself should benefit from this book."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"I used it in a linear algebra class when I was an undergraduate at Cornell.

This d____ed book goes out of its way to make things confusing, causing too much memorization, and intertwines what a vector space is with matrix operations. It really does not have to be this confusing. Further, the guy does not teach you how to do proofs, but then requires you to do them in homework. He doesn't teach you where to start from, or what to think of when doing a proof. Linear Algebra is a tough class to begin with. It is known to be abstract and theoretical. Lay does not need to make an already challenging subject more challenging by presenting it in such a confusing way. Thank God I had to drop last fall.

Examples of linear algebra in economics and engineering help solidify these concepts. However, the book does not cover several types of matricies. For example, an assignment involved a population-change question involving Leslie matricies. Unfortunately, the Leslie matrix is not covered anywhere in the book. It would also be desirable to have a summary of the Invertible Matrix Theorem. Instead, the various parts of this theorem are scattered throughout the book. Otherwise, however, this book serves its purpose well- as an introduction to linear algebra.More advanced students will want a text with more thorough coverage."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"This text is a dream to read compared to many other mathematics texts. Lay's writing style is clear, and he rightly stays away from using wording that distracts the reader from the theory he presents. Mathematical notation is introduced before it is used, and proofs are placed in an appendix.Overall, this is a very good book for undergraduate study. It won't carry you through graduate classes, but it might be useful as a support book if you have a weak background in the topic. Math majors who love concise formalism and extended proofs should stay away from this book. Engineers, business, physical science, and social science majors will find the text very helpful."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"This is one of the better linear books that i have seen so far.The examples are great and the illustrations give a good reprensentaions of complex mathematical thougt.

I would reecomend this book for students studying engineering and buissnes but a longer, more challenging issue for mathematics students"},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"First I must say that i have not taken any other course in Linear Algebra then the course I took with this book. Further, I must say I am reviewing this book with the perspective of someone who is major in mathematics with the possible eye to graduate school in the subject.However, regardless of my lack of exposure elsewhere, I have started to read other books in the topic, and I had the benefit of having a very formal instructor in the class I was in. This book seems to be the standard for the non-honors 2nd or 3rd year Linear Algebra course.I have several problems with this text. My first is the fact that it is quite informal in organization. The course I was taught in asked more theoretical questions in exam and lecture and was attempting to imprint, in the student, a sense of understanding more so then the 'intuitive' or 'common sense' perspective that was displayed by Lay (a good example of this is Lay's \\"geometric\\" paradigm of Linear Algebra which he conveys throughout the book).I have several problems with this book,1. The book is not versatile in its display of the material. What I mean by this is that the book uses a very algorithimic method of introducting theorems and topics. I must point out also, that it operates almost exlusively in the finite vector space setting. I believe the student does not get the full grasp of the power of Linear Algebra to be applied to more things then vector spaces. Hence, the appropriate use of the book is nesscairly limited to those classes that teach students whose sole aim is to understand the applications of Linear Algebra, and not the topic itself.2. The excercises were trivial and laughable as preperation for the exams I took. I do not lay blame on my instructor as I have heard that this book was adequate for a number of other sections in my university. However, I must add that the questions I was asked, in my opinion, truly tested whether the student understood the theory and thus the nature of the subject. Yet, I found it very unfortunate that neither the excercises nor the exposition were at all adequate for preperation for my exams.3. My final problem with the book is the nature of its organization. I can't say how many times the book proved something using induction or some other constructivist method when it could have been proven using far more eloquent techniques and would have been able to convey deeper principles and thus greater understanding of the topic. Again, I know this is true, becuase the instructor conveyed these alternative techniques to us in lecture, thus I was able to see both perspectives.I do not want to be completely biased in this review (although this is the nature of reviews in general). The book has several good points, one of which that it does come with an excellent student manaul, that does contain well written solutions to the odd problems. Further, the solution manaul is moderatly priced (less then $20.00 USD). Also, the book contains many problem sets, which may be appropriate in some classes, but not so much in others (I realize this is a dependent on instructor temperment).In conclusion it would have been faulty on my part if I had given this book less then 3 stars, because as stated above, it is probably appropriate for many classes, however, in my exposrue to the text, in my circumstances, it failed miserably, thus I believe, the book has failed in my case and probably many other cases similiar to mine."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"This book is one of the worst mathematical texts I have read. When I told my student counsellor so, he said \\"thank you\\".The book is bad for mainly two reasons:1. If you are an engineer, or want to learn the material just for the applications, and not to practice your mathematical skills. Then the book can be very frustrating. Many proofs are left as excercises and the material is scattered widely. I think its better that the text coherent, and that the book has good excercises.2. If you want some depth this book is not for you. There are too many trivial problems and examples and the book could be compressed to less than half of its length.The proofs are not the best. If I remember correctly some proofs are based on the algorithm of solving systems of linear equations, instead of quite simple use of definitions.It also emphasizes on the wrong things.Despite of its length it does not cover so much theoretical material. And Lay doesn't give a picture of how important some of the concepts are.I also find it a bit strange that Lay includes two almost identical chapters... one about R^n and one about finite dimensional vectorspaces. The thing is that all finite dim. vectorspaces have the structure of R^n. And R^n is a finite. dim VS.The only positive thing is that it gives a pretty soft introduction, and its not so hard-digested."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"covers 75% of the detail and leaves the 25% up to you. it lacks clear explition is vector space secotion (row col vector nul basis etc). it seems like you do the first coumple of sections not understanding what you are getting at but when you get to chapter 6 or so the past stuff finaly makes sense.

He explains everything very clearly and concisely. This would be a good book for someone interested in Linear Algebra to read. The exercises are not simply computational, but he makes sure you understand the theory behind the math as well. The odd answers are in the back of the book, and on some of them he will give you hints instead of the answer itself. The one problem I had was that sometimes the exercises did not follow from the examples in the sections, but those were few and far between. Another thing: there are quite a few proofs as exercises so if you are not familiar with math proofs you may want to look at a book dedicated to proofs."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"Many people may say what they want about this book. They will say that it was confusing or it presented proofs that could have been presented better. I have used this book extensively and have read it and done problems in it. The problems range from easy to very difficult. This book tends to be proof-oriented and problems within the text require students to construct logical arguments demonstrating some nontrivial fact (a proof). The author is condescending at times, placing the usual phrases like \\"it is eacy to see\\" within the text. My main problem with the text would have to be lack of depth in the explanations. Lay is purely abstract for the most part and doesn't want to use geometry or other didactic techniques relying on intuition, perhaps. I have heard of another text in linear algebra that does this. However, Lay isn't trying to make anyone an overnight expert. The text is probably reflective of his personality; he is stuffy.I can understant his lack of emphasis on geometry though, assuming that the student has had only one calculus course. I would have to say this book gives you a fine education on the subject, but it doesn't attempt to give you a first-class one. I don't think first-class means more stuffy, but what I mean is more instructive in the underlying philosophy of the subject and its relations to Calculus."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"I think David C. Lay does not try to help the student with this book. Instead, he wants the student to work for the solution. This is fine some of the time, but not all of the time.

The examples are inadequate for the problems in the book and the solutions guide always says something really helpful like, &quot;Look in your textbook for the answer&quot;. I like Linear Algebra, but I don't like getting the run around when I get lost. I am using Elementary Linear Algebra by Ron Larson and Bruce Edwards as a supplementary text and it will be the book that I keep after the course is over.

He's a great professor and a distinguised scholar-teacher at the University and really knows how to convey the material well.But I think the professor is a better instructor than the book. This isn't an insult to the book, because he's an excellent professor.I've seen reviews for this book that were pretty unfavorable. Some of them were just reviews, some unjust. People need to realize that this book is just an introduction to Linear Algebra, it is a book for lower level undergraduate mathematics. This course is equivalent to a freshman calculus course; it is mainly to teach you to do calculations and apply them. Some of the reviews treat this book as if it were for some upper level class like Abstract Linear Algebra (which is a much tougher course and requires a deeper book).But for what it is, the book is clear in most cases. But like people mentioned, the Invertible Matrix Theorem is scattered about the book but never summarized. There are a few tough exercises, but 98% of all exercises in the book can be completed via the examples given in each chapter...just like a freshman calculus text. I don't think the book is a hard read, it's pretty easy in fact, but it won't really help you out much to prepare for proof-oriented classes like Number Theory or Advanced Calculus. This book will benefit engineers more than it will mathematicians. The true/false questions themselves are not too helpful in my opinion. The answers to these are vague and refer you to the study guide (which in turn are not direct answers, but more like indirect answers and probably a cheap way to plug in his study guide). The study guide itself will contain 1/3rd of the odd answers in the book and are clear to read and will review some of the chapters' key concepts in different wording. But most math majors probably won't need this study guide. The study guide is mainly for students who won't be majoring in math (I.E. computer science, physics, engineering, etc.).The book doesn't go too much into proofs. Most of the proofs are trivial to prove, so there is no need to really have an entire chapter devoted to developing proof skills. However, most students taking this course have no idea of what a mathematical proof is. This book gives a bad impression of what a proof is. The proofs in this book mostly deal with \\"DE' = AC --> D = ACE\\", which is just algebraic manipulation. Any student hoping to jump into a proof oriented class using this book will be sorely lacking. But let's give the author credit. He never intended this book to prepare students for that \\"next-level\\" of mathematics (I.E. writing rigorous proofs). His intent, and I've had this professor, was mainly to teach linear algebra in a way that would draw students towards mathematics and see how the world of linear algebra is an exciting one. For this, I think he's done just that."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"I used this as the textbook for an undergraduate course in Linear Algebra.

I attribute getting an 'A' in that class to this text.One word of advise however... the study guide for this text comes in handy at numerous points of the book. It's not needed, but strongly advised.

It suffers from many of defects that all Linear Algebra texts at the level suffer from these days. The first Chapter introduces the concept of linear independence without suitably introducing vectors. Linear transformations are also introduced in this chapter, again without the proper tools to deal with it. Another topic in this Chapter is the solution of systems of Linear Equations. The treatment of the case where there is more than one solution is totally and hopelessly inadequate. The method used to generate the solution does nothing but confuse the students.Chapter 4 is far too laconic. The treatment of projections lays no foundation, does not connect it with eigenvalues but just jumps into orthogonal bases. It is difficult believe that anyone would guess that orthogonal matrices are important from the information given in this book. The treatment of least squares is too sparse.The treatment of Linear Transformations is extraordinarily lacking. The treatment of the kernel and image lead no place. There are insuffient number of examples and relation to geometric concepts.Unfortunately, almost all new texts in this field are just as bad."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"I am currently about a week away from completing a course in which we've used this next (the THIRD edition). I cannot express enough the unbelievable level of quality and attention to instruction that has been put into this edition. I cannot speak for previous editions, and from some of these comments it doesn't sound as those past versions of the text are anywhere near as good as the third edition.For what it's worth, I strongly suggest that anyone needing a secondary text for a linera algebra course consider this book. It may be pricey, but there's no way I'm letting this one go after the semester is over. It's going on my shelf and staying there!This book has more visual, geometric interpretations and depictions that you'd ever find in another book, and what's more it's actually concise. You don't get 10 pages of explanation when one or two will suffice. Concepts are continually reinforced and re-examined, not to mention built upon. You will continuously be presented with the links between chapters and concepts, and this is one of the book's greatest strengths. When you get to see how it all fits together, it sincerely improves the learning experience. The subject matter becomes not 7 distinct chapters of abstract methodology, but instead 7 parts of the same story. You'll know why you're doing things a certain way, and when you read the material in chapter 5, for example, you'll fully and readily understand why you learned chapters 1 thru 4 first, not to mention how the material there fits with the ideas in later parts of the book.Previous reviewers were right, you sincerely can injoy reading parts of this text, if not all of it. The examples are painfully clear even to the uninitiated. I honestly believe that if you cannot learn from this book, there is no hope for you. Take it from me, I'm not a math person at all, and yet I'm getting an A in the course thanks entirely to this book.Following lecture I've gone home, cracked open the text and been able to do the entire homework assignment without taking a single peek at my notes from class. The instruction and examples in the text are truly all that you need to work the problems. Yes, it's THAT good. Proofs abound, but they are easy to follow and really help to enforce concepts and the inter-relation between ideas. I dare say the proofs even help you remember why certain definitions are what they are, rather than the sophmoric method of memorization.This book is a steal at twice the price, do yourself a favor and check it out. Please don't be influenced by poor reviews of the previous \\"hardback\\" edition, because the new third edition is nothing like that others have commented. Judge for yourself, skim through it a bookstore first or whatever, but don't pass this up just because some halfwhit that failed the course decided to run his mouth on amazon (see below)."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"Lay presents here a basic textbook on linear algebra. Topics covered include matrices, determinants, vector spaces, eigenvalues &amp; eigenvectors, and orthogonality. As a student of economics, I was happy to see that a few of the applications of linear algebra presented are related to economics and statistics (the Leontief Input-Output Model in Chapter 2, for example).When I first encountered this book in an undergraduate matrix algebra course, I found it to be quite accessible despite my liberal arts background. More recently, since I have been a graduate student, the book has proven to be a decent reference for the basics of linear algebra, although I wish it covered projections in more detail -- particularly non-orthogonal projections.From an economist's point of view, I would sum this book up as follows: it covers enough material to address linear algebra concepts needed in a first-year graduate microeconomics course, but not enough for a first-year graduate econometrics course."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"Filling a book with applications is no good when you compress the theoretical material. This book, although nice on the application side, falls short when the going starts to get rough.This book has chapters that are not even worth reading, like the chapter on Eigenvectors and Linear Transformations. In general, the explanations are so short or lack demonstrations to a point where you end up memorizing theorems (a demonstration is not a paragraph in cursory English saying \\"blah, blah, as we saw previously, blah, blah, blah.\\" If you doubt me, do that on an exam and see what the professor writes in red ink, later). Is that what you want ? The serious student will then waste his/her precious little time trying to fill in the gaps with other books. I'm not even talking from the standpoint of abstractness and rigour. I'm just saying explanations are lacking.A reviewer said some problems are hard to do with the text, and 98% are done by rote. This is correct. The \\"hard\\" problems are hard because the book is lacking in abstraction. Another reviewer said this book will please engineers more than mathematicians. I feel this is correct too. Applied mathematics students should also avoid this book. I don't think this book prepares you for \\"the next level\\", where you'll be working with real problems. I don't see this book preparing the student for computational linear algebra, and I don't think there's nearly enough matrix theory here. Also, I think the book has that American textbook style where things are broken into small pieces and fit into nice-looking boxes and the text tends to loose its flow and you tend to loose the conections. It's not a good writing style for my taste.It's kind of like a Calculus book. They lie to you first, and then they teach you \\"Advanced Calculus\\" and \\"Analysis.\\" Personally, I don't like that approach, because I think it's a time waster. And, you might not get a second chance to ge it right as an undergraduate (this is true for engineering students at my institution).Quickly immerse yourself in \\"Matrix Analysis and Applied Linear Algebra\\" by C. D. Meyer and avoid this book; or, another great book (and everybody says so, because it is), Gilbert Strang's \\"Linear Algebra and Its Applications.\\" The virtues I see on this book are carefully chosen illustrations that help to convey meaning to the theorems by geometric aid and the intertwined applications \\"appetizers.\\"All in all, though, it'll do you more harm than good.

The book lends itself to a variety of majors, whether math, econ, physics, business, etc. as there are a number of good examples.My biggest gripe is with the answers in the back and the answer/study guide. I'm sorry if Dr. Lay's students are too lazy to actually do the work and reading and would prefer to look in the back, but christ allmighty, please provide the answers *and* reasons for the answers for T/F questions. If the T/F questions are important enough to include in virtually every section then don't you think we should have the answers? The answer/study guide is virtually worthless. Look, I played the game and plunked down the extra bucks for the study guide, so would you please give me the solutions? I don't like getting the run-around if I don't understand something. Using the guide is like something out of a monty python skit. So for these reasons the book gets rated down a star."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"Chances are you are a university student in need of a linear algebra textbook. Great news! This older version is exactly the same as the newer version in every which way. If the new edition is a required text for your class this older edition will save you some cash.

Each section of each chapter is very clear and to-the-point. The examples are helpful and well-placed in the chapters. I attribute getting an 'A' in that class to this text.One word of advise however... the study guide for this text comes in handy at numerous points of the book. It's not needed, but strongly advised. Other than that, the book is great! I only wish that I had a calculus book that well written."},{"Title":"American Portraits: Biographies in United States History, Volume I","review":"To understand the history of America, it is necessary to know about some of those who were the movers and shakers. However, to achieve a complete understanding of the forces that made the United States what it is today, it is also essential that you know about the lives of some of the lesser greats and of the more common people. A few of the essays in this book are about the greats, only three of the nineteen essays in this book are about historical figures at the highest level. Those essays are about Christopher Columbus, Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall.Lesser, but still significant historical figures covered are Daniel Boone, William Penn, Tecumseh, Sam Houston, Harriet Beecher Stowe, John Brown, Nat Turner and William T. Sherman. Nearly unknown people also included whose lives illustrate how the country was built are Anne Hutchison, William Byrd II, Phillis Wheatley, Frances Wright, Mary Richardson Walker, Elizabeth Blackwell, Emily Lyles Harris and James T. Rapier.All of the biographical profiles were written by historians with a knack for effective exposition. They describe why knowledge of all these people is important. My favorite essay was the one about William T. Sherman, a man who truly understood the phrase \\"total war.\\" He was one of the very few people who understood that the way to completely defeat a modern nation state in a war was to utterly devastate the country. While his methods were considered brutal, his goal was to destroy infrastructure rather than kill people. His tactics went a long way towards destroying Confederate morale, by scorching the Earth he let all Confederate citizens know what their fate would be if the war continued.I really enjoyed this set of essays, while most of the information about the major historical figures was not new to me, it was written so well that I enjoyed reading it. The background on the lesser figures illustrated the struggles these people had as they went about their lives."},{"Title":"Geriatric Urology","review":"Exception research methods utilized with much input from leading practitioners.

The book looks at the role that its education system played in raising a highly literate and educated workforce. We get a history of education that well predates World War 2. In fact, most of the book is about education in the prewar period.After the war, we see the structure of the primary, secondary and tertiary components. There is no discussion about the severe workloads and pressure often incurred by students in primary and high school. Granted, the system worked wonders. But there was indeed a human cost, including suicides, that the book completely ignores."},{"Title":"Cults and the Occult","review":"Overview and PurposeThrough careful analysis and research Edmond Gruss provides an introduction to most of the major cults, and the occult. He gives a brief history of the origins for each movement and their founders. He exposes their distorted doctrines as erroneous by comparing their \\"authoritative\\" writings with the Word of God. Attention is also directed to the alluring tactics these subtle deceivers use to gain converts. In most cases Gruss discusses how to deal with people who have been deluded by these false teachers and how they might be freed from cult and . Resources for further study are provided.Gruss's main purpose is to prepare evangelical Christians for the work of evangelizing people who have become involved in a cult or the occult. He desires to inform readers of the teachings of the leading cults and the occult, equipping true believer in Christ to meet the challenges presented to the truth of the Word of God. Gruss says \\"It is now time that the cults were confronted as never before by the evangelical church\\"(9).Critical EvaluationGruss successfully fulfills his purpose. He mostly uses the writings of the organization, or a proponent of the movement, to conclusively show its teachings, making it difficult to deny. Gruss's clear communication of the essential points is his greatest strength. It is difficult to understand why the Masons, a cult that leads people into the occult, is not included in a book about cults and the occult. Wicca is also strangely neglected. This book is useful for gaining an understanding of most major cults and forms of the occult, refuting their teachings with scripture, finding resources for deeper study, and practical advise on how the lead those involved to trust Christ as Savior and Lord."},{"Title":"Cults and the Occult","review":"The book is good.

Sunday worship is the Mark of Satan's authority (the counterfeit to God's true Sabbath), therefore making it the \\"Mark of the Beast\\". It was created by the Roman Catholic Church in 321 A.D. (by Constantine) and all those who keep Sunday are unknowingly following the Catholic Church (the \\"Mother of Harlots\\") and the \\"Dragon\\" who controls it. This is the truth!! Edmond C.

His most famous book was the 1879Progress & Poverty 4TH Edition; this book was written in 1883. He notes, \\"My endeavor has been to present the momentous social problems of our time... without that abstract reasoning which some of the principles of political economy require for thorough explanation. I have spoken in this book of some points not touched upon in 'Progress and Poverty,' but there are other points as to which I think it would be worth the while of those who may be interested by this book to read that.\\"He begins by stating that \\"A civilization which tends to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a fortunate few, and to make of others mere human machines, must inevitably evolve anarchy and bring destruction.\\" (Pg. 8) Democratic government can exist only \\"where wealth is distributed with something like equality... The man who is dependent on a master for his living is not a free man.\\" (Pg. 15) Furthermore, although there are some mental and physical differences between men, \\"we already have men hundreds of millions of times richer than other men.\\" (Pg. 51)He states that \\"the capitalist is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist.\\" (Pg. 57) But George would put no limits on acquisition: \\"Let him do as he pleases with his own, without restriction and without suggestion. If he gets without taking from others, and uses without hurting others, what he does with his own wealth is his own business and his own responsibility.\\" (Pg. 87) The functions of government should be restricted to those necessary to the common welfare. (Pg. 171) \\"It is not the business of government to make men virtuous or religious, or to preserve the fool from the consequences of his own folly.\\" (Pg. 173)He summarizes, \\"The main source of the difficulties that menace us is the growing inequality in the distribution of wealth... In a society where the equality of natural rights is recognized, it is manifest that there can be no great disparity in fortunes... But, in a community where the soil is treated as the property of but a portion of the people, some of these people from the very day of their birth must be at a disadvantage... Our fundamental mistake is in treating land as private property.\\" (Pg. 194-195) He proposes, \\"All it is necessary to do is to abolish all other forms of taxation until the weight of taxation rests upon the value of land irrespective of improvements, and take the ground-rent for the public benefit.\\" (Pg. 208)George's ideas were often viewed as an alternative to 19th century Socialism; and even some modern conservatives (e.g., William F. Buckley) are fans of his ideas---particularly the \\"single tax\\" proposal. His writings were ENORMOUSLY popular in his own day, and the fact that he has modern followers (e.g., The Robert Schalkenbach Foundation) attests to the continuing vitality of his ideas."},{"Title":"Social problems (The complete works of Henry George, v. 2)","review":"This book is worth your time.

The author uses humor, rarely if at all lectures the reader, and tells it like it is. This book is light, full of stories to help get the point across, with simple language and very little beating about the bush. Only in the last chapters does Vine Deloria, JR. get serious and that deals with Indian leadership and how Indians should deal with problems in the future. Of course we are in the future, when compared to when the book came out, and I wonder how the book will be updated, if ever, in the future.

I expected (mostly from other reviews here on Amazon) that it would be pretty offensive towards caucasians (like myself). In reality, it is a strongly opinionated editorial that frequently criticizes whites, anthropologists, and wanna-be-Indians. But I was never offended. Maybe this ruffled a lot of feathers when it was published in the 1960s, but in 2010, I think most whites are comfortable with the notion that minorities have a lot of complaints to voice.To that point, I think this book is a little dated. Certainly many of the issues raised here have not been resolved, but the book is 40 years old. Even the revised version is over 20 years old. While the book provided a lot of insight, I also found it a bit long-winded (surprising for how short it is) and repetitive. It certainly will turn off the more casual or merely curious readers.For my own purposes, I would rather find something more contemporary, written by someone born after Deloria first published this book.

Custer Died For Your Sins is contaminated by hyperbole and racial generalizations. Mr. Deloria (our esteemed author, contemporary of George W. Bush at Yale University) says, for example: \\"The future does not look bright for the attainment of such freedom because the white does not understand the Indian and the Indian does not wish to understand the white.\\"Mr. Delorian says: \\"When one examines the history of American society one notices the great weakness inherent in it. The country was founded in violence. It worships violence and will continue to live violently. Anyone who tries to meet violence with love is crushed, but violence used to meet violence also ends abruptly with meaningless violence.\\" I say: What country wasn't founded in violence? Does America really \\"worship\\" violence? Is it true that anyone who tries to meet violence with love is crushed? And which part of violence used to meet violence is meaningless violence? I'm an American. But I don't and never have \\"worshiped\\" violence.Mr. Deloria says: \\"White culture destroys other culture because of its abstractness. As a destroyer of culture it is not a culture but a cancer.\\" I say: This is the sort of inflammatory and incorrect generalization I'm speaking of.Mr. Deloria says: \\"The white man has the marvelous ability to conceptualize. He has also the marvelous INABILITY [my emphasis] to distinguish between sacred and profane. He therefore arbitrarily conceptualizes all things and understands none of them. His science creates gimmicks for his use. Little effort is made to relate the gimmicks to the nature of life or to see them in a historical context.\\"I say: Arbitrarily? Really? Must I respond to this?Mr. Deloria says: \\"White solutions fail because white itself is an abstraction of an attitude of mind, not a racial group or reality. The white as we know him is an amalgam of European immigrants, not a racial phenomenon. But the temptation has always been present to define groups according to their most superficial aspect.\\"I say: OK, you get the idea. An outdated, badly argued, divisive, clumsily composed polemic in the fashion of the protest handbook of the sixties. We're in the second millenium now, people. We can stop calling each other names. We are all the SAME race. There is one extant species of Homo Sapiens on earth.

He writes well, but is very inconsistent and many of his comments about whites, Christianity and The Church are nothing short of bigotry. Too many people confuse Deloria's quips and sarchasm with intellectualism. He is far from being an intelectual."},{"Title":"CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR SINS","review":"I love this book because of it's toughness. It's not a book on theory, or history, or excuses for a situation. Granted, it covers some history, and offers a little theory here and there, but the focus is action - what needs to be done, and how does it need to be done? The book is extremely well written, and the ideas a thoroughly thought out. It's an excellent example of a well laid out argument."},{"Title":"CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR SINS","review":"Vine Deloria's work is very important because he publicizes the concerns of Indians in the modern world. The stereotypical warriors on the plains or peace pipe-smoking chiefs have as much in common with modern Native Americans as powdered wigs and pantaloons have with modern White Americans. Deloria also convincingly contends that it's now useless to dwell on old evils of conquest and colonialism, and we should instead focus on the real problems faced by Indians in the present, especially poverty and ineffective government programs, and even insulting know-it-all anthropologists. After so many centuries of struggle, modern Indians deserve to be heard through a hard-hitting and knowledgeable statesman who holds no punches and tells it like it is. That's why Deloria's writings are so crucial. Unfortunately, his initially strong philosophy breaks down in the details, due to a writing style that is heavily dependent on hyperbole and generalization.Deloria rightfully contends that such errors are at the root of misunderstandings about Indians, and racism in general. But he does the exact same thing when analyzing White culture, society, and religion, revealing his own lack of understanding about the people who he (accurately) accuses of a lack of understanding. One example among many here is \\"He [the White man] arbitrarily conceptualizes all things and understands none of them.\\" This review forum does not allow me to list out extensive direct quotations, but the alert reader will find nearly continuous examples of this type of generalization about another culture, amidst Deloria's complaints about the same being done toward his culture. Another issue is that Deloria often reminds us that Indians are astonishingly diverse in their opinions and outlooks on modern issues. This could not possibly be untrue by any stretch of the imagination, though when Deloria starts arguing against White conceptions, he can&#8217;t (or won't) avoid lumping Indians back together with blanket statements like \\"There is usually not the slightest difference in what the tribes want for the future.\\"I'm not presumptuous enough to state that this type of writing should be condemned as reverse discrimination, or praised as fighting fire with fire. More opinionated people than me can decide such things for themselves. But when a writer can't stop doing what he accuses his opponents of doing, his arguments are sapped of credibility and believability. This is unfortunate because Deloria's basic contentions are crucially important both for his people and for the betterment of America's multicultural realities.

You've got to be a part of the world Deloria describes to understand the humiliation and insults Indian people, especially on Reservations, face daily. Let me give you one example: How many of you don't own the land your house sits on? Ask a Reservation Indian and you will find that many, if not most, have \\"houses\\" sitting on \\"federal\\" land.Deloria just scratched the surface. A talk show host correctly gets fired for using a racial slur involving black women. A university donor is hunted and scorned (gee, righteous anger is so swell) for using a horrible term. Each day, though, the Braves play ball as the Redskins get ready for their season, and schools across the nation call themselves racial names-or paint themselves up (remember \\"blackface\\" - can't do that anymore) to be an Indian.

An independent Indian is the most dangerous one: To liberals, because they can't use us as their hair shirts anymore and to conservatives because they fear us laying waste to the myth that they are the ones fighting for freedom.

Don't let that last statement put you off if you are not already aware that the people who lived in \\"America\\" before 1492 suffered mightily from European colonialism.The atrocities committed by both sides were horrendous.

Not a perfect man, not one who's right all of the time, but a man who means well, and has done great things for Native Americans. My feelings about Custer Died for Your Sins are similar. It's a good book, this Indian Manifesto, and has the power to do great things, still, decades after its publication. But it's not perfect. If you're a Caucasian reader, you're going to get angry. Parts of the book simply aren't meant for you, and those parts that are, are very inflammatory. This is intentional. Deloria is a master of making people furious, in order to make them think. But it's also intentional, I think, because Deloria is, understandably, himself a bitter and angry man, in many ways. The book's passages on people of mixed descent are good examples. Deloria issues the blanket statement that Native/Caucasian people are, in fact, just White people with a royalty complex. He does this to make you angry, and he does this to make you think; he wants you to understand what you are doing when you claim tribal descent or affiliation, and he wants you to be sure you're doing so with the proper respect. But he's also doing it because he's annoyed, and very tired of White people who don't have said respect. He's making a mistake, though, in his implicit assumption that, somehow, being Caucasian is the default, and that to be a Native, one really should be a wholeblood. The book is also tinged with seeming contradictions (like one chapter devoted to the idea that Indians must solve their own problems because they are and should be responsible for their own lives; and then the chapter on how anthropologists are largely responsible for the problems of the modern Native American, a chapter where tribes play a largely passive role), but most of these are resolved when you consider both the complexity of the issue, and the complexity of the book. All in all, this Manifesto is *not* the place to begin one's exploration of Native issues, but it's one that *must* be read somewhere along the way."},{"Title":"CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR SINS","review":"What impressed me most about this book was its emphasis that imperialistic exploitation is not a dead relic of a past we Anglos are ashamed of and wish to forget. The fun continues, and it makes little difference what we call it: manifest destiny, bringing civilization to the primitives, or new world order.Another point: we've been long overdue for a Deloria-style criticism of Anglos who exploit Indian folklore and beliefs. I refer to those who claim esoteric knowledge from Native shamans and all the rest of it. What such folks, including the anthropologists and social scientists who pretend more objectivity, never ask themselves is: do I have any right to make a profit and gain a reputation from the people I claim to have learned from? What do they get out of it? Does it benefit them or harm them? (The claim that Indian people don't need any kind of concrete benefits because they aren't \\"materialistic\\" is particularly nauseating.)At one point, while contemplating doing some interviews with local Indians about their experience of being blinkered, baffled, and b.s.ed for 250 years, I reread parts of this book--particularly the \\"we want to be left alone\\" parts--and decided that I lacked the temerity even to ask for such interviews. Deloria suggests that no research of any kind be done that isn't approved in council and that doesn't clearly demonstrate some use to the Indians themselves. I would also suggest to other Anglo readers that before they involve themselves in matters indigenous they be very honest about their motivations--particularly where any notions of being \\"helpful\\" might occur. Our \\"helpfulness\\" has been genocidal and even now perpetrates stereotypes, as Indians may tell you if you're genuinely receptive to the feedback.Books like this are a good reminder that the true primitive is he who goes on colonizing others--intellectually, religiously, economically--without having the courage to look at his own dark side as it flourishes in the here and now."},{"Title":"CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR SINS","review":"I think non-Native people tend to forget that Native Americans aren't interested in functioning as symbols. They have lives beyond the tribal dances they put on for tourists. They're forced to watch their religion and culture being appropriated by bored New Age types who want to be cool and hip and profound, and it's hardly surprising if some Indians, like Mr. Deloria, don't view this theft as a compliment. This book, along with the works of Sherman Alexie, represents a part of the Native community that's usually ignored by the mainstream."},{"Title":"CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR SINS","review":"First published in 1969 and reissued in 1988 with a new preface by the author, this is the one that started it all. This book is required reading and you will be tested. Best Sellers magazine says of Custer Died for your Sins, &quot;nauseated by the traditional Indian image, (Deloria) asserts the worth if not the dignity of the redman and blasts the political, social, and religious forces that perpetrate the Little Big Horn and wigwam stereotyping of his people.&quot; Deloria shines his distinctive light on Indian missions, federal relations, Hollywood stereotypes, and community leadership, to name a few. Here began the critique of anthropology to be continued in Indians and Anthropologists, also featured on this website.

While there are problems that I had with the book the fact remains that I enjoyed it greatly as well. When I first read I said to myself &quot;Hey this is great finally a Native American's perspective. Than I looked at the orginal publication date...1969.Thats my only problem while it is witty and funny the issues discussed are at time too far in the past for me to understand. All I have to go upon are my own preconcived notions taught to mein history class. Mr. Deloria on the other hand was right there when all of this stuff was happening and for that reason this bok deserves some serious study.He basically has three main points1. That the programs set up by Whites to help Native Amerixcans have actually hurt them in the llong run(be sure to read his rant agienst Anthropologists and missionaries)2. There are still Native Americans east of the Mississippi(Some readers will not be aware of this even today)3. The Native Americans have power but they are kinda like the Democratic Party they just can't organize(htis hasn't changed much even today)Overall-I loved it, its a good book to see where Native Americans were in the 60s and how things have changed(or not changed) in the lat 34 years."},{"Title":"CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR SINS","review":"This has become a period piece, as both Indians and the rest of North America have changed a lot since this was written in 1970. Though the foreword to the new edition updates it somewhat, significant chunks of the book still come across as quite dated. For example, it was clearly written during the civil rights movement, which shapes many of the issues Deloria discusses.Still, many of his points remain timeless. Deloria is very good at pointing out how many whites patronize Native Americans while believing that they are honoring them. For example, many whites like to claim that they had an Indian ancestor - - almost always a woman, often a great grandmother, and usually Cherokee. (Funny how whites don't make such claims about slave ancestors.) These claims are rarely documented, and rarely true. Many whites like to take on a cloak of Indian mysticism, as we see in many New Age practices. This has little to do with real Native Americans, real Indian religious practices, or real people's lives. Third, Deloria launches a devastating bromide against sociologists, and by implication other social scientists, who descend on reservations to pursue their own professional ambitions without giving anything back to their subjects.Despite making a lot of similar valuable points, the book does not make any real argument. Each chapter is a bunch of ideas, anecdotes, and observations, all strung together. There's considerable inconsistency: on one page, Deloria praises a tribe for getting funding from five different agencies to build some housing, while two pages later he says that Indians just want to be left alone. Being left alone would probably not mean depending on funding from federal agencies.Deloria eagerly criticizes stereotypes but has more than a few stereotypes of his own. He treats all whites as if they were alike, while he treats blacks as if they were all like one another but different than all whites. Latinos exist only as Mexicans, who are treated as all alike. All anthropologists and all Christian pastors or priests are also alike. Obviously, none of these groups are homogenous, and it does not further Deloria's ultimate project to treat them this way.Obviously, I've been pretty critical so far in this review. Yet there's a reason why people valued the late Deloria so highly. He's often very insightful and makes many great points, even if his overall argument cannot sustain close scrutiny. He's also funny, and uses humor very effectively to make his points. My high-schooler and middle-schooler each laughed out loud - - independently - - when they saw this book in my possession, and it sparked some good conversations. The whole book is like that, and would be great for a reading group.I'll finish this review with a question: who is in the position to write a new \\"Indian manifesto\\" today? So much of the writing by and for Native Americans today comes out of the humanities and is concerned with \\"discourses.\\" Deloria, and those he worked with, cared about concrete outcomes - - material accomplishments. Even when he talks about stereotypes, he's less concerned with a racist discourse in itself than thinking about how to get past the stereotypes and help Native peoples. The 1960s and the 1970s were the years of the lawyer and the sociologist, and we now live in the years of the English professor. Are Indians better off for it?"},{"Title":"CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR SINS","review":"This is a great book. Vine Deloria is an interesting author and he brings across good ideas.As for the few people who believe that they hold no responsibility because their ancestors imigrated after 1900, well that's not true. Everyone hold responsibility, because Native Americans are still being mistreated. As late as the last half of century Native women were being sterilized without being told what was happening.Our bones and cultural are being dishonored by &quot;scholars&quot; And all those people who want to help Natives. They treat them like little children. If that's not disrespect...Deloria brings out what so many want to keep hidden.All of his books are worth reading."},{"Title":"CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR SINS","review":"Having frequently come across references to this 'classic' in other books on modern Indian affairs, I finally decided to read it. Very different from what I anticipated, this book is not a rant or the work of a bitter Oglala, but a thorough and very well thought out Indian manifesto, just as it claims to be. Unlike, say, On the Rez by Ian Frazier (which I highly recommend), it is not a quick or entertaining read. It can be exhaustingly thorough at times and I found the references to people and events contemporary to the first printing but very dated now -- e.g., long passages describing why former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall was such a disappointment -- alternately interesting and off-putting. The chapter on Indian humor, however, was well worth having to skim some of the dated stuff. All in all, I highly recommend this thought-provoking book to the serious student of modern Indian affairs."},{"Title":"CUSTER DIED FOR YOUR SINS","review":"A must read book. For all those other readers who have their noses out of joint over Mr. DeLoria's book: get over it. I'm mixed blood and I have certainly seen just about everything that DeLoria documents, and I share his sense of humor about it all. DeLoria is a very funny guy, because laughing is about all you can do in the face of such everlasting prejudice, harm, misery, and profiteering at the expense of the First Nations of America. It's not that Mr. DeLoria is a bitter guy, as some reviewers have accused, it's that the subject matter he has to report is such a black and bitter history that few White people have the guts to look at honestly. Anybody who doesn't like what Mr. DeLoria has to say better don their hip waders and do something about it; because it's the truth and it hasn't stopped -- the Republican 2000 Convention passed a resolution calling for the termination of the tribes. As DeLoria observes in his preface to the revised edition, everything comes 'round again."},{"Title":"Outlaw Culture: Resisting Representations","review":"bell hooks's speaks to us, elegantly, clearly, and passionately about the culture of the margin, about disempowered people and their culture. But even more incredibly, she cuts right through crap, and fearlessly breaks things down for us, articulating truths, hopes and dreams I have never seen discussed anywhere else. bell hooks uses her keen intellect and her brilliant common sense to examine not only the materialistic and physical constraints of racist and sexist oppression, she also identifies the psychological, spiritual and emotional; individual and communal injury and trauma that is experienced. Then, she gives us hope, for revolution, for decolonization, not just of our bodies, but our minds and hearts.Reading bell hooks, for me, is like listening to an incredibly wise and gentle girlfriend, who can both hold your hand, and beat the living hell out of anyone trying to do you wrong."},{"Title":"Outlaw Culture: Resisting Representations","review":"bell hooks does an excellent job in exploring pop culture and its relationship to African Americans.

I have found her work to be very direct and very, very challenging. Resisting Reresentations has done a lot of things to my mind. Although I consider myself \\"in-the-now\\" with ideas on social issues, after reading this book I am left with a feeling of re-birth. hooks speaks of many issues I agree with (and some I am not so sure I swallow completely). These issues and hooks' analysis of them has made me learn to laterally think and critically observe our world. I am a woman who believes in the eradication of sexism on all levels but now I must make my belief the engine to keep the eradication machine existent. Any woman, or man, who needs inspiration to challenge the many institutions that support racism, sexism and captalism start with bell hooks. She forces you to use your brain and think. This is a quality that many intellectualists fail to possess."},{"Title":"Outlaw Culture: Resisting Representations","review":"I've read a few of bell hooks' books and I do think she is a great thinker and writer, however, I don't think this is her best work. Overall, I did like the book, but in places it does seem like she is too defensive about conflicts she has with other famous people. It is a fine line of critiquing others, so I can't say that she was wrong or anything...I just think she undermined herself in some places. Also, this was published in 1994, so it is a bit dated although I would argue, still relevant. I guess I'm only comparing this to some of her other books, so if I was to read this without comparison I would probably think it was pretty right on and daring, because bell hooks is usually right on and daring! bell hooks does what she does best in this book--great analysis in accessible terms. You don't have to be an academic to read this, but it isn't a dumbed-down polemic either. I enjoyed the book and learned a lot.

She cleverly exposes some of the subtle ways in which the powers that be maintain their power, sometimes deliberately, sometimes unwittingly, and she shows how the latter way is the most insidious one and does the most damage.At the same time, hooks is not always true to her word. She demands for herself complete freedom from censorship but in her own way attempts to censor or at least discredit those women who might disagree with her. Second, I appreciate her condemnation of black violence, but following that with a &quot;I condemn, but...&quot;makes one wonder about her true feelings. And in her essay on Columbus, hooks does exhibit her limited knowledge of American Indian issues.

The authors lay out the highly-complicated world of adoption subsidy in a manner that is easy for a novice parent to follow. Chances are your social worker will probably not know much about adoption subsidy or at least won't have it all right so it is crucial that adoptive parents read this book carefully. You can take the information in this book and use it to advocate for your child's subsidy and service rights. The authors also provide important policy decisions and laws that will help anyone who has to go back and fight for subsidy and services after their adoption is complete. I plan to keep this book by my side as I negotiate my own adoption subsidy agreement and I am telling every prospective adoptive parent I know to read it."},{"Title":"Adoption and Financial Assistance: Tools for Navigating the Bureaucracy","review":"This book is the most important investment we made when we decided to adopt our daughters.

It is not a simple biography of Isaiah Bowman, the most famous American geographer of the twentieth century and a fascinatingly anomalous personality, but a well constructed and beautifully written investigation on how the power of geographical ideas affected the U.S. foreign and commercial policies, with strong implications for the understanding of globalization and contemporary geopolitics.Neil Smith elucidates a &quot;missing link&quot; fundamental for the comprehension of contemporary history: the hidden thread that connects American geopolitics from the Paris Peace Treaties of 1919 to that of World War II, up to the creation of the U.N. and the beginnings of the Cold War. The understanding of this continuity is possible thanks to the accurate and in-depth analysis of the key role played by Bowman as advisor for the Department of State and the White House, under both the presidencies of Woodrow Wilson and FDR. In doing so, the author is able also to re-establish the key role of geographical visions in shaping the soon-to-be American hyperpower, throughout the Twentieth &quot;American&quot; Century.Unfortunately, historical perspective and understanding of geographic knowledge seems often to be quite limited in the present world, as most people tend to lose memory of the past or represent it in simplied terms, and generally consider geography little more than something related to &quot;map quizzes&quot;. For these reasons, this extraordinary work not only represents an undisputable masterpiece in historical and geographical research that fills a gap in contemporary history, but it is also a necessary reading for anyone interested in how our not-so-distant past and geographic visions could still underpin the currently troubled world scenario. An amazing work that is bound to last."},{"Title":"American Empire: Roosevelt's Geographer and the Prelude to Globalization (California Studies in Critical Human Geography)","review":"Interesting but not entirely correctThis books is very interesting, there is something special about it, like a tulip in a wine glass. It seems oddly inspiring and intellectual. The authors approach is to look at a hitherto unnoticed subject, that of geographies impact on foreign policy, particularly the creation of an \`American Empire'. The authors opening paragraph explains his thesis. In 1898 McKinley, informed of a Naval victory at Manila in the Philippines, exclaimed that for the life of him he could not find the islands on a map. Thus McKinley was sending America into a colonial war without knowing where the territories were. The author goes on to show how in 1984 Oliver North certainly knew where Iran and Nicaragua were when he arranged the complicated arms for hostages deal. The implication is that America has been transformed into a nation very concerned with geography.A man named Bowman is the culprit, according to the author. Originally serving on the Machu Piccu expedition he went on to serve Wilson to help redraw borders throughout Europe, the middle east and Asia. Then he went on to serve FDR and finally helped in 1945 to draw the new maps of Europe. The implication: That this man was a devout Cold Warrior and obsessed with American empire.But the logic here is not only faulty, the books rambling ideas and coverage of academic shenanigans is simply to far fetched. Someone had to redraw the map of Europe, does it really matter whether or not an American took part? In 1945 someone had to draw a line down the center of Germany. Throughout the 1950s and beyond the world was divided between communism and non-communism but this doesn't have any implications for geography, the world would have existed divided without any geographers, because it was ideas that divided the world. Thus this book could have done more. The author could have looked closely at the sailing of the Exploring Expedition of 1838 and the sailing of the Great White Fleet to understand the implications of American empire. Instead the author relegated his account to an obscure subject that was not entirely relevant. An interesting book, but it does not live up to its potential."},{"Title":"Hosea and Gomer","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. This is the first book I have ever seen written about this particular book of the Bible. It tells the story of Hosea and Gomer as told in the book of Hosea in the Bible. The author wrote accurately in the parts that are also covered in the Bible. She wrote the details very convincingly."},{"Title":"An Old Creed for the New South: Proslavery Ideology and Historiography, 1865-1918","review":"Dr. Smith has done it again. He has covered a complex subject with in depth scrutiny. From that he has produced a work that puts forth a great deal of information in a manner that the reader can easily grasp. If you can't learn history from Dr. Smith, you can't learn history."},{"Title":"The Book of Kings: Part 1 & 2","review":"I was tempted several times in the first 200-300 pages to put this book away. Although I generally enjoy historical fiction, the author goes into painstaking detail of the political and social climate of pre-WW2 Europe. The characters discuss fascism, socialism, communism and every other &quot;ism&quot; fashionable at the time. After the philosophical groundwork has been laid, the book picks up. Although it then takes place primarily during the war, it is not your standard WW2 book. The book remains focused on the main characters. Each of them had envisioned a bright future and the war has changed everything. How they act, what they become and the choices they make are all shaped by their backgrounds and beliefs. The story becomes very readable and the events described are as interesting as they are detailed. This is not an easy book to read, and I had to re-read paragraphs many times. It does offer a great insight into the political and social climate of the times. If James Thackara isn't an English professor somewhere he should be. Finishing the book also made me feel like I deserved some easy fiction...I read the Lion's Game by DeMille after this book and it read like it had been written by a 13 year old."},{"Title":"The Book of Kings: Part 1 & 2","review":"Although I agree with the other reviewers that the prose is awful, that was not my major problem with Mr. Thackara's novel. Instead, I found the behavior of almost all of his characters incomprehensible in one way or another. They have these strange reversals of positions that are not adequately accounted for; misunderstandings arise between them that would never occur if the characters were actually the people that they had initially been drawn to be; instead it seems Mr. Thackara justs molds them at will as necessary to suit his story. Hasty ex post rationales are then sometimes tacked on to explain their behavior.In War and Peace, the echoes of which you can clearly trace in the characters and plot of Mr. Thackara's novel (and to which he himself pays homage to in the words of Baron von Sunda), all of the characters, e.g., Prince Andrei, Rostov, Natasha, Pierre, were real people whom I understood and felt for even when, especially when, they made tragic choices, labored in ignorance or doubt, or when, through great suffering, they were transformed. I did not buy The Book of Kings with the expection of encountering the art of Tolstoy but I did expect to meet human beings who I would care for and empathize with.Beyond his gift with language, Tolstoy is a genuis because he could capture History, Fate, War, Tyrants and Slaughter as well as the blessed uniqueness of the indivudual."},{"Title":"The Book of Kings: Part 1 & 2","review":"I spent $25.00 on a book whose author is not only impressed with his own intelligence, but who cannot even make it interesting. Big in scope, and at times, very well written, it is very hard to wade through a story where the reader is supposed to understand French, know the city of Paris as if they had been there numerous times, and try and understand page after page just what the author is actually trying to say by speaking through boring and troubled characters. A big waste of money and an even bigger waste of time."},{"Title":"The Book of Kings: Part 1 & 2","review":"The first time I picked up this book, I put it down after a few pages-the writing is often very obscure, and understanding it is difficult: but when I tried again I ignored the language when verbose, and became involved with the story itself and the characters. It really is a wonderful overview of the European world as it is swept up in unbelievable evil and suffering. Not told from just one point of view, it shows that noone is perfectly pure, or without ulterior motive, and that alliances are constantly shifting. Ultimately fascinating-and not one graphic sex scene!!"},{"Title":"The Book of Kings: Part 1 & 2","review":"Yes, you do need to know a little French, and you do need a vocabulary of a college grad, but no- this book is not pompous. Romantic? Yes. Grandious? Yes Occassionally tedious? Yes. Riveting? Often. Wonderfully coreographed? Absolutely,especially the set pieces whether it is a dinner party at a German estate or a war battle in Russia. I guess the thing I most liked about this book the most was that it painted a picture of pre- WWII Europe without inserting any late twentieth century sensebilities- excellent social and philisophical commentary. Well worth getting through the 775 pages. Only one unhappy note: it occassionaly degenerates to soap opera."},{"Title":"The Book of Kings: Part 1 & 2","review":"I take issue wholeheartedly with the detractors of this amazing work; This book is a masterpiece, pure and simple. Historically rich, masterfully written, lifelike characters, brilliantly insightful, unique in it's approach, entertaining, powerful, and deep. WWII is no easy subject and does not lend itself to a lightweight breezy treatment. This is a heavy, serious book and as well it should be. Don't read this if you aren't willing to make a committment both emotionally and in time.One quote that exemplifies the authors masterful insight; Paraphrasing, and commenting on the appeasment of Hitler, Thackara writes; \\"Love is blind, and blindest of all is the love of peace.\\" In light of today's events as well as history, this explains an awful lot."},{"Title":"The Book of Kings: Part 1 & 2","review":"The Book of Kings by James Thackara has a great premise: follow the lives of two well-intentioned men--one the spoiled son of a German aristocrat, the other a brilliant political thinker that grew up in servitude to wealthy French aristocrats in Algeria--through 25 years surrounding WWII.Thackara provides some very good insights into many complex issues surrounding the war, in particular how good-thinking people might have gotten caught up in the Nazi (and Vichy) movements, and how others could not prevent the terror from happening. It also provides much insight into the post-war years, and how humanity seemed to learn nothing even in the terrible glare of humanity's worst atrocities.In the final analysis, The Book of Kings fails by being barely readable. The problem here is not one of Thackara being too erudite, but rather one of terrible editing, especially in the mid-section of the book. The front third (the before-war section) is coherent and promising, but very slow. The middle section (during the war) is disjointed, confusing, and frustrating. The final third of the book (post-war) is much too long and quite tedious. The Book of Kings could have been great, but the author and editor failed to tighten up great ideas into a coherent read. Not recommended."},{"Title":"The Book of Kings: Part 1 & 2","review":"If ever a book was in dire need of a strong editor, this is it! Without any editorial experience I could easily slash a good half of this book. But it is the other half that kept me at it. I purchased the book because of the promise of the story within. And the underlying story is wonderful. But Thackara really needs to get over himself! A lot of the writing is utter conceit, literary posturing to be expected from a high school literature teacher/frustrated novelist, not from someone who actually got these 800 pages published. Too bad. It could easily have been a really great book."},{"Title":"The Book of Kings: Part 1 & 2","review":"After having read this book, I must take serious exception to the detractors that have given this book an undeserved thumbs down. It is frankly dirty pool to compare it unfavorably to War and Peace, one of the great historical novels of all times. It is likewise unfair to criticize the author as being full of himself, or unable to write in a manner in which people speak; that is what may be termed style. It is also disingenuous to admire the typeface as the only redeeming quality of the book. How about criticizing Proust as being wordy? That the prose is self conscious adds, to my mind, a kind of period authenticity. Much of the writing of the time was similarly stilted. Look, for example at Paul Scott's Raj Quartet, Robert Musil's Man without Qualities, or Anthony Powell's Dance to the Music of Time, each of which compares favorably to this book, and none gets such an undesrved bashing. Upton Sinclair won a Pulitzer for the Lanny Budd novels with this self-conscious prose and none of the substance herein. Thackery and Trollope were every bit as convoluted. It seems that the critics should cut Mr. Thackara some slack; just sit down and enjoy the journey.The story traces four friends, two principally, through prewar and subsequently war-torn Europe, elaborately staged from drawing-room to battlefield. The prose is indeed ornate, but after all this was a time of demagogues and hyperbole. My sole criticism is that it is far from unexplored country. Like an old silver mine, all the nuggets have been carried away long ago. It is prettty derivative stuff. It is not a new idea that the reality of war makes disillusionment of ideals. Still, this is a story that needs to be told lest we forget. We watch Grand Illusion now, realizing that it is as compelling as it was more than a half a century ago, although the acting seems wooden and it is in black and white. We have not as a society had to face a loss of innocence for some time, and perhaps that is the best reason to read this period piece and be caught up in the hubris of a near forgotten past."},{"Title":"The Book of Kings: Part 1 & 2","review":"This book has its weaknesses, and I agree that some editorial tightening-up could have made it more readable. But that said, I am deeply grateful to Mr. Thakara for this detailed and ambitious journey through the years surrounding WWII from a multi-faceted perspective. His writing style, and the style of his dialogue takes a little getting used to, but it's definitely worth the effort.I disagree that the characters are not believable or well-motivated. They seemed perfectly solid to me, given the times. And more than that, their responses to circumstances which were so destructive to virtually every social, moral and material precedent of modern times were reasonable, if you could call anything reasonable in Hitler's shadow.Things that I particularly liked about the book included the windows into the lives and minds of people with very different backgrounds. Although the main characters were all talented and privileged in one way or another -- they began as a foursome of exceptional university students in Paris from France, Germany, Algeria and the US before the war -- there were many other characters and settings that opened the world of villagers, farmers, military officers and soldiers, aristocracy, communists and other revolutionaries, and diplomats. The glimpses into the self-serving Nazi spiritualism that turned to sexual and genocidal depravity was particularly interesting.For anyone who is too young to have lived through the war, and is a not a historian, this is an exceptional introduction. It is also deeply disturbing. I read it over a few weeks, and while it was hard to put it down, it was also hard to live with the scenes of battle, wanton destruction, and ghastly misuse of political power and military might. If it were not for the ongoing human stories that carried the plot, it would have been unbearable.I highly recommend the book. It's not an easy read, but it's compelling. And despite all these negative reviews, I think it will find it's place among the books that endure and possibly are recognized later as masterpieces."},{"Title":"The Book of Kings: Part 1 & 2","review":"This is one of the worst pieces of \\"literature\\" I've come across. The storyline drags, the characters are completely unbelievable and lack depth and the ethical issues that this time in history obviously brings up go undeveloped. Don't waste your time. My copy has already made it to the recycle bin."},{"Title":"The Book of Kings: Part 1 & 2","review":"I can honestly say that this is the best book I've ever read. The bias I have in my opinion is that I read it while I was temporarily living in Germany. I read the book, and then went and visited the places I had just read about. The way James Thackara used real historical events and people, and then wrote his story around it was brilliant. You won't be able to put this one down."},{"Title":"Jules Verne: An Exploratory Biography","review":"Several books on Jules Verne (1828-1905) have been translated from French into English, including biographies by Verne's cousin (1928) and grandson (1976), and a study of the political themes in Verne's novels by Jean Chesneaux (1972). Now, for the first time, the reverse has occurred: a book on Jules Verne originally written in English has been translated into his native language. Sadly, Herbert R. Lottman's new biography of Verne, also published in France (in a translation by Marianne V&eacute;ron), is not worthy of holding such a distinctive position in Verne studies. Although described by St. Martin's Press on the dust jacket as the first \\"modern biography\\" of Verne ever written, there is a long tradition of writing about the author, not only in French, but in English as well.Lottman offers little literary analysis of Verne's works, and that which is present is cursory and often ill-considered. While the details of Verne's life are more developed, they are frequently marred by the author's determination to indulge in amateur Freudian analysis and to draw often highly questionable conclusions from his biographical data.Generally, Lottman's discussion of Verne's writing is shallow, seldom extending beyond simple plot analysis. There is little evidence that Lottman has personally studied Verne's more than sixty novels and many additional short stories, plays, non-fiction, speeches, and poems. Approaching Verne's books in chronological order, Lottman makes little effort to examine the links between the works or the broader themes and narrative formulae which characterize Verne's oeuvre as a whole. Important issues such as narrative structure, 19th-century ideology, and stylistic innovation in Verne's works discussed over the past few decades by writers and scholars on both sides of the Atlantic are almost totally ignored (despite the fact that the author cites many of these critical works in his endnotes).Lottman does not elucidate the cultural conditions that have played such a large role in determining Verne's literary reputation, nor does he attempt to explain how Verne still remains a best-selling author in this context. His observations on Verne's influence on science, culture, and literature are perfunctory.Lottman does occasionally raise tantalizing questions about Verne's personal life, but despite his subtitle, An Exploratory Biography, many of these points are then never investigated. For instance, Verne wrote to his brother in 1893: \\"You and I both committed an enormous and irreparable blunder; you know which one, without having to be specific. Tear up this letter. But what a life we'd have had, without that blunder.\\" Despite Lottman's dwelling on Verne's anti-semitism, he fails to examine the impact of Jules and his son Michel's different reactions to the Dreyfuss Affair; Lottman is typically content merely to say, \\"it was not the only time a family split over Dreyfuss\\".Instead of using such material as a key to exploring Verne's creative psyche, Lottman chooses to classify him according to a preformulated psychological profile. He sprinkles the book with bits of Freudian analysis, but never fully develops this methodology so that it might lead to a full portrait of Verne the man or writer. Lottman labels Verne an \\"anal\\" personality, whichis used as a catch-all justification to explain such diverse matters as Verne's worries about income and the spendthrift proclivities of his son Michel.With this book, Lottman lives up to his reputation for meticulous attention to detail, although at times he seems to dwell on minutiae. For a nonacademic, commercial writer, Lottman has done an impressive quantity of research, taking advantage of the Verne libraries in Amiens and Nantes. He has thoroughly perused the well-indexed Bulletin de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Jules Verne, a quarterly which, since the 1960s, has published scholarly articles and primary texts about Verne. Extensive endnotes cover twenty-three pages in the English edition, and thirty pages in the French edition.To Lottman's credit, he does follow in the footsteps of many French Verne scholars to correct a number of factual errors that have appeared in earlier Verne biographies, and incorporates much of what has been discovered in the two decades since Jean Jules-Verne's biography. Lottman is much interested in the business details of Verne's life, as might be expected from one also whomakes his living by his pen, and these financial matters receive a full airing. He provides the first thorough account in any English-language biography of Verne's collaborations with Adolphe d'Ennery on turning his novels into plays. On the other hand, Lottman offers little discussion of Verne's occasional collaboration on novels with Paschal Grousset (Andr&eacute; Laurie), or ofthe role played by Verne's son Michel in the composition of the posthumous Voyages Extraordinaires. In the last decade, the original manuscripts have appeared in print, revealing that the first versions published in the decade after Verne's death were extensively rewritten by, and in some cases originated with, Michel.Lottman's prose is generally highly readable and engaging. He has labored to produce what he clearly intends to be the definitive biography of Verne. He has accumulated a wide array of data, but has been unable to synthesize this mass of information in a meaningful way. Lottman's book is especially disappointing because the time is so ripe for an account that would fuse the new biographical discoveries about Verne with the many insights of recent Vernian literary criticism. By analyzing the strictly material side of Verne's life, Lottman has neglected the creative talents and the well-springs of imagination that produced the fiction for which Verne is remembered. Those readers seeking to understand the reasons why Verne is one of the most widely translated and enduringly popular authors of all time will find little explanation in this biography."},{"Title":"Jules Verne: An Exploratory Biography","review":"Jules Verne has been one of my favorites authors since I first read his &quot;Journey to the center of the earth&quot;. Combining the prophetic scientifical ideas and the masterly skill of a storyteller, Verne never fails to astound and fascinates his readers.Although not an &quot;juvenile&quot; any more, I still from time to time grabbed one of his books from my bookshelf and regaled myself with his captivating voyages. I always wonder how can a man have all those great ideas; are they derived from his imagination or his industrious study on science?Now Lottman's book partly answers the question and solves the mystery of Jules Verne, whose public image is often out of accord with his real life. Lottman's research, including a lot of Verne and his family and his friends' correspondences, is detailed and authoritive.Many anecdotes are interesting. For example: the idea of &quot;Twenty thousands leagues under the sea&quot; was first suggested by George Sand! In his youth, Verne exceled in Greek and literature but his scores on physics and chemistry were often poor. And, many books of Verne are influenced by Hetzel, Verne's book publisher, whose opinion often changed the plot of the whole story; captain Nemo, whose identity had been originally a Pole sworn to revenging the russia, but due to Hetzel, was finally changed into a Indian prince.However, this book does not make one truly &quot;understand&quot; the character of the founding father of SF. Intending to be objective, Lottman does not judge Verne but only lists all relating facts that, after a lot of exhausting descriptions, we sometimes still do not know the true character of Jules Verne and many strange incidents about him: why should a cousin(Gaston Verne) shoot his uncle(Jules Verne) and make him lame for the rest of his life? What's really wrong with Jules Verne's son, Michel Verne? We read a lot of scathing reprimands about the latter from the former's letters but still don't know the reason. Was Michel Verne really a prodigal or had he commited some horrible crime, which must be kept a secret?In spite of the weaknesses mentioned above, Lottman's biography still deserves reading, especilly for those longtime Verne's Fans. Though the master's life is still an enigma, this book at least shed some light on it."},{"Title":"A Maid's Friends and Fantasies: Devlin O'Neill's Short Stories","review":"i also enjoyed this book very much and couldn't put it down after I picked it up.

Be ready for multiple uses of 'gina to describe the vagina. Cute, isn't it? Not really.Particularly unworthy of publication are the stories addressed to \\"you,\\" although the \\"you\\" is not the general reader. There is a reason why basic writing classes advise against this direct discourse, and that is because it seldom works.Frankly, I am quite annoyed with myself for wasting the time and money.

Annoyingly, these women (and I emphasis women) act like spoiled children just for the benefit of being punished. Adult women speaking as if they infants is really insane. The refering to female genitial as 'gina is a total turn off!!!!!!! I felt as if I were reading the contexts of a wannabe online BD/SM chatroom.

My therapy since then has been simple but (so far) effective: whenever I feel the least bit thirsty, I fill up a jumbo plastic 32 ounce cup (acquired from a local fast-food restaurant) with water and down the entire contents over the next half-hour or so. I may spend the rest of the day in the bathroom, but I haven't gotten a kidney stone since.For those who want more information about possible therapies (and causes) of kidney stones, there is this book, which provides an excellent overview of the numerous types of stones, what causes them, and what can be done about them. There is strong encouragement to confront one's doctor to make greater efforts to diagnose causes along with information on just what these efforts should be. One key chapter covers what one should or should not eat, which is again divided according to types of stone. My only quibble is that an occasional looseness in terminology causes confusion: generally a stone is referred by type, which can include calcium or oxalate. However, at a couple of points, there is a reference to a calcium oxalate type. I have no idea how that fits in with the other types.But that's a very minor point. Overall this is an excellent book and absolute must reading for anyone with serious kidney stone problems (i.e., who has gotten more than me!)."},{"Title":"Kidney Stones Handbook","review":"I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

The book explains what a stone is, the 5 most common chemical risk factors, common questions/answers, and many other things. Most importantly, it tells you steps to take to prevent another stone. Anyone who has suffered through this horror will appreciate knowing how to keep it from happening again. It is also an excellent book for the friends and family of stone sufferers.

Martyn Lloyd-Jones: Romans: An Exposition of Chapter 10. Saving Faith. Edinburgh: The Banner of Truth Trust, 1997. ISBN 0 85151 737 4. xi, 400 pages. Finely bound hardback with illustrated dustjacket.The late Welsh evangelical preacher Martyn Lloyd-Jones delighted in what he termed the \\"exposition\\" of the Scriptures. By that he meant returning week by week to a selected passage and examining it verse by verse, phrase by phrase in order not only to establish the meaning (that would have been mere dry exegesis) but also to apply this meaning to his hearers (and readers). His thirty-five expository sermons on Romans 10 preached from May 1963 to May 1964 and printed here are no exception to the rule: In his first sermon, Lloyd-Jones carefully explains the context of the chapter, seeing it as a kind of extended commentary on the last verses of Romans 9 (which he had expounded previously: seeGod's Sovereign Purpose, 9:1-33 (Romans Series)). Then he offers an overview of the whole chapter before launching into a detailed analysis. But if that sounds dry and technical, just read on into the next chapter which, in my opinion, is worth the price of the whole book: Lloyd-Jones there examines the whole question of \\"zeal\\" and lists a number of extremely valuable tests by which true zeal can be differentiated from false zeal. And so on in the whole book: careful exegesis is combined with powerful application, making this volume both a mine of information and an invaluable source of edification for the Christian believer. Following Paul, Lloyd-Jones goes on to discuss the nature of true righteousness; the content of saving faith (namely the Biblical message about the death, resurrection and Lordship of Christ); the conditions of saving faith (belief from the heart and public confession of salvation); the missionary charter and the position of those who have never heard the Gospel; the calling and the message of the Christian preacher; the relationship between 'hearing' and 'obeying'; reasons for the rejection of the Gospel by the Jews; and last but not least, there is a tremedously important chapter on the danger of dead orthodoxy and resistance to the Holy Spirit among evangelical Christians.Not all Lloyd-Jones's sermons are equally meaty or of equal value, but I suspect that even his weaker messages contain a good deal more spiritual nourishment than most of what the average Protestant, at least here in Europe, gets to hear on a Sunday morning. And some of the chapters here are real eye-openers. I warmly recommend this book to all who are interested in a thorough acquaintance with the teaching of the New Testament and of the Apostle Paul in particular.

It's odd seeing Gaia working together with Oliver/Loki. It's amazing how quickly he has gone from good guy to bad guy. I also thought it was fun to see the escape methods in Siberia. This book was slightly different from the other ones, which is what made it so good. Ed's still leading Kai on, which is really mean of him to do, and Gaia's a walking pile of confliction between Oliver, Jake, Sam, and a lot of other things. This book didn't have as big a cliffhanger as most of the other ones have had, but that's fine with me! The thing that kept me on the edge of my seat is the wondering about Oliver slipping back into Loki, which is the biggest threat so far! I do reccommend reading \\"Before Gaia\\" if you read this because knowing some of the information and characters in it can help you figure out who has kidnapped Tom."},{"Title":"The Mind Of Jesus","review":"Dr. Barclay's Mind of Jesus is fantastic!

He follows the Gospels very closly and adds so many things that only a historian of imtimate knowledge of the times that Jesus lived in would know.

The subject for each chapter is clearly addressed and presented so it can be used for discussion by the small group.In a few places the author is a bit eclesiastical but that is the exception rather than the rule.

He doesn't yet fully understand everything and we had to stop and explain a lot to him, but it is something that we plan on reading over and over again as our kids continue to grow.I read a review that stated that a main flaw in this book was the lack of one on one relationship with Christ. I can understand what they are saying, but I think what you have to keep in mind is that while we are here on earth and in our day and age we do not physically see Christ. He was once here walking and living on this earth, but He is now in heaven. He uses other means now to maintain a personal relationship with us. For example, we can know Christ through His word and through prayer. Just as in the book, He often also sends other Christians along in our life to help us and encourage us. This book is a good example of a walk of faith. We can't see and physically touch Christ right now, but when we are in heaven we WILL see Him just as Bunyan talks about in the book. Christian persevered in his walk without physically seeing Christ and he was rewarded in the end for his faith.

[July note: Penguin is again listing it as current!] Most of my comments are specific to this edition, and a few other closely related text editions.Back in, I think, the early 1970s, I was taking a course in seventeenth century English literature, and encountered a library copy of Roger Sharrock's 1960 Oxford English Texts edition of \\"The Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which is to Come,\\" an immensely impressive editorial treatment of the famous allegory of the Christian life, but fairly expensive, and, I think, out of print. (There was a revised printing in 1975; it seems to be out of print for now.) Sharrock's edition was intended as a revision of a 1928 edition by J.B. Wharey, but it broke new ground in Bunyan studies. It returned for its base text for Part One to the first edition of 1678, drawing on the second (also 1678) and third (1679) editions only for Bunyan's additions to the text. (For Part Two, published in 1684, only its first printing has any claim to authority.)This decision was based on the recognition that printing house practices had rather quickly denatured Bunyan's highly personal, colloquial, and even regional (Bedfordshire) English, turning it into what typesetters thought of as acceptably genteel, beginning as early as the second printing. The progress of textual corruption had continued through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, despite several attempts to provide scholarly editions. Close study of Bunyan's other, rather extensive, and generally less frequently printed, writings, helped to establish a clearer idea of his use of English, as against that of the printers. For the first time in centuries, Bunyan's most famous book was available in (almost) exactly his own words, as nearly as possible as he had set it on paper. Since Bunyan's vocabulary and style of punctuation reflected the speaking voice of an accomplished preacher (the \\"crime\\" for which he was imprisoned for twelve years), this almost amounted to restoring the correct meter to a poem long printed with incorrect versification.Fortunately, or so it seemed, Roger Sharrock had also edited a very slightly modernized text, without the full critical apparatus and notes, for the Penguin English Library (1965). It was not readily available at the campus bookstore, and the student-oriented stores in the area were already being replaced by chains, but there was a religious --- excuse me, a *Christian* -- bookstore in the neighborhood, which had a good selection, and generally well-informed and helpful clerks. I was bemused to find an unfamiliar member of the staff, who was quite enthusiastic about the King James Bible, in what is in fact Elizabethan English, but dubious about an unmodernized version of \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" The book's language is almost a century closer to us in time, and it claims only to be the work of a \\"Tinker and a Poor Man\\" (as the title of American editions of Christopher Hill's biography reminds us), not divine revelation. Still, she assured me, an original-spelling edition of it would be just \\"too hard to understand.\\" Surely I would be better off with one of the many nice adaptations or retellings? See the children's' section. (I had a sudden image of a special angel assigned to each and every copy of the King James Version, to supply linguistic information to its readers, lest they go astray over the unfamiliar words and grammar, but decided not to confide this to the clerk, who was trying to be helpful.)In the end, it turned out the Penguin English Library edition was unavailable; I eventually found a used copy, years too late for the course, but worth having. I don't find Bunyan an edifying guide to the religious life (see below), but he is in many ways an appealing human being, and a remarkable writer, the author of the last great medieval allegories in English, which are at the same time among the first modern novels.In 1986, however, Penguin reissued Sharrock's popular edition in the Penguin Classics series, and even gave it a revised edition in 1987, as well as a splendid new cover (from William Blake's illustration of a scene in the book). In the meantime, the Oxford text as such formed the basis of a World's Classics edition, edited by H.N. Keeble, with a new introduction, helpful notes, and a chronology of Bunyan's life based on the latest research (1984). That edition went through a number of printings, and was reissued in slightly larger format when the World's Classics line was revamped as the Oxford World's Classics. Keeble's edition has just been replaced by a new version by W.R. Owens, likewise following Sharrock's critical edition, but restoring a few more (specified) first edition readings which, in Owens' view, make sense as they stand; I have reviewed this last separately.It should be made clear that I have written this review as a reader with an interest in seventeenth century English literature and history, and a concern with the combination of realism of style and incident with a narrative of marvels and adventures. As far as what John Bunyan considered most important about his work, I am probably a less than ideal reader. Although coming from a secularized Jewish background instead of an Orthodox one, I tend to agree with David Daiches that the Pilgrim, Christian, seems to spend far too much time worrying \\"What must I do to be saved?\\" in the World to Come, and too little asking \\"What ought I to do?\\" in this world. Still, I find Bunyan's sincerity, and willingness to work out the implications of his theology, impressive in their own right."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"This book is truly a literary classic! Although written over 400 years ago, this allegory of the Christian life is still relevant today. It still speaks to incredible depths of the Christian experience, the struggles as well as the joys. You'll feel the emotion of &quot;Christian&quot; as he encouters a number of characters, all named for their particular life experience.I have read this book 4 times in the last 10 years, and plan to again this year. Everytime I pick it up my relationship with God is strengthened. I have also refered to it many times in conversation.

I guarantee it!"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"This is super thick to me. It is pretty simple on surface, and fun to read. But diving into each of the characters and their virtues/vices has kept me up late since I received the book. Lots of personal questioning, lots of views that I hadn't considered. I strongly recommend."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"I can't pretend to understand the historical milieu from which this book arose, or the theological underpinnings that led to its writing. Instead, I come to the book as a modern and secular reader, trying to learn more about Western thought and literary tradition. Despite its archaic language and sometimes tedious preaching, I found my time well rewarded. The familiar aspects showed me as much as the unfamiliar ones did.Among the unfamiliar ones, I was struck by the pervasiveness of the religious sense in Bunyan's world. Seemingly ever action was seen in terms defined by religion. It almost appeared as the sole source of light in that world, without which nothing could really be seen, and tinting everything with its own color. Likewise, the literary tool of \\"morality play\\" naming sounded odd to my modern ear. Writers still use names in many ways, but characters names like Hope, Atheist, or Mr. Money-Love come across as heavy handed. Perhaps that mechanism helped in a semi-literate society, where subtlety of reading could not be counted on; perhaps it acted as a short-hand, invoking values shared consensually across a fairly homogeneous society.More familiar aspects of the storytelling also struck me, possibly because of their contrast to the ones no longer used in modern writing. Christian's journey, for example, has been copied repeatedly and in many variations by writers ever since. Not just allegory for seeking, it provides a natural way to expose the protagonist to a series of other characters and challenges, and foreshadows some destination for the story. The \\"journey\\" has been refined over the years since Bunyan and rarely takes such a central spot in more recent texts, but I enjoyed seeing it in this relatively pure and primitive form.In itself, 'The Pilgrim's Progress' holds only slight interest for me. As an historical document, reflecting the religious sense of its time, and as an ancestor of modern writing, I found it fascinating.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"This book was packaged in a plastic rap which was very nice as I am giving it as a gift to my Pastor and his wife.

Rich in Biblical theology, it is the best-known allegory of the Christian's life. It tells the story of a pilgrim named Christian as he walked a journey from the City of Destruction (where he lived before his conversion) to the Celestial City (an allegory of heaven), sharing with us the many challenges, obstacles, comfort, and encouragement Christian encountered in his long journey. This book reminds me that I, too, am walking in a similar spiritual journey as Christian did.When I read of Christian passing through the Valley of Humility and falling into the Swamp of Despondence, I'm reminded of those times when I, too, was in such a swamp and valley, and how God graciously used those trials to humble, comfort, and rescue me.The Pilgrim's Progress reminds me and encourages me with the Biblical promise that regardless of what deep valleys I may be in, whatever swamps I fall into, whatever rough roads I tread, whatever rivers to ford, or whichever steep hills I may be climbing in my own life journey ... my Guide is ever watchful, my Deliverer unfailing, and He is indeed faithful in keeping and persevering all of His elect in the faith till they arrive to their final destination at the Celestial City--that glorious, everlasting City that is so different than the one I've traveled from and \\"built not by the hands of man.\\" Every Christian can learn and be encouraged from the Biblical doctrines taught in this story."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"I give this book away every chance i get $$$ enough to do so.The first time i read it i was amazed at how i was on this adventure and it was changing the way i thought of things.and how it influenced my dreams was amazing as well; being that the story is a telling of a dream, made me even more in wonder.than i read it a second time and could not believe the amount of detail that comes out of this little book. if you know your Scriptures you will see them jump off the pages and here they are with visual application.If you don't know Scripture and find it hard to understand what The Bible is saying, here is a story that puts it in perspective.I love this book and can now understand why it has been so poplular for so many many years.i will read this book again and again as medicine for my soulHigh five for John Bunjan"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"This past year in school my class studied &quot;Pilgrim's Progress&quot;.

Perhaps a bit too widely. While the book itself is stunning, having seen, heard, or read so many attempts to imitate it, I found that the original effect of the story was lessened for me.By all means, this book should be read -- it is in itself a great work of literature, and it is a prime example of Puritan thought. Be aware, however, that much of it will seem trite and worn -- not because of anything inherently wrong with Bunyan's writing -- primarily because we have all heard so many poor imitations that it will be difficult to put them aside.However, this book still warrants a reading for the simple fact that it is a great story!

The price was very competitive and it made a great gift to a dear friend."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"Pilgrim's Progress is without a doubt one of the true classics of time--an allegory that has remained a best seller years after its introduction.My first introduction to Pilgrim's Progress was as a child in parochial school. I had to do a book report on it in 5th grade and ended up reading numerous times for various projects throughout grade school.The reader follows the main character--aptly named &quot;Christian&quot;--on his journey to the Celestial City.Along the way, Christian passes through the many trials of life, symbolized by intruiging characters and places along the way. An early temptation is the &quot;City of Destruction&quot;, which Christian narrowly escapes with his life. The various characters are perhaps the most fascinating portion of the book--Pliable, Giant Despair, Talkative, Faithful, Evangelist, and numerous others provide the reader with a continual picture of the various forces at work to distract (or perhaps, encourage)Christian on his ultimate mission.Of course, the theology (for those of the Christian faith) of Pilgrim's Progress is a constant source of debate, the book is nonetheless a classic of great English writing.It's not a quick read--that's for sure--however, I certainly would recommend that one read it in its original form. Don't distort the beauty of the old English language with a modern translation."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"In this classic work, John Bunyan paints a detailed picture of the Christian life/walk, giving true-to-life insights and experiences. The despair, sorrows, trials and temptations that a believer may face are depicted in an allegorical manner, as well as the hope, joy, and salvation found in Jesus Christ. The main character Christian (once named Graceless) sets out on a lifelong journey from the City of Destruction, where his family disowned him, and encounters many persons and difficulties along the way to the Celestial City (heaven). The characters he meets are given names that reflect their mindset or what temptation they bring. At times he stumbles and at times he perseveres, but all by the grace of God. The second portion of the book tells of the conversion and subsequent sojourn of the wife (Christiana) and children of Christian. The discussions of Christian in the first part and Christiana and her companions in the second part are very interesting, as they defend their faith and explain their purpose to those they meet along the way. The book is quite different from your ordinary novel, and has many interesting words of wisdom for the Christian life. Readers should be aware that some of the language is antiquated and has unfamiliar usages, so its a little bit of an adjustment to read."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"A letter to Marvin Minsky about this book:I urge you tolook at a remarkable book by the English Puritain John Bunyan(1628-1688), \\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\", which is one of the great evangelical Christian classics, though clearly that is not why it interests me and should interest you (although I AM interested in the puzzle that is the religious sense, which even the irreligious feel, and this book can give remarkable insight into that as well).Rather its fascination lies in the pilgrimage it depicts, or in the fact that human traits, vices, virtues, &amp;c are PERSONIFIED as particular individuals who are their living and speaking epitome, and who are encountered along the way in revealing situations.Bunyan's hero is appropriately named Christian. Someone once wrote that \\"Christian's journey is timeless as he travels from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City, meeting such characters as Pliable, Talkative, Giant Despair, Evangelist, Worldly-Wiseman, Faithful, Ignorance and Hopeful.\\"At first this personification is merely amusing, even a bit annoying (as caricatures or truly stereotypical people can be); but after a while I found myself enthralled because I realized that the effect of this odd literary device was to give unmatched insight into the nature of such traits. The force of the whole thing comes from the fact that one journeys about in - literally INSIDE of - what is both a comprehensive and finite moral and psychological landscape (a \\"psycho-topography\\"), very much as though one were INSIDE the human mind and your \\"Society of the Mind\\" was embodied in the set of actors. This is more or less the opposite or an inversion of the \`real world' of real people, who merely SHARE those attributes or of whom the attributes are merely PIECES; in \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\", by contrast, the attributes are confined in their occurrence to the actors who are their entire, unique, pure, and active embodiment, and humanness, to be recognized at all, has to be rederived or mentally reconstructed from the essential types.The effect, for me, was something like experiencing a multidimensional scaling map that depicts the space of the set of human personality types, by being injected directly - mentally and bodily - into it by means of virtual reality technology.So Bunyan's book has something of the interest to a psychologist, neuroscientist, or philosopher that Edwin Abbot's \\"Flatland\\" has to a mathematician.I don't mean to overpraise \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\", of course; it was written for theological rather than scientific purposes, and has conspicuous limitations for that reason. But its interest to a student of the mind who looks at it at from the right point of view can be profound.- Patrick Gunkel"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"I have to admit that I've never been a fan of Pilgrim's Progress. Despite the fact that I usually like all sorts of folk art and corny stuff in general, this ham-fisted allegory just seemed too weird---too kooky.Yet Edward de Souza's *reading* of the text turns the thing into a work of art. I'm a voracious consumer of audiobooks, and I have to say that De Souza's performance for Naxos here is the best I've ever heard. The dramatic pause---almost as if perhaps he's thinking up the name---just before he tells you the goofy name of each new character, turns what I used to consider the most annoying aspect of the book, into the most charming instead. Bravo.And it's not just this book. From the opening strains of the fine, authentic 17th century music, you're at once made to know that Naxos has thankfully brought the art of the audiobook out of the dark ages. I have bought a few Naxos titles and found each more impressive than the last. Great job."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"I just purchased this item. What a delight it is.

No other book has ever sold as many copies as this one, save one Holy Bible. And there's no wonder why. It's timeless. If you don't mind reading seventeenth century literature, please pick this book up and read it. The first part of the book is an allegory of one Christian on his journey from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City. Forsaking all he knows, all he owns to take a blind leap of faith into the unknown, Christian meets with many trials and tribulations. The second part of the book for me was just as good, as a matter of fact, a bit more touching as I had standing water in my eyes in a few places. I won't go into detail what happens in the second part, but it was quite pleasant for me. Who would I recommend it to? Heck, anyone who likes to read will not waste there time on this one.

I highly recommend David Suchet's reading of this endless tale."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place where was a Den, and I laid me down in that place to sleep: and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream. I dreamed, and behold, I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back. I looked, and saw him open the book, and read therein; and, as he read, he wept, and trembled; and, not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a lamentable cry, saying, &quot;What shall I do?&quot;In this plight, therefore, he went home and refrained himself as long as he could, that his wife and children should not perceive his distress; but he could not be silent long, because that his trouble increased. Wherefore at length he brake his mind to his wife and children; and thus he began to talk to them: &quot;O my dear wife, said he, and you the children of my bowels, I, your dear friend, am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon me; moreover, I am for certain informed that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven; in which fearful overthrow, both myself, with thee my wife, and you my sweet babes, shall miserably come to ruin, except (the which yet I see not) some way of escape can be found, whereby we may be delivered.&quot; -John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's ProgressPilgrim's Progress, though hardly anyone reads it anymore, is one of the best-selling books of all time and was enormously influential for several centuries; in fact, we are still living under its influence. However, like Dante's Inferno, it has passed out of favor in recent years, not because of its pedantry and antiquated style, but because much of its message is simply too harsh for the tenor of our times.The narrator relates an allegorical dream in which Christian, having received knowledge that his city is to be destroyed by heavenly fire, leaves his wife and children and sets out on a quest for salvation which takes him to the Celestial City. In the Second Book, his wife, Christiana, and the kids follow. In their travels, they must pass through such places as The Valley of Humiliation and Death, the Slough of Despond, and Vanity Fair, and must resist the blandishments of folks like Ignorance and Hypocrisy. Ultimately, all of the pilgrims do make it and enter through the gates of the City, saved by their unbroken faith.It's easy to see why the story was so popular. First, it's an exciting tale of adventure; one reviewer aptly refers to Christian as a Protestant Indiana Jones. Second, it is triumphant, with Christian overcoming all the odds to arrive in the Celestial City, nor is there ever any real doubt that he is going to succeed. Bunyan, who had become a Baptist preacher after a lifetime of tormenting dreams and struggles with doubt, wrote the story (and an autobiography) during two periods of imprisonment, one lasting twelve years, for holding services that were not in accordance with the teachings of the Church of England. Especially in light of the author's circumstances, he expresses a bold certainty that Christian's path is in fact the path to Heaven.But it's here that we see why the book is no longer popular. Start with the idea that God's judgment is coming and that most of us face the fire this time. Then add in the concept that Christian's are embattled by temptation and the sinners around them, and that many will succumb. Top it all off with the notion that it is only by following in the Pilgrim's footsteps that you can attain salvation, that everyone else is doomed to Hell. These aren't exactly the humanistic, inclusive, permissive doctrines which inform modernity are they ?But there's one crucial tenet of Nonconformist Protestantism which Pilgrim's Progress captures and which is both the religion's greatest gift and worst legacy to modern times : the primacy of the individual. John Bunyan experienced the struggle for faith as an intensely personal battle and his protagonist, Christian, likewise makes his pilgrimage alone. It shocks our sensibilities for him to abandon his family and friends to their fiery fate, but such is his desire for &quot;eternal life&quot; that abandon them he does. Here lies the two-edged sword of the radical Protestantism of the 16th and 17th centuries, for if it is true (and I think it is) that this emphasis on the individual in religious matters also spread to economic and political matters and brought about the concurrent rise of protestantism, democracy and capitalism, it is also true that this emphasis on the individual, if unchecked by morality, ethics and institutions, leads to the complete atomization of society and a cult of selfishness which undermines the very free society that it creates. Personal freedom has been the greatest engine of progress that mankind has ever known, and it has been generated in large part by the Protestantism of which Bunyan was a part; but that same freedom, if torn loose from the laws, responsibilities and moral precepts out of which it grew, becomes mere license. The individual, though paramount, is not sufficient. Freedom, though vital, is not everything. In particular, extreme individualism and liberty are inadequate ideals around which to build a civil society.Christian's pilgrimage conveys the message that faith is the most important quality we bring to our approach towards God. As theology, this doctrine of &quot;salvation through faith alone&quot; is harmless enough, and for all we know it is absolutely correct. But in organizing Man's affairs here on Earth, we have to emphasize works as well as faith--works which manifest themselves in following the law, accepting one's responsibilities to one's fellow men, and behaving morally. Otherwise, come Judgment Day, God won't have to smite us with heavenly fire, we'll have destroyed ourselves already.Bunyan's book, besides being a rousing adventure tale, should be read both because of the influence it has exerted in shaping the modern world and because the issues it raises, of individualism and the like, are still just as important today, when they have gone to far, as they were when he was writing, and they had not come far enough. It is a brilliant, though flawed, work, one who's impact on English Literature and Western Culture can not be overstated.GRADE : A-"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"Pilgrim's Progress is an important religious work, and should be read for that reason alone. It can be heavy going at times because of the moralizing and preaching that goes on throughout, but in spite of that there is a pretty good story here. Bunyan does preach and moralize, but he tells a darn good story too. This book is a product of the Protestant Reformation (published in 1684) just after the release of the King James Version of The Bible. The book is a religious and political allegory that symbolizes particular qualities and actions that should form the cornerstone of a Christian's life.

I am making plans right now to read it to my kids (right after we get through with the Chronicles of Narnia series). Though this book is old (published 1682) it is still one of the best descriptions of the Christian life available in either fiction or non-fiction form. The mental image that has stuck with me since the day I first read this book is of Christian coming up on the cross. &quot;He ran thus till he came at a place somewhat ascending; and upon that place stood a Cross, and a little below, in the bottom, a sepulchre. So I saw in my dream, that just as Christian came up with the Cross, his burden loosed from off his shoulders, and fell from off his back, and began to tumble, and so continued to do so, till it came to the mouth of the sepulchre, where it fell in, and I saw it no more. Then was Christian glad with a merry heart. He hath given me rest by his sorrow and life by his death. Then he stood still a while, to look and wonder, for it was very surprising to him that the sight of the cross should thus ease him of his burden.&quot; Unfortunately I have met some who won't read this book due to it's length and archaic language, and this is a great loss for them.

Bunyan's work was, for 18th century Christians, a companion to the Bible. The theology is a perfect example of Reformation thought, and were it not for a major flaw in the allegory, this work would be just about perfect.Setting out from the City of Destruction, Christian makes his journey throughout many perils and temptations, eventually finding his way (through death) to the Celestial City, to live with Christ and the saints. Along the way he learns much about evading temptation, and much practical advise on escaping sin is given to the reader through his discussions with travelling companions Faithful and Hopeful.However, by no means is Christian's journey representative of the Christian life as it is meant to be lived. Two stunning flaws stand out - first, that Christian in no way has any direct contact with Christ, until after his death; secondly, that Christian's life is devoid of relationships, outside of his two travelling companions.These two realities of the novel are startling, especially given that the Christian life is, first and foremost, relational-primarily, the Christian lives in relation to God, and then in relation to his neighbor. The Christian is not an island; he is to evade the world, but love those in it. Bunyan entirely misses this key point.Not only is the life Bunyan paints theologically incorrect, but it is entirely undesireable. It would be unimaginable for the Christian to live an entire life without, along the way, enjoying intimacy with Christ. Indeed, it is these moments of intimacy in spite of imperfection, which drive the Christian's soul onward. And it hardly needs mentioning that a Christian who, rather than reaching out and loving those around him, dismisses them as sinners and leaves them behind, is more reminiscent of Pharasitical hypocrisy, than Christian love.If one is looking for a challenging allegory, they need look no further than Hannah Hurnard's \\"Hinds Feet on High Places;\\" its protagonist, Much Afraid, is throughout her journey often in direct contact with Christ, and her redemption comes not through death, but through Christ making her able to go out into the world and love. Though \\"Hind's Feet\\" is not as theologically rich as Bunyan's allegory, its practical application is far more uplifting, hopeful, and correct."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"Other than the Bible this book has sold more copies than any other book in history.

Hendrickson Christian Classics. ISBN 156563134X. (Due to Amazon's tendency to post reviews of one edition of a book on another edition's product page, make sure you're viewing the product page for ISBN 156563134X.)This review focuses on the edition only, as the Pilgrim's Progress itself needs no review. The hardcover binding is handsome and tasteful, and looks well on the shelf. The typeface is very readable. It would in fact be a perfect inexpensive edition of a great allegory, if not for two relatively minor flaws.The first is no \\"Note on the Text,\\" or even the name of an editor (of this volume; I believe the series may have a general editor). From what edition was this text edited? What other editions were consulted? What is the history of the text of the Pilgrim's Progress? A Note on the Text wouldn't have been much trouble, and would have raised this edition up a notch or two.The second is the glossing of words such as \\"I trow\\" which the unknown editor considers difficult for modern English readers. Glossing should properly be done either with footnotes or in the margins, but in this edition, the glosses are in brackets immediately following the word glossed. E.g. \\". . . I trow [believe] . . .\\" I find the procedure annoying; other readers might find it helpful. And if glosses in brackets make a great work of English literature accessible to more readers, then I suppose the editor is justified.Other than that, it's an excellent edition. I commend Hendrickson for bringing out their line of \\"Christian Classics\\" in handsome bindings for very low prices."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"This is a Christian classic that is my favorite of all Christian works, bar none (except the bible of course). Possibly the second most published work outside the bible, it has been highly regarded by many, and was once widely taught in the schools.I wish my school had taught it. I first read this book a year ago, and I feel as if I've been deprived all my life.Pilgrim's Progress is written by a mature Christian, with insights that you will not get from anyone other than a mature Christian. Few people are capable of writing such a book.And the book shines with great quotes. Two of my favorites are:What means this? The Interpreter answered, 'This is Christ, who continually with the oil of grace maintains the work already begun in the heart, by the means of which, notwithstanding what the Devil can do, the souls of his people prove gracious still. AND IN THAT THOU sawest that the man stood behind the wall to maintain the fire, this is to teach thee that it is hard for the tempted to see how this work of grace is maintained in the soul.And this: Now a little before it was day, good Christian, as one half amazed, brake out in this passionate speech. 'What a fool', quoth he, 'am I , thus to lie in a stinking dungeon, when I may as well walk at liberty. I have a key in my bosom, called promise, that will (I am persuaded) open any lock in Doubting-Castle.'A key called promise.. great thoughts.There are many editions to Pilgrim's Progress, and I haven't found one I am happy with yet. Try to get one with the original wording, and the references to passages in the bible. Many versions delete the references to passages in the bible, which are, of course, the most useful to Christians and of least use to the world.ISBN 0140430040 appears to be true to the original wording of the classic. On the other hand, it lacks the biblical passage references, chapter divisions, and is a paperback with (quite frankly) an ugly cover.ISBN 0785242228 is a modern spelling version. However comparing it to the original shows that a lot more than just the spelling has been changed, and it doesn't read nearly as well. This is a nicely bound hardback with quality paper and chapter divisions, and some (but not all) the references to the bible. Character names are annoyingly abbrievated throughout book.ISBN 1557480990 is a children's version of Pilgrim's Progress. While a children's book, it remains true to the original and is worth getting. The illustrations are great.There are also many etext versions of Pilgrim's Progress that include the original text and all the references the text makes to passages in the bible.I recommend you take your time reading the book, and reflect on what is being said. Also, if you have a full version of this book, with the references to passages in the bible, you could use it as part of a bible study.BTW: the phrase 'vanity fair' comes from this book."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"In contrast to Dante, Bunyan fills his allegory with real people, not just stereotypes - or even archetypes. Though his characters have names like &quot;Honest,&quot; &quot;Feeble-mind,&quot; and &quot;Ignorance,&quot; they come across as real people given a nickname. The names apply to some extent, of course, but not to the point of making caricatures out of the characters.This volume contains parts I and II of Pilgrim's progress. The first part concerns the journey of a pilgrim named &quot;Christian,&quot; while the second describes the journey of his wife, Christiana. Both start from the City of Destruction and both encounter many of the same obstacles - the Slough of Despond, the Vanity Fair, the Castle Doubt - before reaching the gates of the Celestial City. Other than that, their journeys are rather different, for Christian travels on his own, with a bit of help here and there, and with one or another traveling companion, but his progress is almost entirely his own. Christiana, by contrast, travels as part of an ever growing company, who support one another and who are defended by one or two powerful champions.You never lose sight of the allegory, but this work is not a mere tract. The story itself and the characters entertain - even today."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"This book is essential reading for any Christian who wants to &quot;fight the good fight&quot; and to finish the race well. The excellent thing about this book is that it helps to give the big picture of life and what small events that happen in life can mean in the scheme of things. The first book is about about a man named Christian (you can see that the allegory isn't too hard to understand) and the things that happen to him after he starts on the journey on the road that leads to Heaven. We see how with each step and misstep along the way Christian has the option of continuing on the road to Heaven or giving up, and that helps us readers to realize that the same thing is true in our own lives. Another thing I really like about this book is how even when Christian totally goes off the path and in the wrong direction, God extends grace to him and he is able to return once again to the road to Heaven. The second book is about Christian's wife and family, and is also worth a read. One thing to note though, unless you are extremely comfortable reading old English (which I am not), it would be a good idea to get the modern language version instead of the original; because I read the original and there were several times when I thought about how I probably would prefer a more readable, modern translation. But whichever version you choose, make sure you read this book. It will help you to thoughtfully consider the here and now and also your final destination."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"Everyone should read Pilgrim's Progress. I read it for the first time last week. It is a book about a journey by the main character, Christian. It will also set you on your own journey through the Bible. John Bunyan writes that his allegory contains \\"nothing but sound and honest Gospel strains\\" and he includes references to Bible verses on nearly every page. I found it easy to understand Christian's journey by looking up these verses in my Bible as I came to them. By doing this, Bunyan was giving me fresh guidance because I had not read many of these verses recently. The references also allow me to keep Bunyan accountable for his words by comparing them to Scripture.Reading a book is a journey in itself, especially when it is read along with the Bible. It was also a literal journey for me because I was reading Pilgrim's Progress while on an airplane. In one sense I was meeting John Bunyan for the first time through his book while at the same time my flight from Los Angeles to London was taking me closer to Bunyan literally. On City Street in London is a cemetery called Bunhill Fields which is full of non-conformist preachers (Puritans and others who severed their ties from the Anglican church establish by Charles II). This is where John Bunyan is buried. Last night when I finished the book I came across a related quote by Charles Spurgeon:Go into Bunhill-fields, and stand by the memorial of John Bunyan, and you will say, \\"Ah! there lies the head that contained the brain which thought out that wondrous dream of the Pilgrim's Progress from the City of Destruction to the Better land. There lies the finger that wrote those wondrous lines which depict the story of him who came at last to the land Beulah, and waded through the flood, and entered into the celestial city.\\"So the day after finishing Pilgrim's Progress I took Spurgeon's advice and went into Bunhill Fields to see Bunyan's tomb (as well as John Owens). It is ironic that a man whose life and thoughts so greatly followed and conformed to the Word of God would receive the reputation of non-conformist. It's clear from the story where Bunyan's loyalties lie:Ignorance: What be good thoughts respecting ourselves?Christian: Such as agree with the Word of God.Ignorance: When do our thoughts of ourselves agree with the Word of God?Christian: When we pass the same judgment upon ourselves which the Word passes...Ignorance: What are good thoughts concerning God?Christian: Even, as I have said concerning ourselves, when our thoughts of God do agree with what the Word saith of him.I appreciate Bunyan's regard for the truth. He clearly shows that we all are born into the City of Destruction wearing nothing but rags. He insists that the only road to the Celestrial City is through the Narrow Gate. He portrays the progression of our sanctification as a grueling journey, but one that is nevertheless fueled by God's grace. The true nature of worldliness is portrayed in Vanity Fayre, Satan's schemes are encountered and explained, and numerous actions, attitudes, and feelings are examined.Pilgrim's Progress is about the ultimate journey of life of pursuing a pure heart through faith in Jesus. By modeling faithfulness and perseverance, its characters illustrate the trials and tribulations by which God works His good in us. This book is a classic and I hope it remains in print for a long time so many more generations can learn and be encouraged by it."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"\\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\" is a classic Christian text written by John Bunyan. Written in an allegorical format, the two-part story focuses first on \\"Christian\\", then on his wife \\"Christiana\\" and sons. Convicted of their own sinfulness, the characters set out on the journey to salvation at the Heavenly Gate. Characters such as \\"Honesty\\", \\"Great-Heart\\", and \\"Faithful\\" aid the pilgrims on their journey, whereas they face trials from the Slough of Despond, Vanity Fair, and the Valley of the Shadow of Death.Getting through the book takes some work, less because of the story and more because of the depth of the allegory. Also, the dialogues between characters regarding salvation and righteousness often require a careful read. However, the story is exceptionally creative and thought-provoking, and the lessons that can be gleaned from it are timeless and worth the effort that needs to be expended. I recommend reading this one at least twice."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"John Bunyan confronts the world head on in his allegory The Pilgrim's Progress. Using the journey, conversations, actions, and interactions of his main character, Christian, Bunyan draws contrasts between true Christianity and the vast array of opposing philosophies and opinions offered by the rest of the world. Each contrast demonstrates the superiority of Christianity to the perspectives and beliefs of the fallen world.The story is told through the use of a narrative device. That devise is that of the narrator himself recounting his dream in which Christian makes his way to the Celestial City. The device serves to put the action of the story in context as well as a way break up the story into manageable segments. A key phrase often used in service of this device is: &quot;then I saw in my dream&quot;. The narrator's dream begins in the City of Destruction; which is Christian's homeland. As Christian Journeys to the celestial city, he encounters many people and trials. Each one is representative of various worldly, or otherworldly philosophies or beliefs.Bunyan has in all these encounters faced the problem of the truth of Christianity. If Christianity is true, how come there are all these alternative ideas in the world. Bunyan successfully exposes the weaknesses of the alternative ideas by refuting them one by one in the context of his pilgrimage allegory. Through his characters, Bunyan agrees with the apostle Paul. His argument is that our best weapon as Christians (once we have accepted Christ as our Savior and realized that only his grace is sufficient to save us) is to keep our eyes on God and the things of heaven (Colossians 3:2). All the arguments presented by the characters contrary to Christianity in this book add up to meaningless noise compared to the word of God and the truth expressed therein.Bunyan takes great care to steer clear of the idea that Christians are somehow intrinsically better than other people. He is careful to express that only God's grace working within them makes them capable of withstanding the trials of life. He demonstrates time and again that Christian suffers from the same weaknesses as normal people and is therefore prone to failure. It is only the love and assistance of God that allow Christian to reach his destination.God's grace and God's grace alone are sufficient to save Christian from the perils he encounters in his journey. Any time Christian attempts to do something of his own accord, his plans go horribly wrong and God must rescue him.The second part is about the travels and trials of Christian's wife: Christiana. It too is very instructive and entertaining.Pilgrim's Progress is insightful as an allegory. It is instructive and would be useful reading for anyone currently alive and making there way through our current sojourn or &quot;pilgrimage&quot; here on earth. Anyone going to the real Celestial City would profit from taking a glance at this book as they walk along the narrow path. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"The first time that I encountered Christian and his pilgrimage was as a preface and a family favorite in the book Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. Unfortunately, it was not until twenty-something years later that I actually got around to reading the book itself. If I were you, I would not wait that long.The first part of the current combined book appeared in 1678. Bunyan, a nonconformist Protestant minister who was imprisoned for preaching without a license, wrote at least the first part of the book in jail. The second part was first published in 1684. It is likely the most popular allegory ever written, and is still one of the best selling books of all time.What makes it so popular? The obvious key to its popularity is its simple, crisp style. Even accounting for the language changes between the seventeenth century and now, it is not a struggle to read Progress and it flows well for the modern reader. Although the book is allegory, the characters are full of little realistic details that make them feel quite human. Incidentally, I was reading this book as I was walking some of the old pilgrimage trails of Europe and it was interesting to me how vivid and applicable his version of the pilgrimage experience is. The Slow of Despair rang remarkably true, as did characters such as Talkative and Mr. Worldly Wisdom.The Oxford University Press edition is bound with a scholarly introduction which is, for a change, worth reading. It also came with explanatory notes and a glossary which were helpful for the modern reader who is not familiar with the everyday language of the period."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"Pilgrim's Progress has been accepted by the world as a classic piece of literature. However, just as Handel's Messiah is recognised as a magnificent work without people really appreciating the message it brings so Pilgrim's Progress can suffer from its own fame. Here we have the stories of believers moving towards heaven. They have ups and downs. They suffer pain and experience pleasure. All the time the christian reader is being led forward into experimental practical christian avenues. Despair, doubt, backsliding, the temptations of the world, helps from above and support from others on the Way all make this work so vital and relevant. Both parts, Christian's journey and Christiana's are wonderful in their own ways. For the past four years I have preferred the second part. Read it every year at least once. If you must read only one other book next to your Bible let it be this one, (Or Thomas Watson on All things for Good) but do read it all. A classic that is beyond review."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress; Cassette","review":"worth the value of the print and binding alone, this edition not only has the Pilgrim's Progress (with illustrations) in large print (yeah, no glasses!) but the OTHER works of this brilliant man, including his last sermon preached!Masterbooks has done us all a wonderful favor. Read the book that Spurgeon read over 100 times in his life. Read it to your children and let them grasp the beauty of the language, and the timelessness of the message.I think there is no other book in the world where the reader takes the place of the primary character and interprets all other characters as people in his own life...aunts, uncles, friends, former friends, ministers, phoneys, givers, takers, and so on. Read your life story through the brilliant pen of the old tinker from England. No wonder that this was the 2nd most selling book in the English language for generations!Introduce this to your children via DVD, \\"Dangerous Journey\\". My kids love to be read to, and to watch the DVD, chapter by chapter. Enjoy! Thank you to the publishers!"},{"Title":"The guilt trip","review":"A concise booklet which deals well with the reality of spiritual warfare in our minds and with the doctrine of eternal forgiveness (and thus, eternal security) through the finished work of Christ on the cross. The only weakness that was apparent was that Lindsey made no distinction between forgiveness for salvation and forgiveness for fellowship in the life of a believer. Otherwise, it is a very helpful volume on the issue of dealing with false guilt (and well worth a buck)."},{"Title":"The guilt trip","review":"The material in the book is excellent, however, it is not worththe price you have to pay for the book when it is simply a chapter from Satan is Alive and Well on Planet Earth.

You've read the various synopses from the other reviewers, so I need not include them here. What I find most charming about this author's work is the depth and wit she exhibits in exploring the human condition. Her writing style is not simplistic, but is so very easy to read. The story is never rushed, the characters are well drawn, and the philosophical bits of wisdom scattered throughout make a quote collector like me rush to my journal to record her pithy observations.Lorna Landvik just keeps getting better and better, and I would love to see her work gain a wider audience so that others can enjoy the discovery of this incredible storyteller."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I thought this was a great book! I really liked Angry Housewives, first one I read by her. I wasnt sure about this one 'quirky characters'...hadnt i read enough of quirky characters? but the characters really surprised and i loved that each beginning chapter was written in first person by violet and then switched to 3rd. She said things in the first part that related to upcoming parts so you 'knew' something was going to happen but you were never sure. Great book, fun characters that sing in a band you feel like you are one of the Clamshells as well (you have to read the book!) It is fantastic to see how Violet turns out greater and greater as life goes on for her. You definitely root for her :)"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"The story begins with instant tragedy and does not quit. The entire story is riddled with prejudice and tragedy. The only fell good part of the book was the music and you can't hear that. Lots of lyrics, but difficult to appreciate without audio of course. I was very disappointed as I was searching for a 'feel good' book as this was the words I used in the search engine and the book was anything but that. It was not a page turner and never got any better all the way to the end."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"For me not one of my favorite books by Lorna Landvik. I felt it just dragged on for ever with not much of a story. I only finished the book because I bought it. Although, the ending was nice. Wish she would write more books like Tall Pine Polka and Welcome to the Great Mysterious, two of my absolute favorites by Lorna Landvik"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"An interesting historical account of the depression, that we all should read. I'm a little younger than Violet, but not much. This story feels right, and I believe it is. Things were very different. Who now camps out just because they need a place to stay?!I loved the characters and the story, most of the time. At one point (those who have read it will probably know when), I just put the book down forever. Later, I picked it up and finished it, just to be finished. I'm very glad I did, as the ending is lovely!Ms. Landvik writes touching stories about people I have not known, but wish I had!"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"This book is so upbeat and positive as so many books are not.The book begins with elderly Violet Mathers who stops at a diner to get in touch with blue collar, every day Americans; plus she wants to bring back the times when eating at diners was her life style. She wants to remember back when she was the manager of the Pearltones, a music group, and travelling all around the country. She was young, the group was wild, there were groupies following the band around. These were wild times,fun times with many friends, drinking and partying and the joy of being young, enjoying life and meeting different people back during the depression.Born in a Kentucky town,Violet had bad luck with parents. Both despised her; her mother ran off with a man; her father poked fun at her, was constantly calling her ugly and stupid as did relatives and other townspeople. However, she found she loved to sew, work on fabrics and design clothes. She was a genius in this field and excelled at this work. Then working at a factory job in lost one arm on a machine. So she decides to hop a bus,leave town,travel out to San Francisco and jump off the Golden Gate Bridge.Fate steps in. The bus breaks down in a small North Dakota town. She is taken in by the family of Kjel, a very handsome young man, and his black friend Austin. Violet falls in love with Kjel, but is afraid of Austin, she is from the south and Austin is black. Kjel is much like the young boy in Landvik's \\"Welcome to the Great Mystery.\\" He makes good things happen.Kyel is a lover of life, a lover of people, and sees good in everyone and everything. He seems like an angel on earth. Kjel has wonderful parents, his father is a Lutheran pastor, his mother a loving mother, but not so wonderful older brother and sister.Time passes, Violet marries and Leola, Kjel's mother, then a widow, informally adopts Violet, her husband and their daughter. She is not too happy with her son and daughter.The book ends with Violet making peace with Dallas, her brother-in-law, who caused a bad accident and has always regretted it.Good read."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"This is a really great read. The story is gripping and original and the characters are ones you don't see in every novel. The story is unique and untold with it's own interpretations of love and hate, excitement and suspense.You fall in love with the main characters, both their positives and negatives, but in the meantime there is a whole array of background characters and events that find their way to the surface with an exciting electricity. If you are a woman you'll find yourself relating to Violet's pining for the bad-boy w/ a good heart character of Kjel (Shell).I also really like the way in which the story is presented. At the beginning of each chapter an elderly Violet (main character) addresses you, the reader, to recap some era or events. Then it moves onto the past where, from a narrative standpoint, Violet's story is told as it occurred.My only fault is that the recaps are entirely in italics, sometimes a page and a half. I personally find italics a little difficult to read in great lengths, but other than that everything was great!"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Wonderful book written by a great author!Lorna Landvik is a great storyteller. My biggest problem is putting the book down to get anything else done. I've just ordered another book by her.\\"Oh MY Stars\\" captivated me from the first page. I felt like I had lost a good friend when it ended. Very very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"A woman I worked with lent me this book and I read it in two days ... it was EXCELLENT. My favorite authors are Nora Roberts, Catherine Anderson, Janet Evanovich, Sandra Brown ... I'm now adding Lorna Lanvik to that list!While the book started out somewhat depressing, I think it was overall an uplifting story. Like with Janet Evanovich books, parts of this book actually had me laughing out loud (then laughing until I cried, as my husband looked at me like I was nuts!)"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"This was one of the best books I've read in a while. Wonderful, richly developed characters take you on an incredible journey from heartbreak to triumph. I read this all in one sitting because I just couldn't put it down. You can bet I'll be checking out the rest of Landvik's work!"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Every once in awhile, it's fun to read a book that causes you to smile and forget about everything. It doesn't always have to be a profound book that addresses society's biggest issues; sometimes some escapist fun is perfect for that long flight or commute on the train.That tends to sum up my view of Oh My Stars. It was fun, it included a number of great characters, a few plot twists, and a number of important observations about our country during the years just before World War II. The observations include a perspective on racial relations, music and war but isn't overly political or preachy.The central character is Violet Mathers, who looks back on her life's story. She has an unhappy beginning with a mother who abandons the family, a cold and abusive father, and eventually a factory accident that costs her an arm. Ready to kill herself, she instead begins a lifelong odyssey full of music, travel, and love.Although some people often think Landvik is a writer of books that appeal to women, I think her work is transcends that limitation. I enjoyed her previous book, Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons and am interested in reading some of her other work too. What I enjoy is her ability to write about a lifetime in a concise way. Oh My Stars is actually a fictional biography of an entire life; in fact entire lifetimes about a number of characters. She manages to cover decades in time without being shallow, and she does it with a sense of humor that often brings with it a unique Midwestern perspective."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"There were too many dragging parts of the book for me to give it a 5 star read but it was still enjoyable; the characters were well-defined and I warmed up to Violet as the book progressed. There is quite abit of bad luck that plagues Violet from page one but her life, as the story weaves from future to flashbacks, is surely never a dull moment if it is a sad one.Landvik is queen at storytelling and I look forward to more of her books."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Her previous book Angry House wives eating bonbons is one of my favourite books. This doesn't quite come into that league but it is still good. The characters come alive, they are complex and you love most of them and care about what happens to them, it's well woth a read"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Save this book for a rainy day. The main characters - Violet, Kjel, Austin, and Dallas - are all sympathetic, but slightly underwritten. It was a nice story, but nothing to sink your teeth into. I particularly felt that the author was thinking of what a nice Lifetime movie this would make as she got deeper into the book. How else to explain the immediate transference of love and loyalties following a tragedy befalling one of the characters? (When you read it, see what I mean, and try and tell me that I'm wrong.) The author seemed to run out of plot 3/4 of the way into the book, and cobbled together a hasty ending that not only didn't jibe with the rest of the story. It was a good read, but not satisfying, and completely forgettable 24 hours after reading it."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I was hooked on Ms. Landvik after reading Patti Jane's House of Curl. This is another great read from her. The first chapter was a little hard to get into but I was quickly hooked! And very surprised with the turns the book took. I have to agree with the reviewer's remark about the historical information. I read things I had no idea about! The characters are real and unforgettable. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Once again Lorna Landvik presents a novel that is full of unique and endearing characters. How can we not fall in love with Kjel or want Violet to succeed? In a story that deals with both outer and inner beauty, readers are taken on a road trip that is not only memorable, but life-changing for each of the characters. Landvik's storytelling abilities are unsurpassed. I've enjoyed all of her novels and this one was one of her best. I can't wait until her next release."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"This book was darker and more serious than the other Lorna Landvik books I've read, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed it any less. I felt so sad for Violet, and so hurt for Dallas and the prejudices he faced. Yet the author had a lighthearted way of keeping this from being a depressing book, with an upbeat musical setting and playful interactions between the main characters."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I was looking for a novel that would complement my \\"escapist\\" read set during the 1930s (no easy feat) and came across this one at my local library. I have heard of Lorna Landvik. A friend of mine had been recommending this author for the longest time and told me that I just had to read Angry Housewives Eating Bonbons. Well, it isn't that I haven't wanted to read this author, it's just that I keep forgetting to give her a whirl... until now. This may not be the aforementioned novel, but it is one that to me is an awesome discovery. Oh My Stars is a fun, entertaining novel about an Elvis-like rock band (before Elvis) and the suicidal girl that joins with the leader of the band and two black brothers seeking stardom. The year is 1937. Eighteen-year-old Violet Mathers has had enough. Her mother has left her, her father is unkind, she is tall and plain, and she'd lost one of her arms in an accident at work. The young woman from Kentucky has decided to end her life. But on her way to her final destination -- the Golden Gate Bridge -- the bus she's on has an accident and becomes stranded in North Dakota. There she meets the handsome Kjel and his friend Austin. Then she meets Austin's brother Dallas. Together they travel as The Pearlstones, a band ahead of its time, for its rock and roll, Elvis-like style will revolutionize music as people had known it... or maybe not. There are some fun twists throughout the novel.This is one charming, heartwarming novel! There is humor, poignancy, darkness and a hopeful tone. Violet's home life is told in such a way that you feel as though you are living her experiences with her. The things she goes through are quite sad and you feel compassion for her when she decides to end her life, but things aren't told in a way that makes this novel depressing in the slightest. This is a young woman who has gone through a lot and you cannot feel but understand her. Kjel, Austin and Dallas (I thought their names were funny) are great characters as well. I so loved the whole rock-and-roll-before-its-time thing and the author has done it in quite a convincing, enthralling way. The backdrop of the late 1930s is told in a wonderful manner -- I loved the author's descriptions of the era and the different areas as the band travels and performs. I also thought the author is quite on the mark when she addresses race issues and segregation. You are reminded of all the things African Americans have been through and have overcome over the years with books like this one. The one thing I can say that isn't in favor of this book is that the editing leaves much to be desired. I was confused whenever I read about Violet using her \\"arms\\" as though she hadn't lost one of them. I hope those errors have been fixed for the paperback version. Other than that, Oh My Stars is one wonderful gem! My friend was right in regards of Lorna Landvik. She is a very talented author and I will give her other stuff a whirl. I wonder if her other books are as good as this one. It seems that nothing can outdo such a wonderful and creative story. I cannot recommend this gem enough!"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I just now finished this wonderful book. I delayed reading the last few chapters because I didn't want it to end. I love Violet Mathers and the way Lorna Landvik portrayed this girl/woman. The format of the book with Violet speaking and then the rest of the chapter telling her story was brilliant! This story told of the challenges of living in the 30's, 40's and so on, especially regarding racism. It also told the story of courage and staying true to yourself. I can't wait for my daughters to read this book. My grandchildren are of mixed-race and I'm so thankful for all the real Violet's and Austin's who had the courage to love and marry and have children. The world is better suited to accept my grandchildren, but we still have a ways to go. Thank you Lorna Landvik for your brilliance! Peace Always."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I know I've enjoyed a book when I delay reading the last few chapters because I am not yet ready to leave my new friends!A quick and easy read with a subtle and satisfying sense of humor.

I loved it, everyone I've loaned it to loved it, you will too!"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Lorna Landvik proves with her latest novel, Oh My Stars, that she is a force to be reckoned with in the world of fiction writing.At 18, Violet Mathers has been abandoned by her mother, abused by her father, suffered humiliation at the hands of her classmates, and lost her arm in an accident. All this might make the average person want to jump from a bridge.And that's exactly what Violet intends to do. She boards a San Francisco-bound bus in Kentucky, determined to jump from the Golden Gate Bridge and kill herself. But when the bus breaks down in North Dakota, she meets Kjel, who dreams of stardom, and his guitar-picking friend, Austin, who is black and challenges Violet's beliefs about segregation. The guys begin a journey to stardom, and Violet is going along for the ride.Oh My Stars is not like Landvik's other books - and that is a good thing. Now they all are wonderful books filled with humor, sadness, and reality, but somehow Oh My Stars cuts much deeper and stretches Lankvik's talent. And that stretch won't disappoint you. I will remember this book for a long time and will highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I have read several of Landvik's books ~~ Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons, Patty Jane's House of Curls and Tall Pine Polka. I have loved every single one of them ~~ and this one, Oh My Stars, is just right up there with them! This book is perhaps my favorite so far simply because it is heartwarming and written so eloquently.Violet Mathers is a character after my own heart ~~ especially when she described camping out beneath the stars on her travels with her two best friends, Kjel and Austin, both musicans. Yes, she suffered a horrible accident and had a lonely and isolated childhood. Yes, she was abused by her father and abandoned by her mother. Told she was ulgy all of her life, Violet escaped into her sewing designs till a factory accident cut off her arm at the age of 16. On her way to the Golden Gate in San Fransico to committ suicide, her bus breaks down in Pearl, North Dakota. There she meets Kjel and his family. Inevitably, her life changed in an instant.Violet travels with Kjel, Austin and Austin's brother, Dallas, to perform at different bars. On the cusp of success and making a record with a big time label company, tragedy hits the group and they disbanded. However, it was not the end for Violet as she found love and happiness.It is a wonderful story ~~ lyrical and upbeat. Even in the beginning when Landvik was describing Violet's home life, it wasn't depressing like you would think it would be. It was written as a matter-of-fact which is believable since Violet narrated her story throughout the book. Reading this book is like being there. You can smell the campfire and feel the cool breeze blowing on your neck. You can see the women swooning over the Pearltones as they played their music and feel your feet tapping in time. Landvik has really written a story that captures the imagination and doesn't let go till long after the last page has been turned.And to be honest, it's been quite a while since I've shed some tears while reading a book ~~ this one definitely pulled at my heartstrings while reading it.

I have only read one other of her books, but with it as well as Oh My Stars, I am left wishing it would go on. I feel like I have become close friends with each and every one of her characters. Well, the nice people anyway.I will read this one many times."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"This was my first introduction to Lorna Landvik and I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, this is usually not the type of book I would read, but after hearing two other people rave about it I decided to give it a try. I have since read another of Landvik's stories but it couldn't live up to this one.This is an overall heart-warming story (with angst and depression in it) of a young woman who had the worst childhood and worst luck, and yet, through the help of those around her, was able to completely change her life for the better and change her attitude towards life. Violet is just a lovely person and your heart aches for her and all she has to go through. Landvik did a great job of developing the character of Violet and all the characters, really. She has a wonderful writing style and a wicked sense of humor."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I had already read several books by this author, including this one, so ordered this book for my sister.

Her latest, OH MY STARS, was quite different from PATTY JANE'S HOUSE OF CURL and her more recent ANGRY HOUSEWIVES EATING BON BONS, but I think this latest book is one that I'll remember for a long time.Violet Mathers starts out in life feeling unloved and unwanted. She's too tall, too plain, and then after she loses an arm to a horrific accident in the sewing factory where she works (she is only sixteen years old at the time), she soon feels that her life is not worth living. At the age of 18, she leaves her father (her mother had left them years ago for another man), gets on a bus bound for San Francisco, hoping to be the second person to end their life by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.What can only be fate happens during this bus trip. The bus ends up in an accident, and because they are stranded somewhere in North Dakota, she ends up being rescued by a very handsome young man named Kjel, and his good friend Austin, and they bring her home. This is the turning point of her so far miserable life, and her life is now on the upswing.A good part of this book entails their travels as a musical band they call THE PEARLTONES, and Kjel becomes something of an Elvis-like music idol. The time period is the late 1930's, so rock n' roll has not yet been invented, color lines have not been crossed, and so their musical world is a bit different than what we know today. They encounter racism during their travels, as Austin and his brother Dallas are black, but Kjel doesn't see color, and while Violet was brought up to believe that blacks and whites should be segregated, she learns something new through her friendships with Kjel and Austin.I really loved this book. I do have to admit that there were times when I felt the book could have been edited differently, but by the end of the book, I had a feeling that this was a story I would not forget easily. I am glad I read it and am looking forward to more by Lorna Landvik. This may have been her best book yet. Violet's early life was depressing, however, and some may not enjoy reading about her early years, but I saw this story as an uplifting type of novel, where even the almost impossibly sad lives can turn around if surrounded by people that care about them.Violet narrates: \\"Who'd have ever thought a shunned, husky-voiced, one armed, big-chinned girl with a hive of bees in her head could live a life so full of miracles?\\"I think that summed up the book quite nicely."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"While not roller in the hair funny like her Patty Jane's House of Curl, or as witty as Angry Housewives Eating Bon-bons, still, ja, sure, Minnesota author Lorna Landvik's newest foray into the foibles of the US NorthLand is a fun and graceful frolick. This time, we're in and out of North Dakota and on a road trip with a band in the 1930's. The travelling band features a pre-Elvis, Preslian precursor Norwegian/American Lutheran Boy Named Kjel (pronounced in the Norwegian way as \\"Shell\\" just as their native son Kjierkegaard is pronounce \\"Chicago\\" &lt;-accent on the first syllable)and includes 2 black brothers and a 1 armed girl/manager.Told alternately in the first \\"old ladies are the ghosts-boo!-of American culture;only a few people actually see us\\" and third person, the story wends its way from the old Kentucky home to North Dakota through the segregated South and back to a Garrison Keillor-esque North Dakota. Landvik's latest is a fresh brisk breath of North Dakota air. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"It's the Depression; Violet Mathers is 18 years old, creatively accomplished, a cacophony of ugliness, the product of an absent mother and a cruel father and the casualty of a factory accident that robs her of her talents and sets her on a suicide mission to the Golden Gate Bridge. As chance (or fate, luck or doom?) would have it, the bus she is traveling on crashes in a small North Dakota town. Here Violet meets the men who will change her life, musicians, Kjel Hedstrom and his 'black as night' friend Austin Skyes. In love with Kjel, repulsed by Austin and eventually annoyed by Dallas (Austin's ex-con brother), Violet joins the threesome as they travel across America on a tuneful, almost Elvis-like adventure of self-discovery and social issues.The self-discovery is nicely done. It's quite easy to become drawn into Violet's world thanks to Landvik's brillant humor and empathy.The quartet of characters, though not deep, is fun and pleasing and easy to care about.Landvik ultimately loses her reality when dealing with the social issues of a distinctly black/white 1930s America. They are never fully addressed or even worse, developed into the sticky situations and considerable quandaries they were. An encounter with the KKK is woefully short and flawed with no ensuing aftermath or logical social ramifications for the times. I sensed as if the author was floating through the period and was apprehensive about taking on racial matters and losing the cloudy, lighthearted, atmoshphere on which much of the novel rests.While this is a pleasurable read, nonetheless, historically, it lacks a significant punch to give it the real impact it could so easily have had."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Lorna Landvik excels with this masterful tale of Violet Mathers, an ugly duckling, deserted by her mother, beaten by her father, and just to make sure she has more than her share of misery, a horrible accident that causes the loss of her arm. But an amazing thing happens to Violet on her way to commit suicide. Violet's life has taught her that when things look as bleak as can be, they can still get bleaker. And her bus ride to San Francisco for the express purpose of jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge proves that point. How she winds up on a farm in North Dakota, how she meets the man she will love forever but who can never love her in the way she needs him to, how lemons truly become lemonade is about the most uplifting, heart-wrenching story I've had the pleasure of reading.Her dreams of being a fashion designer may have died with the loss of her arm, but a life she never envisioned rises up to meet her. Through a series of circumstances Violet could never have dreamed, she finds herself traveling through the United States as a band manager during the Great Depression. Twenty years before Elvis, a beautiful and charismatic man named Kjel Hedstrom had young girls swooning and grown men wanting to join the band. His relationship with Violet, the other band members he brings into her life, and the unforgettable adventures of the Pearltones will keep you mesmerized. Be forewarned that this book will not end as you expect, and perhaps not as you would have wished, but end it does and don't be surprised if your tears of sorrow and joy have stained the pages."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I am a big fan or Lorna Landvik, and was not at all dissapointed in this book. There are so many things that I loved in this book. I loved that the characters went from rock bottom, to top of their own worlds and back down again but make it out ok. And I realy liked that the ending wasn't what you thought it would. A great read!The books main character was a lame dog at first, one arm, no self esteem, and her only goal in life is to be the 2nd person to jump of the Golden Gate Bridge. You want to take her in and fix all her woes. But then she meets the two people who will change all that.This is a great story that will stay with you. It is very dramitic with powerfull race issues that remind you how far we have and have not come over the years."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Don't be put off by the corny title of this book (for me, it gives the impression of a sappy romance) - this book is great. I was pulled in right from the beginning and could not put this book down.I loved Violet's character and enjoyed seeing her transformation. I loved the other characters as well - the band members, Elwin, the Clamshells, etc. My only (very slight) criticism is that the book got a tad slow for me at the very end but not enough that I wanted to stop reading it.This is definitely one I will be recommending to my friends and to my reading group."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"In general I liked this book quite a bit. Landvik's books always seem to have that \\"feel good\\" vibe to them. The characters are well written and the story, although at times a little implausible, (I would have thought that Violet and the Pearltones would have encountered a bit more racism and bigotry on their travels,) nicely told. Violet was a great character and I found myself rooting for her throughout the book.There were a few too many \\"around the campfire\\" scenes that really should have been edited better, but on the whole, this was a very enjoyable book to read."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Oh My Stars opens with Violet describing The Off Ramp Caf&eacute;. It is your regular Anytown, USA diner where truckers are eating burgers, salesmen are reading the papers, and waitresses are writing down orders. Violet soon invites us to sit down for a cup of coffee while she tells us a story about miracles and love.Violet had a hard depressing childhood. Her mother deserted her when she was just a child and her father was physically and verbally abusive. Rebelling against everything her mother told her not to do, Violet went without using soap, bit her fingernails, didn't brush her hair, and slept in her clothes. For those reasons plus many more she was tormented by the town people and other kids.Violet spent much of her time alone reading and learning until one day her father told her to get a job instead of sitting around all day doing nothing. Violet was hired at the thread factory where she finally got to experience something she never had before, friendship. The days spent there were some of the best times but it quickly ended when she was involved in an \\"incedent\\" which caused her to lose an arm. Violet could not take life the way is was any more so she decided to clear out her bank account, take a bus across the country, and jump off the San Francisco bridge. Little did she know at the time that her life was about to radically change.On the way across the United States, Violets bus broke down in North Dakota. She was rescued by two men - Kjel a man who made her feel like no other and his friend Austin. These two men who where stuggling musicians took her in on their journey to fortune and fame and made her a part of their life and the pursuit to make their own special kind of music.Oh My Stars is not a bright and funny kind of story like Lorna Landvik has written in the past but it sure is worth the time it takes to read it. This story deals with some serious issues such as abuse and racism but it also has love and hope and shows that miracles can happen. You can't help cheering on Violet as she makes her way through this book.I'ts about time Lorna Landvik wrote a new book and Oh My Stars will not disappoint you.

Lorna Landvik paints her literary canvas with characters of real strength and most certainly does the same in this novel.The story centers around Violet from childhood through middle age. As you travel with Violet, you feel her pain, her losses, her agony, her grief and her joys, love and strength. You also feel the camaradarie with her friends and newfound family.This novel is a wonderful expose' of life for those who are without hope, have experienced loss, who experience discrimination and who lived in a period of time in America few of us have experienced.Wonderful novel, nice read, sweet lessons."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I first read Ms. Landvik's Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons which I loved, so I picked up this book. I had a difficult time getting into the first few chapters, but once the other main characters (Kjel and Austin) were introduced, the story really picked up. I LOVED this book. It has great historical information as well as a wonderful story of young adults coming of age in the depression era. I am surprised that Oprah hasn't put it on her booklist yet as it does a great job of describing the segregation issues of that time. The characters are unforgettable -- all of them, which is quite a feat."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Oh, My Stars is a one of the best novels I've read so far this summer. Authored by Lorna Landvik, (author of Angry Housewives Eating Bob-Bons) it is written in a style that definitely puts you in touch with the characters, feeling their joy, sorrow, pain - a whole roller-coaster range of emotions. Unexpected twists in the storyline add to the suspense and the desire to keep turning those pages!"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Violet Mathers Sykes has stopped at the Off-Ramp Caf&eacute; and begins to tell her life story addressing those in the diner and the reader directly at the front of each and every chapter. Violet had a extremely difficult childhood in early twentieth century America; her mother abandoned her at a young age and her father was a mean drunk. When she was older, Violet got a job in the local thread factory. She loved everything about her job. Tragedy struck on her 16th birthday, when she lost her arm in a threading machine accident. Violet pushed all her friends away and almost succumbed to her sorrows. On a bus ride to California and the Golden Gate Bridge, Violet dreams of and is determined to be the second person to jump that famous landmark. However fate intervenes, her bus has an accident in North Dakota, and the riders are rescued by the local townsfolk. She is rescued by Kjel Hedstrom and his family. Kjel is a unique person who greets each day with saying \\"Oh My Stars\\". He befriends those who tend to be left behind by others. At first, Violet's relationship with Kjel and his friend Austin is strained, more from the pity and empathy than actual friendship. Once they go on the road, and create a music group called the \\"Pearltones\\" does their relationships change and grow. She tells her story with such conviction; you start to believe that they were an actual group. They have become her family and have given her hope for the future. However, Kjel is paralyzed in a senseless drunken act and their life on the road ends. Violet is rescued from her despair by Austin Sykes, someone who has been there all along for her. Excellent writing, characters who become your best friends or enemies, music that jumps through the pages, a little bit of everything to keep you immensely satisfied."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"In Mount Crawfiord, Kentucky Erlene Mathers abandons her daughter Violet to be raised by her spouse Judd, a terrific mechanic but an abusive ugly drunk with no quality time for his wallflower giraffe of a child, dubbed Olive Oyl by her peers. In 1935, Miss Eugie Dodds hires the lonely almost sixteen year old Violet to work the night shift at the Marcelline Threads factory. The shy unhappy teen, whose first name is apropos, finds acceptance and a feeling of belonging for the first time in her life. However, on her sweet sixteenth birthday, a machine accident amputates her arm.Once released from the hospital, Violet concludes she has nothing but bad memories in Mount Crawford so like many others takes the bus to California, but a crash in North Dakota strands Violet and others. Musicians Austin Sykes and Kjel Hedstrom rescue everyone. Violet likes the kind black Austin, but is quite attracted to Kjel and joins the duet, who hopes to pioneer a new style of music to a still somewhat depressed America as the show has just begun.OH MY STARS is a terrific look at the mid 1930s in America. Fans will appreciate the metamorphosis of Violet from her belief that she is the ugly duckling into a confident swan symbolizing America coming out of the Depression. The cast is fantastic as the audience will believe they are traveling with the heroine and others as readers discover the wonders of the country while Violet seeks her groove. Lorna Landvik provides a delightful Americana tale that will elate historical readers with its depth of characterizations to include the land.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"I wanted so much to love this book, but I just never could care enough about the abstract mismatch of characters and I found myself distracted by most anything...leaving the book for days then picking it up again and hoping it would get better. It was not a bad read at all, but it wasn't as memorable a novel as I'd hoped."},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"All of Lorna's books are great and this one is not an exception"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"Lorna Landvik is a name that always catches this reader's attention. Whenever she has a new book out, it automatically is on the must-read list. While OH MY STARS is quite different from PATTY JANE'S HOUSE OF CURL and her more recent ANGRY HOUSEWIVES EATING BON BONS, Landvik's latest does not disappoint.This is the story of Violet Mathers, a woman who started out in life unloved and unwanted. She was made fun of by her peers and by her family, and when she is left with only one arm following a horrific accident in a sewing factory, she knows that her only choice is to end her life. At the age of 18, she leaves her father, gets on a bus bound for San Francisco, and patiently waits for the bus to end its journey. Her plan is to be the second person to end their life by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.But fate has something else in store for Violet. The bus never makes it to the West Coast. An accident that leaves the bus stranded in North Dakota becomes the turning point in her life. A family kindly takes her in. One of the family members, a handsome young man named Kjel (pronounced \\"Shell\\"), patiently and lovingly helps change Violet from a very depressed and insecure teenager to a confident and happy woman. To say it simply, Kjel gives Violet a reason to live.Soon after, Kjel and his good friend Austin, a black man for whom Violet feels repulsion in the beginning, decide they want to travel around the country. Their story takes place in the late 1930s, and she has been taught that white and black people do not mix. Kjel, however, never sees a color difference, and the two men are best friends. Kjel convinces Austin and Violet that they are going with him on this trip. They leave North Dakota and take off for parts unknown, with no plans except to travel.What happens next is the adventure of a lifetime. With the help of Austin's brother Dallas, and Violet as their manager, they form a musical band called the Pearltones, in tribute to their hometown of Pearl, North Dakota. Their lives take on the form of a dream. Kjel becomes an Elvis-like heartthrob, and they help break color barriers with their music. Fans crowd into clubs and bars to hear them perform, with women young and old swooning at their feet. They encounter racism along the way, as well as lasting friendships, loyalty, and not least of all, love.Although the story is difficult to follow at times due to the jumping back and forth between time sequences, OH MY STARS is a wonderful novel. While the story is rooted in history, in particular the segregation of whites and blacks, it also takes on a fantastical dreamy type of fable. The story of Violet's early life is a downer, but this is the type of book that, when the last page is turned, makes you feel good all over, and you will remember the characters for a very long time afterward.The story is told through Violet's eyes as an elderly woman reminiscing about a life that could have ended too soon. The book concludes with Violet's narration, remarking, \\"Who'd have ever thought a shunned, husky-voiced, one armed, big-chinned girl with a hive of bees in her head could live a life so full of miracles?\\" It's nice to know that some books do have happy endings.--- Reviewed by Marie Hashima Lofton"},{"Title":"Oh My Stars","review":"While this book was not bad, it just did not measure up to the first book of Landvik's which I read, \\"Patty Jane's House of Curl\\". I loved that book, but merely liked this latest one. I found parts of it to be verrrrrrry slow and just wanted to get to the end. It took me 10 days to read it, which to me says \\"this is not a book that was compelling\\".The synopsis has already been written several times, so I will not go into that....suffice it to say that the story was \\"just okay\\" in my opinion. I liked Violet and \\"the boys\\" but they were not nearly as fleshed-out as Patty Jane and her family and friends.I also felt that after dragging out the story of the first couple of years, the book/ story was concluded too rapidly."},{"Title":"American Portraits: Biographies in United States History, Volume II","review":"This volume [and I assume the first volume too, though I haven't read that] strives mightily to give a diverse sampling of prominent Americans in history. As the editors point out, traditional biographies have focused on white, male, Anglo-Saxon examples. But in counterweight is offered this book. Hopefully, the reader will gain an appreciation of the complexity of American society.The choices in this volume may include people unfamiliar to you. [Which is a salient strength of the book.] Like Sarah Evans, an educator and elected official [sic] in the 1890s, when women had no vote. Or Susan Picotte, the first Native American female doctor. Good examples of unorthodox trailblazers."},{"Title":"Save the Good Seed (Booker)","review":"This is the third book in Monty Joynes' series about Anglo (AKA Booker Washington), a middle class white realtor who completely abandons his suburban lifestyle to magically wander across the country and into a leadership role in a traditional Pueblo Indian community.I learned about SAVE THE GOOD SEED after stumbling across the initial work, NAKED INTO THE NIGHT, in my local college library. I was quite impressed, all the more so because I discovered half way through reading it that the author lived in my relatively obscure mountain town! I found him in the phone directory, gave him a call, and after a half-hour conversation, immediately went out and bought the other two books. I was not disappointed!SAVE THE GOOD SEED removes much of the attention from Anglo onto Ray Rey, a Native American man who was adopted (some would say stolen) as an infant in the 1950s from his people into a white family in Western North Carolina. The story line alternates between Anglo's increasingly controversial integration into his assumed Pueblo community and attempted reconciliation with his children, Ray Rey's tortured and confused rediscovery of his Indian heritage, and the unfolding careers of White Wing the dancer and his former showgirl managers (who were introduced in the previous book). Perhaps because it struggles to weave together such disparate themes into a cohesive fable that is part history lesson, the tale doesn't quite hold together as well as in the previous two books. Although it ponders some disturbing questions and posits gentle, sometimes remarkable spiritual solutions, the book loses some of its metaphysical momentum and clarity. It was heavier to read, and less memorable.Nonetheless, taken within the trilogy, SAVE THE GOOD SEED is an important and somewhat grounding contribution. However, it won't make any sense if you haven't first read its predecessors. All the books in Monty Joynes' series belong in the category of what might be called spiritual or allegorical fiction. Although the stories are obviously imaginary, they evoke perennial truths and awaken an intuitive sense of the sublime. I recommend all of them for anyone who wants to touch upon the essence of Native American spirituality, and the stillness of his/her own soul."},{"Title":"A Cherished Wilderness: The Adirondacks","review":"Perused this volume while waiting my husband's turn in the cancer clinic.

The Travel books: v.III)","review":"Lawrence was a good traveller in these parts and he spent a lot of time carefully observing the Indians he met along the way. He was particularly interested in the ways of thought of the Indians and their religious beliefs and the ways their ideas differed from yours and mine. On simple concepts like time and distance, for example: &quot;To an Indian, time is a vague, foggy reality. There are only three times: en la manana (morning); en la tarde (afternoon); en la noche (night). But to the white monkey (you and me) there are exact spots of time, such as five o'clock and half past three.&quot; The Indian's concept of God was different from ours. &quot;With the Indians...there is strictly no god. The Indian does not consider himself as created and therefore external to God, or the creature of God. There is, in our sense of the word, no God. But all is godly. There is no great mind directing the universe. Yet the mystery of creation, the wonder and fascination of creation shimmers in every leaf and stone... There is no God looking on. The only God there is is involved all the time in the dramatic wonder and inconsistency of creation. God is immersed, as it were, in creation, not to be separated or distinguished. There can be no ideal God.&quot; Lawrence does a wonderful job of digging into this exotic culture and explaining to us the significance of Indian rituals and dances. I particularly liked one of his statements: &quot;The Indian is completely immersed in the wonder of his own drama.&quot; There is also a lovely example of descriptive travel writing in &quot;Market Day&quot;, a chapter that makes you slow down your reading pace to savor the beautiful descriptions of small things like a bird's flight or flowers in a doorway. I guess this is the difference between reading and information-processing, which we do so much of today."},{"Title":"Mornings in Mexico,: And Etruscan places; (The Phoenix edition, 18.

The only DH Lawrence I had read before was Aaron's Rod, and a brief description of his sensiblities in reference to Lady Chatterly's Lover. This book, Mornings in Mexico, is a series of short essays about his observations while living in New Mexico and Mexico in the 1920's. His writing is simultaneously poetic and anthropologic, often detailed and consistently insightful. A reader might debate the accuracy of some of Lawrence's assertions, but not without exploring and exposing your own beliefs. Hence, DH Lawrence shares his observations of people and circumstance in a seductive and provocative way...and, what else can we ask of an author? I am thankful to have read this book and gained a better understanding of why DH Lawrence is considered a great writer."},{"Title":"Mornings in Mexico,: And Etruscan places; (The Phoenix edition, 18.

Mornings in Mexico is really a slight work but with a charm to it. There is a relating of facts (especially about Indian life and thought) that you would expect from a travel piece but the charm is in the kind of easy sauntering pace that the narrative keeps. That feeling that it is vacation time and there really is no hurry. The house he lives in for his stay in Mexico and the surrounding markets and open fields in which he walks and the balcony he stands on in the morning with parrot are all pleasantly described. It feels like a place you want to be. The way time away should feel. There is a slight mournful air to the fact that the Americans are beginning to spoil the place, it is as if the Americans have brought that intruder time itself into this timeless land. It's not so much the details you will remember as the overall feel of the work. And Lawrence himself. And here he seems at ease, searching as always but not desperately so, which is a nice Lawrence to spend time with."},{"Title":"Mornings in Mexico,: And Etruscan places; (The Phoenix edition, 18.

The dinner that was left warming in the oven, the furniture, the telephones even the toilet paper has been taken. After trying to convey the thouroughness of the robbery to the police (in an uncomfortable public phone booth , no less) Mr. Ransome returns to his empty house to wait with his wife...while waiting he notices not only the drapes but the curtain rings are gone! This slender British novel wittily and adeptly poses the question &quot; What would you do, Who would you be, if everything was taken?&quot;. The Ransomes deal with the police (who proffer no hope of recovering their gear), the insurance company (however, EVERYTHING is gone, including the copy of their insurance policy) and wait for some semblance of normal to be restored in their lives. A few creature comforts are obtained to replace the many and then the tale takes a remarkable turn. This is a delightful tale, full of humor and with remarkable insight on people and their possessions. I have given my first copy away and have already reread the replacement book! A must have."},{"Title":"The Clothes They Stood Up In","review":"Ever since his days as part of 'Beyond The Fringe' in 1960, Alan Bennett has continued to hold a valued position in the affections of the British public. His 1987 collection of monologues, 'Talking Heads' are classics of the genre and in 1995 he was even nominated for an Oscar for his screenplay, 'The Madness Of King George'. 'The Clothes They Stood Up In' is a further testament to his popularity. Appearing first in 'The London Review Of Books', Bennett later read the story on Radio 4, a performance later released on cassette. Now it has been published in a volume of its own. Like much of his other work, it is a comic story with elements of tragedy. The title refers to all Mr. and Mrs. Ransome have left after they return home from a night at the opera. To the horror of this middle class couple, everything in their flat has gone missing including the telephone, the toilet paper (Mr. Ransome has to use his program from the opera), the light bulbs, and Mr. Ransome's prized Mozart collection. The comic situations developing from this crisis are improbable yet curiously still believable. Communication problems and individual idiosyncrasies propel the humour along in these hilarious sequences, with Bennett's observation making the farce seem all the more real. Social workers, the police and daytime television shows all find themselves on the receiving end of Bennett's gentle (albeit razor sharp) wit. The cold Mr. Ransome, painfully aware of his impression on others, begins to crack now his respectability is threatened. His wife on the other hand discovers her independence. Bennett has admitted he finds it easier to write through female personas, and he succeeds in showing Mrs. Ransome's gradual growth as a human being and disenchantment with her cosy, starched, pre-theft lifestyle. Bennett's irony gets many opportunities to manifest itself in this story, as does his ability to juxtapose incongruent ideas. His elegant writing style is littered with lavatories and dog excrament. When the Ransomes find an audio tape with two people having sex on it, Mrs. Ransome says &quot;It sounds like custard boiling&quot;. The story's message seems to be a warning against suppressing the true self and not living life to the full. The latter part of the book is particularly scathing towards Mr. Ransome's stiff and awkward outlook. One suspects that Bennett is intervening, using the opportunity to attack pompous middle class behaviour. The climax is a poignant but positive ending to what is an amusing, moving and insightful story."},{"Title":"The Clothes They Stood Up In","review":"Alan Bennett's writing so often reminds me of fractal forms; the twists and turns of his plots on the macro scale being matched perfectly on the micro scale by the endless convolutions of his individual sentences and paragraphs. There are times when his writing gives every impression of wandering aimlessly through a tangled mass of irrelevant side detail, with no possible single end point in mind, until suddenly, and with an almost shocking clarity, his words reveal themselves as carefully chosen after all, when they all unexpectedly lead plumb to centre of the narrative target that has been in his sights all along. I can see that, for some people, this technique may prove to be an impenetrable annoyance (although anyone brought up in Yorkshire - and more especially Leeds - where they talk like this all the time, should merely find it homely and comforting.) But examine his words closely and, for all their meandering, you'll see that they have an absolutely exquisite precision and economy to them. This is the work of a true (and truly English) literary craftsman.This short story, \\"The Clothes They Stood Up In\\", receives the classic Alan Bennett treatment, both in terms of writing style and also in terms of another of his hallmarks: the at times almost surgical examination of the social mores (and boors) of Middle England. Although this book is very short indeed (it should not take even the most meticulous of readers more than a couple of hours to devour this tasty titbit) it nevertheless demonstrates this author's unerring capacity for dissecting away endless layers of social stereotyping, in order to expose the central nuggets of individuality at the heart of his characters (or else reveal such nuggets to be entirely absent) whilst at the same time pointing up the basically ridiculous natures - and faintly ludicrous habits - of even the most ordinary of people.Amusing and poignant by turns, this small volume delivers some exquisite character studies of ordinary people in entirely extraordinary circumstances. As ever, it makes for a highly entertaining read for those open to Alan Bennett's distinctive writing style. Bargain hunters may like to be aware, though, that this story is available in various better-value boxed collections, alongside other Alan Bennett short stories (principally \\"Lady in the van\\" and \\"Father! Father! Burning Bright\\") There are also plans to publish it within a single compendium volume some time in 2002. Of course, some people may just consider such collections as altogether too much of a good thing!"},{"Title":"The Clothes They Stood Up In","review":"Alan Bennett has amazing instincts. Here he has indulged an apparent whim and it works wonderfully. Having lost all of their possessions, the Ransomes are confronted with new perspectives about the more substantial losses within their affectionless marriage. This is a mannered novel with a modern, surreal twist. Bennett manages to capture a more fully realized plot than many authors are able to do in much longer novels. Respected for his talents as a playwright, Bennett's little gem deserves as much acclaim."},{"Title":"The Clothes They Stood Up In","review":"Writers could take a lesson in how to write an entire sensitive and insightful saga complete with mystery, humor, drama and intrigue in the tiniest volume ever -- found my self laughing out loud and unable to lay it down til I had finished -- darn! wanted to make it last. Like British humor? Like great word pictures? You'll like this just fine."},{"Title":"The Clothes They Stood Up In","review":"I first read this story back in 1996, when it appeared in the London Review of Books and was somewhat surprised to see it as a tiny book some five years later! Let me just say at the outset that it's well designed, but small, and should cost about half of what it does. With dry British satire, Playwright Bennett recounts the story of the Ransomes, who return from the opera to find their flat stripped totally bare--even the wires are clipped flush with the wall. They are middle-aged, middle-class, childless, and totally fail to connect with each other. Life has obviously been quite empty for both of them as they have their little routines (hers seem to revolve around pleasing him), but no friends or family. Once the shock of the bizarre burglary wears off, they must attempt reinvent their home from scratch. Fortunately this does not become a new agey lesson on how our possessions actually possess us, but rather a fable about starting over. Mr. Ransome looks to recreate his previous existence (albeit with higher-end stereo equipment), while Mrs. Ransome is forced to frequent daring new shops (a Pakistani grocer's, a thrift shop!). As she takes these small steps into the broader world, she is reawakened to life's possibilities. The bizarre mystery of the theft is finally revealed, and things end happily, if rather predictably. A neat little tale that takes about an hour to read--shame the publisher so wildly overpriced it."},{"Title":"The Clothes They Stood Up In","review":"Yet another masterpiece from Bennett, this time the victims of his seditious satire are Rosemary and Maurice Ransome, amiddle-aged, middle-class, childless couple who are gradually drifting apart from each other in a long-term emotionalwithdrawal. Their lives are governed by order and routine with the one remaining ember of passion between them lying inMaurice's love of Mozart. This escapism from the reality of each other is shattered one evening as they return from the opera todiscover that they have been burgled, not just a smash-and-grab but instead everything has been taken, right down to theinsurance policy! As they gradually attempt to restore some semblance of order to their lives, Maurice discovers furtherfulfilment in the new hi-tech CD players he could buy to improve the quality of his Mozart. Rosemary undergoes something of acultural revolution with visits to the local Pakistani grocer shop and the occasional venture into a \\"thrift shop\\". In a startling climax, Rosemary discovers the motive behind the theft and Maurice finds his inner-self awakened but in the most unpleasant of circumstances. Bennett's perspective on those around him and the foundations of middle-England are ruthlessly portrayed here in what is one the one hand a wonderful social comment and, on the other, an familiarly disenchanted critique. The precision with which Bennett selects his characters and provides us with the ammunition to assassinate them is remarkable, there is not a word wasted or thought used to excess, stunning."},{"Title":"The Clothes They Stood Up In","review":"The Clothes They Stood Up In is British playwright Alan Bennett's (author of the play The Madness of George III and later screenplay The Madness of King George) first novel.The story revolves around the Ransomes, a reclusive and childless middle age couple who are living out their isolated lives in \\"an Edwardian block of flats the color of ox blood\\" known as Naseby Mansions. One evening, after returning from a production of Mozart's \\"Cosi fan tutte\\", they find that their flat has been burgled, leaving it devoid of every single item that the Ransomes have accumulated in their life together, much of which had been of little use at all anyway.Faced with what would seem to be a devastating situation, the Ransomes in fact adapt to the situation as though it had been a blessing, and begin to rebuild their lives anew.It was at this point that I began to suspect that the main underling motive of the work was to serve as a critique of our modern materialistic culture, but then Bennett added an interesting twist. Based on a query from a storage company, the Ransomes undertake an impromptu expedition to a storage facility, where, to their surprise--but indignation, rage, or even dismay--they find their stolen property. Oddly, not only did they find all of their possessions, these possessions were arranged exactly as they had been in their flat; moreover, somebody by the name of Martin had made himself quite at home, apparently ignorant to the fact that everything about him was stolen. In fact, he--and his lover--made himself more than just at home, which after the Ransomes have their possessions restored to them, is key to how the story plays itself out.I have to say that the story proceeds along from this point in an interesting manner, although the ending in my opinion is somewhat indicative of the author's uncertainty as to how this off-beat tale should be resolved. This is of little consequence really, when one comes to think of it--the story, although possessing a certain degree social commentary, can easily be read superficially as a means of passing a few spare hours. Be forewarned: the format of this book is small, being smaller that the standard pocketbook and its stated length of 161 pp. is deceptive; the average word-per-page is much less than what one expects. For this reason, The Clothes They Stood Up In should really be considered a novella.Although not an overly impressive book, The Clothes They Stood Up In will provide the reader with a few hours of casual entertainment while not being excessive mind-numbing and/or pathetic."},{"Title":"The Clothes They Stood Up In","review":"I have sometimes thought that if a tornado destroyed all my possessions, I would not be entirely sorry. Never before have so many people had the opportunity to realize how burdensome belongings can be. People sometimes find themselves the bewildered inheritors of collections of valuable things that they don't want and can't figure out how to get rid of gracefully. For this reason, parts of this novella resonate powerfully with me. The Ransomes come home to find that everything in their flat, (including the oven and casserole warming in it) has been stolen. The likable and sweet-natured wife, Rosemary, finds a sense of liberation in this unasked-for opportunity to rethink her life. The thread of her thoughts as she reconstructs her life, feeling a certain relief at the loss of some things and a certain dismay at the return of everything, is the very best part of the novel.Unfortunately, the story goes downhill from this intriguing beginning. The book, outside of Rosemary's musings, becomes very contrived, silly, cliched and dull. For such a short book, there is an amazing amount of extraneous and tedious detail: the caretaker's night school, the trip to the Aylesbury, bowel movements, etc. Social trends in the UK and the US don't necessarily move in lockstep, of course, but this book feels like something from the 1970s. Rosemary in particular seems to have stepped through a time warp: more a timeless stereotype of a sixtyish woman than a plausible woman born around 1940 and growing up after World War II. At one point Bennett even intrudes into the narrative to explain his theme, just in case the reader hasn't managed to figure it out.This explanation is the worst of the book: \\"... what he is being condemned for here is for not having got out of his shell ... .\\" What is it to me or to anyone if he hasn't? Why bother joining Busybody Bennett in standing in judgement over Maurice Ransome or anyone like him? If a cranky misanthrope has the grace to be a recluse, who is being bothered by him? He strikes me as an undesirable husband, but Rosemary seems to cherish some affection for him and if she doesn't, well it's not like divorce isn't pretty common these days. I could understand it if Bennett had turned his ire against Paloma, that aggressive evangelist of rigidity who was behind the bizarre burglary. (I have just had a vision of the relentless Hyacinth Bucket, arrogant meddler par excellence of the British sitcom \\"Keeping Up Appearances\\" adding the Ransomes to her list of persons to be bullied and terrorized into her vision of a well-led life.) Alas, real life is full of people who intrude on others, even complete strangers, with unsolicited advice on how to cease being oneself and become more like the unwanted advisor. Those who do it in the name of freedom and individualism never do seem to get the irony."},{"Title":"The Clothes They Stood Up In","review":"Another thoughtful and humorous novella by Alan Bennett. As with \\"The Uncommon Reader,\\" this book has a preposterous premise, but Alan Bennett makes it work. And in fact, it's the ridiculousness of the premise that makes the book so compelling! Mr. and Mrs. Ransome come home from the opera one night to find that their flat has been completely cleaned out... down to the stove and appliances--including the casserole left to warm in the stove! This elicits very different reactions from Mr. and Mrs. Ransome, each of whom have been going through the motions for years, stuck in stagnation and complacency.I didn't enjoy this one quite as much as \\"The Uncommon Reader,\\" I didn't feel the same kinship with the Ransomes as I did with the Queen in \\"Reader.\\" Still, this is a funny and though-provoking book, absolutely worth the afternoon it will take you to read it."},{"Title":"The Clothes They Stood Up In","review":"Bennett is a master of the cool, dry British narrative. This novella is pithy and perfect in its self possession. The story opens when the Ransome's return from their beloved Mozart &#34;Cosi&#34;. In fact, but for Mozart would probably split up years ago&#34;. Stripped of their daily props, the Ransomes come to confront themselves. The wife finds freedom on a variety of levels, while the husband seeks comfort in stricter rigidity. We find them in their improvised home. She has a rocker found in a shop she would have never considered, while he sits erect at a card table and chairs.Given the half wished reality of stripping of the old, where would we find ourselves? This book enables one view of the answer."},{"Title":"The Clothes They Stood Up In","review":"I personally did not like this book. I personally do not like Bennett's works in general. That aside, this work was well written.To those who are familiar with the tendencies in Bennett's plays and works for films.... the themes to be found in this book shall come as no surprise. British snootiness, clashes between generations and their values, clashes between the sexes, nationalism, sex humor, and bathroom humor are once again in Bennett's work.The Ransome's return home from a night of listening to Mozart to find their home completely empty... toilet paper and all. During this time, they find themselves of having to get things to reidentify themselves. But along with the purchase of these things comes the questions... who do I really want to be and what do I want to be characterized by? At least these questions plague Mrs. Ransome as she runs across foreign stores that she would have never considered before. The book delves deeply into the awakening of identity of Mrs. Ransome and the resistance she meets from her husband.This is one of Bennett's more interesting and solemn works. Though not a great in literature, it does capture a snapshot of British life in an age of transition.Crazy James"},{"Title":"The Clothes They Stood Up In","review":"really short but actually quite pleasant. it's a cute little tale that i think my mother would benefit from reading, but that I myself enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Clothes They Stood Up In","review":"I had somewhat high expectations of this book as a bizarre, quaint little tale from a mind who created the marvelous film, &quot;The Madness of King George.&quot;The book itself was enjoyable, but I would not read it again or recommend it to a friend. Bennett could benefit from some punctuation, as some of his sentences are run-ons or are nonsensical (I'm sorry, but I'm an editor). The satire of the British middle class, Britain in general, and various types of people is the best part about the book. It is intelligent in that way.My biggest disappointment was that the bizarre tale climaxed (when the reader finds out how, by whom, and why all of the Ransomes' possessions were stolen) in a way that did not fit with the rest of story and, indeed, did not add anything to it.The characters are high quality, however, in a book that is so small and fluid."},{"Title":"Heaven's my destination (Anchor books)","review":"I was finished with this book before I really knew that I'd started it. It has a light, easy flow and a gentle sense of humor. It features George Brush, who is profoundly religious and tries his best to live up to the standards he sets for himself. What makes the story worth reading is that you always want to see what he is going to say next; despite his odd way of looking at the world, at heart George truly wants to help people and live a life of love and goodness. He speaks out against injustice and wrongdoing and is quick to defend his own traditionalist views. The fact that so many people are so quick to judge and misunderstand him, and that the people who do understand him benefit from knowing him, seems to be what the book is trying to get across. No matter how crazy or misguided he seems, he is a better person than the average Joe who never takes the time to think about his impact on the world.There is a very subtle ironic humor pervading this book; it is impossible to miss, but Wilder never makes a clown out of his protagonist. Instead one is left with the feeling that George really does make the world a better place, though he has an eccentric way of accomplishing this goal. What I had thought was going to be a stinging kind of satire about an evangelical young man ended up being a wistful satire more about the people who judge such a man than about the man himself."},{"Title":"Heaven's my destination (Anchor books)","review":"George Brush, a traveling book salesman, is the American version of the Protestant saint: opinionated, narrowminded, selfless, literal-minded, priggish, and brave, Brush is the truly good man whom no one can stomach or ignore. Wilder's writing is strong, and his portrayal of Brush is very comical. The scene of his religious conversion in college, which is instantaneous after listening to a woman evangelist, who also happens to be a drug addict, is marvelous. Likewise his \\"marriage of convenience\\" (for him).It's a fun book, though there are serious undertones throughout. George gets depressed and thinks the whole world is crazy except for him and wonders why God is \\"so slow in changing the world.\\" Finally, Brush is not very smart, not very passionate, but he IS good, and perhaps, Wilder suggests, that's enough. One of Wilder's best novels."},{"Title":"Heaven's my destination (Anchor books)","review":"Say there, young man: Are you feeling Unfit for Society? Battling with Depression? Socially persecuted because of your ideals? Well, take heart because you are not alone! George Brush has walked down that lonely path in life himself.Both as playwright and novelist, Thornton Wilder captures the essence of human nature--revealing its hesitant yearnings and poignant humiliations in the daily struggle for recognition in an indifferent world. Despite the almost humorous cover illustration (Bard Pbx) and occasional outbursts of wit, this story is more pathetic than comic. George Brush is a young man sure of salvation in the next world, but woefully ill-equipped to cope in this one. Fiercely determined to live a righteous life of voluntary poverty during the Depression, he manages to antagonize or frustrate most of his non-business contacts. Haunted by an unfortunate romantic incident in his recent past, he feels obligated to make reparations, yet pursues various female acquaintances with overzealous devotion.Georgeis considered a success only by his employers, since he proves a competent traveling salesman for his textbooks company. So what is it about this unusal young man which turns normal folks off at first encounter? Is it his relentless religious discussions, his strict rules of self conduct, or his odd manner of viewing his own role in society? Somehow he just does not fit in with mainstram America of the 30's. His road travels are a series of bizarre circumstances and gross misunderstandings which result in brushes with the police and judges--even though he is honest to a fault. People can't figure out his motives, for it is difficult to put into practice the theories of Ghandhi in the \\"modern\\" mercenary world. The country was simply not ready to welcome this sincere but persistent young man as a regular member, even though he longed for his own hearth. Can a brutally honest fellow find happiness with the girl of his dreams in rugged, disillusioned America?I found the style disjointd, with many loose threads instead of a clearly woven plot; this made the book hard for me to wade through. But the courtroom scene was a delightful section, cleverly plotted with witty remarks--Wilder in top comic form. How can poor George find justice in our plebian nation and personal happiness at home?"},{"Title":"Heaven's my destination (Anchor books)","review":"This book is a forgotten classic... as a comedy of the Great Depression, it stands alongside Chaplin's \\"Modern Times.\\"I own the first edition, as it was out of print for many years before this paperback came out.

Strangely ironic."},{"Title":"Heaven's my destination (Anchor books)","review":"\\"Heaven's My Destination\\" is a rather unexpected novel. I read it quickly, although I found the book to be \\"slow\\", and after it was done it stuck with me for quite some time. That seems to be the motif for my reading of Wilder's novels.And I love them!I am a little disappointed at how many reviewers want to call this book a satire, despite the fact that Mr. Wilder went to great lengths to point out that the novel is not a satire at all. The story follows a fundamentalist traveling salesman named George Brush whose philosophies and non malicious ignorance get him in one sad situation after another. George Brush is a good man, although I was often very irritated at his simplemindedness and frustrated at his sometimes idiotic views about certain religious topics. However that is exactly the response Wilder wanted to elicit in the reader. George Brush is only 23 in the book, and recently converted to Christianity, and he has all of the joy and stupidity of a recent convert. Wilder said about his novel's protagonist that he \\"is everybody when they are young\\", and the novel's ending is a perfect climax for the next stage of Brush's life and one that Wilder lets the reader decide for themselves.At its heart \\"Heaven's My Destination\\" is about a man who sees the world as a very ugly place, and is bound and determined to try to make the parts of it that he comes into contact with better. He is idealistic, nave, and maybe even deluded...but so what? He hurts no one and is striving to make the world better in some way.George Brush is really the only fleshed out character in the novel, although each chapter is peopled with many cameo characters that appear and then are gone. It is to Wilder's great credit as a writer that they come across, for the most part, as very real.I hesitate to offer a lot of commentary on a book that is so ambiguous and open to interpretation so I will end with what Thornton Wilder himself said about this novel's protagonist, \\"George Brush at his best is everybody.\\" When you read a novel and you see some of yourself, it is worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"Heaven's my destination (Anchor books)","review":"A fun read with interesting characters, lots of surprises.

As I am not what many would call a formal &quot;Christian&quot; I still believe that it has both power and meaning for those not of that faith.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!! If it wasn't for your review I would never have looked at the book seriously.I had sciatica pretty bad for 1 and 1/2 years. I found some relief from taking 4 ibuprofens once or twice a day (for months), but didn't want to live that way. My local MD quickly diagnosed sciatica with the straight leg lift test - steroids and PT didn't help. The chiropractor managed to move the pain after my first visit (Sarno's book talks about this) - it turned into what felt like electric shocks running down my leg while laying on a bench for some weight lifting and I thought that was a big improvement! He disagreed. Finally I got so desperate I did some online research and ended up here in Amazon. Searched for sciatica, and bought 3 books. Fishman's book and Cunningham's book were pretty standard fare. You know, strengthen your back, do these exercises, don't bend your back while lifting, blah, blah, blah.Luckily for me, someone else was kind enough to share their knowledge by mentioning Sarno's book in their review of the Cunningham book. I had noticed Sarno's book in the ads off to the side and immediately ignored it. Come on, how can your mind heal your back! Despite the hokey, holistic sounding description, this BOOK CURED ME!! I know, it sounds crazy. Read some of the 213 REVIEWS on the book. I'll just be repeating what most of them have to say. I read the book and I was a classic example (as are probably the vast majority of middle aged, pretty normal/responsible folks with kids, jobs, etc who also have a bit too much emotional stress which can manifest itself as sciatica).My improvements were dramatic and fast! Within a few days my pain was greatly diminished. Within 4-6 weeks it was 100% gone and I am back doing the rigorous sports I love - weightlifting, handball, tennis, raquetball, snowboarding, windsurfing, skimboarding, catamaran sailing, etc. Hey, I'm not 20 years old either - 50 is pretty close now.If you have sciatica you owe yourself the risk of spending a few bucks on Sarno's book on healing back pain.

Well, it turns out that Sciatica is clearly part of TMS, which is what I have. Look up the Sarno book here at amazon, and read the reviews. The Sarno book has helped hundreds of people be free of both back AND SCIATIC pain. I am not yet 100% pain free, but I am living an unrestricted, active life without fear.

It barely touches on extraspinal causes of radiculpathy which medical science is beginning to address. The alternative medicine section was a fairly well-written overview, but corelational studies are lacking. If you are looking for a simple book in a non-medical setting, then maybe this book is a good place to start. And by the way, the author, while accomplished in other works, seems to lack a medical background."},{"Title":"The Sciatica Relief Handbook","review":"The information in this book is laughable at best. Unfortunately, bad information to sufferers of low back and leg pain is not funny at all. I would highly discourage anyone from wasting their money on this text.A patient gave me this book to read because they wanted to know if it would help them. After reading it, I told them to throw it in the garbage. The text lacks any credibility, the author obviously has no medical training, and there is no reference section to back up any of the assertions made. He even got the number of vertebra in the neck and spine incorrect which would have required nothing more than a simple Google search to verify.As a physician, it angers me to see books like this get published which are more propaganda than fact, contain multiple errors and flat out lies, make no attempt to scientifically validate opinions presented, and lead the reader with fallacy to approaches that are not based in science. Furthermore, I can hardly believe that a chiropractic physician with a nursing degree would agree to write the scant forward when the information presented in the alternative medicine section is no more than an overview with numerous erroneous assertions.The only section of the book I found worthwhile were chapters 8 and 9 on exercises and proper lifting and ergonomics. Again this section is not comprehensive, but I found the best information to the reader in these sections. However, you can find the same information in many other books on back pain."},{"Title":"The Sciatica Relief Handbook","review":"Found that the book covered many many different treatment types including alternative therapy methods, most of which I have taken - I'd rate it pretty good in explaining most of them. I'm disappointed in that it didn't go into more depth concerning the actual physiology of the nerve and how it transfers the pain from the back down the leg - I've heard lots of theories, and would like to get a definitive answer on this. Found that it had &quot;filler&quot; material that was pretty basic stuff.

It is decent for the beginner by giving an overview of what sciatica is, what causes it, etc. It explains some treatment options such as; surgery, homepathic remedies, excercises, massage, acupuncture, etc. However, the treatment options have very small overviews of what they are and what they could do. I would have rated it a little higher if it gave me a little more detail. Also, as another reviewer stated is that you can find most of what is in here on the internet. You could probably get it cheap, I got it for $4 with shipping. If you could get it for around that, why not?

After surmounting Everest on his third attempt, Jamie turns his attention to crossing the world's longest and most forbidding sand desert, the Rub al Khali or &quot;Empty Quarter&quot; of the Arabian peninsula. In tribute to Sir Wilfred Thesiger, whose own sensitive accounts of the Arabian desert and its peoples have enthralled generations, Jamie and his crew decide to retrace the route of this great explorer, a feat never before duplicated by a westerner. Jamie's narrative skillfully guides us through the intracacies of the entire experience -- from &quot;camel wrangling&quot; training in the Texas desert, the team's initial meeting with Thesiger himself in England, the infinite trials of sponsorship and bureaucratic necessities, to the desert journey itself. Once the adventure is underway, Jamie's day-to-day account is enthralling, achieving a pleasant balance in its combination of dialogue, description, and emotion. Flashbacks to his Everest experiences are thoughtfully placed, and his comparisons of the two native peoples, the Sherpas and the Bedouins, show Jamie to be as attuned to the cultures he encounters as he is to the physical challenges of the landscape. The reader grows to know and appreciate the entire team, from Jamie's Canadian accomplices, Leigh Clarke and Bruce Kirby, to the generous and hospitable Bedouins who accompany them, and finally the colorful cast of camels whose antics never cease to amaze and amuse. Victor Hugo once said, &quot;The desert is where God is and man is not&quot; and after reading &quot;Everest to Arabia&quot; his sentiments are more clearly understood. Across long miles in Oman and Saudi Arabia, to victory on the shores of the Arabian Gulf in the United Arab Emirates, Jamie Clarke takes us to one of the most forbidding and inaccessible places on earth. It is a rewarding journey, indeed."},{"Title":"Everest to Arabia","review":"An evocative and mesmerizing page-turner, Everest To Arabia is Jamie Clarkes thrilling story of his expedition across the Empty Quarter on camal. Even after summiting Everest on his third attempt, Jamie's irresistible urge to explore drove him onward to yet anither incredible challenge, the inhospitable Empty Quarter.Fueled by the legendaty explorer Sir Wilfred Thesiger's stories of the Quarter and the Bedu inhabitants, Jamie, along with his brother and Bruce Kirby, embark on one of this centuries greatest and most difficult journeys across the most desolate desert in the world. Everest to Arabia is a truly fascinating read, not just about Bedu culture, hardships of travel by camal, but about the human spirit and potential to overcome our fears and doubts, our ability to ' step out of the frame,' and do something truly spectacular. Jamie's words and example tells us, the reader, to dream, and dream big. Everest To Arabia is a vivid and scorched to the bone account... Convincing... Whether Jamie is tackling the Mashadid well searching for water, brewing the perfect cup of coffee in a sand storm, wrestling with his camal, or having flashbacks of crossing the Khumba icefield on Everest, Clarke knows how to use precise detail or poetic imagery to make this epic story come to life. The pages of this book crunch with desert sand and smell of exotic lands. Jamie Clarke is one of the worlds greatest living explorers, in another era he might have been compared to Shipton or Mallory. Harrowing, relentless, honest...and thoroughly enjoyable Jamie Clarke's Everest To Arabia shouldn't be missing in anyones adventure library."},{"Title":"Everest to Arabia","review":"In this book Jamie takes you out of the comfort of your own home and into a world of adventure!Jamie talks about all aspects of the adventure including sponsorship &amp; team work.Everest to Arabia tells a story about how even the most thought out plans don't go to plan and being able to adapt is a key element in success wether it be in business, adventuring or any other aspect of life.The book also has a good deal of humour in it, I found myself laughing out loud at times and especially liked the bit where Jamie wanted the scorpian to strike his team mate first so he could sound the alarm. :-)A great book, 5 STARS!"},{"Title":"Everest to Arabia","review":"I actually heard Jaime speak at a conference I was at a few years ago. He was a GREAT speaker. After hearing him speak I really wanted to read his books. I wasn't really impressed with this one. It was dry. Kind of boring."},{"Title":"Everest to Arabia","review":"Jaimie shows us a culture so different from ours and yet like all human nature so familiar. The emphasis and devotion that the Bedu show to religion and family values is unbelievably humbling. As Americans we want the best of everything and we want it now. A few weeks with the bedu and surviving in the desert seem to make those narrow minded views questionable at best. Jaimie can write as well as he can plan adventures. A great adventure and escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life."},{"Title":"Waves of Deceit","review":"The story idea is good, the lingo is pretty catchy but like many first time authors, the dialogue is stilted and too much information that is not necessary to the story. I did get my local library to buy it which is a plus for the author since she will get much wider circulation through libraries. For a first time author, it's successful but cannot give it anything close to five stars - but I hope she continues writing and looking forward to seeing her work in the future as she masters the process."},{"Title":"Waves of Deceit","review":"This book is definately a page turner filled with unexpected twists and turns!

But if you look around you'll see bitsand pieces of it, remnants of a bygone age.Before the days of urban sprawl, mass transit, and the demise of the railroad, small local railroads were to be found all of the San Francisco Bay Area. One of the mostpicturesque was the Ocean View railroad which started out in San Francisco and eventually ended up in near Santa Cruz. Started in 1905, the railway was all but obliterated in the earthquake of 1906. Engines from the railway did assistin clearing debris from the city and hauling relief supplies.Construction started again soon, cutting a roadbed along the Pacific coast. It was hoped that with the railroad, somehousing development for vaction homes would blossom as well. The train ran through little communities like Salada, Half Moon Bay and Rock a way beach.Unfortunately its bug competition Southern Pacific was always in the background, trying to snuff out the operation.And with the introduction of more highways and automobiles, the days of the railraod were numbered. The last gasp of the line was in 1920, when gas powered railcars were used to haul excursion passengers.Not much of the railway exists today, except for a few station houses, and traces of the righ of way. As with all Arcadia publications there is a nice mix of historical photos and modern images to compare the changes over time. a nice feature in the end, is a model railroad that was built to commemorate the railway."},{"Title":"Public Opinion and Public Policy: Models of Political Linkage","review":"This book explores a key thesis of democratic government--the role of public opinion in affecting public policy. The introductory chapter lays out a variety of models by which public opinion affects public policy. The most radical is direct democracy in which the citizens themselves make policy. Other models include: the rational-activist model, political parties model, pressure groups model, belief sharing model, and role-playing model.The book is organized around these distinct models (although the work does not actually address the first model, in which people directly make policy themselves). In each section, the editor selects illustrative publications if political science research on the model. This begins to suggest what evidence there is for each and how each model can operate.Since the book was published, a number of much more direct and more powerful tests of the linkage between public opinion and public policy have emerged (e.g., the work of James Stimson).Nonetheless, this still remains a useful resource to help the reader tease out what the route might be from public opinion to public policy."},{"Title":"Twenty Steps to Power, Influence and Control Over People","review":"Old school military management style.

Only, instead of being pauintings, what we see are sentences, in perfect order, words perfectly crafted and honed to deliver a most astounding portrait of their author."},{"Title":"Where I've Been, and Where I'm Going: Essays, Reviews, Prose","review":"Before picking up this 1999 Joyce Carol Oates book of nonfiction pieces, called Where I've Been, And Where I'm Going, I'd only read a handful of her \`poems' and stories in assorted magazines, and a dozen or so of her essays regarding pugilism, and recalled little of what might be called style- pro or con. After having read it I am wary of her ridiculously prodigious literary output, because if it's anything like these essays, then Oates is one of those Ginsbergian first thought, best thought writers, who takes little or no time revising. These fifty plus essays, while displaying an admirable breadth of knowledge show an alarmingly thin depth of wisdom. In short, Oates has got to be the foremost sciolist in American letters, constantly scribbling mediocre works into the void.A sign of this comes from her alarming usage of epigraphs for essays. Epigraphs are quotes from other works designed to either state the essence of the work, or act in counterpoint to it. While this tool has been overdone in fiction, and especially poetry, its usage in essays- which are designed to explicate, seems superfluous, since why would an explicative form need its own explication? The whole book starts off with a quote from Aristotle, \`They who are to be judges must also be performers.' Ok, but does this have a thing to do with the book? Is Oates saying that she'll be doing literary vaudeville for us? No, it just sounds cool, even though it has little to do with the book's contents. In an essay called The Aesthetics Of Fear, Oates has a quote from Tod Browning's film, Dracula: \`There are far worse things awaiting than death.' Now, is this a deep thought? A unique one? Is it phrased memorably? No, trois. It simply is an ego stroke let's the reader know that Oates is a cinephile with an ability to quote from obscure sources. Especially in such a format, epigraphs, in general, and these two particularly, give a clue that not much original will be coming the reader's way....This book shows off Oates, a humanities professor at Princeton, in the worst possible light, as a typical example of all that's wrong with modern publishing and Academia, and why it's filled with, at best, hacks. Oates, unfortunately, stands at the pinnacle of being a \`hack's hack', as this book amply demonstrates. How someone who has written so obscenely many books can still be so utterly clueless as to what constitutes clich&eacute;d and banal writing is beyond me, save that it proves she has very little in the way of writing ability, much less critical ability. She is to criticism what Thomas Steinbeck is to literature- a styleless, generic cipher. That these pieces were originally published in places with reputations as large as the New York Times, Kenyon Review, and London Review Of Books, also comments amply on their assorted falls from grace, as well, as ignominious part in the dumbing down of art and culture in general. The only thing remotely positive I can state of Joyce Carol Oates' Where I've Been, And Where I'm Going is that it captures this intellectual and artistic stillicide, in miniature, all too well."},{"Title":"Witches' Companion","review":"These books are excellent.Anne Rice is a very believeable writer.

From flipping through and reading maybe 25-30% of the entries I have noticed errors of fact (the Chronology for 1936 says Ryan was born to Cortland and Amanda, but Ryan's father is the older Pierce--Cortland was his grandfather), mistakes in cross-referencing (the entry for 'Judith' directs the reader to 'Chris', but the entry 'Chris' simply redirects the reader to the preferred heading 'Little Chris'), and a number of over-simplifications and, in my opinion, misinterpretations of events.

The result is a series of close-ups of eyes, lips, and mouths - all body parts considered by the subjects to be the most precious part of their appearance, life, and career. Each page is given full play to even a small part of the body designated by the subject and an added short comment by the subject accompanies the elegantly designed layout. The subjects are wide ranging: Renee Fleming, Johnny Depp, Twyla Tharp, Tommy Hilfiger, Lukas Haas, Elijah Wood, Harrison Ford, Meg Ryan, Paul Theroux, Paul Giamatti - the list goes on covering not only Hollywood stars but also figures from the dance, theater, fashion, model, music, and literature worlds. This is a fascinating coffee table book that is probably more intimate than any single monograph of any one of the subjects!"},{"Title":"Precious","review":"This book is truly an accomplishment. After looking at so many high-profile photographer's books, I found all of the books to be self centered and all the same. This book is absoloutely different. Not only are each of the photographs unique, but the design of the book is a refreshing change from every other photo book out there. The quotes from all of the subjects in the book are revealing. The manner in which each person was photographed so creative and a nice change from the way that we're so used to see some of the celebs. These are two amazing photographers and its so good to see that they're putting their talents to work for such a great cause."},{"Title":"Precious","review":"I love picture books. I like when they have a theme and purpose, but this was just kind of lackluster. I flipped through it and enjoyed some of the pictures, but overall it is only worth the few bucks I paid for it.

The photos are beautiful and fresh, and the commentary is pretty revealing about what these famous people have in their minds (some good, some bad). The design of the book is eye-catching...perfect for your table, and to inspire conversation. I definitely think these talented photographers created something worth every penny. Plus, in today's world where people are mostly jaded and cynical, I think it's pretty cool that two artists decided to do something completely unselfish for a good cause. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Precious","review":"Many famous, not-so-famous, and not-at-all-famous (the photographer's kids!)people were asked what part of them was most precious, that part subsequently being photographed for inclusion in this book. Half the pages have no photos, but are blank with only one word on them: eyes, feet, hands, etc. Far too many of the photos are blurry abstracts and could be photos of anyone. One example: Actress Miranda Otto chose her shoulders. The photo doesn't even show her shoulders, but rather a few strands of hair and the faintest suggestion of unrecognizable facial features . It tells me nothing. I purchased this book because I read that it contained a photo of Elijah Wood's eyes. Well, it does, but I have seen at least 100 more beautiful photos of this actor's spectacular eyes. I did not buy it to see a photo of the photographer's daughter's toenails. The concept of this book is terrific, but the photos are not. A pity -- it could have been so much better."},{"Title":"Precious","review":"What utter toss. I first saw these two muppets on CNN taking about their joint project, and became annoyed at them simply talking about this book. When I was unfortunate enough to view their lofty tome, I became insensed. If, like other reviewers, you enjoy learning that Susan Sarandon's favorite thing about herself is 'her soul', and you find it creative genius when you get a hack photographer to perform some art school nonsense technique to get a 'ghost image', only to have someone print a gold stripe along the picture to denote it being precious (geddit?), then this book's for you. Personally I don't give a monkey's that Miranda Otto likes her shoulders, or some 'hobbit' actor likes his belly button. Revealing? Refreshing? Hardly! There is nothing here that the subjects don't want you to see.Melanie Dunea told CNN something along the lines of she \\"...was trying to capture someones' essence\\". Really sweetheart, we are not all 13-year-olds who believe that celebrities are 'awesome'. It might have been a touch less cringe-inducing if all the subjects had been nobodies, but then no one in LA would have bought it....and Nigel Parry wouldn't get his tearsheets would he?

Ya see, Kleck is a liberal Democrat. He is a member of the ACLU, Common Cause, Amnesty International and supports the typical liberal agendas. When he got done crunching the data he found results that shocked him. At a minimum, Americans use firearms 2.5 million times per year in direct, face to face defenses. And that is Kleck's admittedly conservative estimate. Additionally, only 1% of the time is the thug shot, and only 0.1% of all encountered thugs are killed. Remarkable restraint, I'd say. Good people just left alone.The bad news, Kleck received far fewer invitations to Florida State University cocktail parties. The good news, He won the Hindelang Award for the most significant work by a criminologist (in a whole bunch of years).I would suggest that most people who would consider buying &quot;Point Blank&quot; would be happier getting Klecks collaboration with Prof. Don Kates titled, &quot;The Great Gun Debate.&quot; It covers the same issues in a more digestible, less academic manner, and should be about half the price."},{"Title":"Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America (Social Institutions and Social Change)","review":"A rigorous and dispassionate statistical examination of a topic more often distinguished by emotion than reason, Mr Kleck has created a book that everyone interested in the suject of gun control should read, and which every second amendment advocate should own.&lt;P&gt;This comprehensive study starts with an examination of the ideological nature of arguement on the subject, and thoroughly examines the nature of gun ownership and use in the United States.&lt;P&gt;Supporters of gun control have tried and failed to impugn the integrity of the author, who owes allegiance to no vested interest, and who reached his conclusuion that gun ownership has a more positive than negative effect on society in spite of his own early leanings.&lt;P&gt;Thoroughly documented, Point Blank is a required reference book for anyone with the courage to set personal bias aside, and search for the truth."},{"Title":"Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America (Social Institutions and Social Change)","review":"Japan's low murder rate is often presented as a reason to copy their low rate of gun ownership.

(Which by the way isn't covered at all - other than the Cygwin program and why the author hates Windows so much.)This book uses the BASH shell almost exclusively with some \\"oh yea, this syntax won't work on the C Shell\\" thrown in.the Korn & Z Shells are treated like they don't even exist - and BASH is always the only way to go.The book at about Chapter 3 becomes more of a \\"look what i can do\\" and \\"here write this out in a text editor and save the file as this\\", without much explaInation as to why it happens that way and what the syntax introduced means. With some syntax being introduced in a script and never being explained or referenced at all.The terms the Author uses are as technical as you can get (like Palindromic Scripting\\" instead of saying a number reads the same forward and backwards (ex. 15851) or even symmetrical would have been a better term for a newbie. Luckily i know what Palindromic numbers are.Not a good book for Newbies ... too much un-explained out of nowhere syntax - related in the most technical terms the Author could find. It reads more like a technical manual on something ... not a how to learn from the ground up book. Your just as well off reading the MAN pages."},{"Title":"Beginning Shell Scripting (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This book seems to want to introduce all and everything under the sun, as as such, the book looses focus quite a bit. For example, the in the beginning the author introduces samples of python, perl, and tcl, talks about batch, and then introduces a variety of text editors for all platforms. Later in the next chapter, we learn how to launch a music player and then echo out text, and then how to setup variable in bourne shell, and the c shell. I am grateful for his enthusiasm on the topic, but feels like I'm on a roller coaster ride of scrambled ideas related to shell scripting.In looking forward to the chapter \\"Scripting with Files\\", I see some minor notes on chmod and file test conditionals for files. I don't see more advance topics like using find or stat or related topics, and instead we are presented with a conversation on Next file systems, Mac OS X file systems (UFS and HFS+). And on those topics, we get \\"gee that's neat to know\\" trivia, but it's totally useless, as there nothing on Mac specific commands like ditto or setfile to handle the Mac flavor of Unix.On one topic on \\"Controlling Processes\\", the author explains the concept of processes and shows a screen shot of a Windows Task Manager. I was thinking, that well, maybe this book offers something different by showing how to script with Windows specific commands, like tasklist, but nope, we only get the screen shot, and following discussion on ps command and the /proc directory on Linux.Overall, the book offers a lot of trivia on a variety of topics, and in some places there may be some scripts -- if you are lucky -- relating to the topic, and interspersed chaotically is some introduction material on shell scripting, sometimes bourne, sometimes c shell, sometimes something different. If this type of style works for you, then this might be the book, but I think for most of us, we'll want to follow more focused organized books relating to shell scripting (and of a particular scripting language, e.g. POSIX shell or other shell language)."},{"Title":"Beginning Shell Scripting (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"Shell scripting is one of those things I keep telling myself I need to learn but never quite get around to it. The Wrox book Beginning Shell Scripting by Eric Foster-Johnson, John C. Welsh, and Micah Anderson might be the book I end up using to get me there.Chapter List: Introducing Shells; Introducing Shell Scripts; Controlling How Scripts Run; Interacting With The Environment; Scripting With Files; Processing Text with sed; Processing Text with awk; Creating Command Pipelines; Controlling Processes; Shell Scripting Functions; Debugging Shell Scripts; Graphing Data With MRTG; Scripting For Administrators; Scripting For The Desktop; Answers To Exercises; Useful Commands; IndexThis book has something for just about every beginning user. As a \\"Beginning\\" Wrox book, it's meant to take you from no knowledge to basic competency. Normally when you think of shell scripts, you think Unix. But this book goes beyond that. The authors include just about every OS in their coverage. Unix and Linux users are obviously taken care of, as I'd expect. But they also address Mac OS X users so that they can start to delve under the covers of their operating system. They even include Windows users by having them download the Cygwin software. Overall, the focus is on the Bourne shell, but special features of the others (like C, bash, and Korn) are also addressed as they come up. Overall, you get coverage on just about everything you could want as a beginner.With the combination of \\"Try It Out\\" and \\"How It Works\\" examples in the book, beginners should quickly be able to do something with their new knowledge.

The stories are unrelated, and different in tone and content.The Brackett story, Nemesis from Terra, was originally written in 1944 as \\"Shadow Over Mars\\", and may have been rewritten to a degree for republishing: short of tracking down a Fall 1944 copy of Startling Stories Magazine and going through it line by line, who can tell? Its classic Brackett: a space-bum \\"hero\\", Rick Urquhart, with a heart of - not gold, exactly, perhaps copper. Maybe even lead. He's rough, mean, and the subject of a prophecy he will rule Mars, which is currently tired, corrupt, and decayed, with powerless native kings now largely in thrall to the parasitic Company mining it for commercial minerals. The prophecy is pretty thin, and we could probably use a little more backstory on Rick, and why he is apparently special, but once the plot gets moving, its only a very minor irritant. Its beautifully visualised though, to the dry hilltop cities that were once islands on the now-dry seabeds of the Martain plains.Rick comes up against villians of all kinds: its him against the whole of Mars, pretty much, and although the giant telepath Jaffa Storm of Mercury is Rick's particular nemesis, everyone else - except two women - is out to kill, hurt or thwart him. Everyone is well-written with shades of grey: one character who appears harmless is not what he seems at all, and there is always a degree a doubt about Rick's intentions. All up, this is a story that runs along and drags you with it, and even if it is not quite Brackett's best, its still pretty damn good.Silverberg's \\"Collision Course\\" is more \\"classic\\" sci-fi: set a thousand years in the future, man has conquered empty space at a sublight pace, and with matter transmitter technology, has an empire 800 light-years wide (ie 400 light years out from Earth each way). But expansion is limited by the sublight travel required to drop off a transmat pad, and when a new discovery offer super-luminal speed, well, humanity grasps it with both hands, and heads off into space...only to find its first alien species, which also has an empire of its own, and accordingly there is a need for a treaty to divide the universe.Suffice it to say, the ambassadorial expedition does not go to plan. And then things really fall apart, when on the trip home, our heroes get lost.There is a nominal protagonist here, but really the protagonist is humanity (or at least the male half of it: for all the governing council of Earth is multi-racial, and apparently the ship crew is too, they are noticeably all male without a woman in sight). Its noted how instaneous transit has changed humanity's perspectives, and there is a lot of that old-style optimism involved: for all that Earth is not alone, unexamined dreams of ruling the universe are not exactly put to one side forever. Its good, but not great. Three and a half stars, to go with 4.5 for Brackett, for 4 overall."},{"Title":"Developing USB PC Peripherals Using Intel 8X930AX USB Microcontroller","review":"If you're looking to work with USB, this book is way too out of date.

While you are reading it gets you thinking about who or what is behind what is happening the galaxy. My opinion of T'sart is he is a pain in the backside, but what do you expect from a Romulan. After finishing read book 1 recently I had to to start book 2 [not finished yet with book 2] to see how it ends up.

Please don't hurt me! :)I've read the complaints about it not having enough story for two books, etc. I thought it had enough story, although to save money I'd have prefer this was one big book. My mind was seeing this as an episode of the show, and I think the books allows things what the show cannot-other POVs, such as on the Defiant and Voyager. It emphasized how widespread the problem was.What I didn't like was the very end. It seemed too choppy for me. *SPOILERS!!!* It was a nice way to end the book, but I would have preferred a better explanation as to how the Federation and the Romulans came to the treaty. What did this treaty employ? Did Tobin choose to go home or to 'defect' anyway? What about Folan and the Tal Shiar? The alternate universes were cool, though. Captain *Robert* Picard?? The mind boggles at the possibilities. *END SPOILERS* I also felt there was a point where Data, Spock and Picard were out of character. I'd like to chalk it up to strain of the mission, but it seemed really out of place.As this duology was my second and third ST:TNG novel purchases, I'd have to say I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Maximum Warp Book Two: Forever Dark (Star Trek The Next Generation, No 63)","review":"I wanted to like this two book set, but ended up disappointed. There was such potential, but it was wasted. Picard and Spock working together. The Cold War between the Romulans and the Federation getting renewed after the Dominion War. Even a mention of a post-Sisko Deep Space Nine. Alas, the authors' reach exceeded their grasp.The action jumped from scene to scene with many loose ends left untied. What exactly was the point of the Lotre character? What did T'sart want with the device and why was he even in the book? Folan's actions had no consequences. And all the secondary characters and subplots: Tobin and Nien, the aforementioned DS9, the Klingons. All these elements were thrown together in one big stew without much organization.That said, I did like the Picard, Spock, Data interaction and the dialogue between Data, Riker, and Troi. In fact, I think Galanter and Brodeur have a real knack for writing for Data. Some of his scenes were downright amusing.But even that could not make up for the incomprehensible ending. All those theories and mysterious tools and omnipotent aliens were just too much to keep track of and I still don't understand what happened. I think some Trek authors have fallen in the same trap that many Star Wars writers fell into: the superweapon-of-the-week. It was just too big; I mean if the entire galaxy is threatened (or more), then wouldn't the Q or another of the omnipotent aliens have shown up to save themselves? And what was with the brief mention of the Guardian of Forever?One last nitpick for the publisher, not the authors: Do a better job of editing. I was continually jarred out of the story by bad spelling, bad grammar, and bad punctuation. Perhaps the Trek publication schedule is too full of mediocre books to do a good job of copy editing; cut some of the books or hire some more editors."},{"Title":"Maximum Warp Book Two: Forever Dark (Star Trek The Next Generation, No 63)","review":"book I: Dead ZoneThe first half of the \\"Maximum Warp\\" duology is a minor dissapointment.The story is based around an unoriginal concept about spatial disruptions that suddenly appear out of nowhere, causing ships to go wrecked as energy can't get transformed from one form into another in the disruption field to enable any kind of mechanical function. Curiously (and unexplainedly) enough, the phenomenon doesn't appear to effect any non-mechanical transformation of energy.This causes strain between the Romulans and the federation, as they both suspect the disruptions as a new and powerfull weapon.The book highly resembels Dave Galanter and Greg Brodeur's earlier Voyager novel Battle Lines in it's concentration on action instead of plot and characterization, wich ultimately leadst to rendering the book unrealistic.This can be seen especially in the field of characterization. The characters feel familiar enough, and the duo writes them talentedly, but there are times in the plot that would absolutely require heavy and deep exploration of one or more characters, but don't contain any. And speaking of characters, Spocs inclusion in the story is as unjustified as it can get, as he has absolutely nothing to do and appears to be there only to fill the pages with his presence and comments that any other characters could have expressed. This I call a true waste of potential, wich appears to be the only real theme of the story.The book succeeds in offering good science and sufficiently interesting original characters, though, and works at least somehow as a baggage of entertainment.After all this the book still feels mediocore and cheap, and it leaves the reader with a feeling of being underestimated.book II: Forever DarkAfter the first \\"Maximum Warp\\" book, the second half of the duology starts off really promisingly.The story holds together much better than in the forst book, there are more interesting siuations and even some sufficciently deepened character moments with both new and familiar characters.But soon starts the downhill as plot gives it all away to action as long and uneventfull space battles and other action-packed scenes take over the story, the plot gets predictable and characterization is forgotten.The ambitious but messy ending of the book ruins it all, as it stumbles on sci-fi clich&eacute;s and overly melodramatic climax.Leave the \\"Maximum Warp\\" duology to the bookstore and maybe borrow it from the library.

All of which is great. However, the 2-page-spread format is annoying! Instead, they should have each destination on the FRONT and BACK of 1 page, preferably with a perforation along the inner edge, so that you can simply tear out the page you want (or a couple of pages describing places near where you'll be), stick it in your pocket, and go. So you don't have to carry the whole book around the city with you. We actually ended up creating our own destination flash-cards by cutting, pasting, photocopying, and reassembling the pages. But that's a lot of work that the consumer shouldn't have to do in order to make a guidebook useful to him or her.It doesn't include ANY maps. And some of the location descriptions are bare addresses, which does not help a non-Roman to figure out where they are if they're not on main thoroughfares or in major piazzas.The destinations are organized alphabetically...in Italian. Great for pointing to the name when trying to indicate to a non-English speaker where you're trying to go, but HORRIBLE for non-Italian-speaking parents (and kids!) who are trying to use the book.My 7-year-old requests that I add to this review his own comment: \\"the red writing is hard to read and it doesn't tell you how to get to anywhere.\\""},{"Title":"Fodor's Around Rome with Kids, 1st Edition: 68 Great Things to Do Together (Around the City with Kids)","review":"Just returned from a trip to Rome with two kids and had this book in hand.

If you're interested in &quot;old time&quot; hockey from the 1960's which is when Bruce Hood started officiating professional hockey or like to get the inside story on the NHL up until the 80's this is a great book. The quality of writing is a little weak but Hood has some great stories about being a referee, traveling around the country, what players and coaches of his era said and how they acted.It's obvious Bruce Hood is a referee and not a writer, although he had some help with the book. Some readers might be bored when Hood wanders a little too far into his personal life but some might enjoy that aspect of the book."},{"Title":"Snow","review":"This is one of my favorite wordless picture books, depicting a small railroad station throughout a snowy day.

While Kate Flax's empathy and genuine desire to help others comes through on most pages, the book is a muddle of poor punctuation, listless writing, careless spelling errors (example: spelling Dr. Andrew Weil &quot;Dr. Wile&quot;), and generally could have benefited from the work of a proofreader or copyeditor. Flax writes that she is dyslexic, but surely someone could have read the manuscript before it was printed? The errors, which abound on every page, distracted this reader from an otherwise valuable and informative book. Despite the protestations of Natalie Goldberg and Anne Lamott, both of whom are mentioned in Flax's acknowledgments and both of whom have encouraged thousands of fledgling writers, not everyone is a writer. At the very least, this book proves that certainly not everyone is a proofreader. This book feels like a manuscript-length post in an online support group. The errors in form reflect poorly on the accuracy of the information contained in the book.

Each of the nine authors comments upon the people they saw, events, and various cultures of their time. These first-hand accounts are informative and interesting. I will focus in this review on the trip of Benjamin of Tudela, which was composed by a Jewish man, apparently a merchant, who visited quite a few countries, including what was then called Palestine, which is named Israel today. I also wrote a review of &#8220;The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela,&#8221; which I recommend to readers who are interested in this trip.Benjamin apparently lived from 1130 to 1173. Virtually nothing is known about his personal life. He is called Rabbi Benjamin in the beginning of his book, but this part of the book was most likely added after his death. There is no indication that he was a rabbi, although it is clear that he was educated. His trip began in 1165 from his hometown in Spain. He visited France, Germany, Italy, Constantinople, Baghdad, Persia, Africa, and many other places, a total of some 300 cities. He came to Asia about a hundred years before Marco Polo. He focuses for the most part on the Jewish population of the cities and mentions the number of Jews living in the cities and the Jewish leaders of the community, but he also speaks about non-Jews. His book is considered important because of the otherwise unknown information he gives about daily life in the middle ages.Some of the many interesting facts that Benjamin gives includes the following. The Jews of Constantinople were brutally oppressed, they weren&#8217;t even allowed to ride horses, but the king&#8217;s physician was Jew who was allowed to ride on a horse. In Cyprus, there were Jews who followed the ancient biblical practice where the day begins at day break, rather than the current Jewish view that it starts at sundown, and they observed the Sabbath from Saturday morning until Sunday morning. He wrote that Jews bring the bones of their dead to Hebron, the traditional burial place of Abraham and the other patriarchs and matriarchs, so that they can be buried near these saintly people.While much of Benjamin&#8217;s reports are correct, his book is also filled with incorrect information. He thought that the Western Wall in Jerusalem, which we know was the outer wall of the Temple Court, was an inner wall, the wall of the temple&#8217;s holy of holies. He saw a salt pillar near the Dead Sea and was told it was the pillar of Lot&#8217;s wife, from the time she was turned into salt, when she looked back at the destruction of the city of Sodom, and he believed what he was told. In Damascus, he believed a report that a mosque was partially made out of the wood from the biblical Noah&#8217;s ark. He was told and believed that the Pope in Rome had Jewish advisors; the Roman emperor Galba had a palace that was three miles long and had 360 windows equal to the number of days in a year; Rome had two copper pillars built by King Solomon which sweated or wept each year on the ninth day of the Hebrew month Ab, the traditional date on which the Jerusalem temples were destroyed in 586 BCE and 70 CE; the ancient Egyptian pyramids were constructed by magic; and the legendary King Romulus, the founder of Rome, feared the Israelite King David. Thus, it should be clear that along with facts accepted by scholars as being true, there were many superstitions in Benjamin&#8217;s account that were most likely untrue.Benjamin&#8217;s fascinating story of the life and death of David Alroy is the principle source about this pseudo-messiah. See my review of Benjamin Disraeli&#8217;s novel &#8220;Alroy&#8221; for information about this &#8220;prince of the captivity.&#8221;"},{"Title":"The spy;: A tale of the neutral ground,","review":"For the bulk of the novel, Fennimore Cooper seems to spin his literary wheels attempting to develop depth into his characters. Failing miserably, the plot quickens and the novel becomes more entertaining, although hardly believable. The ultimate reason for the danger in the book becomes rather silly, but still there is some redeaming quality to the novel. This was basically Fennimore Cooper's first attempt at an American novel and so some tolerance is warrented. I shall try the next book, The Pioneers, in time."},{"Title":"The spy;: A tale of the neutral ground,","review":"The plot of this book is based on a real spy story. Therefore, although some do consider it unbelievable, the basis of it is entirely true. The way that the author slowly brings out the character of Harvey Birch is wonderful. He creates numerous sub plots that make the story very interesting. The only weakness is the fact that the author was rushed into stopping the story abruptly. As a result, one hears no more about many important characters until the very end when some are fleetingly mentioned. The ending is so strong, however, that this fault isn't as glaring as it would have been."},{"Title":"The spy;: A tale of the neutral ground,","review":"In his second novel, James Fenimore Cooper forces readers into the minds and mentalities of his characters, while practically bringing the readers to the scene with his excellent writing ability. Both of these things help to establish the basic ideas in the novel and make it easier to understand.The story takes place during the heart of the American Revolution in 1780 on the neutral ground of Westchester County, New York. Harvey Birch is an American spy wrongly suspected by Patriots to be a spy for the British. Harvey meets a family named the Whartons, who are torn apart by the war. Throughout the story, Harvey helps the family by trying to save Henry Wharton, a British Spy, while he himself has to evade both the Continental Army and American guerrillas. In the end, George Washington offers the spy a reward, but Harvey refuses because he was motivated by his love for his country, and not by money.Though it may seem unbelievable, the basis for the story of The Spy is actually true. There are even real characters, including General George Washington. The plot was very complex, growing thicker and thicker, containing many subplots which enhanced the entertainment value of the book. There were some very significant ideas in this novel, such as the elder Wharton's neutrality during the war which held his family together. There were also some confusing events, including Harvey Birch's sudden change of mind while handing his pardon note to Major Dunwoodie. Another puzzling aspect of the story was how the Continental Army still suspected Birch to be a spy for the British even after seeing all his pro-patriot actions. This book would be great for historians, history teachers, or war fanatics, but Cooper's sophisticated language would be more difficult for high school students."},{"Title":"The spy;: A tale of the neutral ground,","review":"THE SPY appeared in December of 1821, 189 years ago as I write this. Why in the world would anyone want to read a novel written nearly two centuries ago? First of all, I submit that the age of a book is pretty much immaterial. Until one has read it, a book is always new to each of its readers. Secondly, THE SPY is very simply an intriguing story, which brings us to one of the two reasons that I thoroughly enjoy it:The story line of the book is as interesting as that of any modern spy novel, probably better in fact. Take this mysterious peddler, Harvey Birch. He is widely believed to be a spy for the British, but where do his loyalties truly lie? What real identity underlies Harper, the stranger driven to the Whartons' home by the storm? Beyond the mysteries lie other fascinating plot threads, for even in the midst of war love exists, both true as in the case of Major Dunwoodie and false as in the person of the British Colonel Wellmere.Beyond its gripping story line, I also found THE SPY most enjoyable reading for what I'll call its educational aspects. Although it is a novel and therefore fictional, I believe it does rather accurately bring out aspects of the American Revolution that are often ignored in American history classes. As happened again eighty-four years later in the War Between the States, the Revolution saw many families whose members were divided in their loyalties. Not all of the colonists were in favor of American independence by any means. Many remained loyal to King George, while many others strove to maintain neutrality in the hope of preserving their property from confiscation or destruction by either side. All of these sundry positions find expression through various characters in THE SPY.Another aspect of the Revolution of which I was hitherto unaware was the existence of irregular armed groups that roamed the countryside amidst the lawlessness of war, ostensibly supporting one side or the other but often more self-serving than anything else. Neither the Skinners (supposedly supporters of the revolutionaries) nor the Cowboys and Refugees (supporters of British loyalists) were particularly trustworthy or observant of any \\"rules of war,\\" pillaging and burning at their own whims. As with probably any war, things were not quite as neat and orderly as history textbooks make them appear. Bits of historical reality such as this leave the reader not only entertained but also a little bit wiser of our nation's beginnings.To balance the review, I must add a couple of characteristics of Cooper's writing that were a bit distracting, although neither can be called a weakness given the stylistic and social conventions of the time. Early 19th Century writers were not as direct and concise as are modern authors, and the use of rather stilted phrases in lieu of precise nouns was an expected norm. Hence, instead of the single word \\"doctor,\\" we find \\"disciple of Aesculapius\\" and such like. More distracting, though quite explicable in light of evolving social norms, are the descriptions and actions of the female characters, who exemplify the now-outmoded traits of the \\"weakness of their sex\\" and are controlled by conventions of \\"propriety\\" that the contemporary reader now finds ludicrous. I mention these not to dissuade anyone from reading THE SPY but merely to prepare one to encounter them.All in all, the novel remains as intriguing and captivating as at any time in its 189 year existence, and I heartily recommend it to any reader interested in a fresh, and probably very realistic, view of the American Revolution as well as anyone who just enjoys a good, adventurous mystery story."},{"Title":"The spy;: A tale of the neutral ground,","review":"Cooper's second novel and first important book is filled with things that aren't what they seem to be: people in disguise, others claiming things about themselves that aren't true, laws that appear to be unfair, unpatriotic patriots, etc. Set during the Revolutionary War in a sort of no-man's land (Cooper calls it the \\"neutral ground\\") north of New York City, where both patriots and English sympathizers intermingle and are more likely to be out for themselves than supportive of either side, the story centers around Harvey Birch, thought by all to be a British spy, but who is actually just the opposite: he's spying for George Washington, who appears in disguise as Mr. Harper. Washington is staying with Henry Wharton, a British sympathizer. Wharton has two daughters who provide the \\"love interest\\" of the novel (one is about to marry Colonel Wellmere, who, it's discovered just in time, is already married). Wharton's son, who is about to be hanged as a British spy, is \\"allowed\\" to escape by Washington as a favor to Wharton for his hospitality. Cooper's theme is moral ambiguity in the face of unfolding events, though individual characters do make clear decisions based on their beliefs, most of which have nothing to do with the war. Birch in particular acts with unflinching honor in spite of what most think of him. Although the novel at times can feel stiff, Cooper's story is animated and well- dramatized. Not as good as any of the Leatherstocking tales or some of his sea novels, but better than quite a number of his other books."},{"Title":"The spy;: A tale of the neutral ground,","review":"THE SPY, America's first historical novel, is set in late 1780. It plays out in New York's Westchester County, \\"the neutral ground\\" between the British forces occupying Manhattan and the American rebels further up the Hudson River. It is not long after the capture and execution under order of General George Washington of out-of-uniform British officer Major John Andre. It is a tough time to be a spy -- for either side.The novel has two principal characters: an American double-agent and his handler.The former is Harvey Birch, a wandering peddler, suspected far and wide of being a British agent. He lives in Westchester County with his ancient father, John Birch, and their housekeeper. American forces have arrested him more than once, but he has escaped, perhaps under command influence. He is under a death warrant, if caught by the Americans.The latter lead character calls himself Mr. Harper. He is tall and has the upper classes about him though he does not wear a wig. Harper looks about fifty.We meet Harper in THE SPY'S first sentence: \\"It was near the close of the year 1780, that a solitary traveller was seen pursuing his way through one of the numerous little valleys of West-Chester.\\" He is dressed as a civilian and sits astride on a mighty horse. He takes shelter from a raging storm in \\"The Locusts,\\" country home of Mr. Wharton, a man somewhat older than Harper. Wharton is wealthy, pro-British, but a political trimmer who hopes (for the sake of not losing his extensive holdings) to seem at least politically neutral to the Americans, in case they ultimately win.There are also two Wharton daughters on hand that evening. A son, Henry, a British officer based in Manhattan, visits his family in disguise carrying a forged pass from George Washington. The peddler Harvey Birch arrives with goods to tempt the ladies. One of the daughters is pro-American and is in love with handsome Major Dunwoodie of the Virginia forces. The older girl loves a rascally British Colonel, whom she does not know to be an intending bigamist.All the elements of the novel are in place that evening. The characters go on with their lives, harried by two irregular armed forces: pro-British Cow-Boys and pro-American Skinners.The story is about the American revolutionary patriotism of Birch and Harper. Over time we learn Harper's real identity and see his national reputation grow until by the time of the War of 1812 when he is dead and gone, he almost equals the gods. Harvey Birch is equally the American patriot but is, by contrast with Harper, condemned forever to hide his true identity as a loyal American who only betrayed to the British what Harper ordered him to reveal.When the ancient Harvey Birch falls after being drawn into a fight against the British near Niagara Falls on July 25, 1814, he had just made the acquaintance of two young American officers. One is Captain Wharton Dunwoodie, son of the pro-American Wharton daughter of 1780. Harvey recalls her to her son as \\"an angel.\\" Harvey's corpse is found after the fight by Captain Dunwoodie. A bullet had pierced a tin container under Birch's clothing en route to his heart. In the case is an aging testament from none less than George Washington to \\"Harvey Birch ... for many years a faithful and unrequited servant of his country. Though man does not, may God reward him for his conduct!\\" (Ch. xxxv)There is a view among scholars that celibate or childless heroes of Fenimore Cooper stand outside, even above time. They beget no sons to bind their generation to the next. George Washington and Harvey Birch were two such men. History, however goes forward dialectically through the marriage of the slave-holding Virginian Dunwoodie to the daughter of a wavering New York Tory. Their son, Captain Wharton Dunwoodie, representing, America's unique future, is the first to learn the patriotic truth about a master spy who had long before done much to make his parents' wedding possible.This review offers a little bit about THE SPY's beginning and end. There is much, much more in between, including other characters, black and white, whom you will enjoy meeting. And you may also find yourself asking more than once: \\"Just who is this mysterious Mr. Harper?\\" -OOO-"},{"Title":"The spy;: A tale of the neutral ground,","review":"As an English teacher, I have had trouble over the years finding a novel that could be classified as a classic--or even a well-done movie--about the American Revolution. Cooper's *The Spy* can go some distance toward filling that gap, but it is perhaps the characterization of Caesar, the slave, that has made the book undesirable in today's classroom. Certainly it shows condescension toward Africans, but there is also a great conversation in the book regarding the hypocrisy of fighting for freedom while holding slaves, and Caesar becomes central to the plot more than once in this story. The novel shows how, as in the Civil War, families were divided, enemies mingled, and rowdies loyal to no one wreaked havoc in the countryside. The use of disguise and/or deception is key in this novel: I can count 8 off the top of my head. Things are not what they seem, which, of course, is Cooper's main point as he labors to enshrine the memory of those who allowed themselves to be hated by their American neighbors in order to aid the American cause. Cooper's characterization is not as strong in this novel as what he later achieved with Natty Bumppo, but *The Spy* fills the gap of the missing classic of the Revolutionary period in American literature and should not be left simply to gather dust."},{"Title":"The spy;: A tale of the neutral ground,","review":"Some of my ancestors lived in the area that this book describes. They defended their property and fought against the British army and cattle thieves (\\"cowboys\\"). Reading this book helped me picture how it must have been for them at that delicate time in our country's history. The story is entertaining even if the plot is somewhat straightforward."},{"Title":"The spy;: A tale of the neutral ground,","review":"James Fenimore Cooper (1789-1851) has been called the American Sir Walter Scott. Like Scott he wrote of his native land. In his great Leatherstocking Tales and in this early novel he explores life in the early American nation.The Spy deals with the exciting and sad life of Harvey Birch a pedlar living in Westchester County New York during the Revolutionary War. This was a neutral area in which a civil war was in progress between Loyalists favoring Great Britain and the colonists fighting to create the United States of America. Harvey was a spy for Washington though he was widely thought to be a Loyalist agent spying on Washington's beleagured army. There are several times in the novel when the reader believes Birch will be hanged. Due to his skill in disguise and quick talking he always escapes.The major focus is on the Wharton family. The father favors the English remaining loyal to George III. His oldest daughter Sarah falls in love with an bigamy minded British officer named Wellmere. It is discovered that he has a wife and family back home in England. Sarah becomes mentally ill when she learns this shattering news on the eve of her wedding. Wharton's youngest daughter Frances is in love with Colonel Dunwoodie an officer in the American army Henry Wharton the only son is a British officer who is saved from being hanged as a spy by the exertions of Henry Birch. The book is filled with disguises as spying goes on in this battleground of blood and death. Cooper includes a few battle scenes. The book ends with Harvey Birch being shot to death during the battle of Lundy Lane in the War of 1812. Until a note from George Washington is discovered on Birch's body he had been thought to be a British agent. Instead, Cooper celebrates the patriotism of Birch. The best scene occurs when Birch refuses to accept money for his efforts from the hand of George Washington. Washington appears in the novel as \\"Harper\\" who visits the Wharton family as the novel begins with his exciting flight for freedom from the British finding safe haven in the comfortable home of the Wharton family.Cooper is much mailnged for his ridiculous plotting, fabulous escapes and stilted sytle. Despite these faults this is a good book worthy of being read and enjoyed. Cooper was our first great American novelist who is deserving of being read. His romance novels of a distant time and place are part of our American literary tradition."},{"Title":"The spy;: A tale of the neutral ground,","review":"The is here adventure enough and romance for all.A visit home to see the family turns badfor a British Captain of Infantry.A peddler ans a gentleman stranger are what the plot turns on.Here are \\"Cowboys\\" as mounted British soldiers before the moderncowboy was thought of.Here are spies and daring escapes in the middle of raging war.All this takes in rural 1780's New York.It isn't as good or as bad as some of Cooper's writing,but it is well told with some surprises along the way."},{"Title":"The spy;: A tale of the neutral ground,","review":"This was Cooper's second novel and his first success (his first novel, \\"Precaution\\" is still in print but little read, deservedly, by all accounts). America wanted its own Walter Scott, its own in-house novelist, and at the same time it was busy mythologizing the Revolution. So Cooper and \\"The Spy\\" were opportune. He was consciously attempting to emulate Scott but, although he writes quite well, he lacks Scott's lyricism. Also, he was not yet into his stride as a storyteller and so, for example, conflicts are resolved too soon and sub-plots remain undeveloped.Although \\"The Spy\\" was inspired by ('Based on' is too strong a characterization) events surrounding the Major Andre affair, the connection is tenuous, and even though real historical characters, including a most implausible George Washington, make an appearance, the historical accuracy is slight. It is a version of events that the American public wanted to hear. Probably it still is. In fact, Mel Gibson will probably one day expunge all vestiges of authenticity from it and turn it into a movie.It is interesting to note the discussion on slavery that takes place between the British and American protagonists, and also the author's treatment of the black characters. Written between the Revolution and the Civil War, it reflects the attitudes of its time.If you do decide to read it, I recommend the Penguin edition, as it has a very good introduction."},{"Title":"Inspiring Interiors from Armstrong 1950s","review":"What sort of rooms did middle-class America live in during the fifties? Just have a look at the 250 room-set photos in this fascinating book. The advertising folk at Armstrong Tiles had the neat idea of showing the companies product as part of a room set to inspire home owners. These photos were used in their ads in the leading consumer magazines of the period. The photos are sharp, well-lit with no deep shadows, everything had to be visible and they capture the time between mom just cleaning the house and the folks arriving! I find the many kitchen and bathroom shots the most interesting, living in London during the fifties my parents would have loved to have such units and facilities. This book and the companion volume on the sixties, are a wonderful reminder of how we lived in the recent past. Although it does not detract from the photos the typography and presentation are rather bland.***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover."},{"Title":"Inspiring Interiors from Armstrong 1950s","review":"I've had \\"Inspiring Interiors\\" for several years and now give it to friends with 50's design interests.This book is a collection of interior photos and artist's drawing from Armstong Flooring ads covering 1940's through 50's. Although flooring was originally Armstrong's point of interest in the ads, the reader has a virtual goldmine of Mid Century Modern floor plans, art, lighting and furniture.Unlike my other other antique/collectable books which focus on individual pieces and their histories, \\"Inspiring Interiors\\" gives great resource for pulling all the design points together.This is undoubtedly one of my favorite and most useful collectables books! The only downside is that furniture/lighting/etc isn't specifically identified but if you have more resource books, it's not a problem.I used this book almost exclusively for my 1950's vintage kitchen renovation back in 2004. Amazingly, I found my restored 1948 Hotpoint stove on page 18.Great book."},{"Title":"Inspiring Interiors from Armstrong 1950s","review":"This book has excellent design ideas from the 1950's. Great color usage, storage ideas and showing all types of rooms. Love this book!"},{"Title":"Inspiring Interiors from Armstrong 1950s","review":"Fantastic book that has great decorating ideas for your vintage 50s home. 50s designers were hired to 'dress' a room to flatter the Armstrong flooring featured in the ad: expect Heywood Wakefield and other furniture designers to pop up from time to time. Well worth the money, this is a great 50s sourcebook you'll turn to again and again when decorating your mid-century home in true 50s style."},{"Title":"Inspiring Interiors from Armstrong 1950s","review":"AS A KID OF THE FIFTIES I REMEMBER MY MOM ALWAYS HAVING A BUNCH OF HOME MAGAZINES ON THE COFFEE TABLE.THIS BOOK CAPTURES THAT ERA AND BRINGS IT BACK TO LIFE.MANY OF THE IDEA ROOMS SHOWN WOULD BE CONSIDERED TACKY BY TODAYS STANDARDS BUT WERE EXQUISITE BACK THEN.

But not all of them. My favorite part of the book is the chapter on family rooms, recreation rooms and dens. That chapter is better. This is worth having if you are interested in 1950's interiors, but just be prepared for a lot of tacky rooms. There are enough rooms that are not tacky to make the book worth while, at least for me."},{"Title":"Inspiring Interiors from Armstrong 1950s","review":"Initallly I thought this was going to be a book of mid-century furniture. Boy was I ever wrong. If you want to see 50's bad taste here is your chance."},{"Title":"The Midnight Man","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated bedtime picture book with a short poetical text. It features the dream travels of a boy and his dog as they follow the Midnight Man with his sack of stars. When this mysterious stranger leaves them in his tracks as he continues on his starry way to the midnight land the gentle, motherly full moon sees them safely home. The short text is just the right amount of \\"tuck me in\\" attention that will make a little one feel snug and safe before going off to sleep and the pictures are shadowy blue, green and peaceful and sprinkled with starlight.

Authentic feel, easy to read, everything you hoped for when you said to yourself, &quot;there must be more to the Legends than this!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Unknown Arthur: Forgotten Tales of the Round Table","review":"A very entertaining book! 12 very obscure (to most) stories of Arthur and his knights. Written in modern prose, but not completely omitting the flavor of middle ages romances, this is a collection of stories that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. These aren't the stories in Mallory or other famous retellers. Chances are, if you're not an Arthurian researcher, you won't have even heard of half the stories within. This book has wide appeal...especially if you'd like an insight into what tales entertained the people of olden days. Some are dark and cold, some are heroic and rousing. The best part is that all stories are sourced - if you wish to read more, or in the original text's format, the author points you in the right direction. Definately, this book is worth the price."},{"Title":"Anthropology: The Exploration of Human Diversity","review":"This book is great for beginning anthropology students or people who just want to learn a little more about it! Basically, the author hits the main points (kinship, culture, primates, language, etc.) in an extremely easy to understand fashion. There are clear, concise definitions throughout, which I found to be very helpful when using it in the college classroom. Overall, a great choice for an introduction to the study of anthropology!"},{"Title":"Anthropology: The Exploration of Human Diversity","review":"Kottak is a model for scientific writers.

She woke up worring about school. She came home woring about homework. She went to sleep worring about not sleeping well enough. Until this book...Lori Lite manages to take simple concepts and weave them with her creative magic. She takes a cute Caterpillar and teaches children how to relax and unwind and deal with stress and anxiety.The transition my daughter has gone through is amazing. I was almost at the point of considering medication to help her deal with anxiety but thankfuly her books came to the rescue.I hope Lori continues to write more books and I recommend all of her books and especially her CD Indigo Dreams for our children.Maybe she can write some for adults."},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"I am a stress consultant and work with children frequently.\\"The Goodnight Caterpillar\\" is the \\"Goodnight Moon\\" for the new millennium. This is the only relaxation book I know that actually tells a story where the listener gets to follow along and implement a proven relaxation technique with the characters.Kids love this story and I am amazed at how the children learn the techniqueof muscular relaxation without a lesson. This is an excellent way for children to manage stress, anxiety and fears.This book is destined to become a classic bedtime story that will be relaxing children through the next millennium."},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"First I will begin by listing the programs/CD's/books that I have purchased from Lite Books. 4 books: A Boy and a Bear, The Affirmation Web, A Boy and a Turtle and The Goodnight Caterpillar plus 5 audio CDs: Indigo Dreams, Indigo Ocean Dreams, Indigo Dreams: Garden of Wellness, Indigo Teen Dreams and Indigo Dreams: Adult Relaxation plus: Children's Stress Awareness Curriculum Designed for Youth Education.Next I will say \\"THEY ARE ALL AMAZING!\\" For 9 years I worked as an advocate for children in a homeless shelter for women and children. I was constantly challenged with finding resources that were short, effective, and held the attention of the children. I was able to find resources but not all in one spot, I had to piece a little of this and a little of that to reach a fully rounded program that worked. The tools that Lori Lite created within each book and each CD offer short, highly effective programs that hold the attention of children. And best of all it is a package deal! You do not have to pull from any other program because the tools that she gives you are all you need. I am now an HHP and use the books and CD's when working with children of any age to simply give them powerful tools that they can use in daily life and hopefully carry into teen and adult hood. In my opinion Lite Books offer the best resources available to the health and wellness of children on the market. Within my own life I use the CD's as a nightly staple within the bedtime process of my children. They have not been able to stay awake long enough to finish even one of the stories on the CD yet. That is how relaxing the CD's are. For myself I have to stay sitting up when tucking them in and listening with them because if I get comfortable I am waking up in the middle of the night still in my kid's room! During daylight hours and when my children are well rested I have worked each session on the CD's with them from beginning to end. Now when they are feeling overwhelmed, frightened, angry etc... I will see them use the techniques they have learned through Loris programs, they move quickly from the negative feeling to a positive approach and positive result.Lite Books offers professional and friendly customer service, with great shipping time. I am so grateful to have found this amazing resource and look forward to being one of their strongest professional advocates as well as personal customers!"},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"This story adds a new spin on an old journey! A caterpillar too stressed out to see clearly and too ridden with anxiety to accomplish the task ahead of him is shown how to relax by himself! In addition to this being my child's absolute favorite bedtime story,it is the favorite of her first grade class. I read to the class once a month and even though I bring other books, they always ask me to read this one. The class is intrigued by the caterpillar and the bright water color illustrations. They love to relax with the adorable caterpillar.I especially like the author's choice of vocabulary. Kids today are smarter than we think and they appreciate being spoken to in an intelligent manner. If the occasional child is challenged by words like, \\"nourished, confident, and accomplish,\\" then it is a perfect opportunity to teach them the meaning of these wonderful words that are meant to fortify our children's minds and bodies. In today's stressed out, rush about world, this book should be mandatory!"},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"i fall asleep each night while reading this to my children! they love it, i love it, and it works! both children ask for it at bedtime, during anxious times, or anytime they feel a need to take a break for a moment. highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"I am an elementary school teacher, and a grandmother. I have used this book extensively to teach my young grandchildren to relax into sleep. Although this is a bedtime story, I have also used it in my 4th grade classroom as a way to relax children before we begin any high stakes testing. The more I have repeated this exercise, the better the children learn and the better they test out. Even the children have noticed the difference when we read this book and when we don't. This is a fabulous addition to my curriculum."},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"I teach meditation classes to children ages 5 and up.

They never get tired of hearing it and I never get tired of reading it. I have a 7 year old who suffers from severe food allergies and deals with a lot of stress on a daily basis, this book has done wonders for him. Not only is it a great bedtime story that helps them relax ( me too... ) it teaches a lesson that they can use throughout their lives. I highly recommend this book to every parent.

I purchased the set including this book \\"The Goodnight Caterpillar\\". My daughter listened to the CD as she read the books and loved them. The first night I read her this story she de-stressed and was very relaxed. She feel asleep almost instantly. I have also noticed better coping with her stress during the day. We have only had the books for a week but they are just the tool I needed to help my daughter with her anxiety and stress."},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"I have had this book for 1 week. My daughter is 8 y.o. with ADHD and bedtime has been a struggle for a very long time. She found every excuse to get up, sneak to play under covers, anything but sleep. Every night since I've gotten this book, she has been able to relax enough to let herself get sleepy. By the middle of the book she is yawning and by the end of the book she is ready to snuggle up in her own cocoon and say goodnight. Just for good measure, I play a relaxation CD after the story and she doesn't even make it through the first track on the CD. I am VERY pleased with this book and I will be purchasing more from Indigo Dreams."},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"Book was easy to read and undestand and my daughter liked it.

Now when I was buying it I seriously did not belive that my son will fall asleep reading it, just thought it might be something nice to read to him before bed.Now let me tell you something about my son, he does not like to sleep.If possible he will stay awake till 12 at night !! I know it is shocking and then he will wake up early in the morning. How he does it I do not know. So when I read this book, the first night he fell asleep before \\"his time\\" ,even before I finished the book. I thought maybe it was a coincidence, after all he did run around a lot that day and maybe he was just tired.However, every night since then he has fallen asleep either before the book has finished or just after I finish reading.This book is magic. I do admit that this book does relax me a little too.Thanks Lori Lite."},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"I use this book with clients (child and challenged adults) in psychotherapy, as well as with my 4 and 6 yr. old children.

My 8 year old son loves it (we bought it when he was7). It's tough to relax and unwind after a long day at school and we wanted something to help him do just that before going to bed. He unwinds soooo much after reading this book ~ you can see the stress leaving his little body! It helps mom and dad too! Muscle relaxtion is essential in promoting relaxation ~ we have found he wakes up less frequently during the night. It's wonderful to have him be able to read this book himself, should he feel the need, if he awakens during the night (or any other time).

Her Anxiety can keep her from doing things she really wants to. Going to bed has always been an issue in our home. She becomes very aggitated and anxious at bedtime. I bought the book \\"The Goodnight Catapillar\\" and it has helped alot. She has learned to relax her body in bed as the Catapillar does in the book. The pictures are beautiful and she actually catches things I as her mother don't such as in each page as the catapillar relaxes his hands become straight and relaxed. I would reccomend this book to anyone whose child has a hard time going to bed at night!"},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"I bought this book for my five year old son, who has anxiety disorder. He was having difficulty sleeping at night, due to anxiety about the next days' events (school, soccer, etc). We read this book together each night and he says he can feel himself relaxing, \\"just like the caterpillar in the book, mom!\\" He's sleeping really well most nights and his teacher says he uses the deep breathing techniques at school when things seem overwhelming for him.The story line is pretty basic and if you can pair this with actually growing caterpillars, the book really comes to life. It's age appropriate, too, with something for kids of all ages. I even relax while I read it!"},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"My recent purchase of The Goodnight Catepillar by Lori Light was prompted by my 2 yo daughter's difficulty finding sleep at the end of the day. Since receiving the book, I find the nights we choose \\"the Catepillar book\\" result in quicker, deeper sleep for her. As an added bonus, my husband finds 10-15 mins relaxation too as he and my daughter lay side by side to relax. I recommend it to 2+ with the caveat that the 2 yo will have difficulty embracing the whole concept of breathing and relaxing but will like the tone and pace of the story."},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"I love this author I have almost all her books and cds I gave all the kids in my family her books and cds this year my niece cant wait to get home from school to listen to her cds and all the parents were thrilled to actually have a fun way to help their kids learn about relaxation."},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"As a mother of a 9 year-old ADHD daughter, I found this story to be an excellent way to teach relaxation techniques. My daughter is always rushing through her homework assignments, chores and school projects. This unique story teaches children to slow down and use the same relaxation and stress management techniques for their everyday projects and life experiences as the turtle used in this story. I find it so difficult to select good stories for my daughter that will keep her focus and attention. \\"The Goodnight Caterpillar\\" has all the qualities that I look for.

We've tried *everything* with our reluctant sleeper (age 5) -- to no avail. I was getting very, very desperate for a full night's sleep. I just could not believe that one book would solve the problem, but it is.Night one, he half-listened to the story and half did his own thing. No clear improvement. By night three, he was requesting it as part of his bedtime routine. By night five, he was demanding it. And his sleep is improving. We're down to one or at most two trips out of his room after lights out. Amazingly, most for the bathroom, not for extra snuggles or reassurance that everything is okay from us. He doesn't have bags under his eyes anymore and neither do we.He even asks for it during the day if he feels like he's getting out of control (his phrasing, not mine). It's working for our child because the story is interesting without being too interesting (meaning that he doesn't *have* to see the pictures every single time or get super caught up in the story line) and he focuses on the relaxation part of the reading.This is an excellent introduction to guided relaxation for kids! It's now going to be added to my list of books to give to friends with kids."},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"The other day I was babysitting my 4 year-old granddaughter. She hates naps and frequently asks, \\"Do I have to take a nap today?\\" Each time I say, \\"Yes.\\" That's it. Nothing more. Just \\"Yes.\\"Last Thursday after lunch, I picked up Lori Lite's book, The Goodnight Caterpillar. Allyssa jumped on the sofa beside me. She insisted on seeing each colorful picture.If you've ever thought you get stressed and tied up in knots you should see Lori's caterpillar. But with systematic relaxation and the voice of a little red haired girl looking a bit like Raggity Ann, he settled down to rest. So did my granddaughter.After the story she went to her room, climbed into bed, and took a 2 hour nap.I suggest you look into Lori Lite's relaxation system. When children learn how to relax at an early age they learn a gift for life. Lori gives you just what you need to teach your kids.

My daughter was thrilled, as it really works, however, she encountered a problem when her daughter continually became disgruntled by the illustration of the red-haired girl. The three-year old didn't like the illustration of the little girl from the first reading and stated her disapproval. After hearing her out, my daughter encouraged her to enjoy the book regardless of the illustration she disliked. That worked for a while, but as they say, all good things come to an end. One night the granddaughter refused to &#34;look at that girl anymore&#34; even though she likes the story line! UGH! Her adamant refusal to ever look at the book again made me think of the mantra to selling real estate: location, location, location. For children's books that mantra must be illustration, illustration, illustration...Thankfully, the granddaughter now goes to bed with no problem, so we think the book played its rightful and intended role excellently, but my daughter and I both agreed the illustration of the little girl could have been much better."},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"For people practicing hypnosis, the goodnight caterpillar is basically an indirect relaxation induction also teaching a very simple strategy.So not so bad but fits only to max. 5 years old (mostly due to the obviousness of the goal behind the story)."},{"Title":"The Goodnight Caterpillar: Relaxation/Stress Management bedtime story for children improve sleep, manage stress, anxiety","review":"They don't come out and say it, but what this book is doing is teaching children how to meditate: to get out of the thinking mind and into feeling the body.

My daughter, who is 3 years old, like it and it seems to calm her down. She doesn't usually fall asleep as I am reading it to her but she will visibly relax. My only critique is that I would prolong the breathing sequence and the relaxing body parts sequence. For the each body part,I have my daughter shake out the part (for arms & legs), let it drift slowly down to the bed, and then repeat the \\"relax the (part),\\" several times as her part relaxes. For the ankles/feet/hands, I have her rotate them a few times before resting them down.

The siblings bear such a strong family resemblance that they are nearly indistinguishable, particularly since they are all apparently very close in age. Tightly knit, and dressed in old-fashioned clothing, the family thrives on the abundant vegetation they gather in the forest, trading the excess for the few necessities they cannot make themselves.Dave becomes enamored of the lovely Molly, and is delighted when she consents to marry him. So are the Perdrys, who encourage them to wed immediately. While Chip privately wonders how the young couple will fare, he is unexpectedly supportive of their union.The two decide to honeymoon by camping in the woods, and it is there that Dave begins to notice his bride's unusual traits. Molly is terrified of being alone; frightened of cats, dogs and foxes; and dislikes cooking and eating meat. These peculiarities become even more apparent as the young people begin their married life together, and Dave finally loses patience when Molly runs home to her family after he asks her to prepare three freshly killed chickens for a dinner guest.Molly's lengthy absence leaves Dave ample time to ponder her mysterious family, Chip's admonitions, and the strange magic of the Enchanted.

Will Molly ever return, and will Dave ever solve the riddle of her origins?This lovely, lyrical and unusual romance is beautifully and memorably told by Elizabeth Coatsworth, and is suitable for all ages."},{"Title":"The Enchanted: An incredible tale","review":"A man moves into the Maine wilderness to work a small farm by himself. His only neighbors are a friendly old hermit, and a loving although flighty couple and their pretty daughters. The man falls in love with one of the daughters, marries her, and then begins to suspect that she might not be exactly what he thought....The story is basic, but absolutely magical, one of the great achievements of perfect tone I've ever read for any audience. It brings to mind classic fairy tales, Japanese spirit lore, and Henry David Thoreau; it never misses a note, and it made me want to move out into the woods immediately. I read it once as a young kid, and felt it was just too intensely magical to ever read again--I remember it seeming too powerful, too genuinely magical, even to pick up. Recently, I re-read it to my four-year-old daughter, and I was not disappointed. Both of us loved it.How have I never heard about this author from anyone else? Are her other books this good? I'm always looking for great children's authors--for writers who, despite writing for younger audiences, don't feel the need to be crass or dumb or overly simplistic, but who instead recognize the magical-feeling dream state that young children should retain the pleasure of existing in for as long as possible, and that adults should be able to visit as well through works such as this. For anyone who enjoys the children's books of E.B. White, or of Randall Jarrell, let me just say: Elizabeth Coatsworth. THE ENCHANTED. I can get the shivers just recalling it.NOTE: A search for more books by this author just revealed to me that THE ENCHANTED is only the first in what sounds like a thematically-linked series, \\"The Incredible Tales.\\" The other books in that series are SILKY, MOUNTAIN BRIDE, and THE WHITE ROOM."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"For an entire family to endure oppression and sexual abuse by a father - the protector - is unthinkable. Though, as Donald D'Haene sets out early in his book, \\"Fathers Touch\\", it does happen and unfortunately, probably more often than we know.Danald's life story is not only of physical and sexual abuse, but also of religious oppression. It's quite obvious Donald's and his siblings abuse could have stopped, years earlier, if it were not for the secret system of the Jehovah's Witnesses.\\"Father's Touch\\" will keep you wanting to know what's around the corner on the next page.Thank you Donald for sharing with us your pain and your survival.Bryan Lee McGlothin"},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"Very often, when sexual abuse survivors tell their tale, they have been made to feel so much like objects that even as adults their earlier thoughts and feelings remain hidden. In this case, however, the author has given us glimpses of the inner life of a child terrorized by a man given permission by a patriarchal religious background to be \\"head of the household\\": that is, a darth vader, the head domestic terrorist.As the tale unfolds you can see how the perpetrator isolates, then brainwashes his victims while increasing their physical and psychological dependency on him. And how black-white, this-that, right-wrong beliefs merely reinforce his own absolutist opinions and literalistic excuses for seduction and violence. The self-justifications, the lies, the false faces and twisted thinking were familiar to me through my counseling work with perpetrators, whose primary agenda is the complete control of family members.What the author also details for us is the adulthood fallout of abuse, and the lifelong struggle for clarity. Sticking closely to his experiences, he shows us what it is to try assembling a self without having had a sense of self--and burdened at the same time with the hyper-rigid shoulds, oughts, and other forms of shame and self-hatred deposited into his psyche by the abuser. (I believe it was Elie Wiesel who said that it's always the victims who feel shame, not the executioners.)A particularly sad moment: sitting in the courtroom hearing attorneys warp a sexual abuse case into a religious battle, the author thinks: why did I put myself through this ordeal? Such legalistic wranglings only serve the perpetrator, of course, mirroring as they do his own attempts to control other people through misrepresentation, procedural weaknesses, and word games.In spite of this, the author moves ahead with his own healing, demonstrating that the benefits of asserting oneself don't necessarily depend on happy outcomes, legal or otherwise. To find that the world isn't so bad a place to inhabit in spite of all the suffering, and to become comfortable with one's differentness, are only two of the treasures he uncovers on his pilgrimage. A third is learning to get more comfortable--despite abuse, rejection by \\"Christian\\" elders, and a homophobic society--with being gay, a thing hard to come by even without having been incested or raised in a fragmented family. (Remarkably, the abuser has written about the sinfulness of his son's homosexuality. Apparently it's OK to terrorize an entire family, use spirituality for subjugation, and even rape one's children--but not OK for a man to show love to another man. The family values of perpetrators and those who support them are truly unique.)Finally, the book is also a topical reminder that sexual abuse is not confined to (or mismanaged by) the Catholic Church, and that many \\"Christian\\" organizations are more interested in protecting their clergy than its victims. In this they resemble the gentlemen whom Jesus criticized for shutting the door on those who follow. Not every church, temple, or parish provides a safe haven for perpetrators, of course--but an emphasis on politics, male control of women, missionary persuasion, ideological domination, and uncritical obedience make large religious organizations attractive to victimizers looking for protection and self-authorization. The more political an organization, the greater its usefulness to predators adept at making rigid rules work in their favor.I recommend this book to abuse survivors actively engaged in the struggle for selfhood."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"\\"A Father's Touch\\" is the the autobiographical story of a boy growing up in a family dominated by an abusive and unhinged father. Even though D'Haene's relationships with his siblings and loving mother are positive, it does not erase his suffering. In fact, all the family members suffer at the hands of the father; no one is spared. And no one is able to stop the father's abuses, even when the mother finally moves her children out of the home. D'Haene writes of his rural Canadian small town, where, even when other adults in the community find out about what is going on in his home, nothing is done to help or protect his family. Thus he touches on a dynamic that too few people are willing to grapple with: for every perpetrator there is a cadre of people in his community willing to aid and abet him by doing nothing or not enough to intervene.Despite the horror that D'Haene recounts, the book is a very good read. The story pulls you in and moves right along. D'Haene's characterizations are well-drawn, utilizing just the right details to give us wonderful snapshots of the various members of his immediate and extended family. Also, he provides some interesting background on his parents' families and the milieu they were raised in (both parents were emigres from Belgium), thus giving us a context to help us understand the dynamics of his immediate family. Moreover, the family background gives food for thought to those of us who wonder about nature vs. nurture in regards to family abuse. It seems that D'Haene's abusive father grew up in a family of hard-working decent people, so anyone wanting to discover the origin of his mental affliction will have to look elsewhere to find a contributing factor.D'Haene's story makes for painful reading, especially for people who've had similar experiences. However, there is hope in these pages, which are written by a due man who, although raised in an atmosphere of violence and cruelty, seems never to have abandoned his own gentle and loving nature. Thus the story illuminates one of our greatest strengths as human beings: the potential resilience of the individual soul."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"Donald D'Haene is an excellent writer,more than capable of expressing his inner thoughts with words to paper and in a style or way readers can fully grasp and appreciate.No doubt, Donald D'Haene's book will help many abuse victims understand they were the victim of a violent crime and should not blame themselves.Donald's book is not only a testament to inner courage on his part;it is about self-discovery and self-liberation against all odds.By exploring and sharing his life experiences and inner thoughts in writing,Donald D'Haene has given the world community a gift of knowledge,shedding light on a topic that is far too often misunderstood.Sadly,the idea that child sexual and psychological abuse should be treated as a \\"dirty little secret\\" is still endemic in cultures throughout the world."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"As a survivor myself I have read many books by fellow survivors and other experts in the field of sexual abuse. Donald's rendition of his story however, is the most moving and thought provoking one that I have read. The clash of culture between religion and law and the frank disclosure of how even those perceived to be the best among us, simply refuse to get involved with difficult situations, should move and challenge everyone to examine our personal perceptions and make sure we are seeing the world as it is, rather than as we want it to be."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"Father's Touch is a poignant, heart wrenching memoir about endurance, survival and triumph over a childhood filled with child sexual abuse. From beginning to end this book will transport you on an incredible journey; you will not be able to put it down.

In speaking out Donald gives permission to all male survivors of this terrible crime; not only to speak but also healing and living life to the fullest is a reality.

Donald D'Haene is a fantastic author and I look forward to reading his next book. This book is going to open a lot of doors for the children who are still suffering. Donald will get a chance to live his lost childhood through the lives of the children this book is going to help and will also be an inspiration to the adults who are still hurting because of the secrets they hold onto. This book shows how a survivor turned his negative and horrid childhood into something positive. What a brave and gracious person you are Donald D'Haene."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"This not only the autobiography of Donald D'Haene but also a family biography. You have likely heard the expression &quot;it takes a village to raise a child&quot; but it also true that it takes a group of people to abuse a child. Nothing happens in a vacuum, no single person is ever totally responsible for abusing someone because others know even if they wish to pretend they do not and societies, be they small religious groups or nations of millions, create dependent relationships that trap the victim. This is not the story of victims, this is a story of survivors, especially Donald himself. The book is told on several levels: First, we see glimpses of the Donald now who is writing this book; then there are two layers of flashbacks -- those triggered during his journey back to the &quot;homes&quot; he knew as a child and young adult as well as the flashbacks he experienced throughout his life; finally the bulk of the book is a chronological account of the abuse and its effects over the years. As someone who has also survived abuse, I can tell you that the feeling such levels creates in a reader only approaches the feelings you deal with throughout your life -- may none of you ever get more than this basic approach. An important book but a difficult book to read if you have a human heart at all."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"If the title alone doesn't run a cold shiver down your spine then certainly once you hit the first few chapters of this astoundingly disturbing book the story will more than catch the readers immediate attention.No, it's not just another whining 'survivor' or 'I overcame it all' type of book but rather an in your face account of a four year old boy, victimized, by his pervert father. With superb writing skills, the author, takes us back into the mind of that boy as he must, with his mother, brothers and sister, live, unprotected and vulnerable while his father continues to play 'The Game'.The author's family, amazingly enough, members of a very closed and tight knit Christian community of Jehova's Witnesses, continues to live and interact in the community until the pervert father makes a mistake and tries to seduce one of the brothers who finally brings the pedophelia to the light of day.Needless to say the author soon realizes that his mother, church elders, teachers and even the police repeatedly betray his calls for help displaying nothing more than indifference and cowardice to face up to a disgusting pervert in the community molesting one of his own sons.Although certainly not my usual reading fare, I couldn't put this book down or stop thinking about the disturbing content. The authors writing skills are superb, the book is an easy read, maintains the readers interest and the story flows. As well, the author certainly avoids the modern day fashionable pitfall of 'Christian bashing' that seems to be a very very popular pastime of the media today.I recommend this highly thought provoking work, it places some perspective on that dirty little secret, and, the reader should not expect to walk away from this story unscathed ....."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"Whenever I think about Donald's book, I think about ghosts. Ghosts inhabit the past of many of us, and the horrors of Donald's past abuse and victimization are small evidence of the ghosts who inhabit his. &quot;Father's Touch&quot; tells the story of Donald D'Haene's past to all of us. If you were ever to ask if ghosts were real, &quot;Father's Touch&quot; tells you that Donald's are. He lives with them everyday. They are with him constantly; interrupting him and drawing him back to his past.This is a story of surviving at a cost. Each member of the D'Haene family pays a high price for their recovery. Donald's solution is clearly exposed: movies that run in his head, film clips that grab his consciousness and return him to his past. &quot;Objects are closer than they appear&quot; is a frightening metaphor of Donald's experience and that of his mother, sister and brothers. This family was done a grave injustice through blindness and ignorance. They were treated badly by a system that was meant to protect them.This is an amazing story. I was shocked when I read it. It wasn't the story that shocked me or the details of the abuse; I had heard those before. &quot;Father's Touch&quot; shocked me because it is the D'Haene story, the Donald D'Haene story, told true...We cannot escape our ghosts; they follow us at every turn in our lives, like fate."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"Father's Touch will have a strong impact on its reader. There were many times I had to put the book aside and think things over. Honestly, I was shocked at how a parent could do such evil things to his own children.Although the book focuses primarily on incest, there is a lot more to this story. Father's Touch is also about a social and psychological system gone awry, sending people deeper into their failures, a father whose lust for power is uncontrollable, and a mother driven into submission. It is about a religious system that prescribes rules for every aspect of peoples' lives, to the point that it abandons Donald and his family to a psychopath.In the end, those responsible in their community knew what was going on but failed to take the necessary steps to help the children. On the contrary, they told them to \\"respect their father\\".Donald's story is the voice of many children. Children that even today, suffer from a system in which community and church leaders refuse to see or admit they are wrong.Anyone who reads this book will be deeply touched in their heart. I can only admire that little boy that became such a nice person because of his own strength and persistence.

Donald put the feelings and the thoughts that I have had down in words better than anyone could have. Although my abuse was not the same as his, any abuse of children is wrong. I just wish I could write my story as compelling as Donald did.This is a must read for anyone who has gone through abuse, helping someone who has gone through abuse or anyone who knows someone who has gone through abuse. It puts a whole new light on the subject. There are a lot of books out there written from the therapists view but not many from the survivors view.

His father introduces him to the &quot;Game&quot; as a part of normal parental responsibilities.

We are all able to see ourselves in this book as victims and as friends and professionals who don't pay close enough attention to what is going on in the lives of children we encounter.

D'Haene has written this memoir with dignity. A must for all sexual abuse survivors to read."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"In his memoir, Father's Touch, Donald D'Haene has fantastically illustrated the searing existence of a molested child while conveying the intricacies of maintaining \\"normal\\" relationships with the rest of his family and the outside world. With his anorexic style, Mr. D'Haene horrifies and educates from beginning to end.When his parents emigrated from Belgium, Daniel (Donald's father) joined the Jehovah's Witnesses in rebellion against a tradition of ignorance in the Catholic faith in which he grew up, coercing his wife to follow suit with a variety of abusive behaviors.The four D'Haene children grew up in a home dominated by a man bent on possessing spouse and offspring completely. Everyone feared Daniel's verbal and physical attacks. When Donald was four, Daniel introduced him to \\"The Game,\\" in which, Donald as well as his siblings, would \\"play\\" for the next eleven years.When Erik, the youngest son, finally reported the abuse and the D'Haene family went before the Elders of their congregation, they were censured and ignored. Daniel was \\"excommunicated.\\" And still, the abuse continued, in spite of Daniel's repeated promised to stop and seek help.After helping rescue his mother from a marriage over which she had no control or active part, Donald read in a newspaper column that incest and sexual abuse was a crime. Obviously, the pain of his abuse was only compounded by the apparent apathy of the very authorities, both spiritual and secular, meant to protect him. Still, Donald began legal proceedings against his father, but was foiled, again, through the incompetence of the courts as well as what is nothing less than lackadaisical concern for the welfare of children in their jurisdiction. Daniel D'Haene was sentenced to two years in a reformatory through a plea-bargain that sought only to insure an appearance of justice rather than the imposition of equity.Incest and sexual abuse, especially with male victims, is a subject avoided by polite society. No one, it seems, wants to face the nasty reality of little boys participating in sexual power plays. Donald breaks down the confinement of the victim and takes the reader on a full, panoramic view of his father's compulsive need to control everyone and everything in his environment, his mother's need to protect and her fear of a world that makes no sense to her, to his own need to recover from the incredible shame and pain of having been molested. Father's Touch is a beautiful recollection of a monster with which far too many of us live."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"The dedication reads in part:For..fellow survivorsand silent victims past and presentUnable to find their way out of the darkness.These words are ever so true. Donald D'Haene takes us into the mind ofan abuser, the family from which he came, and the family that he created.The family which he reminded. upon occasion, when things did not go hisway, that he could also take that life away.Like so many others whose reviews of this book I have read, I, too, couldnot read the book all the way through at one sitting. It took me a fewdays and a number of attempts.. And I am not the same person I wasbefore I read this book, nobody could be. The pain, the frustration, thesense of loss; the anger, the rage, and trust betrayed---all of it isthere, brought alive by the power of words. I felt I was there, standingbeside Donald when his father killed his beloved animals; I felt I wasright there as the children struggled among themselves to offerthemselves up as living sacrifices to their father's rage to protecttheir mother and youngest brother.And Donald takes us to a world where persons practice medicine without alicense, and those with a license to practice medicine do NOT PRACTICEit. There are reasons these things happen, and there are reasons why theyshould NOT-and Donald takes us there and shows us why, in painful andunforgettable detail.Was there ever a time when things MIGHT have turned out differently? Wasthere a window of opportunity when JUST ONE act of kindness, at the rightmoment, might have made a difference in the lives of these children?Donald answers that question for us. Were there ANY signs, observable tooutsiders that, having been noticed, could have led to earlierintervention? Would education and legislation have made a difference tothis family's history? Donald answers those questions for us.This is not a book just to read and then put on the shelf and then gomerrily on our way.

Books on child abuse tend to be either too depressing, self-exploitative, or resort to too much pop psychology without managing to give any real insight. However, these are all things which \\"Father's Touch\\" has managed to avoid. Despite the horrible subject matter of this book, Donald D'Haene manages to draw you into his story with his very cinematic writing style and manages to illustrate how horrible child abuse is without ever resorting to lurid details. And, most importantly, Donald uses his story in a very constructive manner.One of the things which is often most confusing to people who haven't been the victim of child abuse is how such things can go on without being detected or why people in such a situation don't just try to escape it. The fact is that many people try to escape, but due to lack of support, fail, while others are so psychologically torn down that they feel incapable of escaping. Donald manages to create an understanding of how this happens, illustrating how often abuse builds slowly over time, how the abuser manages to assert himself over others until they feel powerless, and how abuse can even begin to seem a normal part of life or something to be taken for granted, like the fact that the sun will rise in the morning.This book also does an excellent job of illustrating how necessary it is for there to be a strong social support system for those who are not able to help themselves. Often, victims might not know there is any alternative available. Some cities are filled with homeless children who have found living on the street to be their only means of escape. Donald did not ultimately resort to such drastic measures himself, but his early attempts to get help often just resulted in the sort of social rejection which does drive many victims into feeling complete hopelessness and even self-blame.And this book couldn't have come at a better time with the few support structures in place here in Ontario, where the events in this book take place, being threatened by massive cuts in funding being made to pay for unrealistic tax breaks promised during the last provincial election. We are now seeing shelters for abused women and children being closed down when instead more should be built. It is also ironic that Donald was not given any help by anyone he turned to in Aylmer years ago, but now the protection system is being attacked by critics in Aylmer who see the authorities' early intervention in another recent case as a form of persecution! Sure, the system is open to abuse, but as \\"Father's Touch\\" illustrates, such \\"interference\\" is often necessary. Critics in the Aylmer area would be especially well advised to read this book.Sadly, in Aylmer, there is still a great deal of abuse which goes unchecked due to the presence of some very isolated communities, much like the one described in \\"Father's Touch\\", and there is now a cult in town which advocates that any child showing any sign of independent thought should be \\"beaten into submission\\". What happened to Donald is still happening in to others, and is actually finding acceptance by some merely because it is physical instead of sexual abuse. Hopefully, this book can create more understanding for the victims and encourage others to give the victims their support."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"This might be a shocking story to some, but one that needs to be told. Father's Touch proves that childhood sexual abuse is not gender specific, but is a crime of violence, power and manipulation. D'Haene is courageous.

When this occurs in the family home and is perpetrated by a parent with an obvious duty of care, the betrayal and it's consequences are immeasurable.Daniel and Jeannette D'Haene emigrated to Canada from Belgium in 1957 where they settled in a rural area and had four children. Ronny the eldest was followed by Donald, the author of this book, then Marina and Erik in turn. On arrival in Canada both Daniel and Jeannette were Roman Catholics, she more devout than he. Daniel felt constrained by a diktat by the church in Belgium the faithful should not read the 'Bible' which would confuse them. This must be peculiar to the clergy at that time and place, since the same was not true then in UK. Daniel was attracted by the Jehovah Witnesses who actively encouraged religious study and became a pillar of the local community group. Eventually he persuaded his wife with a mixture of rhetoric and beatings she should change her faith too.Whatever the expectations and demands of the Witnesses, Daniel believed in his own home he was the master, and his wife and children, his property. They were expected to be obedient to every whim and caprice. At the age of four Donald was introduced to 'The Game'. This involved masturbating his father and was merely the beginning of ten years of prolonged abuse, during which more serious assaults occurred. In time the children would pool their knowledge and learn each of them were initiates in 'The Game'. Daniel informed his elder sons he would expect them when they were older to perform incestuously with their sister, after he finished with her. Each child was intimidated into silence and their innocence of moral certitudes exploited. When they learned what was happening to them was wrong, their father foisted the illusion of mutual culpability upon them. It was only when Erik, aged five, told his mother what his father had insisted on doing she became aware of the abuse. Daniel promised to get help, but continued molesting his children.In 1973 Jeanette and her children approached the Elders of the Witnesses to gain protection for themselves. Their reaction was to 'excommunicate' Daniel without telling his family he had also confessed to bestiality. When the situation at home deteriorated still further, Ronny and Donald persuaded their mother to leave with all the children. Daniel, meanwhile, joined the Baptists and after a divorce, remarried and once again became a pillar of his community.Without exception all four children suffered immense psychological damage. Ronny, temporarily became a 'control freak' like his father and left home before worse effects would be felt. Donald, by chance, reading a newspaper article discovered his father had actually committed a crime for which he could be charged. By then, at least thirty people in authority, knew the family's story and none had advised them of their legal position or alternatively to seek legal advice. Finally getting this from a policeman from Ontario, Donald instigated criminal proceedings against Daniel and obtained therapy for himself, Marina and Erik.When Daniel came to trial, it was a complete travesty informed by incompetence, ignorance and plea-bargaining. He was sent down for two years in a reformatory, having sentenced his family to years of miserable flashbacks and psychological trauma. The severity of damage is evidenced in that it took twenty years before Donald could face his memories and write this detailed account of his childhood. To many fellow victims it will appear to be classical in the methods used by Daniel to control his family and the secrecy and shame they endured. It also highlights the confusion of sexual identity which often results exacerbated by the normal raging hormones of adolescence.There is very little literature on the subject of father/son sexual abuse which is still for some a taboo subject. This well written and fluent book should be required reading for all engaged in the protection of children and the victims of today. These may care to know Donald more than survived his past and is today a successful art journalist, actor and TV presenter. Lawyers should also view the last chapters of the book as a textbook summary of how not to prosecute a case and judges can gain a refresher course on what poor administrative services can do to 'justice'. In this instance, Donald and his family were the victims of secondary rape by the very system which allegedly should have redressed their wrongs and protected them.Although this matter came to trial in the early 1980's in Canada, whilst there is a better understanding of the evils of sexual abuse today, there are still errors of judgement by social workers and laxity in prosecution on both sides of the Atlantic.Finally, the author should be commended for his courage in writing this book. To discuss the unspeakable acts committed by a parent and expose the induced guilt and shame created with undoubted finesse is a triumph of talent and the will over adversity."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"I am happy this book was written, it exposes those that should have helped this situation and didn't. The Jehovah's Witness religion actually protects molesters and lets the children suffer the consequences. the writer generates sympathy by telling the truth . And it is so sad that others like therapists, doctors the police all failed the children who asked for help. I was very moved by their plight and it has made me aware and taught me to look for signs of problems in other families and children"},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"D'Haene's book Fathers Touch has all the active ingredients of abestseller! Suspense, laughter, tears and makes you the readerfeal like you are right there with the D'Haene family living thehorror they had to live. I have read all kinds of books fiction,non-fiction, children's stories and Fathers Touch has got thegoods. The sad part is that it is not Fiction which proves that yes truth is stranger than fiction!!Amazingly D'Haene deals with life through laughter. How many of us wouldsurvive what this family has? After reading this book I realize thatyes it is truly does takes a community to raise a child, and the community in which the D'Haene's lived did not take care of their own. Society failed them so now is the time for us totake a stand. Let's raise our children together and make it safe for them to live in our society. Let's not fail anymore children whether it be at school, at home, or in the courts."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"Father's Touch by Donald D'Haene is the foremost book exploding the myth of male adult survivors of child sexual abuse. Written in an honest and candid memoir the reader is transported into the life of a victim turned survivor. Male survivors of sexual abuse are the least recognized and the most reluctant to come forward. D'Haene has thrown open the doors for healing, placing the shame where it belongs, with the abuser, and invites a healthy life for all who have suffered from this kind of crime. Donald D&quot;Haene is a hero to all males who have suffered so terribly as children, but also to all survivors of sexual abuse regardless of gender. This poignant book will transport the reader to tears, but will also bring the reader to the higher purpose of overcoming adversity and reclaiming life and happiness. Donald D'Haene is a hero to all survivors of this terrible crime against the innocence of children. Living a happy and healthy life is the best revenge from an unmentionable atrocity. D'Haene is living that life and reaching out to others who are fortunate enough to understand his compassion and knowledge. There are not enough adjectives to recommend this important book."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"Father's Touch is a courageous autobiography of incest, healing, and discovering self-love and acceptance. A unique aspect of Donald's book is that in addition to telling his story he also tells the story of his mother and siblings. Donald offers a story of a family's journey to survival, escape and triumph. His mother was also a victim to his father, in her innocence and isolation. While Donald tells his own story he also reaches out compassionately to other survivors. In reading his book I felt I had found a friend.Father's Touch is written like a novel, and I immediately became absorbed into the book, reading it through to the end in a few days, not wanting to put it down. As a survivor myself, there were aspects of his experience that I strongly related to. I have read many memoirs of sexual abuse, and Father's Touch is one of the best. The feelings and reactions that Donald had as a child and as an adult were very familiar to my own experience. I am very grateful for Donald's honesty, and for the great courage it took him to write this book. Reading Donald's book gave me a deeper understanding of a male's perspective as an incest survivor. For all of these reasons I highly recommend this book.Father's touch not only exposes incest within a family, but also a town, a religious community, and a legal system that did not protect children. I hope that people who read this book will gain insight into how to better protect our children, and will gain a deeper awareness of how common and horrific sexual abuse is. Donald also includes excerpts from his father's writing and letters that show the extent of his father's denial and lies towards his family.As an adult Donald has remained kind, caring, and successful despite what was done to him. Donald writes in a way that keeps the reader uplifted and hopeful. Donald is truly a survivor, a thriver and a role model. He gives me hope."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"I was completely engrossed in this book from beginning to end.I found the book both moving and inspiring to the average audience, but even more so to any victims of such abuse.It describes the abuse and his recovery in a very compelling manner.I look forward to reading his next book!"},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"It took me a few weeks to read FATHER'S TOUCH.As a survivor myself, some of D'Haene's passages were just too difficult to read.

However, I think the ones who might gain the most insight are those who never experienced abuse at the hands of those they trusted the most.Kudos to D'Haene and his incredible journey and courage."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"Travel back to a time before the laws about what a parent could do to his children were common knowledge. Before domestic violence prevention programs were around.Travel back into Donald D'Haene's world where his immigrant parents arrive in rural Canada to live in isolated poverty, constantly moving from one rented house to another. Where the religion of the father curdles into a cult at home. A cult of unfettered temper, wife subjugation & the The Game he plays with his children.Donald's father rules his little fiefdom with a fist of fear & sexual abuse until the youngest child refuses to play The Game. When Donald's mother takes her family before their religious elders, instead of the abuse being stopped, she is chastised for not reporting it earlier & the family, while being allowed to continue to attend services, is shunned, & life at home returns to \\"normal.\\"It isn't until Donald, now in his teens, reads a letter in the advice column of a newspaper, that he realizes what his father is doing is illegal. It takes a while for that information to make sense in his life, & when it does, he begins the rescue of his mother & siblings.Donald D'Haene is the first author I've read who recounts his transformation with sessions of mental therapy. If you glean nothing else from FATHER'S TOUCH, you will see how useful the services of a community mental health organization can be.FATHER'S TOUCH is an ebullient, enchanting, hopeful memoir about a man's childhood, dominated by a predator parent, & the author's rocky road to health, maturity & happiness."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"I have just finished reading \\"Father's Touch\\" by Donald D'Haene. First of all I would like to say I admire Donald's courage and tenacity in writing this memoir. To get any book down on paper is difficult enough, but this work is extraordinary.The book really has three main sections to it. The first deals with the abuse and how the family dealt with the traumatic ripples, the second is how they embraced the simple answers Jehovah's Witnesses offered to complex problems and the third is the trial of the offender. In each there is a very subtle change in the tone of writing. In describing the abuse suffered at the hands of his father, Donald writes simply but unblinkingly and with great dignity. He does not shy away from what happened, but manages to provide just enough detail so the reader can realize the day to day events the children had to endure. Later as the family embraced the Witnesses as their best and brightest hope, Donald's storytelling becomes more detached as if he were describing events that happened to another person. My heart ached as the elders and a detective used the family for their own ends. They were cold and manipulative and events are told in earnest sincerity and ironic, deadpan humor which only makes the failure of the Witnesses, and later the judicial system, that much more wrenching. Finally the tone of the story changes ever so slightly. Anger and bitterness mixed with detached logic as the trial is described. I couldn't help but feel tremendous empathy and warmth of feeling toward the family as the entire story played out.Donald used a brilliant maneuver of quoting from his father's book in contrasting what his father said happened in that period versus what really happened. It is a contrast between what a pedophile says and what they actually do. Chilling and very creepy.The story comes across as fair and even handed and Donald is not above relating his own understandable mistakes. The story is powerful and well told.Thank you for writing a poignant and powerful story.Now a personal aside. I feel things deeply, which is both a blessing and a curse. When I'm happy I feel as bright as the sun, but when I'm sad I feel it down to my cells. And so it was with this story. I followed it like I was on a roller coaster. The story hit me hard, but not where I was expecting. Not with the abuse, but at the trial. The trial brought up old messages (it's all a lie; it didn't really happen; you're bad) and the ending itself left my deeply shaken (in fact my hands are still shaking as I write this). I won't reveal what happened, but I will say I received a phone call that was almost exactly the same.The part of the story I related to the most was using the Witnesses as a coping tool and submerging your personality to the organization's. I understood so well a young man trying so hard to perform, as if that would wash away the past. I too believed with all my heart. I've bookmarked several passages that touched me. Here are just a few:\\"Bible characters are more real to me than the people who surround me. I question reality as I know it, sometimes even my own existence.\\"\\"Our human subconscious has no sense of time, so reliving an ancient trauma can be as fresh and raw as if it had happened yesterday. However when someone is successful at disconnecting from his history, current behavior that is irrational or conditions that are disturbing, such as insomnia, phobias, nightmares, seem to descend from nowhere. Reality blurs with fiction. One begins to question one's own sanity.\\"\\"Why am I so numb, so emotionless? Sometimes I feel like a corpse. Do people feel how cold my hands are when they touch them?\\"\\"Even though I am alone, I am not lonely.\\"Remember the end of \\"Castaway\\" where Tom Hanks stood in the middle of a road heading off in four different directions whilst haunting music played? Each person in this story faced that crossroads and each made a choice. The most painful choice, for me, was Donald's mother. I wanted so badly for her father to catch the cab as she drove off. I knew what was coming as she drove away with Daniel and I hurt for her. If she had stayed. If she had not left with Daniel. If ...The lives that could have been, and weren't. All the pain that would follow. What a waste.If I had to use one word to describe how I felt after reading \\"Father's Touch\\" it would be \\"Haunted\\".Haunted by what was and what could have been. For all of us."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"Pedophilia survivor Donald D'Haene recounts the betrayal of a father in FATHER'S TOUCH. From the age of three and a half, his father engaged him in The Game, in which Donald was forced to masturbate his father. Over the years, the abuses of The Game escalated. Further, playing The Game was the only time which his aloof father would show interest in any of his four children.Daniel and Jeannette D'Haene emigrated from Belgium in 1957 to Canada, settling in a rural area and having four children. Daniel left the Catholic Church to embrace the Jehovah Witnesses. He eventually converts his wife, who was not well educated and was forced to remain under his dominion in all things. He became a pillar of the church, immersing himself in bible study. With the church's backing, as head of the family Daniel dictated his family's life, ruling with an iron will.In time, the children confided in one another, learning of their mutual abuse. When the children learned that their father's abuses were wrong, Daniel blurred their realities, making them feel responsible for the abuses that occurred. Even when the church intervened in 1973, The Game did not stop for long. Nor did the Jehovah Witness church elders report the abuses to local law enforcement. Instead, they told the children that they must continue to respect their father as the head of the house.Indeed, it was a letter in a newspaper column that brought home reality to Donald as an adult, when he learned his father's actions were not only immoral but also illegal. By that time Daniel had remarried, joined a Baptist church and once again become a respected member of the community. Donald was eventually able to bring his father to trial, but the case became a sham as it was tainted by incompetence, ignorance and plea-bargaining. His light sentence seems to mock the horrifying ramifications of his abuse upon his children.Donald D'Haene's bold revelations of abuse and survival cannot help but sear the reader's soul with his brutally honest account. FATHER'S TOUCH inevitably will provoke a strong emotional response in the reader, both outrage at the father's actions but also joy at Donald's ability to not just survive but to overcome. The classic methods Daniel used to dominate his family will strike a cord with all abuse survivors. However, FATHER'S TOUCH isn't just for incest survivors, but for all of us who might encounter victims in the court, in the day care, in the classroom, or across the street. A powerfully rendered, thought provoking account, FATHER'S TOUCH comes very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"This book is an essential memoir in the field of education. The education of young children and then teenagers. They are confronted to all kinds of ambiguous and contradictory experiences and they have to build up their own psyches and visions of the world from what they understand, experience and at times suffer in the world. This book deals with a recent historical period when some incestuous practices that had been common place and perfectly neglected by all authorities for ages came to the front and were considered as criminal at long last. We must widen the scope and consider imposed sexual practices from adults onto young children and teenagers. The latter do not know what sex is, though they live the sexual drive intensely. They can be manipulated and used by adults. They have to learn about sex all by themselves. The point is that incest warps the learning because parents are natural models for the kids and what they say is naturally the rule, the law, the truth. If parents sexually meddle with their children, they warp the perception these have of this essential human activity. Then the kids react and build their own personalities from these warped experiences. That leads to a complete mix-up that can bring the young people to all kinds of despaired attitudes : suicide, revulsion, criminal drive, rebellion, etc. This book shows how Donald D'Haene managed to go through it, build by himself and for himself some kind of balanced grown-up life. He chose confrontation and was half-heartedly followed by the social authorities that should have followed him entirely. That is because he was the first or one of the first to come up with the denunciation of such practices in a society where it had been neglected and ignored for centuries, in fact forever. It should be a beacon in our consciousness that life is complex and requires a lot of courage to come to terms with its hardships or crimes, with victimization and the pangs of growing up. The main lesson is that growing up can only be successful if one confronts one's past and comes to terms, no matter what and which, with it. It is a lesson of courage on the side of the individual and a denunciation of the half-measures a society takes in such fields as incest. The general idea that governs social services in such cases is that the kid has to be protected but that the family unit must not be broken up. The society tries to deter but does not want to intervene in family matters as long as it can ignore them. A must on the reading-list of any educator and social worker, or even psychologist or psychiatrist. The conclusion I may put forward is that we have to be careful in such fields because at times an insufficiently thought about act from social services might be more harmful than helpful. A criminal has to be punished but the punishment must be seen not as a deterrent in society but as a helping hand for the victims to grow through the crisis such crimes build up in them. The prime concern has to be the victims and not the perpetrators of the crimes nor society. This is a new approach to social behavior and it is far from being a won battle. Especially since sex deals in everyone of us with the deepest layers of our beings, the deepest drives of our psyches and necessarily the guilt one develops at only having unhuman desires (and I don't say unnatural because man is not a purely natural animal any more but a social and historical being), and I am afraid everyone has or has had such desires and everyone develops some guilt concerning them.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"Donald D'Haene's \\"Father's Touch\\" has been compared to Elie Wiesel's starkly written \\"Night\\". Both are tales of horror, courage and survival, presented in simple, strong prose which seems almost matter-of-fact at times, yet has a powerful effect on the reader. The topic is timely, as daily more victims come forward to charge those who sexually abused them as children. D'Haene's book is a message of courage, hope, and survival to those struggling with the long-reaching psychological consequences of sexual abuse at the hands of someone they trusted.D'Haene was only five years old when his father, an intelligent but deeply troubled man, introduced him to \\"the game\\". In time, his older brother and younger sister also became victims of their father's incestuous perversion. The parents were Belgian immigrants and the family, Jehovah's Witnesses in a small community in Ontario, lived an insular, isolated life-style. When, after years, the religious community became aware of his father's behavior, they \\"disfellowshipped\\" him and viewed it as sin, but not as a matter that should be taken to law enforcement.It was not until D'Haene was grown that his father was charged and tried for his crimes.D'Haene writes of his own ongoing struggles with issues of trust, sexual orientation, and feelings of being an outcast, and also of his attempts to help his mother and siblings both economically and emotionally. Despite its bleak subject matter, \\"Father's Touch\\" is a survivor's healing, positive account of how he was able to salvage a meaningful, happy life from the wreck of his early years. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"I recently had a chance to read this book by D'Haene; setting aside for a minute the merits of the book to the people to whom it might be of the most help (i.e. victims / people close to those who have experienced sexual violence) it is a book that for the sheer force of the words alone deserves a much broader audience. As a tale of faith tested (setting aside literary merit...), it ranks with Elie Weisel's Night as one of the most powerful books that I have ever come across.In this story D'Haene tells the story of his upbringing. His father was controlling of his mother, and sexually and physically abusive to he and his brothers and sister. He tells of his personal dissent into a hell: high school is bad enough for most of us without the additional bitterness and pain caused by a tumultuous home life and the fact that your father has raped you. Nevertheless, D'Haene's story is not solely a tale of angst and suffering: instead, it is a story that shows how one individual finds redemption.As an honest reviewer, D'Haene does not write with typical artifice and convention; his story is an honest and personal account. As it is honestly the story of one man's life, and not the idea of one man's life, it reads as such. Were it intended to be literary, there are ways that it may have been possible to package it in a form that would be a little more tortured, and perhaps more dramatic. Parts of it could be cut; others could be edited. However, as it is what it is, it is a wonderful book as it stands, and really should be read.However you got to this point, I would recommend that you need to read this book. It is enlightening, interesting, and, in an odd way, a book that could strengthen one's faith. I commend Mr. D'Haene for having the strength to live through his early life strong enough to tell his tale; I hope, for all of us, that many people read this book."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"Reading this book,I found it to be the type that makes you want to keep reading and not want to put it down.Partly because the I could not beleive what I was reading,the horror, what the family was going through and what this man was doing to them.The book has its lighter side to it ( hard to beleive with this type of subject) So its not all doom and gloom.When you know what the book is about you may think oh I have heard all this before. you have to remeber this is a book about a survivor and the fact that he did do something about it and not dwell on sympathy.I hope this book can help others who are in the same situation and do something about it."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"Donald D'Haene's Father's Touch is a compelling read, albeit not for the faint-hearted. Actor and columnist, the irrepressible D'Haene recounts the horrors of his and his siblings' childhood sexual abuse by their father.Throughout Father's Touch the author's seemingly dispassionate voice is all the more poignant, a mechanism which enabled him to survive not only his own pain, but also the pain he felt on behalf of his mother, brothers and sister. But the book contains much that is unexpectedly enjoyable, thanks to D'Haene's ironic sense of humor, lively writing style and the upbeat outlook on life he has achieved in recent years. D'Haene has many cards up his sleeves with which he tantalizes the reader into being unable to put the book down.The relevance and educational value of Father's Touch are heightened by its dissimilarity to the customary dark and often self-absorbed exposes in the writing genre of personal revelation. And for all who have experienced sexual abuse, directly or indirectly, Father's Touch is a gift of encouragement, faith and hope."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"I am a survivor of abuse myself and my abuser was my father. I grew up in the Jehovah's Witnesses community. I told an elder in my congregation who would not believe me. Not until 15 years later when it came to light that he had abused all five of his children, would anyone believe us. I have worked in law enforcement and one of the misconceptions is that pedophiles are homosexuals. Actually, 3/4 of all pedophiles are either married men or in heterosexual relationships but target children as sexual objects, mostly girls. As to accusing that I or any child ENJOYED the sex or invited it, is a cruel, untrue statement and as abusive as the actions of the pedophile.Reading this book can clear up similar beliefs maintained in ignorance."},{"Title":"Father's Touch, Second Edition","review":"Too bad James Fry lied to Oprah. Memoirs are important and she is moving away from promoting them. Father's Touch is both a well-told story and educational at the same time. A must read for those interested in understanding the mind of a pedophile, as the author quotes from his molester/father's writings. This book shows the manipulative skill of molesters as well as the resilience of survivors in challenging the misconceptions of friends and family. I wonder why the victims must always have to answer why they are this way, why they made the choices they did. I am not a victim but I hope one day molesters undergo the amount of therapy that victims no doubt need to survive. Father's Touch is a one-of-a-kind memoir.

Soon, though, I figured why because reading the book was just like revisiting my past, which was miserable and left my future self much pain.Just like the author did when he was little, I also experienced a sense of alienation when I was in school -- everyone was just so immature that going to school was hell. I was a prime target of bullying. My parents were too busy to listen to what I had to say, and I was always scared to death when my brother was around. He was nothing more than an enemy to me, just like the author's father to him and the rest of his family members. My brother called me names, clearly showed me hostility, treated me like a piece of garbage and, most of all, hated me. Some of my teachers did not like me either probably because of my shyness and poor grades.When I read about the author's pain he felt at school, I vividly remembered my past and thought as if I was reading about myself. He says he had to be a counselor to his mother. I also had to be a counselor, but not for someone else, but for myself. I have spent most of my school life talking to myself. My attempt to give myself solace failed, however -- most of the things I said to myself were just how miserable I was.It's no wonder that I was never able to make myself feel good because I had no self-esteem. I felt as if I was a puppet forcefully lived by a wizard or something. What is this? I asked myself. Why do I have to see, hear and experience what I'm seeing, hearing and experiencing? No matter how many times I asked this, the answer never changed -- because that was my fate.I have firmly believed in this answer just until recently, but things turned out a little bit better after I came to the United States from Japan to go to college. Of course, so many nasty experiences have attacked me ever since I came to this country, such as friendlessness, loneliness and the encounter with stupid Americans. While all these depressing experiences were happening, I came to spend more time thinking about my life in solitude. After I experienced lots of emotional downs, I started to keep asking myself why I still live.I asked the author the same question in his book a million times -- Donald D'Haene, why are you strong enough to live your life? I felt sorry for him when I was first reading the book because I quickly judged how he must have been feeling only based on my own feelings in the past. But as I kept reading the book, I stopped feeling sorry for him and felt something warm merging in my mind. It was encouraging to see him always trying to live his life despite all the obstacles he faced.I believed I was living because I had no other options and had no control in my life. This depressed me and made my life too unbearable to live. But the book reminded me that was untrue. I was living my life and am still alive because I chose to be so myself. I thought I was weak because I had no courage to kill myself, but this was also untrue. I always chose to live my life because there were always some things to live for. One of them is self-growth. These days, I get counseling and keep trying to be more positive. As a result, I have begun to enjoy seeing myself grow. Some people seem desperate to find \\"meaning\\" in their lives. I don't know if life ever has meaning (After all, no one is born of his or her will), but if there is meaning or something to live for in my life, I think this self-growth is one such thing.This way of looking at life gives me a greater sense of empowerment, which the book reminded me of. Donald D'Haene has been living his life because he has always been strong and willing to live. I learned this from the book. None of us can ever know what is going to happen in our lives, which scares off some people. It is true that things happen beyond our control. It is also true, however, that the power to overcome life's obstacles and have a happy life is undoubtedly within each individual. Yes, all of us do have control over our lives! :)Yet, it is often difficult to realize this, and we sometimes get trapped in a sense of helplessness in the course of life. I know I have control over my life, but I sometimes feel as if I'm still wandering in a nightmare that tells me I'm a loser. The author may also be wandering in his nightmare still, but I just know both he and I will get out of our nightmares completely someday. I try to see this process of saying goodbye to my nightmare as part of self-growth. Although the book is about a survivor of sexual abuse, I think anyone can learn something from it whether they are victims of sexual abuse or not. The author is such a powerful teacher who makes anyone stronger and happier with his lessons. I was lucky to know about the book and get it.I feel great and happy whenever I remember the book.

I never knew that the legal system in Canada was so fallible. The truth can be distorted and facts can be omitted so egregiously. Justice is not always carried out adequately as a result. Failure to report the sexual abuse of children is a crime in itself no matter who is aware of it. Memories of child abuse will never fade for the victims. There is the natural tendency for the victims of sexual abuse to also repress the pain of sexual abuse which is wrong. The inclination of the victims to become confused about their sexual orientation as young adults is clear in this memoir. Years of therapy and journal writing helped the author to acknowledge and uncover the pain. This eventually put him on the path toward healing. These efforts gave the author the ability to give and receive love from other people.

There were many times I had to put the book aside and think things over. Honestly, I was shocked at how a parent could do such evil things to his own children.Although the book focuses primarily on incest, there is a lot more to this story. Father's Touch is also about a social and psychological system gone awry, sending people deeper into their failures, a father whose lust for power is uncontrollable, and a mother driven into submission. It is about a religious system that prescribes rules for every aspect of peoples' lives, to the point that it abandons Donald and his family to a psychopath.In the end, those responsible in their community knew what was going on but failed to take the necessary steps to help the children. On the contrary, they told them to \\"respect their father\\".Donald's story is the voice of many children. Children that even today, suffer from a system in which community and church leaders refuse to see or admit they are wrong.Anyone who reads this book will be deeply touched in their heart. I can only admire that little boy that became such a nice person because of his own strength and persistence.

His memoir most often reads like a very good work of fiction - unfortunately, it's not fiction. By recounting a part of his life story here, D'Haene shows once more proves that old adage that truth is stranger (or in this case more horrifying) than fiction. At some level, \\"Father's Touch\\" brings home the horror and repercussions of parental sexual abuse of children to all who read it. One thing I found really disturbing, although not surprising, is how the religious community to which the D'Haene family belonged, the judge who handled his mother's divorce case and others did nothing even after they learned of these horrendous crimes. It seems to reflect that society at large would often rather shove matters like this under the rug and hope they go away rather than deal with them head on. Anyway, I commend D'Haene's courage for coping as he did, for taking the actions he did and for writing this book."},{"Title":"Sea shells of the world;: A guide to the better-known species. 790 illus. in color of 562 species (A Golden nature guide)","review":"When I was 12 years old our family went on vacation to Folly Island South Carolina. I had been a shell enthusiast since I was in diapers and we got to stay in a beach house owned by my uncle. I was in heaven! I grew up in the northeast and had never seen any of the shells that seemed to be common place there. Unfortunately, up to then I had never owned a book on shells and knew little about them or even what to call most of them. On my second day there my aunt gave me a little book with shells on the cover. I opened it up and it opened a whole new world for me. I was mesmerized. I now had a source of information about my favorite pastime. I looked up and found each and every shell I had found and even learned how to clean and take care of them like a professional. That book was Seashells of the World. Thirty years later I now have thousands of shells and hundreds of books on shells, many of them quite advanced but to this day that little book is my favorite by far.

I had a complete flashback when I opened the covers and viewed the wonderful pictures. This series, \\"A Golden Guide\\" was the first series of books that I owned concerning what is probably my primary interest - nature. As a small boy I had one of these on animals, reptiles and amphibians, insects, trees, flowers and many more. I can remember spending hours and hours pouring over them, to the point that I wore many of them completely out and could recite from memory, verbatim, page after page, description after description. It would be difficult to estimate how many hours I spent with these books and running around in the woods, creeks, fields and yard trying to identify things. They were actually quite a large part of my life. You have to remember that there were not that many child friendly identification guides at that time and that access to books was far more limited then than it is now.This particular little volume is simply full of the most wonderful colored pictures, actually, life like drawings, of the most perfect and beautiful seashells. The text is wonderfully readable for age appropriate children to use. And believe me, these are well made little books and can take quite a beating. I was a rather rowdy youth and should know.Now do not be mistaken, this is not the end all books for shell collectors. This little book deals with over 200 genera and over 1,100 species and could hardly be expected to even scratch the surface of this subject. A serious shell collector will need much more than this in their arsenal; but that being said, there are certainly worse books out there to get a kid started and get a kid interested in something new.I am not at all sure if this series is still in print, but if it is not, it is a true pity. I know my life would be much less richer had I not had access to them and parents that saw to it that I owned them. My original copy of this particular book has long been departed now, worn into an almost unreadable state, but my goodness, did this used copy ever bring back some wonderful memories.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Sea shells of the world;: A guide to the better-known species. 790 illus. in color of 562 species (A Golden nature guide)","review":"My Grandfather gave me this little book and started me on Shell Collecting.

I've been trying to find a copy of the mini-series to view and then I got the idea to read the book version. It is one of the best decisions I have made in my life. Stephanie Harper is a frumpy billionaire and the richest woman in Australia. She is also planning to marry ex-tennis-pro, Greg Marsden. At their wedding, Stephanie's best friend Jilly Stewart, and Greg notice each other and are immediately attracted. For their honeymoon Stephanie convinces Greg that they should go to her summer estate in the outback, called Eden. When Stephanie notices how well Greg and Jilly are getting along, she agrees to Greg's idea that Jilly join them at Eden later on. Even though her husband Phillip is against the idea, Jilly agrees.No sooner does Jilly arrive, then Greg and Jilly meet out in the stables at night and cheat on Stephanie. Awhile later, Greg arranges for the three of them to go on a crocodile hunt. When the biggest gator in the swamp, named Gindy Baru, approaches their boat, Greg shoves Stephanie overboard, and because she can't swim she is pulled under by the croc as Greg and Jilly watch. Even though she is shocked by what Greg has done Jilly decides not to report him to the police.Unbeknownst to Greg and Jilly, Stephanie has survived the attack, and is dying on an island in the midst of the swamp. Luckily for her, a hermit named Dave is passing by and rescues her from the approaching crocs. After taking her to his house he nurses her back to health and when she tells him she can't remember who she is, he gives her the new name Tara Welles. Finally, when she is well enough to go out on her own, he gives her his valuable collection of opals and gets her aboard a bus headed for Townsville.When she arrives, her memory slowly returns and she decides she must have a grand revenge against Greg. She cashes the opals at a pawn shop, and still being horribly scared she goes to a renowned plastic surgeon who owns a clinic on Orpheus Island. Once there, she meets the owner, Dr. Dan, and she begins her treatments. She also takes a liking to Dan and she becomes his favorite patient. Even when the liking for one another begins to grown into a romance neither of them say anything. Finally after numerous surgeries Tara has become a different woman. She is thinner, prettier, looks ten years younger, and has lost a lot of weight from eating the island's nutritious food. When she is fully recovered from the surgeries she decides to leave the island, even though Dan encouragers her to stay.Using her last bit of money, Tara buys a rundown, roach-infested apartment to live in. One night, she gets the urge to see her former home so bad she takes the trip and runs into a servant leaving the home. When he doesn't recognize her, it gives Tara more confidence then ever that neither will Greg. Just as she is leaving she sees Jilly approach the house to meet Greg. She then realizes that Jilly is also involved and beings to plot a way to wreak vengeance on both Greg and her former best friend. A few weeks later, Tara hears that Joanna Randall, the owner of the largest fashion agency in Sydney needs an older model for their new clothing line for older women. Tara walks in and gets the job immediately. She becomes a huge success, buys a new apartment in Sydney, and meets Greg at a charity fund-raiser. Not realizing who she is he is immediately taken by her and dumps Jilly for her, all the while pretending to still be interested in her. After Greg and Tara go out several times, Jilly confronts Tara to find out if anything is going on. Tara denies it and soon she and Jilly are close friends.However, when Greg invites Tara to spend the weekend with him, Jilly shows up drunk and \\"chases\\" Tara off. Actually, Tara leaves of her own will to get Greg furious with Jilly. It works. No sooner has Tara left, then Greg and Jilly attack each other. In the meantime, Dan who now realizes how much he does love Tara finds her and begs her to marry him. She also wants him, buy knows it will spoil her revenge, so she refuses and leaves Dan broken hearted. A few days later, Tara calls Greg, pretending to be upset about the incident with Jilly and convinces him to take her someplace where they can be alone. Soon plans are made for the couple to return to Eden.Jilly, still believing that Greg loves her, divorces Phillip. No sooner has she has done this, then she receives a call from Tara. She is at the airport with Greg and they are flying out to Eden. Tara's plan works and Jilly, frantic and having nowhere to go, rushes to the airport and buys her own ticket. Out at Eden, Tara pretends to be having a wonderful time with Greg. Katie, Eden's housekeeper, uncovers Tara's secret but says nothing. Now all Tara has to do is wait for Jilly to arrive and everything is in it's place for her revenge to play out.I won't give away the ending of the book, but I will promise you it is easily the most suspenseful one ever written. I know this book is out of print and hard to find, but you still should try to track down a copy.

Through a series of sermons, rants, and paranoid ramblings, woven together into a loose narrative, Lamblove/Rathbun exposes the absurdity of contemporary evangelical Christianity. If you're an ex-evangelical, or an evangelical who doesn't buy the whole bill of goods, or an evangelical who likes to challenge his or her assumptions, or a left-leaning Christian with the red state blues, this book will make you feel like you're not crazy and you're not alone.I don't know who those guys are that reviewed it (I keep my distance from Christianity Today).

He also has a seldom seen attitude (from evanglicalism, anyway) that you're okay whether you believe it or not.It's a little Soren Kierkegaard, a little Walker Percy, a little Flannery O'Connor, even a little Kurt Vonnegut.

Rathbun has a Flannery O'Connor sense of grace, grotesque and explosive, which makes this book so impacting.Challenging all notions of faith and mercy, this book takes apart what has become the blanket Christian culture.

Detailed iterations of the end times will always appeal to those who see crises under every vine and fig-tree wishing somehow to solve them with shock and awe-a swift and bloodless end of the world.However, the crisis facing Rev. Richard Lamblove [sic] is not so much apocalyptic fear of the unknown as it is nausea in the face of meager attempts by the so-called Contemporary Christian Culture Conspiracy to make sense of the current crisis in American culture. It seems that the C4 prefers to confront empire with sprawling mega-mall/churches rather than inhabit the catacombs of the American underworld.Lamblove desires a radical reorientation that metes out judgment and mercy in one fell swoop, that has no favorites and that will cause every knee to bow. Ironically, the only recipient of this dialectical apocalypse is Lamblove himself. Perhaps, in a culture that lionizes autonomy, the narrow way by which one can enter the new world that Lamblove could envision is to break down one preacher at a time.If you're looking for an answer to Tim LaHaye's vision of the end of the world, don't bother reading this book. The end of the world in Post-Rapture Radio is disorientation, fatigue, and confusion in the face of the coming change. You should read it.

A world where there is Good News for the poor, releases for the captives, the recovery of sight for the blind - where the oppressed are free, and all live according to God's good favor. What takes more faith - to believe that God can save you or that God is going to save the whole world and wants you to help?\\" - pg. 86, Rev.

Post-Rapture Radio is fiction - forget for a moment the adjective Christian - at its very best. It is inventive, humorous, shocking, provocative, philosophical and at times quite depressing. It's almost existential. Rathbun has a message, to be sure, and it's directed at Christians. However, unlike most \\"Christian novels with a message,\\" the message does not weigh the writing down.In the book, the narrator discovers a box containing various writings of \\"unknown crazy preacher\\" Richard Lamblove. The writings include sermons, journal entries & miscellaneous scribbled notes by this man, whose only proof of existence appears to be the documents in the box. Most of the book consists of these various writings, interspersed with notes by the narrator, who is trying to make some sense of the writings. Lamblove is at odds with what he perceives as the \\"Contemporary Christian Church Conspiracy\\" that surrounds him and it's either driving him crazy, or driving him sane. Or perhaps both.There will be a number of people who simply \\"don't get\\" the book, which to me only shows how brilliant the book is (all great books are not understood by the masses). Some will hate it because it pushed various buttons, and we all hate when our buttons get pushed. Many will love the book, just because it's so well-written and relevant. My reaction, however, was that I began to identify so closely with Rev. Lamblove that I experienced moments of near despair (a near existential moment - another sign of a great book).The only shortcoming of the book, in my opinion, was that the Lamblove character is a pastor. The way the book resolved (I won't give the ending away) was fine for Lamblove, but what about the majority of people in the church? What options are open to those trapped in their own Contemporary Christian Church Conspiracy, but without the resources and opportunities of the leadership (not that he gave any specific answers there, either)? I need to ask Rathbun ... perhaps he'll write a sequel."},{"Title":"Post-Rapture Radio: Lost Writings fromthe Failed Revolution at the End of the Last Century","review":"Post-Rapture Radio is a thought provoking book that is fun to read.It follows the adventures of one Rev.

Devious courtiers surround his London court, and tension exists between Scotsman and Englishman. Into this milieu comes Nigel Olifaunt, a poverty-stricken Scottish lord. His lands are hopelessly mortgaged, and, without any fortune of his own, Nigel hopes to persuade King James to make good on a large debt he owed to Nigel's now deceased father. With this money, Nigel hopes to reclaim his ancestral home. Thus Walter Scott begins another entertaining novel. His stories are not without faults--he can be discursive; his characters flat (e.g. David Ramsay, the the absent-minded watchmaker for King James, hardly exists in this novel); and his knowledge arcane. The patient reader will overlook these imperfections and enjoy the wonders to be found. Lord Dalgarno, Nigel's ostensible friend, proves to be an effective villain; Martha Trapbois provides pathos as the daughter of a hated usurer; and Sir Mungo Malagrowther, former whipping boy to King James, is the most entertaining cynic I've found in literature. If one is new to Scott, \\"The Fortunes of Nigel\\" isn't a bad place to start. Little Scottish dialect is to be found, and the plot moves briskly.

Martin Buber will long stand as the seminal work for dialog and interpersonal interactions. But, don't take my word for it, read the book."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Ich und Du (\\"I and Thou\\") is one of those philosophical texts which, like Schopenhauer's Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, consist of the elaboration of a single thought. The thought is stated up front: human beings have a double relation to the world: Ich-Du and Ich-Es. The Ich-Es relation reifies and separates things out (whether they be \\"internal\\" or \\"external\\" things), while the Ich-Du relation is nothing but relation itself. The Eswelt is a world of nebeneinander and the laws that govern nebeneinander, while the Duwelt is a seamless experience of \\"presence.\\" The Ich that reaches out and the Du that reaches back (neither of which reflects on \\"what\\" they individually are) constitute an exclusive circular reality (Ausschlie&szlig;lickheit) untroubled by causal and spatiotemporal regress. To be sure, the Duwelt collapses into the Eswelt, which means that the Ich and the Du degenerate into so many instances of Es, but there is always the possibility of resurrecting the Ich & Du hidden within the Es.There are different kinds of Ich-Du relation: 1) with nature (presumably before we know to call it \\"nature\\"), in which case we stand at the \\"threshold of speech\\"; 2) with human beings, in which case speech coincides with the Ich-Du relation; and 3) with \\"spiritual beings,\\" in which case the relation itself is speechless, but it can generate speech. (This third relation is very much in the spirit of romantic poesis.) A special subset of the third relation is the relation to God, who is the Du beyond every particular Du. God is the only Du with whom our relation cannot degrade into an Ich-Es relation, because there is no Es beyond every individual Es for which God could be mistaken. (There are, too be sure, many things which people falsely call \\"God,\\" things which are really part of nature or of ourselves, such as Schleiermacher's Abhangigkeitsgef&uuml;hl or Rudolf Otto's Kreaturgef&uuml;hl, as Buber specifically points out).What is essential in every case is the duality of the relation. Buber warns against interpreting the Ich-Du as a self-relation of the Ich (i.e. Hegel) or as a kind of \\"symmetry breaking\\" (to use a term from physics), which can be restored to oneness at the proper mystical \\"heat.\\"One of the explicit objects of this text is to move beyond liberal Protestant theology, i.e. beyond a theology that grounds the religious in some quality of subjective experience. For Buber, religion occurs before there is a subject, and once we arrive at the subject, we find it impossible to even think of religion apart from the subject's relation to another. Buber exploits the pronoun Du (\\"you\\") to draw our attention to an experience of encounter (rather than reflection or feeling) inadequately addressed by rational philosophy, and he employs this experience in the service of religion.Buber may not go far enough, however. He moves beyond the subject, but he does not move beyond religion-as-experience, which is the real drawback of liberal theology. In a sense, Buber is freeing God from the subject only to bind him down to \\"relation\\" (Beziehung), which hovers somewhere between subject and object, and is not obviously \\"religious\\" at all. There is nothing in Buber's argument protecting it, for example, from a biological-evolutionary explanation of the Ich-Du relation, or a psychoanalytic one. Buber overcomes one obstacle only to land himself before another one.Sorry if that was a little technical."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This book should destroy any psychological notion that people exist in separate subjectivities. Buber's beautifully written psycho-mystical prose leaves one breathless. A deserved classic."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This book took me be surprise. I stumbled on it by accident when bouncing around between Heidegger, Jung, and a book on Jewish customs (nothing quite like being eclectic). It was just serendipitous at the time while I was trying to put together a thesis on non-foundational friendship. I have since read 'Between Man and Man' which, while actually longer, is actually an easier read so on reflection it may be better to start with that first. Nevertheless anytime that you spend with I-Thou is never wasted and has not just profound philosophical insights but also tremendous wisdom from practical living. Coming to grips with the I-Thou mode of being-in-the-world has been life changing for me and has launched my thinking in new and productive directions, so much so that I am tempted to write that it is the most influential philosophical work that I have read. It sits within the spectrum of continental philosophy, and it particular existentialism but it maintains it's Jewish distinctiveness with it's emphasis on the 'other'. If this sounds like you then I cannot recommend this highly enough."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"I AND THOU by Martin BuberI think this book will delight everyone who likes Buber,or who appreciates sentences like\\"Of course God is the wholly Other\\"; but He is also the wholly Same, the wholly Present.\\"I love that book and bought it from amazon one month ago - after I had heard people talk of itfor ages..."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This is a great book, written originally in German. The German language has two second person singular pronouns: &quot;dich&quot;, and &quot;du&quot;. &quot;Du&quot; is reserved for intimate friends. RG Smith, in the 30's, translated Buber's book &quot;Ich und Du&quot;, rendering &quot;du&quot; as &quot;Thou&quot;. In 1969, after Buber died, his son asked Walter Kaufmann, himself a well-known philosopher and translater, to retranslate the text. Kaufmann renders &quot;du&quot; as &quot;You&quot;. I think this makes all the difference in the world, whether you think of &quot;Thou&quot; as aloof and transcendent, or as &quot;You&quot;, intimate and immanent. I recommend the Kaufmann translation over the Smith."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Unlike the usual philosophical endeavor, this book does not build an argument or make a case about a particular interpretation of the world or some aspect of it. Rather, Buber's seminal work begins with a key insight into our way of being in the world and goes on to weave an intricate web of variations on this theme, creating, if you let it, a sense of his core insight in the reader's own mind. Reading this book is not about reading a philosophical argument or thesis but rather about giving oneself up to the man and his insight: that there are two fundamental ways for us to be in the world, as subjects relating to objects (in order to use them for ourselves) or as subjects relating to subjects (which recognize ourselves in that which meets us at the other end of the &quot;relation&quot;). For Buber this is what it is all about. And, he tells us, we cannot choose one or the other but must (and do) have both though it is easy for us to lose sight of the subjectness of others when we embrace their objectness. And so he bangs away at the need to see the subjectness, not only in other persons but in other aspects of the world as well, and, indeed, in the world itself, holding that to &quot;see&quot; the subjectness that is there, in the world as a whole (through relating in this manner to its parts), is to see God. And this is where it gets somewhat abstruse for he offers no proof of God in the ordinary sense but rather the assertion alone that we must have access to the subjective aspect of being in order to fully live our lives and that this assumes God. He has no proofs to offer but only an ongoing spiraling prose poem that builds the sense of the world as he has seen it, a realm of subject to subject that overarches and informs the more mundane reality of subject to object in which we are generally mired. If you are looking for a philosophical work that builds an argument with proofs and rational discourse, this is not the book for you. But if you are willing to immerse yourself in his sometimes ecstatic prose, then this offers an experience worth having. Not all philosophy is about building logical edifices or exposing one's thinking to rigorous analytical critiques. Sometimes it's just about insight and seeing the world in a new way. And that is what Buber gave us with this book. -- SWM"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This small book is obscure at times and difficult to grasp, yet it completely changed my life. I honestly think Buber wrote it poetically to encourage the reader to slow down and potentially I have a true encounter with the ideas. Most of Buber's later books seem to be developing the ideas expounded in I and Thou, so it might be helpful to read another Buber text, like Between Man and Man, alongside I and Thou. He becomes his own commentary. If you have the patience, I think you'll find this book opens a whole new perspective on relationships, our perspective on the world, and the potential for truly divine encounters."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Martin Buber has achieved something amazing in this slim book. All you really need to read is Part One of I and Thou (more appropriately translated as 'I and You' in my opinion) to understand his very practical philosophy. There is more profundity in those 30 pages than in all the religious / &quot;metaphysical studies&quot; / spirituality aisle books you'll ever see.For some reason, Buber is always shelved under Judaica, when Philosophy seems like a better place for him, but anyway don't be scared off by the religious categorization. This book is as secular as they come, and therefore safe for the avowed atheists out there.Anyway, after reading enormous doses of literature, and a pretty good smattering of Western philosophy, this was the first book to have simple, applicable advice; it is at one and the same time a metaphysical system and a doctrine of how to live the good life. As far as I know, these two branches of philosophy usually seem pretty far apart, except in religion, in which case you are forced to accept absurdities as the price of this marriage.Buber is neither an optimist nor a pessimist. He's an existentialist but I find him more 'useful' than other Ex's because his theory is not just a laying bare of hypocrisy -- Buber actually gives you a way of taking positive action to enrich your life.Lest you misunderstand this convoluted review, there is nothing Anthony Robbins-ish about Buber.

Buber's powerful stance on human (and divine) relations is even more relevant and poignant today as we spend more and more time in enclosed rooms trying to communicate with strangers through machines. Buber understood human isolation so well and so eloquently mourned its harmful effects, proposing a far better way to live and relate to others.I hope that readers will take the time to digest what Buber has to say. As for which transation to read, I began with the Kaufmann, but soon found the older one by Ronald Gregor Smith to be more direct, less wordy, and much more beautifullly written. However, regardless of which translation you read, this book is truly a gem."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Buber's basic distinction is between the I- It, and the I- Thou relationship. In the I-It relationship we treat others as objects and make use of them for our own selfish purposes. In the I - Thou relationship we treat others with full respect, and seek to understand their inwardness as we understand our own. In the I- Thou relationship as Buber conceives it true dialogue and true relationship is possible. And in this kind of meaningful relationship between two understanding and empathetic human beings we come into a kind of holy relationship. And this kind of holy human relationship parallels the proper relationship we are to have with God.While this single idea might seem too all encompassing to really analyze the complexity of our human relationships, I believe it is a basically right guiding concept.Buber in this short work sets out his theoretical understanding of the concept. Buber is ordinarily a clear writer, and a remarkable storyteller as in his 'Tales of the Hasidism' work. But here the theoretical structure means that there is much abstraction often difficult to understand. Philosophy meets poetry here but not always in a readily comprehensible way.But again this is the key concept of a major thinker, and a concept which illuminate the path for each of us to a better and more humanly fulfilling life."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This book was truly amazing and I continual refer to it with my relationships with other people. And that is the central commandment - to realize that we have relationships with people, trees, dogs, and god (an I-You relationship). We do not experience the abovementioned as objects (an I-It relationship) but they have life that reciprocates our actions. Buber explains our relationships and how we should go about interpreting them. For example, animals and plants are a relationship beneath language, people our related to within language, and finally the eternal you (god) is above our function of language.\\"Feeling dwell in man, but man dwells in his love. This is no metaphor but actuality: love does not cling to an I, as if the You were merely its \\"content\\" or object; it is between I and You. Whoever does not know this...does not know love...\\"The only way one can find themselves is to experience the relationship. I highly recommend this book, but I do suggest a dictionary nearby because the wording can get rather tricky. Admittedly it is a difficult read, but taking your time with each paragraph and rereading when necessary, I am confident that if you truly want to find out more about a simple but thought provoking philosophy you will find yourself done with the book in a matter of weeks."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"I find the notes of Walter Kaufmann very valuable and gives another way of understanding the Old Testament. If you get an edition of I AND THOU, I highly recommend getting one translated with notes by Walter Kaufmann. The main theme of Buber in this book is that there are two basic relationships with life I-Thou and I-It. When we meet life in I-Thou we enter the sacred and are truly authentic to each other. From this basic relationship comes a kind of Monotheism as well as the ethics of personal conscience and integrity and meeting another person in their fullness, rather than reducing them or life to a thing which can be manipulated or analyzed or even objectively known. I feel that Buber opened the heart and core of the Old Testament to me, beyond what my previously more Christian studies implied was there (making any message there inferior to what the New Testament gives). Before then all I could get was outmoded laws, grisly wars, strange folklore, and proverbial common sense with an occasionally wise statement which was a nugget of gold in the strange medley of books. But once I got what this kind of authentic relating was about, something seemed to unify for me about the Old Testament and the rest made sense. I still find a lot of what I used to find there, but with the key Buber gave, I could see something growing at the very heart of Judaism behind all those books about what it meant to meet each other authentically and to feel I divinity that says I AM."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"The image of the self is incomplete without the image of the other. There are very few books that resonate so meaningfully or reflect the human condition as accurately as does I and Thou. Buber presses upon his reader the importance of engaging all of one's self in experience in order to be fully attuned to one's environment and the entities present in it, not to view the other as separate from the self but as vital and purposeful in its own self."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"I am actually going to try and do something novel and comment on the product. - I think the way to do that is to comment on Walter Kaufmann's Introduction and Buber's actual thought. There are other translations available, but I think they're out of print. -The attraction of Buber is his universality, and it is this that Kaufmann plays down from the start. Kaufmann emphasizes that Buber is a \\"Judaic thinker,\\" and while that is certainly true, it is clear that Kaufmann is more concerned with issues of Buber's Jewish identity and his not being a Gentile more than Buber's thought. I find Kaufmann's tendency is in line with Ruth Wisse to a degree - I remember her saying that \\"Jews want to be left alone\\" or some such thing in The Modern Jewish Canon. ...Buber himself probably would agree with Malamud's maxim \\"All men are Jews, though few men know it.\\" There is something universal about Judaism itself, of course, and it is not simply a matter of identity. It is simply a matter of being human, knowing God, and knowing one's community and one's family. And I know Buber would agree with what I'm saying in this paragraph, because it was through reading Buber I learned these things.I want to end these comments by saying that this is a book I recommend to everyone I meet; I just wanted you to take Kaufmann's comments with a grain of salt, and maybe earn Buber a disciple before you even read the book."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This outstanding book gives a vision of a human philosophy far from the dehumanising reductionism of most twentieth century Cartesian philosophy. While Buber uses poetic language, those interested in seeing an alternate, more philosophical rigorous working out of these ideas should look at the neglected work of the Scottish philosopher John Macmurray (1891-1976).Macmurray firstly proposes action, and not thought, as the fundamental basis for understanding what it is to be human. When Descartes says \\"I think\\", he is then already divorced from the world. One can ONLY exist in interaction with others and other things, it is absurd to imagine a person as existing in a universe where there is nothing else whatsoever. Action is the full state of the human being, and thinking is a lesser, abstracted state. Action is a full concrete activity of the Self employing all our capacities whereas thought is constituted by the exclusion of some of our powers and a WITHDRAWAL into an activity which is less concrete and less complex... a theory of knowledge is derived from and included in a theory of action.Secondly, Macmurray proposes another enormous paradigm shift for Western philosophy by saying that we cannot fully understand individuals in isolation, but only in relation to others. Relationship is constitutive of human living for Macmurray: 'We need one another to be ourselves. This complete and unlimited dependence of each of us upon the others is the central and crucial fact of personal existence.' The idea of an isolated agent is self-contradictory; any agent is necessarily in relationship with Others. Macmurray corresponded with Martin Buber, and his thought essentially extends Buber's vision.These two central tenets are explicated respectively in Macmurray's two major works, \\"The Self as Agent\\" and \\"Persons in Relation\\" (also published together as \\"The Form of the Personal\\"). Macmurray's writing is crystal clear, and filled with other fascinating points, such as his distinction between intellectual and emotional representations, in chapter 9 of \\"The Self as Agent\\".A great short introduction to Macmurray and his work can be found in David Creamer's book \\"Guides to the Journey\\"."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"this is a wonderful book, and the Smith translation is fine, but this binding isn't worth the high price for this edition.

Whereas Buber was well-acquainted with the works of many before him, it is clear from reading his own works (and 'I-Thou in particular) that he himself was concerned with, among other aspects of the 'human', the very problem(s) of the systematising of human experience.In this regard, the 'I-Thou' relation is in 'opposition' to any 'system' of thought, (philosophical/theological/ otherwise); although 'systematising' of the 'I-Thou' encounter can be done afterwards. In this regard, Buber's explication of the 'I-Thou' encounter is not meant to be approached from a 'systems point-of view' - it is to challenge and draw the reader's attention to the 'I-Thou' encounter."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Surely I AND THOU ranks among the twentieth century's ten most important books. The extent to which human relationships formconsciousness and selfhood, and how this relates to \\"God,\\" will be one of the lasting discoveries of the era, and Buber was this work's chief architect.It is dense material, but there are many mysteriously lovely passages: the part about looking into the eyes of a cat, as if almost able to induce human consciousness, is unforgettable.In a one-star Amazon review, it complains in somewhat Nietzschean terms (and credit Buber with being one of the earliest scholars to be sufficiently challenged by Nietzsche's insights) that Buber denies \\"the infinite perfectibility of Man.\\" But consider how effortlessly Buber's text \\"reads\\" such a formulation: there is an implicit \\"I-it\\" relationship between the speaker and this \\"Man\\" whose perfectibility we hope to objectively assess. On the other hand, we are invited to enjoy an \\"I-you\\" relationship with the speaker, as subjects judging Man the object.Now, either the \\"I-you\\" relationship we *really* have in mind--without facing our tacit religiosity in the matter--is with God the unobjectifiable, or what we call the \\"perfecting\\" process is as imperfect as Man: it is, in the cold light of day, nothing more nor less than whatever action accommodates the objectifiers, however randomly these arbiters of perfection are chosen."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"never opened it once yet, but it looks pretty interesting. more words are required for me to type in this"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Got it.

This book transforms the relational world we live in; into a workable experience. People live in an I-You or an I-It world.

Eliot. Throughout I and Thou, Buber seducers the reader with wonderfully vivid analogies and metaphors to describe the entire catalogue of human emotions, from despair to love.Speaking of love, Buber gets right to the actual connection, the actual relationship between \\"Yous\\": soul touching and speaking with soul. Buber describes beautifully how love transcends not only social ranks and appearances, but even transcends the \\"I\\" and the ego.Feelings one \\"has\\"; love occurs. Feelings dwell in man, but man dwells in his love. This is no metaphor but actuality: love does not cling to an I, as if the You were merely its \\"content\\" or object; it is between I and You. Whoever does not know this, know this with his being, does not know love, even if he should ascribe to it the feelings that he lives through...Love is responsibility of an I for a You: in this consists what cannot consist in any feeling -- the equality of all lovers, from the smallest to the greatest.This certainly rings true for any and all who have ever truly loved; for any who has ever placed the happiness of another above their own. Buber even refers to this as \\"the simple magic of life\\", an endearing sentiment in the least.Buber also speaks of despair: \\"the sublime melancholy of our lot\\", \\"the moon and the dead who haunt him at night with pain or lust\\", glowing darkness of the chaos\\", and \\"the overseers give you a superior smile, but death lurks in their hearts\\" are all phrases that one can fit into anything Poe or Dante ever wrote (this is not true...Poe wrote plenty of poems and short stories that are anything but dark and gloomy, and of the Divine Comedy only Inferno appears hopeless and dark while Purgatorio and Paradiso express a multitude of hope in a heavenly world and being). Buber then begins offering solutions to this despair and this world, and his solution, ostensibly, is that of looking at the world not as an \\"I-It\\" relationship but as an \\"I-You\\" relationship.It comes as no surprise that someone who is pushing for an \\"I-You\\" relationship with the world is also pushing for community. However, this is quite an anomaly in the world of philosophy. While most theology and philosophy urge humanity to turn away from the world, while hermits and ascetic Hindu wanderers are upheld and revered throughout not only Christianity and Hinduism but throughout most secular philosophy as well, Buber's advice breaks the mold. He advises Man (and Woman) to relate, on a very spiritual level, with the rest of the world, the other \\"Yous\\", to include persons, animals, and...trees.Another striking break from most moral philosophers is Buber's acceptance of profit and power motives.Man's will to profit and will to power are natural and legitimate as long as they are tied to the will to human relations and carried by it.Unfortunately, this appears to be a contradiction in terms. Can a will to power (or to profit) ever be tied to a will to human relations? Doesn't the latter require equality while the former obliterates it? If Buber sees the \\"You\\" in everything (as stated earlier: persons, animals, plants), then what can Woman [or, Man (I am trying to give equal billing here)] aspire to hold power over?It is once I began to distance myself from the lure of Buber's language and, with a skeptical eye, discern the crux of his argument that I find more and more that I am uncomfortable with. Buber is a fatalist. He believes in a predetermined fate for each and every individual. It seems, though, that he understood his audience to be uncomfortable with the ideas of \\"fate\\" and \\"predestination\\" (he published in 1923...not 1536), so he did his best to mask his fatalism in an idea that everyone seems to love and promote: \\"freedom\\".Fate and freedom are promised to each other. Fate is encountered only by him that actualizes freedom.In terms of pure meaning, this statement is utter nonsense; yet, Buber further argues that one \\"does not feel oppressed by causal necessity\\". I would argue that \\"feeling\\" has nothing to do with oppression. In a highly-hyped, lackluster movie released in the late 1990s (1998), a man named Truman Burbank finally discovers that his entire life occurs within a bubble that is completely manipulated by a handful of people on the outside. Up to that point, Truman never feels as though he is oppressed; in fact, he is, from all appearances, a very happy person who feels positively free to live his life in whatever manner he sees fit. Once he discovers the sham though, he realizes he was oppressed all-along; if he had never discovered the rouse, though, he would have remained feeling free...and, of course, have remained completely oppressed.Buber writes a compelling book, as long as one ignores his central theme. He investigates the spirit and spiritual relations in ways that most philosophers (or, at least, Western philosophers) have not done. He brings to light a very compelling argument and indictment against science, stating that ultimately, science relies on just as much faith as religion and theology. Yet, he also indicts himself, unknowingly, when he inquires:How much intellectual eloquence and artistry is used today to prevent or at least conceal this occurrence?True. I will never begrudge Buber the title and honor of a very eloquent artist.For more book reviews and suggestions, please visit: http://www.theunemploymentbenefits.com"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"There is something about the German language (perhaps it's the abundance of compound words, or the complicated grammar) that promotes this kind of philosophy - by - obfuscation. The phenomenon is widespread, (cf. Hegel, Heidegger, Adorno, et al). Take a relatively simple idea, preferrably one based on sentiment rather than logic, and then try to convey it as obscurely as possible through the use of compound words, vast sentences brimming with dependent clauses, and the most paradoxical lines of reasoning available. The result will then be hailed as a masterpiece by those who make a living out of teaching courses on this material (and those who take the courses and are afraid to admit they didn't understand much).Out of the idea that the relations of the self to others are very important (and that God is the most important of those others), Buber has crafted this impenatrable monstrosity. Sadly, there are many others like him out there, whose livelihood comes from being as verbose as humanly possible.

My general complaint is that the writing is not necessarily systematic and it does not clearly define its terms very well. Also Buber never seems to explain what exactly the I is and why it is always related to either It or Thou. Despite some of the problems I had with Buber I enjoyed reading this but I never really squeezed the whole juice out of it. When I started reading other summaries and writings about Buber that's when I realize that what Buber was trying to say all along is the that experience of the Eternal-Thou is found through the authentic interaction with others. Whereas Heidegger had a very individualistic approach towards authentic living, Buber had a interpersonal approach towards authentic living, which is to have authentic personal relationships with people instead of treating them as commodities and objects. Basically, we are initially stuck in the world of \\"it\\" since we always analyze and reduce all things conceptually. but when we approach any object or \\"it\\" in a very personal manner in which we conceive of it as a whole rather than in parts, we see the \\"thou\\". Ironically, it is through the instant interaction with each individual thou that you are really interacting with the eternal Thou. This may not be an adequate summarization Buber's book, but I have to say that I enjoyed it fairly much since it seems to be connect the existential authenticity interpersonal relationship with the relationship with the Eternal Thou (God), which I find some-what refreshing because it seems some-what common to find among some Christians to approach the world with very ascetic and hermit-like attitude (\\"I should spend more time with God than with my friends!\\" kind of attitude)."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"I was a philosophy major in college and I've read a lot of works out there.

We reach a new level of awareness when we choose to approach the other as a Thou - as a relational being and not as an It. We don't find this by seeking an object, but by grace.

The Introduction by Walter Kaufmann is superb. He accurately extracts some of the essence of Buber's text, and places it in the context of Judeo-Christian thought. I say \\"some of the essence\\" because Kaufmann would likely be the first to say that he is not an interpreter of Buber's complete vision of human relationship to the \\"Other.\\" Kaufmann prepares one for the shock of Buber's direct use of simple language (at least in Kaufmann's translation) to depict one's personal relationship with another. Key to the popularity of Buber is the fact that his philosophy of human interaction applies to human-human relationships as well human-God relationships."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Buber's not at all pedantic about his philosophy here. The book's structure utilizes a lyrical simplicity to broach the \\"between\\" that, in the full service of irony, has no spatial coordinates at all.

I, for one, think of Buber as akin to Kierkegaard (I'm sure to evoke scowls for overlooking the difference between Buber's traditional role in his religious community and Kierkegaard's arrant iconoclasm), especially in light of this work, which gives the terrifying recesses of irrationality a new humanism."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Martin Buber's \\"I and Thou\\" has long been acclaimed as a classic.

I agree with other reviewers on its value.That said, here I'm rating a translation, not the original German. This 1937 translation is not adequate, especially by modern standards. It's clunky and its choice of English words and expressions leaves much to be desired. Buber is not easy, and the thread of his thinking is sometime difficult to follow, but translator Ronald Gregor Smith adds unnecessary difficulty. In some cases his interpretation of the original German seems questionable to this reviewer.There is an Italian proverb, \\"Traduttore:traditore\\" (translator:traitor). For me, in this case the shoe fits. Read the original German if you can; if not, then Walter Kaufmann's 1970 English translation (also available on Amazon) is much, much better."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This is the wisest book written in the last hundred years. If religion is to survive in the next millenium, it will be because of books like I and Thou. While the Kaufmann translation is difficult (I prefer Gregor Smith's version) I can't imagine a better way to spend one's time than lovingly reading I and Thou."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Buber describes in detail the mechanism of what might be called Self (big 'S') and self (small 's'). It is with works like this that positive change can enter, and heal, the foundational relationships that shape human existence, and thus our world. Bravo!"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"\\"God is the mysterium tremendum that appears and overthrows, but he is also the mystery of the self-evident, nearer to me than my I.\\"-Martin BuberThe basic assumption of Buber's philosophy is that man has two distinct ways of engaging the world:* The first mode (the mode of I-It) is the mode of experience. In experience, we are engaging the world as an objective observer rather than as a participant. Experience is the mode of science and philosophy, the mode through which we come to know things intellectually, and to put things to use for us. The object of experience (the It) is viewed as a thing to be utilized for some purpose. I and the experienced It: the one is the subject, and the other the object. In this relationship, the experiencing I is an objective observer rather than an active participant in this mode of engaging the world.* The second mode (the mode of I-You) is the mode of encounter, we enter into a relationship with the object encountered, we participate in something with that object, and both the I and the You are transformed by the relationship. The You we encounter is indulged in its entirety, not as a sum of its qualities, instead, it is encountered as if it were the entire universe, or rather, as if the entire universe somehow existed through the You.This \\"encounter can happen with any of the objects that we experience; but with another human the phenomena of encounter is best described as love. We can also, however, enter into encounter with a being that cannot be the object of experience: God.Western culture, according to Buber, has generally come to think that the first mode is the only mode available to human beings for engaging the world, as a result of this approach the modern man has come to feel alienated fundamentally because modern society is exclusively an It-world. We live in a world that strictly relies on experience not encounter. The only solution to modern man's woes is a true fulfilling community that can only be built by making proper use of the neglected second mode of engaging the world, and by using this mode to relate to God.Human alienation is a result of the emptiness we encounter with humans, where we feel that there could be something more, something more lasting and more fulfilling. This \\"more\\" is encounter with God, or absolute revelationThis divine revelation is the only salvation for humans, the only feeling that canKeep them from feeling the emptiness and loneliness associated with human kind. Once this revelation is achieved, we can deal with anything and anybody as you, and this transformation will give each human a sense of compassionate responsibility toward all others.All Buber's conclusions seem reasonable and plausible to me except for him joining Zionism in 1897. While I don't understand how Zionism is related to the needed compassionate revelation of humans, I'm glad that I took the time to understand how one of the main Jewish religious thinkers analyzed the world. It was time well spent."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This is a difficult book that (purposefully) subverts all the standard modes of philosophical discourse in favor of metaphorical imagery. It does this because its subject matter, the spiritual happening that gives life its meaning, cannot be contained in static, philosophical concepts. The occurrence of the I/Thou, the event of meaningful relation, defies all notions of matter and logic. Matter and logic belong to the I/It world- the necessary but spiritually void public world. As the It world grows in strength, this book serves as a beautiful reminder of who we are and what we can be. And as philosophy again loses its soul and degenerates into mere technique, this little book can remind us what philosophy's true domain is- wisdom."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Ich und Du (badly) translated as I And Thou, by Martin Buber, takes me beyond any book I've ever read before. I had to read it with another selection, because after a few pages, my soul became saturated, and I had to read something else.I am at a loss for how to describe this book. The Third Testament hints at the idea.We construct the world in one of two ways: either through a relationship, which engages our entire being in the encounter (an I-You relationship), or through experiencing objects as the means to an end, engaging only a part of ourselves in an I-It relationship.From this simple seed, Buber grows three chapters and an afterward. Walter Kaufman, who translated the work, wrote a 50 page introduction, which is in itself a wonder to experience.The experience of reading the book was amazing, although I'm not sure that I learned as much as I might have. What Buber did was to give me words to explain how I believe, what I experience, and what I long for. I must read it again. And again. And again."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This book speaks of the true nature that is at the centre of all religion. it is difficult to read at times and you can't read it all in one day and comprehend most of what it says. The translation may not do it full justice so if you can read it in German by all means do. It is an extremely profound book that can change your life if you are willing to let it. The book talks about how life is just a collection of thoughts and process, and that is &quot;I and It&quot;. Occaisionally we MAY experience these beautiful moments that are gone as fast as they came, these are &quot;I and Thou&quot;, hence the title. If I were to endorse only one book this would be it. Everyone who can read should definitely read Martin Buber's &quot;I and Thou&quot;."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Buder's &quot;I and Thou&quot; proved to be years ahead of its time when written. Remarkably, it still is. It is the classic text for theistic personalism. Anyone who is embarking upon a spiritual path would be advised to read it. In an age when impersonalism in all its trendy forms permeates the religious universe of discourse, this small book might just save the spiritual seeker many years that would otherwise be squandered in pursuit of an illusory state of &quot;liberation.&quot; The sole purpose of spiritual practice is to redirect one's yearning from frivolous material pursuits and distractions to the Divine Person --- to return home to Godhead. Walking the path is difficult; finding it beneath the accumulated rubble of impersonalist ideologies is an even more daunting task. With the help of Buber's insights, the honest God seeker will find it much easier. Having gotten a sense of direction, he has only to tune out the siren song of New-Age cant to avoid running aground on the shoals of Impersonalism. Justin Thacker"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This translation gives English-speaking readers the opportunity to follow a beautiful and psychologically-sound path to spiritual truth.Quoting from \\"I and Thou\\",\\"The primary words are not isolated words, but combined words.The one primary word is the combination I-ThouThe other primary word is the combination I-It.\\"This is a relational view of our individual impressions. We must necessarily express it in objective terms; that is all we have for written communication. But our individual impressions really precede the objects.Before proceeding to where the primary words lead, I find that reading biographies of Martin Buber, rather than trying to absorb the introductory explanations of philosophers and scholars, facilitates my understanding. I think the most suitable for me is \\"Encounter on the Narrow Ridge\\", 1991, by Maurice S. Friedman.As a Christian, I don't seek conversion to Judaism (Christianity in its origin is best understood as a sect of Judaism anyway), but the book \\"I and Thou\\" speaks to everyone. I believe that to do it full justice it must be read over and over. If we don't have time for that right now, we can at least look ahead to where it leads.Practice in experiencing the I and Thou encounter will lead to its enrichment. Our appreciation of others will become warmer and more understanding. Finally Thou will become God. Atheists may not be willing to acknowledge this last step. But if they are truly resistant, they should understand that they have an open invitation to embrace God."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"I think many people misread this book. Of course it is also possible that their interpretations are valid, but I think they miss what is for me the central and most interesting part of Buber's book.There are at least two strata of the contents of &lt;&lt;I and Thou&gt;&gt;. The deeper one is the metaphysical framework on which the upper one, like Buber's conclusions in the field of ethics, theology &amp;c. is based. Now this superficial part is the part of the contents that many readers exclusively notice. They are taken away by the poetic language and think that this book is some light and soft &quot;life philosophy&quot; or &quot;mystical literature&quot;. Many people do not realize the rigorous and exact metaphysical system behind these spectacular &quot;poetic prose&quot; items. Why Buber uses poetic language is because it is well nigh impossible to talk about his topics in a clear everyday language. Because our everyday language lacks the cathegories necessary for the elucidation of such a theory on the structure of being as that of Buber, the user of the language has to revert to writing some sort of myth or metaphors in the hope that some readers may see through. If Buber had used geometrical metaphors instead of &quot;poetic&quot; language, then his book would have become less popular but may have been taken more seriously, for example, by pro-&quot;analytic&quot; readers of philosophy. Instead, because of the difficult language (Buber's language IS difficult, because it is hard to see through the emotional and poetic tone the underlying logical structure), Buber is often discarded as 'obscure' or hailed as 'writing beautiful poetic text'. In some sense both evaluations are true but from another viewpoint neither one is important.I'm not going to outline the system of this book, I think anyone will find it if he re-reads the book more carefully. The metaphysical doctrine of Buber is unusual and offers interesting features like the possibility of rethinking (or eliminating?) such relations like 'subject vs. object' or 'matter vs. mind' and rethinking the concept of 'being', that of 'individual objects' &amp;c.When a thinker tries to subvert the traditional set of ontological concepts, he very likely begins to use 'obscure language' (like Buber did) or resorts to invent words (this was Heidegger's method). We, readers, often find such works obscure or we misread them because we already do have the 'everyday' scheme of concepts in our minds, which does not conform to the one used by the writer of the book.The already mentioned subversion of the traditional concept-scheme is revolutionary in philospohy in the sense that when traditional concept-patterns are disrupted, then many of the traditional problems are revealed as pseudo-problems or they can be solved and newer ones are found. That is why, for example, Heidegger is important, for he has once again set philosophy in motion with his radical new stance on the world. Buber, together with thinkers like Jaspers, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty etc. is one of the revolutionary philosophers of the 20th century. I don't mean that Buber is among the most important, but his work may be worth a reading because of its originality.And besides, it is still really beautiful a book and may be life-changing for many."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"There are two basic ways to interpret the story of the Fall of Man as it appears in Genesis. The first is that Man had an ideal relationship with God in the Garden of Eden, which he ruined by eating the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. The subsequent interplay between Man and God since then consists of an elaborate attempt to reestablish that original Edenic bliss. In this view, Man essentially makes himself worthy of God by returning to a passive, submissive role and yielding to God's will.The alternative understanding of the story is that when God created Man he withheld two things from him: knowledge/reason and eternal life. Having eaten from the Tree of Knowledge, Man acquired the capacity to reason and develop knowledge. In order to make sure that Man did not also acquire the infinite lifespan in which to develop this knowledge, God banished him from the Garden. In this view, Man is in the process of becoming God. The subsequent relationship between Man and God consists of God putting obstacles in Man's way, like the multiplicicity of tongues as a result of the Tower of Babel, and man overcoming them.The difference between these two views is stark and explains much of Western history. The first view is a more spiritual and inspirational view; it is grounded in the emotions and the inchoate yearnings of human beings to be comforted. It is a slave ideology, conveying the message that externalities are insignificant and what really matters is a personal relationship with God. It requires no action on the part of Man, merely submission. On the other hand, the second understanding is a call to action on the part of Man and a challenge to God. It is an aspirational view, grounded on the belief that Man is perfectable. It reflects the belief that through reason, increasing knowledge and expanding life spans, Man will one day be God's equal. In this context, Genesis is not a tragedy but a revolutionary manifesto.All of which brings us to Martin Buber's I and Thou. We had to read this in Philosophy and Religion my Freshman year at Colgate and I found it excrutiating reading. Returning to it twenty years later has not helped. Stripped of all the obtuse language, repetition and other kerfluffle, Buber's point is this: humans are capable of two types of relationships, the I-It relationship is what we have with things or people whom we treat as objects. The I-Thou relationship is the type of mutual relationship we have with some people and which he thinks we should have with God. In the I-Thou relationship we recognize others as beings rather than things. (...)Buber's concept of I and Thou, with it's emphasis on recognizing interrelations and dependencies and then immersing oneself in them, resembles Taoist or Buddhist ideas, but it also harkens back to the first reading of Man in the Garden of Eden above. The goal is to experience this kind of completely internalized relationship with God. It is, by and large, an attempt to comfort Man with the notion that it is in fact possible to enjoy such a relationship with mysterious spiritual forces which we can perceive in the world around us but which we can not understand through pure reason. It is static, passive and wholly inner directed.If I understand him properly, which I doubt, the following analogy might help: think of Alexander Pope's image of the chain of being; in Buber's philosophy it suffices to recognize your place as a link in the chain and how you interlock with the other segments and that together you all form God's creation Through this realization, and acceptance of your role, you can then approach God. Simply being and accepting being is enough. It is this understanding of existence that has resulted in Buber being termed a religious existentialist.Buber's theology though, like Existential philosophy, has been utterly rejected in Western culture and a good thing it is. Instead we, by and large, believe in the infinite perfectability of Man. We are not content to live out our existence as mere links in a chain; we believe that we can follow that chain to it's end and understand God's secrets, thereby becoming God ourselves. (...)It is easy to see how this activist, outer directed understanding of Man's role in the Universe has led to the ascendancy of Western Civilization. While other peoples, believing in a Buberesque sufficiency of their current existence, have dithered away their days in purely spiritual and contemplative pursuits, we in the West have been driven by the idea of Progress. Perhaps this is even the best term to oppose to Existentialism; our culture is, in nonpolitical terms, Progressive rather than Existential. We refuse to just be, choosing instead a process of becoming, always becoming, whether that means becoming more intelligent, longer lived, or whatever.At any rate, the book is still just godawful--impenetrable prose joined to silly ideas--and whoever decided that eighteen year olds should start out their college educations by being required to read it should be flogged.GRADE: F"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"item was received in a timely fashion. excellent condition. problem with printing. page 23 was missing. returned item only to find that the replacement had the same issue. there is a disconnect in reading. tried to go along without the missing page but had difficulty in making the connection. it may be a printer's error, but it is rathering annoying"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This book is difficult to read or to understand.

This sequel is even more mesmerizing than the earlier work.In \\"Return to Thebes,\\" Drury's depiction of the Eighteenth Dynasty, its intrigues, its murders, it romantic twists--all become bared as this ill-fated kingdom struggles with vengeful opposing priests, its own family members, even, perhaps, the gods themselves. It is Akhenhaten's zeal to make The One True God (the Aten) supreme that is his tragic (and literal) flaw. In this book, the deaths of Akhenhaten and Nefertiti set up the reign of the very young Tutankhamon. Alas, of course, even his reign is ever so brief and Drury contrives to convince us of the conspiracies that bring about his demise (or, as Drury shows, murder!).Dramatically presented, this story line captures the reader from the start asDrury brings, vividly, to life the court of the Eighteenth Dynasty, or some 3300 years ago. Granted, as this is a work of fiction, some literary license must be permitted (or else it's called non-fiction) and later Ancient Egyptian mystery novelists (especially Lynda S. Robinson--the Lord Meren series--and Lauren Haney \\"Right Hand of Amun\\"--both excellent writers, incidentally) show some disagreement with some of the historical points. But no matter, Drury, as he writes in his thoroughintroduction, explains any inconsistency that the reader--or expert--may find.For sheer drama, however, this book is hard to beat and Drury is true to form! I found his Egyptian tales more fascinating that his \\"Advice and Consent,\\" for which he was awarded the Pulitzer--and that's saying quite a bit!(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"},{"Title":"Return to Thebes, A Novel about Tutakhamon and the End of Amarna","review":"Return to Thebes is a brilliant work, and is even better than A God Against the Gods, its predecessor. Return to Thebes' plot has been carefully written by Drury to fit the archaeological theories about what really happened involving Akhenaten and his succesors. Every place and artifact, as well as most of his characters, actually existed! While it does drag at some points, this book will completely absorb you into the world of intrigue that was Egypt's court.

Now, in &quot;Return to Thebes&quot;, Mr. Drury finishes the story. We see the madness and decline of the Pharaoh, and the machinations of the priests of the traditional gods to regain their former power.Altogether, a fascinating look at a period of history which was (until this point) totally unfamiliar for me.I highly recommend these books."},{"Title":"Return to Thebes, A Novel about Tutakhamon and the End of Amarna","review":"I've come to the conclusion that I really don't like books written from multiple points of view. There are some absolutely compelling scenes hidden amongst the pretentiousness. The worst written chapters are the ones from the servants' points of view. While I appreciate that Drury was probably trying to show their awe and reverence for the various nobility and royalty, the extra words spent on groveling and self deprecation turns simple thoughts and plot progressions into multiple page passages of wasted words. The book is much smoother if the servant scenes are skipped all together."},{"Title":"Return to Thebes, A Novel about Tutakhamon and the End of Amarna","review":"Return to Thebes has the following content in it: Grief, lots of murders and deaths, funerals, and King Tut.

Normally I would wonder if there could be a book even worse than the previous A God Against Gods-but now I do not even fear the literary Hell...after I have been through Return to Thebes.The old devils of A God Against Gods return to haunt the reader. Pompous prose, distanced characters, a flimsy plot that, while being somewhat historically correct, cracks immediately under the heat and pressure of the heavy, overdone words-that is what Return to Thebes subjects the reader to.

Charles O'Rear has done it again with his fifth book on wines and wine country - but this one is his opus, his love letter to the place he has called home since National Geographic sent him here on assignment 23 years ago. Every page surprises with a blaze of color and contrast -- seas of green vineyards, blood orange skies, clusters of deep indigo blue cabernet grapes. All this juxtaposed with Avedon-style black &amp; white portraits of the people who grow the grapes which make the world class wine. These \\"farmers\\" are like no other, ranging from surgeon, judge, broker, teacher, and pilot to second generation Italian immigrant. Then there's the collection of quirky-looking corkscrews and a three-foot foldout of golden red winery doors. Along with the photographs, the essays by San Francisco Chronicle wine country columnist, Janice Fuhrman, capture the very heart and soul of this small paradise. And look who endorsed the book! None other than the King and Queen of Napa Valley - Robert and Margrit Mondavi, who wrote the foreword. Chef and owner of the French Laundry, Thomas Keller, and Editor-in-Chief of National Geographic, William Allen, have written glowing words on the dust jacket. I believe this book will become a collector's item for anyone who loves wine, wine country, and the joyful life surrounding it.Books also by this photographer: WINE COUNTRY: California's Napa and Sonoma Valleys; CABERNET: A Photographic Journey From Vine to Wine; CHARDONNAY: Photographs From Around the World."},{"Title":"Napa Valley","review":"Napa: yep, that's it.

I was extremely disappointed.The story is so shaky it's extrememly difficult to understand what's going on. Characters are thrown into the plotline with little introduction or personality.Personally I felt it was like the author wanted to establish that the main character is female, but wants to look male, and controls water. These facts were thrown at the reader repeatedly to the point of being dull and annoying. Not to mention that the supporting cast was introduced in a few pages, then treated as if they had been long since established.All in all, I will not be picking up anymore of these mangas, and I might even try to return the volume I did purchase. If you want a manga with pretty artwork and only pretty artwork, then feel free to pick this up. But if you'd like some decent story to go along with it, steer clear my friends."},{"Title":"Broken Angels Volume 1","review":"The art for this is rather nice, though a little off at some times, and the chibi-blank Fujiwara is kinda creepy.All in all, the author does a decent job of establishing a \\"world\\" - the characters enjoyably interact with each other although they are admittedly a bit of cliche character types - I'm thinking of a combo of Alec (Ceres) and Watari (Yami no Matsuei) for the doctor, and Kiri (Beauty Pop) and some others for Fujiwara.The main problem with this book is that from page one you feel as if you are thrown into an already existing world without any initiation - as if this was a spinoff from some other series (Brand-New Angels?) Not only does the manga-ka seem to assume we know as much about her world as she, but she then follows up with a shaky storyline.The bottom line is, if you want to buy this book, read at least a chapter or two first to make sure."},{"Title":"Broken Angels Volume 1","review":"It has some nicely drawn characters and decent background art.

As a matter of fact I've seen cereal boxes with more plot than this manga. It might pick up in vol. #2 but I'm not holding my breath. It's as if the creator sat down and decided to write a little gender-bender school story, but then decided they'd like it to have a supernatural twist so the main character is given the power to control water. Not bad so far, but then the creator struggles mightily to come up with storylines that could include this power at a high school. It's really sorry stuff so far. I would like to see this creator paired up with a real writer and save his/her focus on the sequential artwork, which is where this creator excels."},{"Title":"The Settlement Cook Book: The Way to a Man's Heart: Treasured Recipes of Six Decades: The Famous All-Purpose Cook Book for Beginner and Expert","review":"The book was in really great shape.

What I came up with was counting the number of times players led their leagues in some basic, universally recognized categories like wins, strikeouts, ERA, homers, runs, and RBIs.Surprisingly, Lefty Grove came in number 2 among pitchers, right behind another underappreciated player, Walter Johnson. Think about it - Grove led the league in ERA nine years, K's seven years (all in a row), and wins 4. In all, he led the league in major categories 20 times. Cy Young only did that 9 times. The other Lefty, Lefty Gomez, only comes in with 7.Once I started reading about Grove, though, he did not come across as a very attractive character. Basically, he sounded like a very talented 9-year-old. Lots of tantrums, lots of sulking, lots of blaming other players on the team. Despite all his accomplishments, he started to sound like just another flawed athlete - another Cobb or Rose or Bonds.Kaplan's book, however, let me see Grove in his entirety. Yes, he could be a jerk on the field (or, more likely, in the locker room). But it was mostly because he wanted to win so badly. In fact, I got a real feeling that the guys he played with really respected that. Between that and his amazing talents, Lefty was the kind of ballplayer other ballplayers seemed to be happy just to be on the field with. He really struck me as a ballplayer's ballplayer.Off the field, he sounded like a regular guy. I got the feeling he was just a country boy who was a bit of a loner. Back in his home town or around people he knew and trusted, he was a very different person.One thing, for sure - he was a very down-to-earth guy. I think that's something to really admire about him. I really didn't find him \\"boring,\\" as another reviewer did, at all. No, he's no Babe Ruth, but who is?There are a lot of parallels between him and another Red Sox icon, Ted Williams. It really is a shame he doesn't get anywhere near the press Teddy Ballgame gets. Hopefully, Kaplan's work will get Grove more of the attention he deserves. It's an excellent look at a very complex character and absolutely incredible pitcher. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lefty Grove: American Original","review":"Jim Kaplan sets out in this well-researched book to resurrect the figure of Lefty Grove, a 300-game winner whose career spanned those of Walter Johnson and Ted Williams. For the most part, he convincingly makes his case that Groves deserves to be included among a handful of baseball's elite pitchers and that he was perhaps the best lefthander hurler ever.Whatever shortcomings the book may have, the reader is bound to be impressed by Kaplan's knowledge of Grove's career (he takes us through each of his 17 big league seasons and four that he spent at the minor league level) and his painstaking efforts to convey a sense of the time in which Grove played. When he describes one of Grove's many confrontations with Babe Ruth, the writing has the ring of truth. Particularly effective is his recounting of the famous 1929 World Series game in which Grove's Philadelphia A's scored 10 runs in one inning to wipe out an eight-run Chicago Cub lead en route to winning the world championship.Kaplan brings to life several key figures of Grove's time, most notably Connie Mack, Grove's manager with the A's and a man who not only strongly influenced the lives of his players but also the organizational direction of baseball. Long before the 1997 Marlins were broken up to save money, Mack was doing the same thing, jettisoning big names and large salaries to build teams anew. He also offers a valuable analysis of Mack's and Grove's 1929-1931 Philadelphia A's, convincingly arguing that these teams (that also included Hall of Famers Al Simmons, Mickey Cochrane, to name a few) were the equal of the more celebrated 1926-1928 Yankees, whose 1927 edition is generally considered the greatest in baseball history.Also of note is the final section, which analyzes the careers of Johnson, Grove and Sandy Koufax and offers the reader statistical food for thought in considering who was the greatest lefthander ever.Kaplan's writing is solid but unspectacular and he lapses at times into a cheerleading tone, particularly when he discusses Grove's great achievements (which included nine ERA titles, a 31-4 season, a career .680 winning percentage and a 1935-1939 resurrection of his craft, during which he transformed himself from a fireballer into a finesse pitcher.)Kaplan's otherwise fine description of the last day of the 1941 season, in which Williams secured his .406 average by going six-for-eight after refusing to sit on the bench for a doubleheader, is marred by the writer's tone of breathless admiration for the player's feat. Nothing wrong with being a fan when you write a baseball book, but I prefer that the author for the most part let the facts speak for themselves.All in all, Kaplan produces a portrait of a driven, often disagreeable man who hated losing and was impatient with the shortcomings of mere athletic mortals. The picture of Lefty is convincing, but Kaplan uses the same strokes pretty heavily to produce it.The baseball fan/historian will find this a very useful look at this undeservedly obscure figure and will find it particularly interesting to revisit an era of the sport that differs so radically from the present one."},{"Title":"Lefty Grove: American Original","review":"I was particularly happy to receive this book on Lefty Grove because, as with a number of pre-World War II stars, a meaningful biography has been lacking about them. Jim Kaplan's version of Grove's life isn't perfect, but it's close enough, filled with stories about Grove, his teammates and the times. It's an interesting, well-written, thoughtful biography about an outstanding pitcher and one of the best ballplayers ever, and fills a gap in baseball literature that needed to be addressed."},{"Title":"Lefty Grove: American Original","review":"just reading through the reviews and note a complaint that the character in question - Lefty Grove - seems a little dull. Did you read the book?It has been a habit of mine to credit my sports heroes with character traits and achievements that are almost god like. I am of the age when Babe Ruth was still considered the premier baseball player. Yet as I have gotten older and wiser - I hope - it has become apparent to me that my heroes are just human. I think the author (and the SABR) does a great job paying tribute to an outstanding athlete...and they haven't left out any of the stuff that makes folks uncomfortable with Lefty - the temper tantrums, and verbal abuse to his fellow players and managers being the most compelling issues. The book makes it clear that for some of his contemporaries, it was an effort to play with and tolerate Lefty. But if you were trying to field a winning team and needed an intimidating pitcher who \\"brought the heat,\\" Lefty was your man. For those of you who are statistically bound - review the record - his work and results speak for him. Finally I appreciate not being spared the details of his eventual decline and passing. Lefty is allowed to be human.I enjoyed this book and if you are a fan of the Boston Red Sox, the Philadelphia Athletics and of Lefty Grove, you may enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"Lefty Grove: American Original","review":"If you think Sandy Koufax was the greatest left-handed pitcher or if perhaps you've placed Randy Johnson on that pedestal, you've probably done it without reading about the greatest pitcher ever born in Maryland, maybe the greatest pitcher ever born. Lefty Grove is overshadowed all to often by Hall of Fame teammates and the other stars of his era, but his dominance over several seasons will likely never be replicated.Jim Kaplan does a creditable, very readable job of telling Lefty's story. I read it in Paris on vacation and it brought me back to America every time I cracked it open."},{"Title":"Lefty Grove: American Original","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It fills in the gaps that most baseball fans have regarding Lefty Grove, whom most confuse with Lefty Gomez. That's a shame becasue Lefty Grove is arguably one of -if not the - best pitchers in baseball history. Some has stated that his personality was rather dull and that explains why he is often overlooked. After reading this book, I'd characterize his personality as more eccentric than dull....And what a great pitcher! Read this book - you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Lefty Grove: American Original","review":"The text is not bad but something is really missing. I think the plain fact is despite Lefty Grove's greatness, he was a dull uninteresting guy himself. He's not even loathsome and looney like Ty Cobb to make for a &quot;the glory meets the train wreck of a life&quot; read. As far as pitchers of his era, check out &quot;Walter Johnson: The Big Train&quot; by Henry Thomas which is a far better book. Although &quot;Lefty Grove: American Original&quot; is an extremely well researched book giving it a good feel for the times, a better bet is probably to check out the books on manager Connie Mack and his A's of the '20s."},{"Title":"Lefty Grove: American Original","review":"LEFTY GROVE AMERICAN ORIGINAL IS WORTH READING.

He tutored under arguably college football's greatest taskmaster, Knute Rockne, and played at legendary Notre Dame. Cut down in the prime of his coaching career, he was 45 when illness forced him to retire, we will never know just how great Leahy could have been. His winning percentage trails only his mentor and rates at the head of the class. Ironically, Leahy, like his mentor Rockne, had their careers abbreviated by cruel fate. While most readily recognize Rockne as the game's best, Leahy tends to get overlooked. This book is a personal narrative told by Leahy shortly before his death at 65. He was a principled man, who molded young men into leaders. A must read for those interested in learning more about our country's true leaders. He spent two years away from coaching serving his country in WW II.

This course book has both clear and user-friendly grammar reference and a lot of interesting skill-building practices. It helps learners to practice grammar in controlled exercises and communicative tasks. The tasks are similar to what learners may encounters in real life, and some of them require oral negotiation during the problem-solving process. Thus, this material help learners to use English in carrying out tasks in real life. Unlike traditional structural-based and drill-focused grammar books, this material allows learners to practice and use grammar in a social context, so it is very suitable for EFL or ESL classrooms, but not for individual learning. The outstanding features of this grammar series are as follows: 1. The methodological emphasis on retrospective approach to grammar. For example, learners encounter the focused grammar structure (usually highlighted) in a reading passage or a dialogue in the first section. Then, they will read the explanation of that grammar usage in the second section. Examples are always included in the explanation, so it is easy to understand and remeber the grammar usage. 2. Instruction-friendly design: model dialogues or passage, explicit explanation of grammar, and ready-for-use tasks are provided 3.A good grammar companion to any other course book: units are arranged according to grammar categories, so learners can practice what they need. 4.Well-designed and interesting skill-building exercises. Some are task-based exercises and allow learners to practice grammar in real communication. 5. Focus on content. Wide-range of interesting subject matters in the presentation and practices. Usually, all ofthe exercises/tasks within one unit deal with the same grammar structure (e.g. passive voices)through the same content topic (e.g.naming) Sometimes, the topics of several units are related when these units deal with related grammar structures."},{"Title":"Focus on Grammar: A Basic Course for Reference and Practice (Complete Student Book)","review":"Well, what more can I say.

While FOG does give an in depth view into the grammar aspects of English, it does not do so in a concise manner, and I am surprised that no one has written this before. The presentation of the grammar aspects is done so in a confusing setting that, while it does present the material at least, does not do so in a manner beneficial to someone learning the language. There are tremendous amounts of errors in the book itself as well; this includes not only the editing itself but also the answer keys. I find I am often forced to skip exercises because they present contradictory material to the presentation given in the beginning of a chapter. Students who have studied English grammar intensively previous to using this book will find that they have a lot of questions that are difficult at best to answer. If you are stuck using only this series of books, good luck to you; you will be pulling your hair out time and time again if you, as well as your students, are paying attention to what is actually in the book and not just writing what &quot;feels&quot; right as a native speaker. There is a lot of confusing and almost false material presented. It seems as though the language was manipulated for publishing purposes, as opposed to using realistic language for organizing a lesson. And as far as communicative grammar goes, I find this is by far a &quot;workbook&quot; type of grammar book; though there are opportunities presented for communicative work, it is often not done so in a realistic setting."},{"Title":"The Hermann Goering Division (Men-at-Arms Series)","review":"The Osprey series of Men-at-Arms is not a uniform and heraldry book, nor is it a complete history of the unit. Being only 48 pages the book cannot even hope to include every piece of information out there about the HG Division. What it does, however, is give you a general overview, along with some outstanding black and white photos, as well as color plates to show the unique uniforms of this division (no other division that fought in the Wehrmacht had as many unique and varied uniforms as the HG division did during WW2).As to whether or not the division was elite, you have to look at the beginning. The unit was formed by Hermann G&ouml;ring in 1933 as a police unit, specifically known then as Polizeiabteilung z.b.V. Wecke. The unit was just that, a police unit, but was destined to be remolded again and again, by G&ouml;ring, into a unit that could fight in the coming war.In 1935, the unit was then known as Regiment General G&ouml;ring, and had changed from a police unit, to a unit under the control of the Luftwaffe. At this same time that the transfer under Luftwaffe command took place, RGG was was asked for volunteers to form the very first Fallschirmjager units in Germany. From the RGG (the HG Division discussed in this Osprey book) came the men who would go on to storm Eban Emael, land on Crete, and distinguish themselves on the Western and Eastern fronts as some of the most elite soldiers in WW2. Oh yeah...and the Fallschirmjager even had time to rescue Mussolini. Elite? I think so, and the men of the HG Division were among those Fallschirmjager elite. The men of the HG Division were the very first to train at Stendal airfield as Fallschirmjager, during the months of May-June 1936. Later on, it was decided to not make the RGG a Fallschirmjager unit, and those men were transferred out of RGG to form the 1st Jager Battalion.In 1939 the unit was basically formed as a FLAK unit, but in 1940 it went to war with France, and Norway. In France, the FLAK units of the RGG engaged the heavy French armor with devastating effectiveness. The FLAK units of the RGG advanced with army units, and took part in piercing the Dyle position, capturing L&ouml;wen, and occupying Brussels. The men of the RGG were always at the forefront of the French campaign, as at that time no weapon in the German army was as effective against heavy French armor as the 8.8cm FLAK guns that the RGG possessed (I should say they were not the only ones to possess the dreaded 88's, and I do not wish to imply this). In action at the Mormal forest, the 3rd and 5th batteries of the RGG destroyed heavy French armor that nearly broke through advancing German lines. The French armor advanced, with cannons blazing, and machine guns spitting death, yet the brave men of the RGG manned their 8.8cm FLAK guns and took out the tanks. If not for the men of the RGG, a French breakthrough, and the loss of countless German army soldiers would have occurred. Elite? Well, consider this...the men of guns Casar, and Dona, who fought in the Mormal forest, continued firing even though French tanks advanced up to within 15 meters of their position. You judge for yourself if you could do the same...or if that is the bravery, courage, and tenacity of an elite soldier.The RGG further distinguished their unit by fighting in the Somme and the Aisne, crossed the Marne, and joined in the pursuit to the Loire.The Kluge Detachment, also fought in Operation Weser&uuml;bung, the march through Denmark and the occupation of Norway in 1940. The unit even advanced across the Arctic Circle, fighting against the Allies, 70 kilometers north of Mo i Rana. The Kluge Detachment fought many battles here, as well as in the action to take Narvik. Only when his men were outnumbered by more than 3 to 1, did Kluge withdraw to a ore railway just east of Narvik. One week later, the Allies ordered the evacuation from Narvik.The unit also fought in Russia twice, Sicily, Italy, and North Africa.Eastern Front '41: The unit fought under the command of the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, in the Sokol area. It also fought battles in the Radziechow, Dubno, Kiev, Briansk, Cherkassy, Kremenchug, and Dniepropetrovsk areas until November 1941. The units 88mm guns were used to engage the bunkers at Sokal Heights, as well.Here, HG Division officer Oberleutnant Karl Ro&szlig;mann, and his men of the 16th company, IV Battalion RGG fought with distinction, and Ro&szlig;mann earned the Knight's Cross. Together with a handful of men from the Heer, and the Waffen SS division &quot;Wiking&quot;, they helped to crush wave after wave of Soviet infantry trying to escape the Uman Pocket. They captured over 100,000 Soviet soldiers, including the commanding officers of the 6th Army, Lieutant General Musytshenko, and the 12th Army Major-General Kyrilov. 317 tanks, 858 guns, and 242 anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns were destroyed or captured. Without the FLAK guns of the HG Division for support, the men in this area would have been overwhelmed.Well, at this point I am at 960 words, and out of space for the 1,000 word limit for this review. I haven't even scratched the surface of the actions of this elite unit.This Osprey book is a good start, but if you want to know what this unit did, read The History of the FallshcirmPanzerKorps HG, by Franz Kurowski (HG division veteran). Maybe the other reviewer never thought to read it, or HG: from Regiment to FallschirmPanzerKorps by Bender and Petersen, as I have. If you do, you'll get the whole story, and you won't be confused like the previous reviewer when discussing the elite status of the HG Division.All of these books about the elite HG Division are 5 star!"},{"Title":"The Hermann Goering Division (Men-at-Arms Series)","review":"Very good brief history of the Herman Goering division with the usual excellent art work of the different uniforms used by the division. A must read for those interested in the history of the division and it's zones of deployment. Excellent for the modeller keen on recreating authentic uniforms for figure painting."},{"Title":"The Hermann Goering Division (Men-at-Arms Series)","review":"Lest my review seem capricious, the reader should be advised that Osprey's Men-at-Arms series claims on its own covers that its purpose is to describe, \\"the uniforms, equipment, history, and organization of the world's military forces, past and present.\\" Unfortunately, the Men-at-Arms series seems to be deviating more and more from that mission statement in recent years and veering toward the exclusive interests of those interested only in uniforms and heraldry. Gordon Williamson's latest volume, The Hermann G&ouml;ring Division, is far too focused on uniform issues at the expense of providing information on equipment, history or organization of that unit. Indeed, the author spends 20 pages on uniform-related issues and only 17 pages on the unit's history and organization. While the color plates are wonderful - as usual - the text and photographs are far too bland for such an interesting topic.Williamson skims over the history of the Hermann G&ouml;ring Division so rapidly that he misses vital facts. He spends only a single paragraph discussing the unit's participation in the Russian Campaign of 1941, but fails to notice that the unit (then a regiment-size battle group) was part of Guderian's panzer group in the final lunge toward Moscow. As for the unit's organization, Williamson provides outlines of the Hermann G&ouml;ring formation in its regiment, brigade, division and corps-size incarnations, but none of these provide information about authorized or actual strengths. Other than the division commanders, only a handful of other HG formation leaders are mentioned. The discussion of the unit's equipment is practically non-existent; Williamson never discusses artillery, engineers, signals and supply troops. Did the panzer grenadier battalions have trucks or SPWs? While the size of the Men-at-Arms series is certainly a constraint, this author has made no effort to provide anything like unique information about the Hermann G&ouml;ring division's strength or composition.It is also odd that this author accepts as Gospel truth that the Hermann G&ouml;ring Division was an \\"elite\\" unit. Yet was this unit really elite or merely the beneficiary of excellent propaganda? Readers should have been cautioned by the author - and were not - that the HG division was established to make the Luftwaffe and its boss look good. Nor does the fact that the troops in the HG division received so many more personal awards and decorations than soldiers in other German panzer divisions necessarily mean that the HG division was better or \\"elite.\\" In order for a combat unit to be considered elite, it generally needs to have superior training, highly selective personnel recruiting and/or superior equipment. There is little or no evidence that the Hermann G&ouml;ring Division had any of these benefits. The division began forming in October 1942, based on the original regimental battle group and the remnants of the 5th Fallschirmj&auml;ger regiment. The regular army provided tankers to form the HG division's panzer regiment. Much of the division was promptly committed to Tunisia in November 1942 and lost in that campaign. Where was the time for specialized or elite training? Two months after the end in Tunisia and barely into refitting, the re-born HG division had to face the Allied invasion of Sicily, followed by a year of continuous tough fighting in Italy. Not much time for special training while at Salerno, Anzio or Cassino. When the HG division was sent to the Russian front again in July 1944, Williamson notes that the unit still had some Pz III tanks (so much for better equipment!). Indeed, for much of the war the HG division had to make do with the older Pz IV tank as its mainstay and only received the better Panther tank in 1945 as the war was ending. After some initial success against the Russians near Warsaw, the German High Command then made the incredibly stupid decision to upgrade the Hermann G&ouml;ring Division to corps status. Even before this point, the HG had been forced to induct conscripts into its ranks and this expansion further diluted whatever quality the unit had possessed. Most of the HG Corps, which was never anywhere near full strength, were isolated or destroyed in the heavy fighting around East Prussia in early 1945. Clearly, two factors that worked heavily against the HG unit(s) gaining elite status were constant, non-stop fighting and continuous expansion.The original HG regimental battle group, which saw service in Scandinavia, France and Russia did enjoy more selectivity in personnel recruiting and had more time for ground combat training. Yet it must be remembered that after 1942, the Luftwaffe was constantly cannibalizing its rear echelons to form ground combat units and few of these men received extensive ground combat training. The eighteen Luftwaffe Field Divisions, formed from excess personnel, were all conspicuous failures in combat - so why should HG have been any different? It is clear that the Hermann G&ouml;ring Division never held superior training, personnel or equipment to significantly distinguish it from any normal German panzer division. However what the HG division did posses was a high-level sponsor who could extol and exaggerate everything his namesake unit did in order to burnish his own diminishing reputation. There is no doubt that the HG division enjoyed some tactical success in Tunisia (but less than the not-elite 10th, 15th or 21st Panzer Divisions), Sicily, Italy and Poland, but the extent of these successes in comparison to other Wehrmacht units may have been exaggerated. Putting the Hermann G&ouml;ring Division in the same league as the Grossdeutschland or SS Leibstandarte divisions is a mistake, since those units did enjoy superior equipment, personnel recruitment and had more time to train before combat. Historically, the Hermann G&ouml;ring Division should probably be viewed as a \\"wanna-be\\" unit that was heavily promoted by its benefactor."},{"Title":"The Hermann Goering Division (Men-at-Arms Series)","review":"Book exactly what I was looking for.

Although I have reservations about the text (which I've enumerated in my review here at amazon.com), I think it is the best available text and the accompanying CDs really make the set invaluable. I've never been comfortable with the workbook, however, and in fact have never used it for class. It is not entirely without value--for example, the passage on string bowings is very helpful (Worksheet 2), and for a teacher this provides material ready at hand for exercises in transposition, clefs, harmonics, and the like, which are generally satisfactory. Much of the workbook, however, takes an historical approach to the teaching of orchestration which I am uncomfortable with for most students. Adler uses &quot;Listen and Score&quot; exercises repeatedly, in which the student is instructed to listen to a passage (included on the CD set that accompanies the text) given in piano or short score and instructed to orchestrate it exactly as they heard it. While these can be helpful in the early stages, I can't understand why one would want to encourage a student to write for 2 horns in C and 2 horns in Eb as Berlioz did. Modern instruments have transcended many of the difficulties that earlier composers faced, and to learn to score for those instruments in the style of a particular composer may be of some historical interest, but little practical worth. There is the decided advantage for the teacher of answers being either right (the way composer X did it) or wrong (anything else)--but the nature of orchestration belies that duality. Often in orchestration many choices are equally right; but if a passage must be notated choices must be made. To make a particular choice does not invalidate the viability of an alternate choice.Other exercises are downright quirky. Worksheet 14 calls for the student to transcribe a Bach organ prelude for four percussionists, all playing non-pitched percussion. While this might be a lot of fun, I doubt it is the best way to learn the use of non-pitched percussion for orchestrational purposes.Missing almost entirely is any material on the wind band. Where winds are considered, they are considered only as the wind section of an orchestra. True, the set is not titled The Study of Orchestration and Band Arranging, but since most students (in the US, at least) will be much more likely to face bands rather than full orchestras in their professional life, such a section would be of great worth."},{"Title":"Workbook for the Study of Orchestration","review":"This workbook is a must-have for the serious student of orchestration and all musicians who would like to get familiar with the process of &quot;sounds&quot; in the orchestra(symphony/small ensembles).A great way for developing,through listening and writing practice, the &quot;mind's ear and eye&quot; relationship when scoring and getting music down in score paper.The workbook/text book/CD edtion combination is the next best thing if you can't get to a real live classroom instruction set up!And even if you can,it will surely enhance the studying process and would surely last a lifetime.Unbeatable.Essential.Get it!"},{"Title":"Workbook for the Study of Orchestration","review":"I used this book for my instrumentation class at the university I attend.

Often these exercises include things that were not present in the book or concepts are presented in a manner different from the text. There are a huge number of mistakes in the workbook, especially in regard to track numbers on the cds (sold separately). Avoid this at all costs. It has nothing to offer. Any competent teacher should be able to come up with their own exercises that would have much more practical value. Unfortunately, I am in an arranging and scoring class where the teacher seems to think this book is the best thing since sliced bread.

The protagonist has the low-down laudry line blues and as she looks at an empty clothes line across the street she recognizes her own feelings as being similarly empty. Meanwhile her pesky, persistent, little sister is feeling fulled up with energy. Little sister lets her energy overflow as she shows her big sister that the empty clothes line can be used to lift the spirits. The story verse has almost a blues music sound to it that children will love repeating. As a librarian of juvenile literature I recommend the use of this book when discussing moods with pre-school and primary children"},{"Title":"The Low-Down Laundry Line Blues","review":"This is an excellent book. The author of this book is themother of a friend of mine. She is a great author and you will lovethis book. She wrote this book in 3 different kinds of musical ways: Blues, Swing, and Jazz.

This book is so poorly written, I am wondering just how it got published in the first place.It seerms that neither the author nor the publisher speaks English. and that the book was written in a bar on a long weekend.

Example: You flip to another page for an illustration of a previous topic, only to find the wrong picture (again) associated with the topic. Code will often refer to an object that you are not told to create until later. Then, you are not told to set certain properties on the object (you just have to &quot;know&quot; which properties to set). I usually prefer the &quot;Teach Yourself&quot; series. I was sufficiently satisfied with the first one in this series, but quality control is lagging. I have to admit that many examples in this book will be frustating and confusing to a beginner of Visual Basic.

The TY in 24 hours is a good fast overview, then go straight to Master Visual Basic 6 by Evangelos Petroutsos. Now that is a GREAT book that teaches the new VB6 programmer how to do it.

There are just too many editial erros in it. For example, Figure 1.22 refers to Hierarchical FlexGrid Control but it actually shows Tooltiptext; Figure 1.23 mentions Data Environment Designer but the illustration is about the form of file copying. If you copy and paste the code listing of 1.1, it wouldn't run because it introduced &quot;i&quot; that did not declared. I wonder if the author and the editor even ever read the final proof once, because there are so many obvious errors if you are an experienced VB user.

Some of the examples are painfully incomplete. It is one thing to suggest that the reader should now have the knowledge to provide their own code following the guidelines of the example application, but when the example doesn't provide a complete framework it is more difficult, especially when the author suggests that he just did.The chapters are poorly organized, really just collections of points. For example, Day 1 is alleged to be about writing professional applications, begins with a 4 page discussion of some issues related to that, and then turns into a review of some new features in VB6, with no apparent logic as to which ones.The bulk of this text appears to be a rehash of an older VB5 book, because in places the nomenclature is clearly outdated. In others, the current version is referred to as VB5.The book also overlaps with elements of the first, TYVB6in21D. It certainly does not simply extend the first, as I assumed when I bought the bundle.

I have used a lot of Sams Teach yourself books and they were all very well written. I also have to agree with some of the other people that wrote the reviews regarding the topics covered in this book. It covers points and new features but doesn't do it in any orderly form.

It is a problem we will have to deal with, but unfortunately the chain of command was indoctrinated during the Clinton Political Correctness of the 90's.

The net result is a big negative. I am a veteran of combat arms and my modest experiences confirm every wit of his arguments. There are so many levels of impact to consider and I think he covers most of the bases. This is not a female issue, or at least it shouldn't be. This is a matter of national security.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Weak Link: The Feminization of the American Military","review":"The &quot;Rumblings From the Far Right&quot; review at the top of this page represents the kind of knee-jerk dismissal that liberals inevitably whip out when faced with the facts in this book.

Since the military's inception of the all-volunteer force, the service has had to market itself as a company with jobs to be had. Thus it now resembles a corporation of employees rather than a fighting force. The information proved true then and continues to prove the same. It's prophetic. One example: the logistical problems due to the differences in men and women. Recently the military announced it will spend a lot of money for cockpits for aircraft suited for females - in essence - his and hers aircraft. &quot;Weak Link&quot; is not a historical account of women in the service nor does it berate women in the service. What it brings to the public's attention is the push to fully integrate women in all the combat services."},{"Title":"Weak Link: The Feminization of the American Military","review":"As a Navy Officer I have seen first hand the effect of women on ships.

In fact, Mitchell's only stated purpose is \\"to tell how sexual integration of the military has not worked the way our military leaders say it has.\\" Since Mitchell provides few footnotes or references to support his statements, this book might, at best, be called \\"one man's opinion.\\" More accurately, this book might be called a collection of patronizing, unsupported, parochial, misogynistic hot air.Take the title, for starters. The \\"feminization\\" of the American military? This is hardly a supportable characterization of the military overall. Apply the same logic to the increase in the number of racial minorities in the service: would anyone agree to publish a book subtitled, \\"The Blackening of the American Military?\\" Do people refer to the \\"masculinization\\" of the nursing or teaching professions because men have entered these fields?Mitchell writes with blinders on. He's completely unaware of the historical experience of other countries. Before we make judgments about what we think women *should* do in the military, based on a few years' of peacetime experience, we should know *what has actually happened* in wartime. A study of the Russian experience in the Second World War and of women who fought during the Vietnam War is a good starting point.As a professional historian and a former military officer, I am appalled that anyone would take this book seriously."},{"Title":"Weak Link: The Feminization of the American Military","review":"This is a very good book if you're looking for the counter-arguments currently keeping women out of combat. Unfortunately, some of Mr. Mitchell's statements - such as where he argues female cadets should not attend the service academies because they don't like history classes as much as male cadets - ring hollow. As a female Air Force reservist, I found the large majority of this book to be unabashedly far-right-wing, illogical, or just plain wrong. However, I still keep it around to refer to whenever I wonder why almost ten percent of all military jobs are closed to me based solely on what hangs between my legs."},{"Title":"Great Hymns of the Faith","review":"I was disappointed when I recieved this order only to find pages 39-86 missing from the hymnal.

The new denomination's hymnal had some of the favorites I missed years before but none of the songs I had grown to love.

The first and only church i have seen this hymnal is is \\"Center Point Independent\\" in Center Point, AL, near Birmingham. This hard cover red book was the standard hymnal wed'e use every morning, and Pastor Baker would always start us with \\"Good Old 69\\", \\"Safely Through Another Week.\\" We would praise God for keeping us for another week, i was also introduced to this hymn this way and have not heard it any place else.As i've only seen it at one church, i cannot tell you what other churches or denominations \\"Great Hymns of the Faith\\" is used at (some other reviews to give us a heads up would be interesting), but it appears to be a non-denominational hymnal produced by Zondervan Singspriation with a more or less Baptist persuasion. There are topical as well as song title and composer indexes in the back, as well as topical Bible chapters and responsive readings. Also included are patriotic songs such as \\"America the Beautiful\\" and \\"The Star Spangled Banner.\\" This hymnal would work great for a church of any denomination that truly seeks to praise God with His word uncompromised. It is filled with lots and lots of \\"familiar favorites\\" as well as new ones. I discovered lots of new ones just this afternoon i neither knew the words nor tunes to, and i thought i knew alot of Baptist hymns! These hymns tell it like it is, and are a great way to understand the gospel even if you never pick up a Bible.Get this hymnal for family singing around the piano (does anyone do that anymore?) or for the new church your starting (if you want the word of God, that is.)

The author mentions today's tight job market, and recommends that job seekers keep a broad view by not ruling out jobs in government or industry. The book is, however, a primer on obtaining a position in academe, and the preparation needed to succeed once you are there. Tomorrow's Professor is thoroughly researched, and covers just about every imaginable base in preparing someone for an academic career. It is well written and easily read. The first part of the book details the peculiar culture of a university, including its teaching, research, and service missions; its governing structure; and tenure. It confirms much of the anecdotal evidence about universities that I thought were particular to the schools that I was familiar with. In Part Two the author outlines the foundation necessary for gaining an academic position. Any student seriously considering a future career in academe must begin early on developing the research and teaching portfolio necessary to gain a coveted position. In research, it is important to begin publishing research papers, presenting results and making contacts at conference, and helping to obtain external support. For teaching, one must go beyond working as a teaching assistant, and start teaching one's own classes. For the current job seeker, the heart of the book is Part Three, where Reis outlines job identification and application strategies. The time and energy required to find out about a particular position and tailor one's application to fit the requirements is well worth the effort, he writes. This section also covers most of the steps necessary in preparing an excellent application, and it is often the inclusion of these details that can make or break an application. In today's tough job market, where hundreds of people often apply for a single position, following the steps outlined in this book could give applicants the edge they need to be noticed.

All information in the book should be well-known to any graduate student or post-doc who is even slightly serious about a career in academic science and engineering.For example, every graduate student and post-doc should know full well that teaching experience and grant-writing skills are indispensable when applying for an academic position.

I wish I had enough money to give this book as a gift to every PhD student, starting professor, advisor, and university administrator. I am currently promoting this book to my friends at the university. For all of this, congratulations, and thanks a million for taking the time to collect the information and experiences, and to write this wonderful book. Let me now introduce myself: My name is Khaled EL-Maleh, a PhD graduate student (last quarter of my PhD) at McGill University, in Montreal, Canada. I am in the EE Department. I hold two B.S. degrees (EE and Applied Math) and a M.Eng. (Biomedical Engineering) from McGill. My PhD is in the area of signal processing for telecommunications. I really love education (learning and teaching)! I have been a tutor for both electrical engineering and mathematics courses for many years. I have recently joined the ASEE as a student member and I strongly recommend this society and your book for every grad. student. One of the interesting parts of your book is the examples you bring from real-life experiences. Also, it is nice that you are giving in each chapter some references for further reading in each topic. It is my dream and goal to join a university that values education and makes research parts of education and vice versa. I am now enjoying reading your book and I feel that I need always to read it again and again as it is a time-independent book. Well done job Professor Reis. I hope to meet you in the near future.

The title was a bit misleading. By the title, I expected the story to take place on the Big Island of Hawaii. The author gives a very picturesque account of the islands, using graphic descriptions of sites and native language to prove her point. She made an error in the word plumeria, referring to it as plusneria. She also made an error in describing plumeria as antheriums. The other error or misunderstanding in the story came when she was describing the relation of the brother and sister, who were half siblings. I couldn't quite understand who the mother and father were to each and how they related to the aunt. The story was good. I did not like how combative the male lead character was. As a woman, I would not have put up with his demanding and somewhat abusive behavior. That was a little unrealistic to me. Overall, I enjoyed this read.

Stressing that there are extreme situations where the only thing to do is to avoid the individual or report them - cases where the bully is emotionally unstable, dangerously violent, or planning or committing a crime - Bullies To Buddies focuses on the more commonplace forms of bullying such as verbal abuse or simple pushing and shoving. Chapters explain how bullying usually stems from the need for power - the bully's need to exert power over others by getting them angry or frustrated or even baiting them into fights. Step-by-step instructions for defusing bullies by learning to control one's emotions, treat them as people instead of as enemies, and not rise to the bait show one how to turn bullies into friends without sacrificing one's principles or becoming a bully oneself. Bullies To Buddies is very highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Bullies to Buddies: How to Turn Your Enemies Into Friends","review":"I read Bullies to Buddies after reading other typical anti-bully books and I found the differences disturbing at first. I liked its psychological rationale, but was dubious of some of its claims and wary to try them since my elder son was only six and the book's advice seemed to apply to slightly older kids. Nevertheless, faced with the repeated bullying attitude of one neighborhood kid of the same age (who was bullied at school...) and my absolute incapacity, during the last several years, to modify it in a positive way, I advised my son, at a moment when the bullying started right in front of my eyes (my son was cornered by the bully and started reacting with a mixture of fear and defiance) to simply let him talk. My son was too young to display any wit or say the sort of things that the book recommends and I feared, as the book warns, that results would not come quickly, but they were almost instantaneous! I could barely believe it. The bully had gone from threatening to sharing a secret.It gave me pause and now when I try to apply the same principles at work, I realize that the main remaining obstacle is me. I think the point of view on human beings that Izzy Kalman advocates is simply the right one."},{"Title":"Bullies to Buddies: How to Turn Your Enemies Into Friends","review":"I have attended Izzy's seminar, read his book on bullying, and had lunch with him.

Izzy Kalman has showed that you don't really need to do anything. He writes in a way that a kid could relate to. There is at least one picture (usually funny things) on every page, so it helps tie in with the subject.Izzy Kalman states that to turn bullies to buddies all you need to really do is treat them like your friends. Instead of getting mad at them, ignore them completely or try to use humor, especially on yourself.But he doesn't just talk about bullies from school; he shows that everyone is bullying everyone all the time. People usually think it's funny to see other people getting hurt or mad, so that's a good reason why people bully you, to get you mad. Also, people want power, and bullies are having power over you.I would suggest this book to any kid that's in elementary or junior high school. This is a really good way to end the tormenting. But some of Izzy Kalman's suggestions might not work in high school, although the basis of the way to handle the problem might. This book has inspired me to give a speech to an 8th grade etiquette class. I am a junior so I'll be able to give them some good advice and from someone other than a parent or teacher.So if you're a kid that always getting called names, fighting with your little brother, or getting in arguments with anyone, then read this book.

When I went to one of his recent seminars I was astounded to hear & see him teaching the same methods I have come to on my own as a way of personally dealing with the bullying problem, both as a child and an adult. I then purchased his bk. and began assisting others I work with as a mental health professional to do the same. The current solution being pushed nation-wide of 'telling on the bully,' which used to be known as \\"tattling,\\" we all know in our hearts will never be the ultimate solution, though I agree at times it might be an unfortunate necessity. I recommend that anyone currently working with children and faced with this age-old problem get and read Dr. Kalman's bk. Then catch one of his seminars and see his method role-played, have him answer any of your questions, and then give it a try with the kids (and/or adults) in your own work."},{"Title":"Bullies to Buddies: How to Turn Your Enemies Into Friends","review":"This book is a way for you to understand why your child is being bullied, and great to use with them to practice what they would say or do in a bullying scenario.

It's likely you would be as appalled as I was and they would lose a sale.Instead of teaching a child integrity, honesty, communication skills and how to stand up for themselves; they learn how to roll over and play dead. You are suppose to take the bullies invalidating comments to heart as if they were trying to help you. You are encouraged to admire the courage of the bully! The author even goes so far as to tell the child NOT TO tell any adult. Moreover, there is no mention of judgement. A child should learn judgement and decide when something needs to be reported.Throughout history part of a child's education was to stand up for themselves and what is right. That's called integrity. If a child follows the author's advice he will lose his self-respect. When he loses that, it's down hill from there.Teach your child integrity and how to communicate.

It emerged that these horrific incidents were committed almost exclusively by victims of teasing and bullying....schools nationwide have been adopting anti-bullying programs and regulations.\\" ~Izzy KalmanIzzy Kalman is a school psychologist who has developed methods children can use to ward off aggression. He teaches children how to solve problems and explains the dynamics of bullying. Should you turn the other cheek or learn about the secrets of human nature and use them to your advantage?This book will teach children how to deal with issues like name-calling, physical attacks, vicious rumors, being excluded from cliques, insults and Internet bullying. You will learn the smart way to say \\"NO\\" and learn how to use humor to your best advantage.Izzy Kalman presents interesting facts about problems animals develop in captivity and how they are similar to human behavior patterns in regards to aggression and violence.\\"The worst bullying of all actually takes place within families. Children and parents bully each other...husbands and wives bully each other too...\\"So, if you must deal with bullying for the rest of your life, how do you stop your tormentors in their tracks? Izzy Kalman has a plan and if you follow his simple suggestions, you can take back your power. He shows children how to go from being a victim to an active participant in their healing. He shows you how much people hate to feel stupid and how being in control of your emotions makes you more powerful. If you don't get angry, you can make people back off more quickly.\\"Remember the three things bullies want: Power, respect and popularity.\\"This book shows you what bullies want, how they test you by bullying you and why you should refuse to get angry. When you keep your sense of humor and view people who bully as fearful individuals, it is easier to show compassion. All of the individuals who have tried to bully me have been very unhappy people and when I showed understanding they wanted to be my best friend. By being kind to people who hate you, you can actually make your own life more pleasant.Bullies to Buddies is written for children, but this book will be helpful for all ages because it goes to the root of the problem and pulls out the weeds. This book should be in every library and on every teacher's must-read list. Too many children are in emotional pain and this book could help to solve many societal problems in their infancy. From my own personal experience, I must say these techniques work very well in daily life and even online.Parents, teachers and psychologists will find thisto be a good resource.

His advice would work for normal childhood behavior, teasing and the like."},{"Title":"Bullies to Buddies: How to Turn Your Enemies Into Friends","review":"I am a school counselor and the problem of \\"bullying\\" is, of course, constantly addressed at every school. I have read everything Mr. Kalman has written and his take on handling teasing and bullying in schools is the only approach that really works. I have used every type of program and philosophy in working with my students, and empowering the targets of teasing/bullying (\\"victims\\") is the only way to make changes.One thing that limits some people's understanding of Mr. Kalman's assertions is that our society has really blurred the lines between bullying and teasing. Children and adults are taught that every action that is veiwed as mean, annoying, or even vaguely discomforting is \\"bullying\\". Kids will tell me, \\"He bullied me. He made a noise when I walked by.\\" The word bullying is used far too liberally and pretty soon everyone is a victim of someone's egregious vengeance. This also results in REAL bullying (physical violence, power and control dynamics, repetitious harassment) being diluted and going unaddressed.Mr. Kalman's philosophy distinguishes between truly dangerous and damaging bullying and more common teasing and bothering behaviors, and he gives advice on how to deal with both. The bulk of Mr. Kalman's advice addresses the annoying, challenging, frustrating behaviors that we all have to put up with DAILY from the time we are born until we die. I can say with confidence that his techniques have worked with EVERY SINGLE student I have counseled in school over the last six years. I know this is a strong claim, and I ensure you I am not exaggerating. Of course, some students are more able to ingest and implement the techniques, but all of them see improvements in their lives immediately, and over time they all get stronger. And their changes lead to behavior adjustments in the kids who do the \\"bullying\\"!To sum, this is a great book and philosophy. I can't recommend the book enough to all parents and school personnel. I also suggest that you read everything on Mr. Kalman's website and really try to understand the depths of his philosophy, even if it's not clear to you right away and it seems confusing. It's a different way of looking at the problem, and it is the RIGHT way."},{"Title":"Bullies to Buddies: How to Turn Your Enemies Into Friends","review":"Increasingly our society seems to be growing bullies that are \\"bigger and badder\\" than in days past. Izzy Kalman, a school psychologist for twenty-five years, tackles the bully problem with interesting, unique and logical methods in his book Bullies to Buddies: How to Turn Your Enemies into Friends!Kalman says we act like animals because we are animals-and what differentiates us from lower forms is our souls and our brain capacity. His goal is to teach us how to make bullies our buddies. He believes that if people follow his instruction they will defeat bullies.The author suggests that people are picked on because they become angry and try to make the bully stop bullying. He indicates that bullies don't really care if someone wears glasses or is overweight. The bully is just \\"having fun\\" because what a bully really wants is power, respect and popularity. The bully is testing the person being bullied.Kalman suggests we think of bullies as sparring partners who will give us practice and train us to win in the \\"game of bullying.\\" His book includes: 7 rules to turn Bullies into Buddies, dialogues, quizzes and experiments. He also includes topics such as Internet Bullies, Sibling Bullies, Parent Bullies, Teacher Bullies, and When Others are Bullied.The bottom line seems to be: Take responsibility for yourself. Understand what the bully is doing and why and then change your reaction to the behavior as this will change the bullies' behavior.This is a simple, logical, straight-forward handbook to help eradicate bullying. This is a workbook that children, parents, teachers and all others who are concerned with the problem can benefit from reading and incorporating into their lives."},{"Title":"Bullies to Buddies: How to Turn Your Enemies Into Friends","review":"When my son was in sixth grade he was being bullied at school. He was miserable - didn't want to go to school, and would cry as he walked to school in the morning. Although the principal recommended that parents report incidents of bullying so that they could deal with it, our son refused, saying that getting adults involved \\"would only make things worse\\". So we decided to use the Bullies to Buddies program, which doesn't require adult intervention - it simply teaches kids how not to be victims. All I can say is - it worked like a charm. In three weeks time, our son went from miserable to running out the door in the morning with a smile on his face - and it may sound corny, but to our utter amazement his \\"bully\\" turned into a \\"buddy\\" - they started hanging out together! That never would have happened if we had contacted the school or the other parents involved. I also like the concepts this program teaches kids - to solve their own problems, and not place so much importance on what other people say - ideas that will serve them well through their whole lives. I know this is a somewhat controversial program because it doesn't focus on the bully at all - it's up to the \\"victim\\" to change his or her behavior. But as a parent, I'm more interested in what works than in psychological theories or school policies. If your child has a problem with bullying, this program is worth considering. You can also check out Bullies2Buddies.com.p.s. I don't think this is formally part of the program, but one thing that helped was that we \\"practiced\\" with our son what happens during bullying - he was allowed to call me every name in the book, and vice versa - and we had a great time doing it! The sky didn't fall, and we can learn how not to get all bent out of shape by what other people say."},{"Title":"Bullies to Buddies: How to Turn Your Enemies Into Friends","review":"I suggest you read the book, look at his website, and attend one of his trainings to find an \\"out of the box\\" way to deal with bullying. At first you'll say--NO WAY, but think about how are we going to change everyone to be nice all the time. We aren't or we'd have world peace! Telling adults and having someone else handle our problems doesn't work and at times makes it worse, so trying something different might be the answer. It is working for some of my students and I plan to work with others to try it. We are just starting to \\"train\\" students now that we've been to the training and we've read the book.

The message that YOU are causing bullies to bully you (as if the bullies have no ownership of their lack of integrity) and that you should never tell an adult about the bullying (because hey, an adult is not capable of explaining to you \\"don't give the power to the bullies and they will get bored and leave you alone\\", right?) is so far off it ruins the rest of the book.This book is correct that the bully is looking to upset you, and the more you react, the more they will bother you. It misses the mark when it tells you that if you just be nice to that guy who keeps pouring milk on your head at lunch every day, everything will be OK. That would be true if you wanted to be part of milk drencher's goon squad. But every bullying case needs to be addressed on an individual basis. True, sometimes people will bully you because you aren't \\"friendly\\" enough (you don't kowtow to them like their minions do), and learning how to be friendly to people is a good life skill, but do you WANT to be friends with people like that? Really?I have to tell you, my son is a nice kid. He knows a lot of people, but only a few he calls friend. He has the world's longest fuse and doesn't let bullies bother him. But one day, a bully who had been hassling him for years picked on one of his classmates, and my son grabbed the bully by the lapels, shoved him against the wall and told him to leave the other kids alone. (Where was the teacher? No one knows...) The bully never bothered my son (or the classmate, or anyone else for that matter) again. Left the school the following year. Individual case. Being nice didn't cut it.I do agree with have a sense of humor, because you can joke your way out of a lot. However, some people are not born with gregarious personalities. Why is it they should have to change because someone wants to bully them out of that personality? Oh, yeah, because it is their fault they were born with that personality according to the author, and you should change your personality to suit the bullies. Again with the Really? Gosh, why don't all just adjust our personalities to not feel anything when insulted, or get excited when we get an A on a paper. Better yet, just get rid of all emotions so no one can bother us or make us feel sad, or proud, or mad, or excited. Because a bully will pick on you for having a bad day, or getting a better grade than the bully did, or being angry you were late or anything the bully feels like.But just be nice, and the bully won't hate you anymore. You don't have the right to be sad, or happy. It's all your fault. You shouldn't care about anything. The bully has all the rights.How can a book that starts out so right end up so wrong?P.S. Oh, and deep down, all of us do NOT want more friends. Some do. Some of us have more than we need. We are all different and need different things."},{"Title":"Bullies to Buddies: How to Turn Your Enemies Into Friends","review":"This book is well-intended, but I can't see it working for seriously bullied children. It won't help either the bully or the bullied.This is what he wants the bullied child to do:Rule 1: Refuse to get mad.Rule 2: Treat everything as the words of your best friend.Rule 3: Don't be afraid of bullies.Rule 4: Don't attack bullies.Rule 5: Don't defend yourself.Rule 6: Don't tell on bullies.Rule 7: Show you are hurt, not angry. From page 33, Turning Bullies into Buddies - the Secret)(Rules 1-5) Can you see a seriously bullied child being able to pull all that off?(Rule 6) The not telling on bullies really bothers me. He makes exceptions for blood, broken bones, breaking or stealing your possessions; that's it. So kicking and screaming at you don't count?(Rule 7) So he wants you to say, \\"That really hurt\\" and be careful to not sound angry (page 48) and somehow that will make it better. I think that hurting you is probably just as satisfying for the bully as angering you. I think it leaves the bullied more vulnerable; the last thing we need.I think these ideas would work great for someone who need help dealing with some abrasive friends, but in no way can I see it helping some kid who is being seriously bullied by one or more kids.He also makes a serious case for not helping other kids who are being bullied, to just be a bystander. That bothers me.I agree with the concept of toughening up the bullied kid, but I don't think this book will help with that. I also think that something needs to be done about serious bullies and this book doesn't even touch on that."},{"Title":"Jewish worship,","review":"Millgram has written a text that is both readable and useful. It's a great reference for understanding the scope, origin and meaning of the liturgy."},{"Title":"Jewish worship,","review":"This book is very special. Rabbi Abraham Millgram Z\\"l was a very learned Jew . He is also an exceptional writer. What he does here is blend both deep historical knowledge and great religious knowledge to tell the story of the way Jews pray. His explanations are superlative. I would also point out that this book is a comprehensive one,and consists in interesting essayson a wide variety of subjects. Here is a brief excerpt his introduction to his discussion of the Siddur.\\" The Siddur differs radically from any other book of prayer past or present. It differs in content not only because of differences in belief and tradition, but also because of its unique history. It was not composed by an official body charged with the task of producing a prayer book for the synagogue. The Siddur grew slowly over a period of many centuries. To grasp its unique development and its singular character we must cast our eyes far back in history , for its roots are sunk deep in the soil of the Jewish past, reaching back more than three thousand years. The story of the Siddur must begin with a brief account of the ancient mode of worship which prevailed during the days of the First and Second Temples.\\" p.39Any one who wishes to augment their Jewish knowledge is strongly recommended to read this work."},{"Title":"The Non-Existence of God","review":"One of the most balanced and sophisticated evaluations of theistic arguments I have encountered. The author considers contemporary versions of arguments for the existence of God and demonstrates them to be deeply flawed. The author makes the case that the existence of the tri-omni God has empirically verifiable consequences and that taken together, absence of evidence for God's existence and evidence of God's absence render God's existence highly improbable. Everitt further demonstrates that many of God's traditional attributes (e.g., omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, omnibenevolence) when considered in conjunction, show God's existence to be self-contradictory and hence that God's existence is not only improbable (given evidential considerations), but is impossible (given logical considerations).Everitt sets up no straw men. He fairly presents what are generally considered to be among the best contemporary theistic arguments available and systematically dismantles them. Throughout he also considers possible theistic rebuttals to atheistic critiques and exposes their impotence. This well-written and carefully argued book is highly recommended to both theists, who wish to challenge their faith by the fire of reason and to non-believers, who will gain greater sophistication in their arguments for the non-existence of God."},{"Title":"The Non-Existence of God","review":"First, the good news: Everitt's book is clearly written and well organized. He has read a fair amount of the relevant literature, and in his suggested readings at the end of each chapter he is quite evenhanded, recommending books by authors like Richard Swinburne and Stephen T. Davis, with whom he disagrees deeply, as well as books by his fellow unbelievers.Now the not so good news: Everitt's treatment of the arguments for the existence of God is not particularly sophisticated, and in places he fails to engage with some of the most important recent work. This comes out very clearly in chapter 6, where he discusses arguments to and from miracles. He mentions neither David Johnson's workHume, Holism, and Miracles (Cornell Studies in the Philosophy of Religion)nor Robert Fogelin'sA Defense of Hume on Miracles (Princeton Monographs in Philosophy). He mentions but fails to engage with John Earman's bookHume's Abject Failure: The Argument Against Miracles, a significant omission since Earman's work is inter alia a sustained and sophisticated critique of the conclusion Everitt takes Hume to have established -- that even in the most favorable circumstances possible, it would not be rational to believe that a miracle has occurred. (Everitt, p. 116) The chapter on miracles has no discussion of Bayes's Theorem and the role it plays in contemporary reconstructions of the argument from testimony to the miraculous, though Everitt has (very gingerly) introduced a bit of Bayesian reasoning on p. 77 in his discussion of Swinburne's cosmological argument.The presentation of Hume's argument against miracles follows J. L. Mackie's presentation inThe Miracle of Theism: Arguments For and Against the Existence of God, stressing the claim that if the overall evidence makes it rational for us to believe that a putative event M was a violation of the laws of nature, then that same overall evidence makes it irrational for us to believe that M actually occurred. (See p. 117.) Everitt shows no awareness of the problems lurking here. It is not clear how the inverse claim should be construed (is it the claim that P(M violates the laws of nature) = 1 - P(M actually occurred)? or that for all E, if P(M violates the laws of nature|E) > P(M violates the laws of nature), then P(M actually occurred|E) &lt; P(M actually occurred)? or ... ?); and under almost any interesting construal it stands in need of argument that it never receives. Everitt asserts without argument that if a miracle is a violation of a law of nature it is maximally improbable (p. 115), showing no awareness of the long history of criticism of this claim from the early 1700s onward.Everitt's attempt to give a fourfold classification of concepts of miracle is another place where deeper engagement with recent work, e.g. Robert Larmer'sWater into Wine?: An Investigation of the Concept of Miracle, would have helped him to focus the discussion. Some accounts deserve to be taken more seriously (and understood more fairly) than they are. Ironically, one of these is an account proposed by J. L. Mackie, which Everitt (p. 119) misunderstands and therefore dismisses out of hand. Other, less plausible proposals get nearly equal time. These latter are not exactly straw men, for Everitt does try to find people who have defended them. But those familiar with the field are likely to think that they deserve more neglect than Everitt has given them.The chapter on the ontological argument is another place where Everitt's presentation is light on detail. There is no discussion of Kurt Godel's ontological argument, for example; and even the versions discussed are mostly informal, verbal versions, though for the discussion of Hartshorne's version he cannot avoid a few lines of modal logic. Here I am more sympathetic to Everitt, since I think that the ontological argument fails in all of its forms. But even the criticisms he levels against Plantinga's formulation, for example, do not do full justice to the subtlety of the argument.The chapters that attempt to show the incoherence of the traditional concept of God are, on the whole, quite weak. Everitt argues, for example, that Big Bang cosmology shows that past time was finite, and he concludes from this that God, conceived of as an eternal being, cannot exist, since (according to Big Bang cosmology) nothing has had infinite duration. Neither the premise nor the inference is backed by a compelling line of argument. Everitt is following the lead of others and should not shoulder full blame for this particular weak argument. Still, it is a bruised reed for atheism to lean on.Perhaps the worst chapter in the entire volume is chapter 11, on Arguments from Scale. Everitt urges that the sheer age and size of the universe as revealed by modern astronomy provide evidence against theism. The argument depends entirely on the premise that \\"humans are the jewel of creation\\" -- by which Everitt means at least that if God exists, we would expect every aspect of the created universe to be \\"on a human scale\\" both temporally and spatially. (p. 215) This claim, however, reveals nothing except the poverty of Everitt's theological knowledge. The whole argument was effectively buried by Thomas Chalmers in hisDiscourses on the Christian revelation viewed in connection with the modern astronomy(1817). It is painful to see a contemporary author trying to resurrect it in the service of infidelity.The concluding chapter attempts to draw together the various lines of argument, and naturally the strength of such a summary depends in part on the success of the arguments preceding it. But in this case there are other reasons to be dissatisfied with Everitt's own attempt to sum up his case. He makes some needless and baffling claims, e.g., that one can have empirical disconfirmation for a self-contradictory proposition like (p & ~p). (See p. 304.) Worse, he fails to see how different theistic proofs with somewhat different conclusions may be coordinated in an overall cumulative case for the existence of God, an epistemological issue discussed with great subtlety and finesse by Richard Swinburne inThe Existence of God. Of course, Everitt thinks that the arguments are all failures, or at least that they are all very weak. But his substantive evaluation, even if it were backed up by better argument, should be distinguished from the structural question of how a cumulative case is constructed -- not only in religion but in almost any field. Everitt's treatment of this important topic is disappointingly weak.In fairness, it is very difficult to write a book of moderate size on this vast topic. Mackie's book, for all its flaws, remains the classic treatment of its size. For anything even approaching a full-scale treatment of these issues from the side of unbelief, one needs a work three times as long like Jordan Howard Sobel'sLogic and Theism: Arguments For and Against Beliefs in God. But Sobel's book is really written for the professional philosopher who is familiar with modal logic, probability theory, and transfinite mathematics. Everitt's book is not, and for that very reason it is both vastly more accessible and vastly less powerful than Sobel's. Each work has the defects of its qualities."},{"Title":"The Non-Existence of God","review":"This book can be analyzed from various points. Previous reviews have had the philosophical approach that I am not enough prepared to discuss. What I can give is a \\"educated\\" opinion, although not trained one in the subject.I like the book. It was easy to read nevertheless the complex and some time hard to follow arguments. According to others reviews the book has not all the \\"right\\" arguments or the more accepted. I can't judge that But I can say that It is a open minder book. It present many of the arguments/propositions/\\"proves\\" in a general and clear view that can help to many people to see or at least to \\"think\\" in the subject in a most rational and logical way.It is true that is open to reader accept some of the argument although the intention of the book was in many, if not all the cases, to prove the failure in the argument pro-god. The point is that Everitt does it without critics, in a fair way, and probably in an easy way to understand for many people in most part of the book.Definitely this book is not for fanatics, but It can be for a religious person with an open mind."},{"Title":"The Non-Existence of God","review":"Of the many books that I have read arguing both for and against the existence of God, this is definitely the very best in the \\"against\\" category. I have been an atheist for many years, so the author did not have to convince me. I found his treatment of the topic to be extremely well organized, lucid, and both comprehensive and concise. I decided to read the book because it had been chosen as one of the top atheist books of the year, and I quickly understood why it was. Don't be fooled by the theist reviewers who post low scores on books like this - typically, they often haven't even actually read it, or if they have, they didn't understand it because they have religious blinders on. In any case, this is definitely worth reading even if you have read other atheist books, if nothing else because the author introduces a new argument against God's existence, the \\"Argument from Scale.\\" The only other atheist book that comes close to this one, in my opinion, is Michael Martin'sAtheism: A Philosophical Justification."},{"Title":"The Cultural Experience: Ethnography in Complex Society","review":"I have used the earlier edition of this textbook twice in a college seminar for first-year students on ethnographic interviewing.

The student papers in the new edition seem a little more current, and selected from a larger number of successful papers.

Showalter is known for being one of the progenitors of gynocriticism, that is criticism that focuses on women's literature and literary traditions. So, many feminist academics will know Showalter by reputation. Although this is not one of her more scholarly endeavors, it is clear that feminism is her main concern and feminist interests do inform this work as well.Although she mentions a couple of nineteenth-century texts (Anthony Trollope's Barchester Towers, 1857, and George Eliot's Middlemarch, 1872) and a couple of early twentieth-century works (Willa Cather's The Professor's House, 1925, and Dorothy Sayers' Gaudy Night, 1935) Showalter confines her focus to the latter half of the twentieth and the first decade of the twenty-first centuries which is a time span that roughly coincides with her own academic career. And one of the appeals of this book is that Showalter is not afraid to offer some insider gossip about this world that she knows so well. Showalter's affection for this genre dates back to her own student days when she more or less used these novels as guides on how to behave in academic circles, but then once she became an academic (and the subject of at least two professorromans) Showalter's interest shifted from a professional to a personal one. This book is both a petit self-portrait and an institutional history of a profession (which, according to many of these professorromans, is not an idyllic one, but one fraught with uncertainty and struggle, intense cut-throat competitiveness and sycophancy, and a rapidly waning, if not altogether vanished, idealism).One short chapter is dedicated to each of the six decades under review. This allows her to look at the academic novel as a genre with its own conventions, themes, and tropes and to reflect upon the changing social and academic realities of the times. Its a slight book, and more scholarly studies of this genre are available, but for my interest level this was about what I needed to get started.I found this book to be thin on insight and critical evaluation but valuable as an introduction to a genre that I knew very little about. Basically, I use it as a reading list. Since the book is not an easy one to find I'll give a quick rundown of the books that she mentions (in case there are others who really just want a reading list as well). The titles of the chapter headings for each decade are Showalters.1950's: Ivory Towers1951 C.P. Snow, The Masters1952 Mary McCarthy, Groves of Academe1954 Randall Jarrell, Pictures from an Institution1954 Kingsley Amis, Lucky Jim1960's: Tribal Towers1962 Alison Lurie, Love & Friendship (Lurie is particularly good at examining academe's impact on relationships)1968 Gerald Warner Brace, The Department1970's: Glass Towers1974 Gail Godwin, The Odd Woman (based on George Gissing's The Odd Women, 1893)1975 Malcolm Bradbury, The History Man (a satiric look at the life of a tenured radical)1979 Joyce Carol Oates, Unholy Loves1980's: Feminist Towers1984 David Lodge, Small World1988 David Lodge, Nice Work (a reworking of Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South, 1854)1988 Richard Russo, Straight Man1990's: Tenured Towers1990 A.S.

Probably everyone will have favorites that this approach omits; I, for example, was sorry that Showalter had nothing to say about Jane Smiley's wonderful Moo. Some of the books she does discuss are given little coverage beyond plot summary.Still, I enjoyed what Showalter did have to say, particular her thoughts on Middlemarch and The Corrections.

The book covers the early development of gunpowder and shoulder fired arms and explains the evolution into the modern cartridge and rifle. There are several chapters devoted to the components of the rifle and ammunition, bullet selection, and sights. This book was written more for the hunter rather than the target shooter, therefore much of the information is applicable to selecting the proper equipment for hunting specific game and/or terrain. The exception is within the seven-lesson rifle shooting course. This section gives more than just elementary instruction. The author gave a lot of insight and experience for the novice or experienced shooter. The chapters devoted to the use of the shotgun cover all the key topics such as sight picture, stock fit, proper patterning procedure, and much more.The reason I like the book so much and rate it so highly is for the quality and quantity of information it contains. It was well written and easy to read for the beginner not familiar with terminology related to shooting and firearms. It contains what it should. Sage experience and advice while entertaining. It is a book you can read again many times and still enjoy."},{"Title":"Complete Book of Rifles and Shotguns with a Seven-Lesson Rifle Shooting Course","review":"If you have ANY interest in rifles and shotguns, this book NEEDS to be in your collection.

It's a delightful place, with an intriguing natural and human history, yet the number of books and publications currently available about Isle Royale is amazingly small. At last, here's a book that does the island justice, essential reading for anyone who is even thinking about a trip to this out-of-the-way paradise.Shelton does a superb job of describing the island's flora and fauna, devoting plenty of attention to the animals visitors especially hope to see -- the wolf and the moose -- without neglecting the role of humbler species like the gull, the loon, the beaver and the red squirrel. He also gives a good account of the various human activities carried out on the island -- copper mining, fishing, lumbering, resorts and finally running and caring for a National Park. All in all I found &quot;Superior Wilderness&quot; by far the best introduction to the park, better than, for example, Jim DuFresne's &quot;Isle Royale: Foot Trails and Water Routes,&quot; though DuFresne's book is very useful in planning hikes and campsites. True Isle Royale aficionados should also pick up Howard Sivertson's &quot;Once Upon an Isle,&quot; a series of reminiscences about growing up in the island's fishing community, illustrated by the author's delightful paintings, and &quot;Isle Royale: A Photographic History,&quot; which charmingly documents the island's human history."},{"Title":"Superior Wilderness: Isle Royale National Park","review":"Isle Royale is an unusual national park. You have to take a boat trip of at least three hours to get there, and your options leave from out-of-the-way places like Houghton or Copper Harbor, Michigan, and Grand Portage, Minnesota. As a result, the people who go there tend to say a while--four days, on average. The park is 99% wilderness, so most of those people are backpacking, canoeing or kayaking, while the rest stay at the Rock Harbor Lodge and take day trips.Given this usage, the book that every visitor needs is Jim Dufresne's guide to trails and water routes. Dufresne also includes information about the flora and fauna.However, \\"Superior Wilderness\\" should be your second book. It is organized around chapters dealing with particular habitats and an animal found in that habitat. Shelton talks about squirrels, falcons and snowshoe hares as well as the famous wolvees and moose. Shelton also spends a lot of time on the forests and the varieties of flora in different parts of the island. (If you like trees, supplement this book with Bernd Heinrich's \\"The Trees in my Forest.\\")I found the book interesting before I went to Isle Royale, and I enjoyed reading it again after my return. The writing style put me off a little bit, which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4. Shelton reaches for lyricism about nature but doesn't, in my opinion, quite pull it off. If you want lyricism, read Bernd Heinrich's books.The author's own comments state that he wrote the book for armchair travelers as well as for people visiting the island. If you want to read about Isle Royale without going there, this is the best book available (and I'd give it four stars)."},{"Title":"Superior Wilderness: Isle Royale National Park","review":"This book has some good trivia type information and is interesting reading, but not a lot of practical information that you can use on a trip to the island."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"The beauty in reading this is the understanding that not much has changed in the past 2500 years.

The epic of Gilgamesh, is one of the oldest known scriptures ever written by the human hand. Yet still the epic captivates audiences and the reader while still delivering a powerful and meaningful message about our humanity. The epic itself is one of the most interesting accounts of a Sumerian hero. However the language of the unknown author has the capacity to move, and to entice. The novel continually involves the reader, even from the beginning, with a question. It asks the reader to identify with the characters as if they were the characters and to still remember the ultimate lesson of life, to enjoy. Not only addressing the elements to keep a reader's attention, but revealing powerful and important aspects of being human. Among these is to understand ones place, and to realize that life is only what we make it, and how we live it.

A tragic tale that is still relevant after thousands of years."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"You wouldn't think a 4000-year old story about a dead king would be that interesting or exciting, but actually, I enjoyed this book. The story is the archetypal heroic epic, and has been useful for learning about everything from ancient Mesopotamian beliefs and customs to tracking changes in the traditional scribal curriculum in ancient Akkadia and Sumeria.Speaking of people getting excited, one story about the Epic of Gilgamesh concerns a dignified and emminent 19th-century British archaeologist who ran naked through his lab when he realized he was the first person in perhaps 2000 years to read an original copy of the story of Noah, once thought to be part of the Epic of Gilgamesh (we now know this isn't true). Unfortunately, I don't recall the guy's name anymore, but it's true.The Epic of Gilgamesh is notable for the fact that it's considered the oldest text understandable by a modern reader without special knowledge. I found this was borne out by the actual reading, as Gilgamesh's actions and motivations are very easy to understand--since his concerns are easily understandable to a reader of any day and age. He is motivated by several concerns, such as his fear of mortality and death, the ephemerality of life on earth, the desire to accomplish heroic feats to prove himself worthy of immortality, to protect his friends and loved ones, and to destroy evil and preserve the good. He is also concerned with honor, loyalty, friendship, fear, loss, and happiness.It's also the most ancient text for which we have an author attribution. Around 1200-1300 BC, a Mesopotamian by the name of Sun-Liq-Unnini compiled the well-known \\"Standard Version\\" of the epic. He wasn't actually the \\"author\\" of the text, but it seems likely he was steeped in the historical tradition and the different versions of the text which had come down over the years in both the Sumerian and Akkadian traditions, and he seems to have gone to some trouble to gather and compile the best versions of the various stories and legends about Gilgamesh in his \\"edition,\\" which became the most widespread and popular version.We also know that he was employed as an exorcist, an important job in Mesopotamian society, since they were called on for everything from driving out evil spirits in the ill and sick, to making sure dwellings and new buildings were free of evil spirits, to blessing farmland that was about to be planted for the new season.By 1800 BC, during the time of Hammurabi, Sumerian, which had once been the dominant language in the more advanced, urban south, had died out, leaving only Akkadian, which had been more prevalent in the more rural north. Up till that time, most citizens in the area were accustomed to speaking both languages in their day-to-day affairs. Sumerian still retained the prestige of the scholarly and historical language, however, and in the written scribal curriculum.We actually have clay tablets that go back as far as 2600 B.C., but these texts are very difficult to translate and understand. It's thought that this is because the language was still making the transition to a full written language, and that this process was incomplete at that time, an interesting theory.Another interesting historical character is the ancient King Shulgi, who lived around 2000 BC. Shulgi prided himself on both his educational and cultural accomplishments, as well as his athletic and physical prowess, bragging about about his excellence as a student in the scribal schools and as the patron and creator of important public libraries. Shulgi is reminiscent of Gilgamesh and perhaps the king consciously modeled himself after the legendary hero of the famous epic."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"A half god and half human, Gilgamesh was a King of the city of Uruk.

Sandars translation for approximately 31 years now - not nearly as long as this tract has been around. I probably don't have to inform you (if you've dug this deep into Amazon checking out Gilgamesh) that our discovery of its existence - a little over a century ago caused quite a stir - we actually found there was a text, scribed in the middle east no less, that was indisputably of greater antiquity than the Bible. Many opine that the inception of comparative religious studies was the result.Nowadays - we have a plethora of Gilgamesh translations from which to choose - the Gardner, most notably, perhaps. But the Sandars volume still has value. The text reads well - and the extensive 50 + page introduction is informative, remarkably free of interpretation - large in the scope and range of its research - yet, like the translation itself - economical and to the point.Before the reality of resource limitations became common knowledge (not so long ago), Gilgamesh had interest mainly for scholars and literati.

Theyfound a library of clay tablets! What was to have been a few days excavation becameyears. He subsequently brought back to London thousands of clay tablets with their wedge shaped cuneiforms, which were eventuallydeciphered, including part of The Epic of Gilgamesh.New finds in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries by others, and their laborious interpretation followed. One of the results was this ancient epic poem, which contains,among other things, one of the earliest tales of a great deluge and flood which is eerily similar to the flood described in the Hebrew Bible. The perpetrators of the flood,though, were not the solitary God of the Hebrews, but one of the multiple Gods worshipped in those days, Enlil, god of earth, wind and air, and counselor to the otherGods, of which there were a multitude.Gilgamesh was the king of Uruk, a great city in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq.) Although blessed with remarkable beauty (\\"a perfect body\\") and great strength, he wasbut two-thirds god and one third mortal--which does present some serious questions! The poem was his epic, and there was indeed an historical figure of the samename.This is an interesting artifact for its insight into human history, if nothing else. This particular translation is more bland in the explicit ... references, etc., than others,but it faithfully retains the story.A valuable piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"The Epic of Gilgamesh dates from the third millennium B.C., making it the oldest epic poem in world literature. It is a relatively short work, which explains why over half of this little volume introduces the ancient text of the first ancient hero. The fullest extant text of the Gilgamesh was found in the Akkadian-language on 12 incomplete clay tablets found at Nineveh in the library of the Assyrian King Ashurbanipal. The narrative gaps have been filled in, somewhat, by fragments found elsewhere. Historians think that Gilgamesh might have been a ruler in southern Mesopotamia, although there is no historical evidence for any of the exploits covered in this narrative or the five poems written about the hero. Cultural anthropologists believe that Gilgamesh was a great king whose name became associated with pretty much every major legend or mythical tale in that culture.Unlike some translations that go tablet by tablet, this translation by N. K. Sandars breaks the epic down into six main narratives. The two most famous of these would be &quot;The Story of the Flood,&quot; with its obvious parallels to the stories of a great flood in the Bible and Ovid's &quot;Metamorphoses,&quot; and &quot;The Coming of Enkidu&quot;/&quot;Ishtar and Gilgamesh, and the Death of Enkidu,&quot; which Captain Jean-Luc Picard narrates in the Star Trek: Next Generation episode &quot;Darmok.&quot; Both of these are relevant points because in working from the known to the unknown they are both avenues of introducing Gilgamesh to which students will readily await. The Epic of Gilgamesh is the fundamental mythic tale in Western Civilization, but tends to be relegated to the shelf in most classes unless in happens to be included in an anthology. His quests for the Spring of Youth and immortality have been echoed in so many other tales. I have always thought that Gilgamesh is a more important figure than Beowulf, but that would be a decidedly minority opinion.

When I opened up my amazon box, imagine my surprise when I pulled out a thin little book of only 128 pages.The introduction is well worth the read, and actually makes up the majority of the book. For people like myself who had no prior knowledge of what the Epic of Gilgamesh really was, this intro is invaluable. It gives not only the history of the tablets, but also goes into the meaning of the tale, and tons of historical information that really added to my enjoyment of the story.The actual Epic goes from page 61-119 and is very interesting to those who have read other mythologies. The characters are very human though I won't say that in today's frame of mind that they are entirely likeable. The story follows King Gilgamesh who is 1/3 human and 2/3 god though the discovery of his brother, their quest to fight Humbaba, their battle with the Bull of the Heavens, and Gilgamesh's search for immortality. To be honest, I wouldn't say that this is a \\"must read\\" but it is certainly a very interesting read, simple to follow (at least in this translation) and a real eye opener to the beliefs and customs of the time.I highly recommend this version to those that are reading it outside of a classroom or discussion setting, because the intro was a lifesaver with the background and historical context that it gave. The version I read was the Penguin Classics translated by N. K. Sandars."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"I bought this book on my Kindle for class, and it was missing several parts of the tablets! Not the complete finished version of the original book!"},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"The Epic Of Gilgamesh, which pre-dates Homer by some 1,500 years, somehow survived on clay tablets and was translated in the 1800's. It tells the story of Gilgamesh, 2/3 god and 1/3 man, king of Uruk.In the beginning of the story, Gilgamesh is a strong king, building an amazing and beautiful city. However, the people are unhappy with him because he takes all sons from their fathers and leaves no virgin to her lover. There being no man alive who can contend with Gilgamesh, Aruru (a goddess of creation) made Enkidu, a man-beast strong enough for Gilgamesh to respect. After a harlot sleeps with Enkidu, he leaves the forest and comes to town to find Gilgamesh. The two wrestle, and after some time, Gilgamesh is finally able to throw down Enkidu. But Enkidu's strength is admired by Gilgamesh and the two become as brothers.Wanting to forever keep his name the mightiest, Gilgamesh goes with Enkidu and slays the guardian of the cedar forest, Humbaba. This act greatly angered the god Enlil - and this act would ultimately bring great heartache to Gilgamesh.The goddess Ishtar was impressed with Gilgamesh's actions, and she asked him to be her lover. But Gilgamesh then rattled off a list of all the men she had hurt and her wicked actions, and gave her a &quot;thanks, but no thanks.&quot; Angered, she had Anu create the Bull of Heaven, which attacked Gilgamesh and Enkidu. They eventually slay the bull, but victory is fleeting. In the aftermath, Enlil gets revenge by sickening Enkidu with a deathly illness.Gilgamesh now goes on a long journey, seeking everlasting life. He visits Utnapishtim, man of everlasting life. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh about the great flood that wiped out most all of the world - save for what was on his ark. For preserving life on earth, Utnapishtim was given eternal life. But for Gilgamesh to be young again, he must recover a flower at the bottom of the sea. he gets it, but it's quickly taken away by a serpent. Everlasting life is not to be Gilgamesh's lot.He returns home, and is exalted as the greatest king ever. Gilgamesh lears important lessons about justice and mortality. His journeys and experiences have truly made him a great king.While redundant at points, this is an amazing tale, told in a straightforward manner that makes it a swift and compelling read. A truly amazing work."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"It is hard to put into words how meaningful this book is. It was inscribed into clay tablets some time around 2000 BC--the same distance from Christ as we are--yet its central message is universal. The message is that man, fundamentally, is committed to establishing a legacy.What does \\"legacy\\" mean? It means status after death. Men fiendishly pursue status in life, and they seek to perpetuate that status to last even after they have died. Gilgamesh reveals to us that this is not some culturally created ambition, but is rather a psychological fixture that transcends the ages, stretching from this exact moment all the way back to the beginning of history. And rest assured that men will be striving to build their legacies until the end of history, too.As the modern industrial age has clearly demonstrated, having all of one's material needs met is not enough for happiness. Gilgamesh illustrated this four millennia ago. He is the king of Uruk, has access to any woman he wants, is indomitable on the field of battle, is loved by the Gods, and surely has as much food and riches as he can imagine. Yet this man, who seemingly has everything, is brought to tears by the thought that he is a finite being who will inevitably die. His solution to this problem is to forsake his life of riches and journey into the forest to slay the monstrous Humbaba. As he puts it,\\"If I die in that country I will die without rancour, [...] Then if I fall I leave behind me a name that endures; men will say of me, \`Gilgamesh has fallen in fight with ferocious Humbaba.' Long after the child has been born in my house, they will say it, and remember\\" (71, 2).For status, Gilgamesh puts it all on the line. He is ready to die fighting a savage beast, far away from home, so that he will be remembered.When I first read this book, it impacted me deeply. But at the time I did not fully grasp its significance. I only began to truly understand it when I read the book \\"Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence.\\" Some readers might be perplexed by this. What is the connection between these two books? The connection is this: evolution has endowed male apes with a deep lust for status. This is because high status apes produce the most offspring. Thus, according to this perspective, the philosophical problem of death is merely an epiphenomenon stemming from the basic drive to accumulate status. That is, the problem of death is subordinate to, and serves the purpose of solving the superordinate problem of status. The reality is that before man was philosophical, before he even had language, he was fixated on accumulating status. Gilgamesh supports this view in the simplest, most eloquent way. For you skeptics, I strongly encourage you to read Demonic Males and then read Gilgamesh. The parallels are remarkably clear. Once you digest the facts, a great deal of phenomena will come into sharp focus.It suddenly makes sense why we humans have such great difficulty finding happiness: because our brains were designed to constantly pursue status, and to never be satisfied. It suddenly makes sense why Gilgamesh was so existentially troubled: his brain was structured to build a tower of status up into the heavens."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"This is another from my \\"what haven't I read that maybe I should have\\" period. This is a difficult read - part of which is because of the way the text and variants are put together (though I don't know how to make it any better). So, have patience.This is the first translation I have read of Gilgamesh (and probably my last unless new material adds significantly to the text) so I can't comment on other versions. The Penguin Classics edition has many illustrations that did add to the pleasure.Highly recommended as one of those \\"to be read before I die\\" books."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"The Epic of Gilgamesh was written around 3000 BC in Sumerian. It must have been a classical already at that time because later on, the epic was re-written or translated by the Akkadians and the Hittites. Unfortunately, none of the versions was entirely preserved. Therefore, attempting to provide a \\"correct\\" version of the story is nonesense. Instead, one has to accept that many versions are possible; each one with its pros and cons.In my view, the translation done by Sandars is a succesful one. Surely there are omissions here and there. Of greater impact -maybe- is the fact that the story is re-written in prose (although the original was a poem). However, Sandars has aimed at getting a fluent and \\"readable\\" version in English without betraying the essence of the epic. Taking this goal as a priority, he has undoubtly achieved an excellent result. Moreover, a glossary containing a brief explanation on the Sumerian gods was added which helps the reading further. Definitively, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"I ordered the hardcover edition of this book from ... , and it is unfortunate that it is not readily available in the US. At least the softcover edition is now available, and worth acquiring for anyone interested in a glimpse of what life-and thought-was like nearly 4000 years ago. I was unaware, before reading this volume, that Gilgamesh, despite it's significance and popularity in its day, does not come down to us in any complete form. George provides both a background of the civilization that produced Gilgamesh and also a history of the various partial versions that have survived and been found. Throughout the text he is careful to explain where different versions disagree, where he has interpolated fragments from other versions to fill gaps, and where no known version exists. He appends translations of various fragments and of earlier Sumerian poems of &quot;Bilgames&quot;. While lacking the completeness, and therefore coherence, of the Homeric epics, George's translation of Gilgamesh offers at least a peephole, if not truly a window, into a civilization very far removed from ours. Despite the distance the desires and fears-particularly the fear of death-expressed seem very human and recognizable. In fact, and in spite of, the archaic structure of the verse, Gilgamesh seems more human to me than many of the semi-divine heros of Homer. Certainly not light reading, but very much worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"This was the first translation of Gilgamesh that ever really grabbed me. I had waded through plodding, tedious translations (mostly in prose) before, and been left feeling like Assyriologists must be the most bored people in the world.George's translation, however, is in verse and adds vigor to what appeared to me, for years, to be a bland jumping off point for bigger and better epics of later eras. I flew through this translation, hanging on every word, and was almost sad to see it end.The notes and critical bits were nice as well, and the numerous lacunae showed me just how little of the full story we really have. Heartbreaking, really, and it made appreciate those bored people I used to pity.If you're new to The Epic of Gilgamesh and want an engaging, readable verse translation of it, this is the one to buy.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"The Epic of Gilgamesh is a fascinating tale of great historical importance. Composed 1500 years before Homer's epics, the story is one that modern man can readily understand and appreciate. Gilgamesh was the more than capable ruler of the ancient town of Uruk; his strength and physical beauty were unmatched by any in the land, and his subjects adored him. Although he possessed so much, Gilgamesh wanted desperately to live forever like a god. He was two-thirds god and one-third human, but he refused to accept his destiny to die. If it were his lot to die, he wanted to perform great deeds so that his name would never be forgotten.The story opens with the story of Enkidu, a wild man of nature who was to become Gilgamesh's best friend and accompany him on his dangerous journeys. The first trip takes them to the Land of the Cedars where Gilgamesh sets out to kill Humbaba, the guardian of the forest. When he later slays the Bull of Heaven, the anger of the gods is turned upon him and Enkidu, leading to new suffering by Gilgamesh. In desperation, he seeks Utnapishtim in the land of the gods; Utnapishtim was granted eternal life after preserving mankind in the wake of a great flood. Gilgamesh again finds only heartache for his troubles. Returning to Uruk, he preserves the story of his journeys and deeds in writing, and it is, perhaps ironically, in this written record that Gilgamesh is recognized today for the great man he was.One learns much about the ancient gods in this tale, and the story of the great goddess Ishtar's role in the related events is pretty amazing. When Ishtar invited Gilgamesh to be her husband, he issued forth a litany of former lovers whom Ishtar had turned out and cursed, boldly rebuffing Ishtar's advances. It is this brave act that led to most of Gilgamesh's later troubles. Even Enkidu, whose reported bravery is belied by his reluctance to aid his noble friend in several situations, is rather astonishingly disrespectful to the goddess.N. K. Sandars does a remarkable job of putting the epic in its proper historical and literary perspective. A glossary of relevant gods and characters is particularly helpful. Along with providing a short history of the man, the gods, and the epic itself, she goes to great lengths to explain her method of producing this modern translation. There is no one extant copy of the Epic of Gilgamesh; a number of tablets, in varying degrees of condition and legibility and differing somewhat in the details of the story, have been compared and contrasted in order to produce the story as she presents it. Perhaps the most useful part of the introduction is an explanation of the form and style of the text. The text was originally told in verse, and Sandars explains that she chose to produce the text in narrative form in the interest of readability. As the order of events is not universally agreed upon, she explains why she chose the order she did for events. One annoying feature of the text, at least to the modern reader, is the constant word for word repetition of speeches between characters, and Sandars does the reader a great service by alerting him/her to this and explaining the rationale behind its use by the ancient writers.The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the oldest written texts in history, yet its theme is timeless, its characters all too human, and its appeal universal. Sandars' modern, narrative translation transforms the historically important epic into an eminently readable, quite enjoyable story. The tale of a great flood in this incredibly ancient tale has raised eyebrows ever since the text was discovered. The parallels to the Biblical tale of Noah are obvious, adding great strength to the argument that the legend or memory of a cataclysmic flood was common to diverse cultures in the ancient Near East. Those familiar with the ideas of Zechariah Sitchin will find this story especially fascinating and illuminating."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient story-- perhaps 4 thousand to 5 thousand years old. Originating in ancient Sumeria, it spread throughout the Near East and the version we have has been reconstructed from Akkadian, Babylonian, Hittite, and Hurrian translations inscribed on clay tablets. Its themes and motifs (including a divinely ordained Great Flood) influenced the development of other great poetic works and mythological traditions, including those of ancient Egypt, Israel, and Greece.The story here is mythic and powerful. I won't try to summarize it other than to say that it raises truly timeless questions about what it means to be human-- questions about love sex and friendship, about nature and civilization, of the simple joys in life and about our desire to do great deeds, about our fear of death and the impossiblity of escaping it.There is much about this story that may seem archaic, naive, and odd to first-time readers, ranging from the description of Gilgamesh as 2/3 god, 1/3 mortal (which may perplex folks who try to work out how that can happen hereditarily speaking), to the repetivite narrative voice that stem from the conventions of orally performed poetry (which does seem a bit odd when being *read* silently in a book). However, once one learns to see beyond these curious features, it is apparent that _The Epic of Gilgamesh_, as it has come down to us, is a brilliant and clever piece of poetic craftsmanship and storytelling. The use of recurrent images and motifs, the narrative symmetries and ironies (e.g. how, after Enkidu's death, Gilgamesh leaves the city, puts on animal furs, and goes off into the wilderness... becoming much like Enkidu was at the beginning of the story). In truth, I would not hesitate to say that the _Epic of Gilgamesh_ is, from a poetic point of view, as complex and sophisticated as any of Shakespeare's plays.The Penguin edition of the poem, I should add, offers a loose prose translation that is quite satisfactory and extremely readable. Those who are more interested in the stylistic qualities of the original may prefer a more literal translation, while those more interested in the history of the poem and its sources, may prefer a more scholarly edition-- but for the general or first time reader, Sandars' edition should be more than suitable."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"First off, I have never thaught I would give Gilgamesh anything less than five stars. However, I recently received Andrew George's translation (the more reccent translation in the Penguin Classics series) and earlier today got my hands on a copy of this edition and decided to compare them. I found this edition very incomplete (George's is currently the most complete form) and like another reviewer said an unneccisarilly long introduction (at least for a translation that short). So while I do recomend Gilgamesh to everybody I would not recomend this (N. K. Sandars) translation and would instead recomend the one by Andrew George (unless you want more myths from Babylon and that area in which case I would recomend Myths From Mesopotamia by Stephanie Dalley her translation while not as complete is still one of the best I've read)."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"Not having read scores of Gilgamesh translations, I really don't know how many stars to give this one, but I am very happy with it. In addition to giving a 'complete' version, mainly from Standard Babylonian texts from the Nineveh library but supplemented from other sources (even Hittite editions) for the sake of having a complete story, the book publishes in separate chapters, older, more fragmentary sources. Even Sumerian versions are covered. Also, in the beginning is an excellent treatment of the history of the rebirth of the Gilgamesh epic and the state of cuneiform translation and research in general. No speculation about the epic on literary or religious levels is given. George doesn't bother to tell us about the literary or historical relationship of Gilgamesh to the bible, nor does he try to use the epic to define for us Mesopotamian religion. He is simply interested in providing a good translation and is very thorough and scientific in cataloguing his sources and judgment calls, yet he hands us a lively and fluid English text."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"I recommend this Penguin Classic, but it offers more thorough scholarly apparatus than usual for the series. This is not meant as a criticism! But, a beginner may find a \\"version\\" such as Stephen Mitchell's easier to start with for an overview of the storyline, and a briefer introduction and helpful endnotes. The poem itself is not lengthy, but the ancillary texts and sources, as Andrew George shows us, do take up considerable space which may please enthusiasts but discourage newcomers to this epic poem.George prepared for Oxford UP in 1999 a two-volume edition, and this Penguin adapts the core of the English translation for a wider audience. It appears ideal for a college classroom or the reader wanting to learn more about the lacunae, the gaps, the language, and the editorial decisions made by George and fellow translators. A fascinating appendix shows how out of grammatical markers, syllabic, and half-syllabic cuneiform incisions the sounds and rhythms and absences that fill this most ancient of narratives turn into what we can understand. To a point.Terms such as \\"louvre-door,\\" \\"glacis-slope,\\" \\"hie to the forge,\\" and notably Ishtar's exhortation to \\"stroke my quim\\" give a rather archaic diction to parts of the translation. George aims obviously for precision in such terminology, but this does clash with the more demotic vernacular chosen by Mitchell in his popularization. Mitchell's also considerably more erotic and develops passages that in their original state, reading George, remain terse. Again, George approaches the thousands of fragments that are still being assembled nearly 150 years after their discovery and observes that this epic is still, amazingly and poignantly, one in progress as we await trained Assyriologists able to decipher not only the later Akkadian but the considerably more challenging and often cryptic Sumerian sources. It's a shame that in a region where so many billions have been spent to destroy the area between the Tigris & Euphrates that a few thousands can not be provided for the study and restoration of the oldest story text we have ever found."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"Andrew George gives you the best of both worlds. He reprints the Old Babylonian version of Gilgamesh, which I find the poetry to be gritty, raw and exciting. (. . . until the maggot dropped from his nose.) He also gives you the newer versions of the story,including tablets 11 and 12. I found that these two additions to the story, written at a later date, did not quite match the OB version. Each version twisted the story from the original Man vs. Hero, into Man vs. King and then Man vs. God. I do believe, though, that this is the best of any Gilgamesh book you will read."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"I fully agree with the previous reviewers who praised the qualities of this book and the translations by Andrew George. The introduction and supplementary material that accompany the standard version of the Gilgamesh epic really help to put this story into the proper historical context.This was my first reading of the Gilgamesh epic and what surprised me most about this story was its humanistic focus, especially considering that most of the literature at that time focused on the gods and how they created the universe and mankind. We learn about the superhuman heroes Gilgamesh and Enkidu, who openly spited the gods by performing deeds that ran counter to their interests. After Enkidu dies, however, Gilgamesh gets a reality check and attempts to avoid a similar fate by searching for the secret of immortality. Instead, he only discovers that even a powerful king like himself will never be able to escape death. But he also learns that instead of performing silly quests like searching for immortality, Gilgamesh should &quot;seize the day&quot; and actively use his time among the living to perform actions that will make a king great to his people. In this way, he will be able to ensure that his name lives on among future generations. Now this is great literature!As other reviewers have commented, Andrew George's translation of the Gilgamesh epic is very approachable and makes for very entertaining reading, even for the general reader (like me) who is not a serious student of ancient history.

Through the course of his life he goes on great adventures, slaying beasts that dwell in the forest and trekking through darkness in search of immortality. The feats are not without their effects, however. By the end, Gilgamesh will have become a different man than he was before.

It speaks tellingly of transience; of heroism in the face of oblivion; of love, companionship and the loss thereof.I cannot possibly say how accurate this translation is but how beautifully it reads.

Compiled from fragments of clay tablets representing Sumerian, Chaldean and Assyrian cultures this Epic has survived for over five thousand years--with the capacity to fascinate modern man. The Penguin Classics edition, whose cover displays the famous scene of Gilgamesh wrestling lions, opens with an extensive and scholarly Introduction by N. K. Sandars, fully as long as the actual saga. With occasional short lines of free verse, this timeless tale is rendered mainly in prose--making it much more readable. This edition also offers a map of the Ancient World to oriente readers.Perhaps originally written as a thesis these erudite pages present the following topics: the History of the Epic, The Discovery of the various Tablets, Historical Background, Literary Background, The Hero of the Epic, The Principal Gods of the Epic, The Story itself, the Survival of the Epic, the Diction of the Epic, and Remarks on this Version.Recited by ancient poets long before committed to clay and preserved in a visual format this story opens with a Prologue about Gilgamesh, King of the mighty city of Uruk--separated from the Persian Gulf by the biblical city of Ur. The seven successive sections of the epic present the Coming of Enkidu, the Forest Journey, The Death of Enkidu, the Search for Everlasting Life (or Eternal Youth), followed by a tale-within-a-tale: The Great Flood sent by wrathful gods, the Return of the hero, and ultimately the death of the protagonist, Gilgamesh.As with the Homeric epics, this was a time when men interacted with powerful gods--beings often at war with each other who demonstrate all the vices and foibles of manipulated mankind. \\"A mixture of pure adventure, of morality and of tragedy,\\" the story presents a wise and godlike King on a quest to preserve mankind in the flower of youth, and to cheat his inevitable end in the dusty embrace of Death. Here we find all the passions of mortal man: love, honor, lust,vainglory, friendship, self doubt, ambition, grief, and determination. Despite his crown, manly beauty and godly heritage, Gilgamesh proves a splendid Everyman who represents the human race in its age old struggle with the meaning of life.Even the frequent use of epithets and the required repetition of oral tradition do not prevent this prose version from being both readable and entertaining. Long before the Greek classics emerged the scattered tablets of the Gilgamesh story lay waiting to be discovered and collated; even today they speak to us directly and poignantly about the human condition."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"I am an Honors student at Boston College, this text was chosen for one of my classes.

For example, I perhaps see the defeat of Humbaba (the guardian of the Cedar Forest), as the start of our environmental crisis."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"Dating from the third millennium B.C., &quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; is one of the earliest surviving epic poems in world literature, and like some of its obvious counterparts, to wit, Homer's &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey,&quot; Virgil's &quot;Aeneid,&quot; and &quot;Beowulf,&quot; still has the power to attract and fascinate readers even at the dawn of the 21st century. Like &quot;Beowulf,&quot; Gilgamesh is a king whose initial goal is to establish his own eternal fame.Gilgamesh, the child of a goddess and a priest, is, at the start of the epic, driving the people of Uruk crazy with his boundless energy and restless enthusiasm. The people beseech the gods to send a companion for their king. This companion comes in the form of Enkidu, a wild man who communes with beasts in the forest. Gradually, Gilgamesh and Enkidu become the closest of friends. While the search for fame and glory continues, it becomes only too clear that the focal point of the epic is the relationship between the king and the wild man. Without peers or equals, the two live almost exclusively for each other and through each other. Other ancient epics, of course, feature complicated relationships, but &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; is rare in the sheer intensity of the homosocial bond.The wanderings and quests of Gilgamesh and Enkidu find their highest purpose in the pursuit of eternal life, which, again, surfaces because of Gilgamesh's relationship with Enkidu. Mortality becomes the overarching theme of the epic. A theme which we continue to deal with, the epic intersects the drive of science, pseudoscience, and magic throughout human history.Stylistically, the most notable feature of &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; is repetition of phrases. Even in conversation, one sees the same sentence, sometimes modified, come from two or more characters, even at relatively great distance from each other in the actual text. This demonstrates very powerfully the oral origins of the epic. Repetition, which could become tiresome, draws us further into the story, as it forces us to pay closer attention to the significance of what is being said, as well as important numbers (7 and 12 appear most frequently), and images.The adventures of Gilgamesh and Enkidu amongst gods, beasts, and natural forces, are compelling, interesting reading. Certain parallels between the ancient Mesopotamian epic and the Judeo-Christian biblical narratives that post-date it, have been well-documented. N.K.

To comprehend that ancient time, one would need knowledge and power of imagination that would be no easy to measure or value. Even than, one couldn't possibly be any nearer that time. It is shrouded in mystery.Origins of entire history of literature, of written words/worlds, emerge from these tablets. And here we find first (written) quest for immortality. And tragedy which is found in fact that that quest cannot ever be successful. That man is forever compelled to roam that vast universe of his, and to raise his voice in vain, constantly fighting for something that is as far away as things can be.Gilgamesh is a real beaut. Of it's style, importnace, structure numerous books have been written. But those are reserved for scholars and for those of you out there who are burning with desire to know. Gilgamesh greatness lies in a simple fact. It lies in realising that it doesn't matter how far have we gone in comprehending world around us, or how much we advanced technologically. However far we may have traveled, when facing this book, we learned that we are still troubled, and still defined by the same troubles heroes of old had been. What does that teach us?

It was horrible. I mean, who wants to read all about the Ancient Sumarians?"},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"There is something so direct about ancient and mediaeval poetry. The very style of it is clearly designed to be read out aloud, with repeated lines varied, like in modern blues, combined with heavily alliteration.The vigour of this poem, which is four thousand years old, is astonishing. Literally, modern writers could learn a great deal from this long-extinct style of writing.My favourite part is where Gilgamesh crosses the ocean at the edge of the world: the poet writes something like: \\"He rowed one mile. And darkness was before him, and darkness was behind him. He rowed two miles. And darkness was before him, and darkness was behind him. He rowed three miles...\\" etc. This is magical writing, evoking the style of oral tale-tellers of the time. One gets a real sense of Gilgamesh's trip into the murky and Jungian darkness of the outer ocean.Also, of course, there is a lot of fine detail of Assyrian life, such as the details of the palaces; also, the mythological monsters are fascinating, such as Humbaba the ogre, who attacks people with somethign called an \\"aura\\", which seems related to later Gnostic ideas about the multi-layered universe.To round things off, we get bits of five even more ancient Sumerian poems about Gilgamesh, or Bilgames, as he was then called. These deal with tales that precede the later Epic. I particularly liked the tale of the captured prince who watches out for the attack of his allies that will liberate him and vanquish his captors.Unfortunately, the Epic of Gilagmesh and most of these poems are fragmentary. I'd like to have known what exactly happened to the Scorpion-People that Gilgamesh encounters; or what the nature of the Stony Ones was.We will probably find out some day, as there are plenty of tablets either waiting to be excavated, or awaiting study. Unfortunately, many of these tablets, read and unread, were kept in museums in Baghdad. No doubt some shady dealer in antiquities is trying to flog them off even now, unable even to read what he is selling!"},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"Before the Bible and long before Beowulf, before Hesiod and Homer, more than 4500 years ago, in ancient Mesopotamia, in a place called Uruk (and in a region now known as Iraq) they told the story of a great and powerful king. Gilgamesh, created by the gods and more powerful than any man, was once an unstoppable force. He took what he wanted, and the people feared him. They pleaded with the gods to control him and so the gods created another man, Enkidu, who was his match in wisdom and cunning and was yet different than him in many ways. Whereas Gilgamesh was a ruler over men, Enkidu roamed freely with the beasts of the fields. Where Gilgamesh lived to conquer, and took advantage of his people, Enkidu protected the beasts from their enemies the hunters. Somehow, though, opposites attract, and these men became fast friends - and Enkidu helped to soften his friend, redirecting his ambitions and channeling his strength, helping him to become a protector and shepherd of his people who would eventually be heralded as a great and heroic king who had established the foundations of a great nation.It's a wonderful story, that can be read on a number of levels. It is a heroic story, that can be read like the heroic stories from various mythical cultures. It is a parable that explores what it is to be human, and how one can accept one's fate and that one will die. It is a story with many intriguing parallels to other great stories, that have defined cultures and beliefs - there are parallels here, for example, to the creation story of the Bible, to the story of the Fall, and to the story of Noah and the great flood. It is the story of a journey, through which a number of themes can be explored: the nature of man, the significance of gender, death and immortality, friendship, memories, and the character of the hero. Finally, it can be read as a kind of anthropological document in which the peoples who wrote it are coming to grips with the importance and meaning of the shift from a hunter-gatherer type people to an agricultural-based civilization. Enkidu can be thought of as a nomadic group that joined forces with, or was assimilated into an agriculturally based community, and then this is the story of how they, together, conquered or destroyed a forest-dwelling people, but came to see as a result that their own civilization could some day be lost as well. From that perspective the epic can be seen to carry a kind of unwitting ecological message about the impact and costs of civilization: that in order to maintain itself, an agricultural-based, military civilization must constantly be in search of resources outside of itself, and destroy those who claim those resources. Then, of course, we'd have to ask questions about a culture (not so far from our own) that tells just this story about itself and treats its own founders, the plunderers of other nations, as heroic and godlike.A rich book, and rewards re-reading and reflection. It's short and you could read it in a couple of hours - but it rewards study. This translation reads well and feels fresh, not like some old dead book. The historical introduction is useful, too, for after you've read the actual book a few times, even if it's a bit dry in comparison to the liveliness of the text itself."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"This poem is perhaps the oldest \\"book\\" known so far. It is supposed to have been first conceived by the end of the Third Millenium B.C. It tells, in a direct and somewhat naive way, the adventures of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, in Mesopotamia. In the beginning we are told of how Gilgamesh got to be king, and how he felt lonely, since he lacked a friend worthy of him. The gods listen to him, and tell him to send a whore to seduce Enkidu, a savage man who lives with the beasts and behaves as such. He is the \\"good savage\\", totally in a natural state and without a civilizatory stain. It is chilling to think of this particular story as an ancient memory of our life in pre-civilization times. The prostitute manages to seduce him (any resemblance to Adam and Eve is granted), and then the beasts reject him. He has become fully human. This passage is a wonderful metaphore of the civilizatory process which we humans experienced in immemorial ages. Enkidu has to learn to drink milk from a jar and not directly from the breasts of animals. He has to learn to wear clothes, drink wine and sleep on a bed.Enkidu fights Gilgamesh, showing him his strength and courage, which makes him the inseparable friend. After that, Gilgamesh feels the urgency to leave his legacy in this world before his inevitable death, another humanizing feature, since the individual already shows a full conscience of his mortality and of himself, and thinks of the future. So, both friends depart for the Woods, presumably current Lebanon (the Cedar Forest), where Ancient Mesopotamians got their timber, so scarce in their country. To conquer the Woods, they must kill the giant Humbaba, guardian of the forest, incarnation of Evil and presumably the first reference to the Devil in literature. In doing so they infuriate all the gods except one, and one of them must die. This is how Enkidu gets sick and dies after an excruciating agony. This fact turns out to be devastating for Gilgamesh, because it confirms the inevitability of his own demise. Ravaged by his friend's death, Gilgamesh sets out on a journey to try and find a way to escape from mortality. He travels to the East, beyond the mountains, to the Country of Sun, to try to cross the Sea and reach the land of Dilmun (kind of a preserved Garden of Eden), where Utnapishtim lives, the only human to have survived the Flood (it raises your hair to see a reference to this cataclism, centuries before the Bible), and consequently granted immortality by the gods. Gilgamesh reaches the \\"garden by the sea\\" where a young female vineyard tender lives. She tells him frankly that he will never find what he's looking for, since Death is unavoidable. It is humans' Fate, but to humans it has also been granted the possibility of happiness, and so the girl advises him to \\"fill your belly with good things... have fun and rejoice. Wear clean clothes, bathe in fresh water, caress yout little cildren and embrace and make your woman happy\\", for that is also the Fate of Man. Gilgamesh can't give up and convinces the oarsman to take him to Dilmun. Utnapishtim, puzzled, receives him and tells him he'll live forever if he stays awake six days and seven nights. Of course he can't make it, and when he wakes up Utnapishtim tells him the story of the Flood, suprisingly and suspiciously similar to that told later in the hebrew Genesis (let's not forget the long years of Hebrew exile in Babilonia). Gilgamesh makes a final effort, ripping from the bottom of the sea the \\"plant that gives you your youth back\\" but later, while bathing in a well, a snake steals the plant, changes skin and leaves. Unconsoled, Gilgamesh returns to Uruk and dies.It is difficult to exaggerate the historical and literary importance of this work, since in its brief span it collects all that makes us human: civilization, glory, the conscience of Death. It also gathers primeval memories, the process of going out of the African plains and building cities, the search for supplies and the fear of the beasts of the forests. The tale of the Flood confirms for us the memory of cosmic catastrophes which since the remote past left an indelible mark upon us. Indispensable reading."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"Overall, a decent rendition. I was looking more for a direct translation of the poetry though, whereas this is a rendition of the already-translated poetry into prose form. I felt like it was dumbed down for the reader, but it's still Gilgamesh, and therefore a great story."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"One of the most fascinating books I've ever read. The episodic tales of Gilgamesh, which were recorded around 3,000 BC from even earlier oral traditions, pre-dates the Old Testament by 1,600 years at least. There are clear parallels--such as Noah (Uta-napishti, known by the Babylonians as Ziusudra) who, after surviving the Flood, is elevated to an immortal, heroic status in Sumerian mythology. Also fascinating is the story of Gilgamesh rebuilding the ancient prediluvian cities after the Flood. One can't help but address Biblical implications since the patriarch was an Akkadian.This tale, if even partially true, conflicts with young-earth Creationist belief that the continents and landscape of Earth was completely redefined by the Flood (which some argue was responsible for the Grand Canyon). Surely that level of destruction would have destroyed any mud-and-brick cities. And yet, we have evidence here that the Sumerians were at least aware of prediluvian cities, meaning there were remnants of those cities. If one chooses not to believe this story, and treat it purely as fiction and myth, then how would one deal with the problem of Gilgamesh pre-dating Genesis? The Noahic flood and Adam and Eve stories in Genesis were derived from even more ancient epics like Gilgamesh. These tablets go so far as to explain that God created man from clay, which obviously parallels Genesis' \\"dust from the Earth.\\"Gilgamesh was, in my opinion, one of the \\"mighty men of old, men of renoun\\" (Gen 6:4). The patriarch Abraham was from Uruk, the capital city reportedly built by Gilgamesh. He was clearly educated and successful, so he would have learned of Gilgamesh and Uta-napishti in his youth. The epic of Gilgamesh has been found in several temples in Uruk and other ancient cities in Abraham's homeland (circa 2,000 BC). To the skeptic I offer this: There is a hint of truth in every myth."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"Or something like that. I'm sure I've gotten the quote slightly wrong. But be that as it may it does very much sum up much of this stories reason to be. The epic of Gilgamesh comes down to us from Sumerian times though its kernel may indeed be older than even that. Based on the story of a great god-king fellow it is does not appear to have come down to us totally 100% complete. This version has a fairly informative preface introducing the reader to some of the academia behind the story and while it didn't really engage me overmuch it was admittedly useful in understanding the story.And the story touches very much on a number of central tenets of humankind which is perhaps why it's proved so popular not only amongst an academic readership. Comprehensively taking the reader into subject areas such as mans quest for power, his insecurities regarding mortality and the nature of friendship and indeed some philosophy of leadership and it's relation to those ruled this book is a very good addition to any \`classics' library you may be building up for yourself or your children.It must be pointed out however that this isn't the sort of ancient classic I'd hand to a newcomer to the genre. The prose format of the story combined with the expressions contained in it as well as the simple fact that certain lines and couplets are incomplete do make this a bit of an acquired taste. Certainly I'd visit Homer or Virgil first and perhaps stuff like Beowulf before diving headlong into this somewhat more obtuse read."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"The translation here reviewed is lucid and readable, yet never deviates from the spirit of a text in transition, from scattered tablets to complete work. However, George does a wonderful job of maintaining the flow within this patchwork epic. In some sense it feels as though you're reading the tablets themselves under his guidance and assistance. There is also a great introduction to basic Near East culture and history, as well as an interesting appendix on the creation of an ancient Babylonian translation. The illustrations are also interesting.Footnotes were nonexistent (though they were usually unnecessary--George has an introduction before every chapter). Also, the repetitive, partial fragments that George has translated after the epic are bit needless in an exoteric translation, though the poems were a nice touch."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"I have to say that I didn't enjoy reading this edition of Gilgamesh as much as I thought I would. Probably the most bothersome aspect was that the text was littered with missing phrases, sentences, and paragraphs. It's not like the editors are to blame, its just that story is taken from hundreds of clay cuneiform tablets, not one, it seems, that was intact. In fact, most of the story is cobbled together from multiple sources in order to create a most complete edition.On the other hand, the fact that this story was written down so very, very long ago, perhaps 1000 years before the Odyssey and the Iliad were written down, and that there is so much there, motivated me to make sure I learned the story.True, you can read a \\"cleaned up\\" version, but there's nothing like reading the primary text. Footnotes at the bottom of the pages would also have helped. Mercifully, the text isn't that long and it does read relatively quickly. Good luck."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"This version is a very popular adaptation of the Gilgamesh story because it contains N. K. Sandars' crucial introduction which is just as important as the translation itself because it includes information about the discovery of the tablets in Assyria dating back to the third millennium BC and then goes on to explain the difficulties that scholars have had in rediscovering the story from these artifacts and how during this long laborious translation process found themselves actively engaged in evolving the story, and thus the mythology, which had developed from other sources and had certainly influenced ancient hero epics that proceeded it. There is no one version of Gilgamesh. There are very many. Having a good introduction like this makes reading the story even better because we understand its significance beyond being just a very old fable.The story of the translation of the epic of Gilgamesh is every bit as important as the epic itself and maybe more so because of its relevance to modern questions about the authenticity of the accounts held by popular traditional sacred texts. It is impossible to ignore the resemblance the epic of Gilgamesh has to Greek mythology as well as to the Judeo-Christian Islamic religions. Elements of the story such as Gilgamesh being part god part man, the flood story which is vertically identical to the one in Genesis and the underlying quest for immortality will peak interest and is probably the main reason why most people want to read the epic of Gilgamesh. The discovery of the tablets only increased popular scholarly opinions that religions have their roots in mythology and here is yet more evidence to back that position. Thus the epic of Gilgamesh and the story behind it is an essential classical text for ancient storytelling and how they evolve with time through the civilizations that come in contact with them. The Epic is not just Gilgamesh but the gradual progression of important themes in life that humans deal with by developing these legends and fables.Sandar's work also contains an important treatment of the story and an explanation of the role of the gods which are essentials to understanding what the story is about. Gilgamesh is hard to read without these initiations because the era and the setting in which the story was written must be dealt with or else the plot which contains abundant and rapid interactions between the gods, their attributes and the consequences, will not make any sense to the reader. The ancient ways, and we are talking ancient going back some 5000 years at least, are not our ways. Here gods are superabundant and are responsible for every aspect of life and with an outcome, such as the setting of the sun by scorpions, there is also a god who is bringing the fiery ball down into the underworld where two more gods are there to catch it and who influence our lives somehow.Gilgamesh is another world, almost alien, giving us a glimpse into how our ancestor's explained themselves and the world they found themselves in. It goes to show how far our modern understanding of why we are the way we are and why things are the way they are, has gone."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"There are two different versions of this book being sold by Amazon.The one version is the more current and is translated by: Andrew GeorgeYou can get that one here:http://www.amazon.com/Epic-Gilgamesh-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449191/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=books&qid;=1263331576&sr;=8-1Then there is the older version translated by: N.K.

They found a library of clay tablets! What was to have been a few days excavation becameyears. He subsequently brought back to London thousands of clay tablets with their wedge shaped cuneiforms, which were eventuallydeciphered, including part of The Epic of Gilgamesh.New finds in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries by others, and their laborious interpretation followed. One of the results was this ancient epic poem, which contains, among other things, one of the earliest tales of a great deluge and flood which is eerily similar to the flood described in the Hebrew Bible. The perpetrators of the flood, though, were not the solitary God of the Hebrews, but one of the multiple Gods worshipped in those days, Enlil, god of earth, wind and air, and counselor to the other Gods, of which there were a multitude.Gilgamesh was the king of Uruk, a great city in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq.) Although blessed with remarkable beauty (\\"a perfect body\\") and great strength, he was but two-thirds god and one third mortal--which does present some serious questions! The poem was his epic, and there was indeed an historical figure of the same name.Recently, in my home town, 8th-grade students were assigned the poem to study, in this very translation, but because of a rather innocuous passage referring to a \\"harlot\\" who used her blandishments, including a reference to her nakedness, toinfluence a friend of Gilgamesh (Enkidu), the teacher was persuaded by an angry parent to black out the offending phrases, resulting a dispute over censorship which made headlines here.Mountains out of molehills!This is an interesting artifact for its insight into human history, if nothing else.

K. Sandars. Penguin Classics Revised Edition. 128 pp. London : Penguin, 1972 (1964) and Reissued.Although many perhaps don't realize it, we live in a truly great age of translations, being awash in an abundance of texts that would have been the envy of earlier readers. The classics of every age and every culture - or those that have survived the hazards of time - are freely available in all kinds of versions. These range from the productions of outstanding scholars learned in the ancient languages, all the way the way through to the adaptations and reworkings of non-specialist enthusiasts, some of whom can also be very scholarly in their approach.I don't really know how many translations of Gilgamesh are currently available, but the newcomer could do worse than select that of Sandars. He freely admits that his &quot;isn't a fresh translation from the cuneiform&quot; because such a translation would require a detailed knowledge of Sumerian, Akkadian and Hittite, a task which he tells us he is not competent to undertake (page 50).He adds that extensively annotated and accurate scholarly translations exist in English, French, and German, but that these hardly suit the needs of the ordinary reader. He himself, however, has made full use of them in preparing his own version, a version which as an ordinary reader myself I've always found wonderfully readable.His book falls into two parts. First we are given a 50-page Introduction which I personally found to be quite interesting and informative, although predictably conventional in its interpretations. Sandars accepts the standard definition of the Sumerian word DIN.GIR as meaning &quot;god&quot; or &quot;gods,&quot; as do almost all others who write on Ancient Mesopotamia, though readers of Zecharia Sitchin will have their doubts (see Sitchin, 12th Planet, p.169).Following the Introduction we are given the text of Gilgamesh, mainly in Sandars' lucid and sensitive prose, though with a few passages in verse. The book is rounded out with a 'Glossary of Names,' and an 'Appendix of Sources' which gives full bibliographical details of the scholarly sources utilized by Sandars. It also includes a useful map, and is printed in a large and easy-to-read type.As a non-specialist Sumerophile I like Sandars' text and have re-read it several times. Here is an example of his verse, with my obliques added to indicate line breaks:&quot;Hear me, great ones of Uruk, / I weep for Enkidu, my friend, / Bitterly moaning like a woman mourning / I weep for my brother. / O Enkidu, my brother, / You were the axe at my side, / My hand's strength, the sword in my belt, / The shield before me, / A glorious robe, my fairest ornament; / An evil fate has robbed me...&quot; (page 94).Others may have rendered this passage better, but to me it effectively communicates the despair any man would feel at the loss of his closest friend. There are other similarly moving incidents in this strange and compelling story, a story which is essentially tragic though not unrelieved with an occasional bit of humor.Here is an example of Sandars' prose:&quot;My friend, I saw a third dream and this dream was altogether frightful. The heavens roared and the earth roared again, daylight failed and darkness fell, lightnings flashed, fire blazed out, the clouds lowered, they rained down death. Then the brightness departed, the fire went out, and all was turned to ashes fallen about us. . . . (page 79).Gilgamesh was sleeping when this experience occurred, but I wonder if &quot;dream&quot; here really means &quot;dream&quot;? Perhaps, but what this passage evokes vividly for me is an ancient man's experience of being very close to the site of the launching of a huge rocket (See Zechariah Sitchin, 'The Stairway to Heaven,' p.127). Everything seems to be there - the roarings, the flashings, the dark clouds of smoke from the exhaust, the fall of a residue of &quot;ashes&quot; from the firing. I wonder if a modern witness of a Cape Canaveral launch could do as well . . .Gilgamesh's tragedy is that he was partly human : &quot;... the great gods made his beauty perfect.... Two thirds they made him god and one third man&quot; (page 61). But who were these &quot;gods&quot; whose lifespans were so much longer than those of humans? And how did they make Gilgamesh two thirds &quot;god&quot;? Did the Sumerians just dream all this up for purposes of 'entertainment' ? Or were they more accurate reporters than they are credited with being ?The Sumerians were adamant in asserting that they themselves created nothing at all, neither agriculture nor irrigation nor architecture nor engineering nor astronomy nor mathematics nor writing nor anything else, but that their _entire_ civilization was given to them by the &quot;gods.&quot;Of this civilization we find Gilgamesh lamenting : &quot;Here in the city man dies oppressed at heart, man perishes with despair in his heart&quot; (page 72). But would human beings have deliberately created a system in which widespread despair was unavoidable? Or was something else responsible for establishing the civilizational patterns that, as a reading of Samuel Kramer's 'History Begins at Sumer' will convince anyone, are still ours? Is &quot;civilization&quot; a euphemism for a non-human system of exploitation?There are many mysteries in this profound and moving tale of Gilgamesh's friendship with the wild man Enkidu, his frustration over the human lot, and his courageous attempt and failure to discover a solution. But whether you read his story in Sandars' version or in some other, make sure to read it. It's a story you will not easily forget."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"Gilgamesh, the king of Uruk (and in real life he was the king of Uruk), is the first tragic hero recorded by the human race. Though many of the epic's tablets were discovered in Assurbanipal's Assyrian library (7th century B.C), parts of this book appear to originate from around 3000 B.C. Long before the Assyrians, 1800 years before the Hebrews, and, in fact, before anybody as this story originated with the hard-bitten people of Sumer, the first civilization, who happened to have been utterly lost from history until the 19th century A.D. The very civilization to invent the wheel, the city, the sexigesimal system governing the sweep of hands on your watch and, most importantly, writing. Say \\"alcohol\\", and you speak Sumerian - as they apparently invented that too, while the word has not changed for over 5000 years. \\"Hard-bitten\\" because while the Egyptians would celebrate Nile floods, Sumerians cursed themselves for having deserved such punishment as a flooded Tigris or Euphrates. To Egyptians the sun was life. To Sumerians the sun was relentless. Suffering is an excellent source of creativity (though the Egyptians did well with less) and Gilgamesh reflects this in both its creativity and diagnosis.Although very old, his story is forever new. Gilgamesh is - as stated in the introduction - emblematic of our concern with mortality, the struggle for knowledge and escape from the common lot of man. As a mortal, Gilgamesh is condemned to death, but he doesn't take his fate lying down. So, like all good mythologies, he sets out on a great adventure to rectify his problem, encountering gods, monsters and his best friend, Enkidu, the \\"savage man\\", who is at home with the animals, until enticed by the civilized Gilgamesh with a woman - something he never saw before. Perhaps a symbol of man's complications when leaving his natural state.Most interestingly Gilgamesh reaches \\"where the sun rises\\" to meet Upnapishtim. Upnapishtim is by now famous for saving \\"the seed of all living creatures\\" on a boat, whose dimensions are given by a rogue god friendly to man, all before a great worldwide flood sent by other capricious gods because humans were making too much noise, keeping the gods from sleep. (That Noah mimics the Upnapishtim myth should be no surprise as Sumer influenced the Levant for thousands of years after its passing.)When Enkidu dies Gilgamesh morns, \\"How can I rest when Enkidu, whom I love is dust and I too shall die and be laid in the earth forever.\\" In the end Gilgamesh is \\"mocked by fate, lost opportunities, wasted hopes and swallowed by death\\". Apparently, no matter how many gods you have - and the Sumerians had hundreds, one even for the pick-axe - death remains a mystery and confidence of reward a hunch.A wonderful journey into the mind of humanities first civilization, greater understanding of scriptures to follow and a clear signal that the deepest concerns of our human condition remain unaltered no matter where or when."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"One of the things I like best about this book is not the words but the layout and graphics. Reading it is pleasant and effortless.Everyone should read The Epic of Gilgamesh and I highly recommend this \\"version\\" (not translation) as the best place to start. You will never be able to forget your trip back into the dawn of civilization, the Sumerian world of the ancient ruler Gilgamesh. He did achieve immortality through this Epic."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"This is absolutely one of the best translations of Gilgamesh available. Andrew George gives us a taste of what the original versification was like. He also translates all the extant versions and fragments of versions of the epic, and this is important. Not only do the versions augment each other and fill in the gaps that time and entropy have literally carved, shattered, and eroded into the original tablets, but they key us into the variations that the generations of years of cross-cultural retellings have wrought. Gilgamesh becomes Bilgames, etc. etc. Finally, an appendix at the back of the book discusses the process of translating the text from the tablets. In many ways this is the most fascinating part of this volume. Along with these good points, we are treated to line drawings taken from period artwork illustrating the epic, so we see the gods, goddesses, and strange monsters as they were visualized by the Babylonians. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"I recently ordered this version to prepare for teaching Giglamesh in a Humanities I course. I had read the famous Sandars version, which compiles the various tablets into one coherent prose narrative. However, Andrews' new version attempts no similar gloss: the work is revealed as a fragmentary masterpiece, with gripping passages of narrative trailing off into maddening gaps and uncertainties. The Introduction offers a very informative, concise overview of Gilgamesh scholarship and the state of the work itself. It is truly humbling to realize how little we have of this great work, yet what we do have literally changed our understanding of the ancient world. And as Sandars suggested in his Introduction to the earlier Penguin volume, it is amazing that such an old, fragmentary work from a forgotten culture still has the power to move us. This sounds like academic hyperbole, but even in its most authentic state, the work is powerful; we see Gilgamesh's grief, his desperation, and his bitter defeat upon losing Enkidu and the possibility of eternal life. The translation carries some powerful imagery that somehow surpasses the more fluid prose translation; perhaps this is a bit of chiaroscuro (sp?), the lost passages showing the more complete, brilliant ones in greater relief.Even better, this translation includes all the various fragments of the Gilgamesh story, as well as the ealrier Sumerian version of the epic, which is much different than the Standard version. It's a remarkable volume which is fun to pour through and reconstruct this ancient world on the dawn of civilization. It truly inspired me to teach this work to my students, emphasizing how such a powerful work can rest on only a handful of broken tablets."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"This epic from the Assyro-Babylonian culture (parts of which were probably written as early as 3000 B.C.) contains perhaps the earliest known example of man's quest for immortality (the version I read was the translation by N. K. Sanders). According to Samuel Kramer, the prologue has the oldest known reference to Lilith, who is an important female demon in Jewish legend. Apparently, a historical Gilgamesh actually existed and ruled Uruk in Mesopotamia in the first half of the third millennium B. C. (probably in the first dynasty of Uruk). In the epic, the god Anu attempts to curb the harsh rule of Gilgamesh, the son of the goddess Ninsun and a mortal priest of Uruk, by the creation of a strong and wild man named Enkidu (or, Eabani) (many scholars regard Enkidu as a symbol of primitive man). After a fight between the two, they become friends and have a number of adventures. In one tale, Gilgamesh is wooed by Irnina (or, Ishtar). But she is rejected by Gilgamesh and the bull sent by her father Anu to destroy him is killed by Gilgamesh and Enkidu (some regard this story as a nature myth in which Gilgamesh represents the solar god of the spring season and the goddess is the goddess of love and fertility). Later in the epic Enkidu is stricken with disease and dies. Gilgamesh is devastated and wishes to avoid a similar fate. He goes in search of eternal youth and immortality (perhaps the earliest example of such a quest in literature). After more adventures, which includes him learning the Babylonian story of the great flood, he finds the answer to his quest; but, it is quickly lost. Even though this is probably the earliest epic, it has considerable allegorical significance. It is perhaps the earliest known description of man's quest for the meaning of life and the struggle to avoid death. What is learned is that death is inevitable and man should enjoy the life he has."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"You wouldn't think a 4000-year old story about a dead king would be that interesting or exciting, but actually, I enjoyed this book. The story is the archetypal heroic epic, and has been useful for learning about everything from ancient Mesopotamian beliefs and customs to tracking changes in the traditional scribal curriculum in ancient Akkadia and Sumeria.Speaking of people getting excited, the translater, Andrew George, says a dignified and emminent 19th-century British archaeologist ran naked through his lab when he realized he was the first person in perhaps 2000 years to read an original copy of the story of Noah, once thought to be part of the Epic of Gilgamesh (we now know this isn't true).George also makes the interesting claim that the text is the oldest written text accessible to a modern reader without special archaeological or scholarly knowledge. I found this was borne out by the actual reading, as Gilgamesh's actions and motivations are very easy to understand--he is concerned with fundamental issues of life and death--honor, loyalty, friendship, fear, loss, happiness, and so on.I also enjoyed some of the historical details George provides in the introduction. By 1800 BC, during the time of Hammurabi, Sumerian, which had once been the dominant language in the more advanced, urban south, had died out, leaving only Akkadian, which had been more prevalent in the more rural north. Up till that time, most citizens in the area were accustomed to speaking both languages in their day-to-day affairs. Sumerian still retained the prestige of the scholarly and historical language, however, and in the written scribal curriculum.We actually have clay tablets that go back as far as 2600 BC, according to George, but he points out that these texts are very difficult to translate and understand. It's thought that this is because the language was still making the transition to a full written language, and that this process was incomplete at that time, an interesting theory.An interesting character George discusses is the ancient King Shulgi, who lived around 2000 BC. Shulgi prided himself on both his educational and cultural accomplishments, as well as his athletic and physical prowess, bragging about about his excellence as a student in the scribal schools and as the patron and creator of important public libraries. Shulgi is reminiscent of Gilgamesh and perhaps the king consciously modeled himself after the legendary hero of the famous epic.Anyway, the introduction and epic made for more interesting reading than I had imagined."},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Penguin Audiobooks)","review":"N. K. Sandars' presentation of Gilgamesh is an outstanding achievement of editing, interpretation, and paraphrase. \\"Paraphrase\\" rather than translation, because she admits that she is unable to read the cuneiform in which the epic was written over four thousand years ago; instead she's compared all the literal scholarly editions available and turned them into very readable and moving English prose. This was easily the finest version for the nonspecialist reader when it was published in 1960, and to my mind it remains unsurpassed.Readers primarily interested in the cultural background of Gilgamesh will want to look at more recent scholarship, but for the rest of us Sandars's rendition of the text is as powerfully engaging as when it first appeared.Though tyhe original Gilgamesh is a verse epic, and Sandars writes prose, readers looking for the intensity of poetry will find it here, in what's really a splendid \\"prose poem.\\" In fact, Sandars's prose strikes me as more, not less, satisfying than David Ferry's currently popular verse translation, which is competent but, to my mind, rather lackluster.Although Penguin has issued a newer translation in verse by Andrew George, I hope they keep N. K. Sandars's version in print. It's brilliantly done."},{"Title":"Play Ball!: A Tribute to Our National Pastime CD","review":"This is a very entertaining listen.

Its not everyday that you can pick up a book and find no profanity in it. This book was written and is set in the 1960's. The Book is centered around the main Charactor Gillian Bellemy, an heiress waiting to become of age to obtain her fortune. Someone is out to kill her and take her fortune. Jim Trevor is there to protect Gillian and find out who is doing this to her. I found this book to be suspenseful and had just the right amount of romance.

Oy, don't get me started!A guest book? Yes, now this is going to be a wonderfully clever way to torture my friends. Can't WAIT to get started.As I look at my notes now, I realize there is a whole lot more nonsense stuff that never needs to see the light of day. But, really, that is my point.

Quite a few on regular journaling, too. And a fair bit on paper arts. I might just have a small, tiny book *addiction*. That's neither here nor there.What IS both here and there is that I lusted after this book before it came out. I think I may have actually scared some people at B&N; with the crazy-eyed, wild-haired begging for them to hurry up and get it in. (I'd preordered it here, but it was taking just way too long. Yes, I know they ship the first day. That's beside the point. I'm not so good with instant gratification.)So when it came in from Amazon, the first thing I did was toss aside the other filler books I bought to get the free shipping and flopped down on the floor with Visual Chronicles.An hour later, when I came up for air, the first thing I did was prepaint some shoes. SHOES, people! Who woulda thunk of creating a literal *walking journal*? Evidently, Linda and Karen.From that first set of shoes until now, I keep finding pieces of this book in things that I do, artwise. It's a revolutionary book in a very quiet way -- making you think about both the extraordinary and the everyday. Those little \\"Have No Fear\\" quotes (which one reviewer obviously didn't understand to be set-offs for tidbit tips) get repeated in my head when I'm stuck, or needing a dose of inspiration. And the projects, while not my typical style, have been something I've gone back to again and again. (The miniprompt book and the color glossary in particular.) And I definitely didn't find any of it to be condescending -- maybe because I really see the authors (through their writing here) as friends. Highly enthusiastic, you-can-do-it cheerleader friends, wanting to share a little bit of their creative spirits with everyone, rather than hoarding it all for themselves.Like I said, I've got a shelf full of journaling books. Among those, there are probably a dozen that I refer back to again and again, and Visual Chronicles is one of those. I've never regretted buying it, or keeping it at the ready -- because that inspiration that's so freely given is priceless."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"Visual Chronicles helped me view the world from a whole different angle.

It was perfect to inspire me and get me going on my own journaling projects."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"Some of the ideas presented in this book might have intrigued me, but the presentation was uniformly bad. There is nothing in this book about journaling that feels \\"real\\". There's no real art, no real journaling, no real emotions. Nothing deeper than the surface.I am particularly irked by the way that the layouts (for lack of a better term) in this book are supposedly rich with symbolic meaning. For example, the \\"flames\\" of paint along the bottom of the front cover come from a layout which consists of the paint, a stamped caption, \\"On a hot August night we drove back from Vegas\\", and a stamped clock on the outer edge of the page. We are assured that it's ok that the clock is only half stamped because it represents that time was lost. The words are supposed to remind us of the jiggle of a moving car and the paint is the heat of the trip. And that is one of the better layouts presented in the book, in as much as it is something hand painted rather than a picture clipped from a magazine captioned with dymo lettering.This book is full of encouragement to speak on these \\"symbolic\\" levels. Pick colors and images to represent the people in your life, write in obscure fragments of sentences, etc... but it seems to me that if you wanted to truly reflect on your life and inner turmoil, it would benefit you more to really get your thoughts on paper in a way that you will understand a week, a year, or a decade from now. I don't think I'd get much out of a journal in which I used pictures of elephants on red backgrounds to represent a coworker who I was mad at for two weeks in June of '97. Chances are good that looking back on it, I wouldn't have any idea of what I was talking about and I'd assume that I must have went through a phase where I was really into elephants on red backgrounds. No memories, no growth.Having said that, the bottom line for me is that this is a pretty terrible book. The art is bad, the concept is bad, and the whole book is patronizing and insults my intelligence. I'm still giving it a fairly high rating because I think some of the journaling ideas are decent prompts when handled in an adult manner. Their presentation seems more geared to teenagers who are looking for a way to write snotty things about their friends without getting caught, but they can also be a jumping off point for far more ambitious journaling."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"Visual Chronicles inspired me.

This book has nothing to do with art journalling. Art is art, scrapbooking is craft.I didn't believe the other negative reviews here because they all went on about how they were artists and they already knew the stuff here. But their reviews were much more accurate than the 5 star reviews.If you want to collage a little book together about your life, the things you love etc, then this, and every other book by this publisher is for you. There are hundreds of books out there and i'd say this one is a little thin on ideas to be worth choosing over other scrapbooking books.Basically this book talks about painting the background, using rubber stamps and rub-on letters, colouring in photocopies, and cutting up paint sample sheets from the hardware store, as though they were new ideas.There are cute ideas in here, and the book talks you through how to inspire yourself. But i honestly can't see any difference between this an all the other books out there trying to cash in on the scrapbook industry. of which i am not interested.If you want to make an art journal, something that an artist uses to develop their work and ideas, then you're going to be let down. You wont be given ideas for drawing materials, or how to combine materials to accentuate your own drawings, how to develop ideas further and present them thoughtfully.This book actually assumes you have no drawing or creative ability at all, suitable for some, but not for those wishing to create an art journal/sketchbook. I suspect the author/publisher put the word art in the title to purposely mislead people like me. I'm seriously tempted to return this book since the title is so misleading."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"I recently got this book and once I started reading it, I literally couldn't put it down. Very few books have drawn me in like this one did. It's wonderfully written. It's very relaxed and casual. I almost felt like I was sitting in a coffee shop and just chatting with Karen and Linda. It's very down to earth.This book covers it all. It's instructional with lots of great ideas and techniques explained throughout. And at the same time it's very inspiring too. They truly make you feel like anyone can be an artist and that everyone is creative. Their concepts of creating your own \\"personal palette\\" and \\"get going\\" tag books are incredible. This book is a must for anyone who is interested in art journals. It's also the perfect book for someone who is just beginning to create art journals of their own."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"From the pictures and other reviews I thought this looked like an interesting book but now I feel slighted. I was hoping for more projects to inspire me but what I saw were basic techniques and a whole lot of chit chat on being creative. A few of the pictures were interesting but not enough to buy the book. I would have had better luck searching for free info online. This is one book I will not be keeping."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"While reading this book, my mind seethed with ideas for projects. The book helps you break through your inhibitions and fears of not being artistic enough or of being criticized.Particularly intriguing to me was the journal box as a place to collect loose journal pages. As a lifelong ephemera collector and hoarder of bits and pieces, I'm thrilled to have permission to glue and paint and write all over these.One example in the book shows step-by-step how to journal on a pair of white tennis shoes to remember a trip. Traveling shoes... how fun."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"Hafta say, I am not at all a beginner in this type of journaling, but I STILL find this book a perfectly swell addition to my library. Even for those of us lacking fear, what a pleasure to sit down with a new book in a fun & funky format; of course, darling, it IS visually appealing. The paper on which it's PRINTED has a nice feel! The book is written in an encouragingly upbeat - yes, FUNNY - style, with excellent advice for all comers and interesting, cool & graphic examples illustrate every page.When you finish this book, if you still aren't all about the journal keeping, at least make yourself a pair of Traveling Shoes. Linda, Karen? Thanks for some ideas I definitely plan to try."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"The authors were on \\"The View.\\" Ordered the book. Read in November and set goal to do in January. There are many new ways to be creative in making your journal pages or scrapbooking pages. The \\"Personal Palette\\" and prompts help get all your thoughts on paper, out of your mind and where you can see them. Clears your mind to renew it and start to think about new possibilities in creativeness and your life.Materials used are easily obtained and are reasonable cost. It was fun to go select all the color palettes from the paint section of the local hardware store. Changes taking place in my life and new happenings to come about this next year. This book most instrumental in helping sort through my thoughts, dreams and wishes. Every page gives you a new insight. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"This was the first book I read when I learned there was such a thing as art journaling. I'm a photographer and not a painter, but I love to work with my hands and with paint and glue and expressing myself on paper. This book showed me from the start that I don't have to be a painter or art student to begin art journaling; it took all the intimidation away and gave me the practical tools and encouragement I needed to begin this new art form for me. The written style of the book is personal and conversational, and I've njoyed reading it, not to mention learning so much, from the first application of the glue stick up."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"From the reviews, I expected so much more from this book. It does have a very attractive layout, but the content doesn't live up to the presentation. There doesn't appear to be much new here. If you are just going to buy one book about this artform, I would recommend Hellmuth's \\"Collage Discovery Workshop\\". It came out over three years ago, but still sets the standard with innovative ideas and provides a lot of inspiration."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"If you are an art journalist, a maker of altered books, a collage/mixed media artist, or are just looking for a new way to be creative, then this is the book for you! If you never buy another book to jump start your creative muse, BUY THIS ONE! This book includes exercises that encourage the reader to chronicle their thoughts and lives with painting, sketching, stamping, collaging, and writing. Inspiration for experimenting with colors, shapes, ephemera, communication styles and more. The unique combination of diverse artistic elements makes this book a must have for artists, crafters, scrapbookers, and writers."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"I bought this book because I loved Linda Woods's artwork, especially her richly colored mixed media pieces with images of the Buddha. I was surprised and delighted to find in this book such a wide range of journal pages. I did not expect to be able to create art like Linda's, and thought I would again see only journals I wished I could make. I can completely relate to the intimidation of journaling with art, and the authors quickly got me past that by addressing those fears head-on, and showing examples of simple and more complex pages. These sisters got me writing and collaging, and expressing many different emotions. My journal is looking pretty darn good, too. I'd still love a book of Linda's Eastern-inspired art!"},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"I had thought of the color coding myself but wasnt sure how it would work out. This book made it seem a perfectly good idea! I love the prompts and enjoyed the writing style. For inspiration both in written and visual form , this book can not be beat ! The snack ideas are really good too! The only thing i would change about this book is a little more explanation of Gesso and other mediums they mention using ,and to tell why to use them and how. Otherwise it is perfect. It has certainly inspired me to create at least 10 or 15 different journals ! And probably more ! If you are going to buy one book on the subject of art journals , get this one. It is worth the money and more!"},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"This book shows you how to convey your personality, your sense of humor, your LIFE, in a journal (or on a shoe, shirt, or whatever!). Whether you are an artist or a writer, you will love the funny, easy style of this book, and the techniques that REALLY WORK to get you painting, collaging, and writing about things you never even noticed before. I have learned to see my world differently, and how to capture it easily in different journaling forms. I truly laugh more, thanks to the sisters!"},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"Have you ever wanted to start a journal, but didn't know what to put in it? Are you daunted by the blank pages? Do you already keep a journal, but feel like you have fallen into a boring routine of \\"Today I...\\" every time you write?Visual Chronicles is a fun, fresh look at journaling for seasoned and novice journalers alike. Full of fantastic color photographs and project ideas, real-life sisters Linda Woods and Karen Dinino have created a masterpiece that is welcoming and inclusive of all readers.Do you feel like you're not artistic enough to keep an art journal? I felt that way - and Linda and Karen devote a whole chapter to those of us who think \\"But I'm not artistic\\". They really *get* how we feel.Or maybe you are an artist already, and you feel like a journal with lined pages is much too confining. Who says you have to use a book like that? Linda shows you how to make a travel journal out of a pair of canvas sneakers!I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in journaling. As well as buying my own copy, I have requested that the library where I work order several copies as well. We are looking into holding a journaling workshop featuring Visual Chronicles in the near future.Don't just take my word for it - buy this book and see for yourself how beautifully put together, awesome and inspirational Visual Chronicles really is!"},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"To me, journalling involves much more of the written word. The point of this book (does it even have a point?) is to devise some sort of symbolic meaning to people, events, or emotions, and then just use a color or a spiral or something to convey a 1-word snapshot of the subject. To what purpose? There may have been 1 page devoted to \\"altered books,\\" which is really why I bought this book. I saw no techniques or layouts I will use, and I really thought the artwork was not only amateur-ish, but not even evocative of any real meaning."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"A wonderful book that provides tools for anyone who wants to start journaling. And even for those who are experienced there is a lot to read, see and laugh about. The essence of what Karen and Linda want to tell you is that only you can tell your story. No one else can do that for you. The sisters show you that you only need limited supplies to make a start and that you definitely do not need an education in art to do it. Anyone can do it! That is by far the biggest message the sisters give you. It is well written, with a great sense of humor. The layout of this book is beautiful. The examples and explanations of the various techniques are breathtaking. This book invites you to get started right away. It gives you enough inspiration to take notice of and to journal about the humor, the special occasions and the everyday. And to do this in a way that is especially worth while to you."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"This book takes all of the mystery and fear out of making a journal that expresses who \\"you\\" are with the \\"stuff\\" you have in your house, memory boxes, maybe even the trash can. It's beautiful and very well organized. It teaches you how to create your own journals using art and found objects in a very simple and patient style."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"I was so excited to get this book and trust me I wasn't let down.

LOVE IT"},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"I'm not easily impressed. I see so many of these books; this one really stands out as a keeper. I like it, I love it. I am journaling now on a daily basis for the first time in my life. This is coming from the anti-journalist. If you're too jaded to admit you love this book, that's a shame.Five star rating.If I could, I'd get it blessed."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"This is the first book in this genre that actually does what it promises...inspires unabashedly free art journalling by \\"wow\\" giving real ideas that lead to more and more ideas.

The book has some pep-talks for the reluctant person and also step-by-step instructions and journaling tips. It's great. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"This book is the coolest, funniest combo of art and writing advice and techniques. It shows you how to express your personality or the personality of the people and places around you, with mixed media art and words. There are different styles of art and writing shown, so you can see how to make a fast art journal page that really captures your mood in an easy, simple way, or you can spend more time on, like, a self portrait that uses more difficult steps for the art. I like that there are lots of ways shown to do art journaling, with paint, collage, pictures, just writing, combining things, etc. The chapters build on eachother, so as you do what is in each one, you get better and better at the writing and art, and you have all these ideas for journaling about your life and looking at life differently. I am laughing more and art journaling more, definately!"},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"I loved the style and lay-out of the book, I liked the simple way it was written, and most of all, I love how it doesn't make a big production out of creating art journals, or make it sound completely pompous and self-gratifying. It's a simple, basic look at how to create some wonderful memories to pass on to friends, family or just keep for yourself.My husband even read it and loved it! That's saying quite a bit as he's a real man's man!Excellent book, especially for those who don't know where to begin!"},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"This book has showed me the way how to do what I never thought I could,Art,it makes it look simple and show no fear.If I can do it anyone can."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"I bought this book early on in my art journaling journey, and hadI decided to take it to my used book store as a trade-in, but looked through it first - and realized that the negative 1 star review of this book is really not fair, so decided I should weigh in with an alternative opinion. I get that the book is NOT for people who've done a lot (or any) serious art journaling, but it's a very good starting place - in fact, that's the audience it's aimed at - and successfully. I found more to it than just being a scrapbook maker's intro to art journaling - frankly, there are plenty of techniques in this book that are in books for more advanced art journalers, so it isn't any more correct to describe this as\\" just painting some pages and gluing on pictures and some stamping\\" than other more \\"advanced\\" texts. Have you read any of the other art journaling book?s - that's pretty much what they show - in fact, I've bought over a dozen and find little difference except the approach. I also love \\"The Journey is the Destination\\" and other books of that type - painted backgrounds, drawings, pasted in photos and significant papers, etc are the basis of them. If the writing in this one is too 'soccer mom\\" - don't read it - just read the descriptions of the admittedly basic techniques and pass up the cuteness. I've had to do this in a number of \\"how-to\\" journaling books, many of which are just fine if you leave out the soulfulness (I really dislike other people's soulful journeys - I just want the techniques to use for my own soulful journey, which I will spare anyone else the annoyance of reading.) I agree about the \\"take it with you\\" art supply kit - phew, it's more than I would use at home. What you need is pretty minimal and differs from one to another - I like gel pens and Sharpies rather than pencils, with a small journal with pre-painted page backgrounds - but, again, this is not atypical of most of the journaling books - some of which want me to take water colors and a bottle of water in addition to the paper, pens, chalks, art markers etc. So, don't write this book off - it's just fine and not much different than so many others.Take what you want from it, and if you do, you'll be well along the road of your own style. I have started weeding out the many (over a dozen) books on this subject, as I'm realizing that there is rarely much difference in the techniques from one to another. Only a handful have anything at all new to offer, and most simply differ in the photos of the projects - otherwise, you can save money. If you have this book, you'll have plenty to work with. Is it the best? Depends on you and your needs. I would suggest checking it out of the library, and if you like it, buy it. You might just decide it's one that you'll find useful."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"This book is intended for people who are not used to expressing themselves with \\"art\\". It is full of ideas for projects to get you started: artistic prompt journals, pet peeve journals, personal color palette journals, travel journals. None of which interested me.There are some good ideas about using \\"ephemera\\", found objects, and materials that you already have on hand. As well as suggestions for how to do art \\"on the go\\", while traveling or running errands. There is even a section on page composition. There is not much about altering books beyond the basic idea that you can saw books into different shapes and gesso the pages to put in your own content.Some reviewers complained that this book was not really about \\"journaling\\" because it doesn't say much about deep understanding or personal reflection and growth. This book isn't about journaling as deep psychotherapy. This is about journaling as art therapy. It is less about introspection than about artistic expression. Some people are not deep and that is ok. Artistic expression is good for you even if you are shallow.This is a pretty book full of cheerful encouragement not to be intimidated by \\"art\\" or \\"writing\\". It would be good for anyone who is intimidated by the idea of doing \\"art\\" who just needs gentle guiding hand to get started on the path of self expression. But really not for me."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"I read Journal Revolution first, and loved this just as much! This book is full of inspiration and ideas for art and life. It is not just a scrapping book or a journaling book. Its really about how you approach art and life. There are fun and unusual projects, cool techniques, and the best philosophies ever. LOVED IT!"},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"If you are new to Visual Journaling, this is a must have book. Wonderful directions for getting started and getting yourself to open up to this unique experience. Even if you don't think of yourself as artistic, this book will pull it out and you'll enjoy the journey."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"\\"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos & Altered Books\\", by Linda Woods and Karen Dinino is a must have for those who love art journaling. I love this book so much that I don't know where to begin because everything about it is great.Visual Chronicles is a soft-cover book with full color pages throughout, and is a collaboration by sisters Woods and Dinino. Their use of childhood photos in many of the collage pieces add a very personal touch to the artwork and the overall book. I felt like I get to know the authors through the photos. Every page is filled with large, colorful artwork and is layed out in a fun artistic way that made me want to dive into each project immediately.The book is written for people who have never done art journaling before, but as a professional artist of 20 years, I found it very useful also. The authors don't talk down to the reader, but instead, joke around and invite readers to have fun, explore, and play. Not only do they make art journaling look fun and easy, (which it IS), they also give readers lots of projects to do, with step by step instructions that include photos, and finished artwork for each project.For people who think they can't write, draw, be creative, etc. the sisters push those fears aside with \\"Fear Buster\\" chapters that dispel most fears around art. And Visual Chronicles isn't limited to collage, but encompasses difference mediums, and most households will have supplies already on hand, such as glue, scissors, family photos, old magazines, colored pencils, old books, etc.The art projects are very creative and leave room for personal interpretation and individual taste, with over twenty art journaling projects to do. One of the projects that I really liked and continue to do on a regular basis is the Wish Journal. That was just one among many of the ideas that I had a blast doing, and have incorporated into my art journaling activities.Overall, Visual Chronicles is great for both beginner and seasoned artists alike; the book has tons of fun and innovative projects; is written in friendly humorus language; has beautiful artwork and design on every page; and is worth reading over and over because it ignites the creative fires. Whether you're just starting or have been art-journaling for years, you'll love this treasure trove of art and ideas."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"I have a pretty extensive library on altered books, journals, etc. and I always find new and interesting ideas in each new acquisition. This book, however, let me down. It's not that it's bad, it just didn't offer anything new or exciting. Unfortunately, it only shows one particular style of visual journaling and the \\"have no fear\\" approach didn't inspire me. If you do have a fear of getting started and would like to start slowly this might be a good first book. It just didn't do it for me. Sorry."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"I love the projects and the friendly tone of this book. The vibrant personalities of the authors really shine through!!! So happy I purchased this book!"},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"This book will inspire anyone to start journaling, especially if you have a fear of writing. You will really start to think about recording your life in a whole new way--a fun, creative and exciting way!"},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"I ordered this book as kind of an 'add-on' because I was getting a couple of others, saw it had been bought by people who had bought my other choices, and had great reviews. Because there are so many positive reviews for this book, I was really looking forward to it. I was very disappointed with it as a casual buyer, but can understand that it would appeal to many people. This review is really just for people like me, who might buy it not fully realising what they're getting, and be disappointed.To understand where I am coming from, the books I *do* like include 'Drawing from art: the journal as art', 'The journey is the destination: the journals of Dan Eldon', and 'Artists journals and sketchbooks: exploring and creating personal pages.'As you can see, my interest is in art journals rather than altered books, but I really feel that this book is aimed squarely at scrapbookers who want to start making some more personal work. The book is directed towards multi-taking parents (meaning Moms); there are many references to taking supplies to the kids' ballgames, or worrying about the kids knocking the paint over, and it takes a cute, encouraging, enthusiastic tone that alas, soon felt like fingernails down a blackboard to me.So, aimed at a COMPLETE journalling beginner, who has done some scrapbooking, but feels that's just not enough any more, then this is a great book. It will talk you through some basic things, and give you the confidence to find your voice. If that is you, then stop reading now, because now I'm going to criticise it. Go read some of those other nice reviews instead.Ok...I hated, simply detested, loathed, this book. If there was a no-star option I would have picked it.A) Why are the authors talking to me as if I have recurring brain damage? Is it because I am a Mom? Are Moms dumb?B) Do the authors have shares in scrapbooking supply companies? Why do they recommend taking, as an portable travelling ESSENTIALS kit, to take *everywhere* with us; a glue stick, fine-tip premanent pen, scissors, paintbox inkpad assortment, Peerless Watercolour paper cards, coloured permanent ink pens, mini stapler, cosmetic sponges, water brushes, alphabet stamps, mini pump-top water bottle, pre-painted background paper, tape, 3\\"x5\\"index cards, and two mini idea-journals you have made. You're kidding me, right? But THEN, they suggest an expansion pack; gel medium, acrylic paint, ruler, flat brush, shipping tags, paper punches, favourite rubber stamps, decorator paper. And she suggests that apart from travelling out with this, you \\"take it from room to room in the house\\". Yeah - me and the team of sherpas! I'm not arguing that that isn't a great bunch of supplies to have at home, but you know, you can journal with just a pencil and the journal. That's pretty much all you need to take with you to the kids baseball game. It fits in your jacket pocket!!C) Journalling is all about examing yourself, your life, and your surroundings, and being honest. The authors do not feature journalling at all. These are scrapbook pages, in a book. They put an ink or paint background down, cut up pictures and glue them, then add stick-on lettering and some rubber stampings. Where is the honest examination! Show me something real! The things that really annoy Linda, or 'push her buttons', are bad eyebrow waxes and holes in the fingertips of dish washing gloves. How Desperate Housewives can you get?OK, i better stop before I get mad. I'm glad so many people like this book, and i HOPE that it will encourage them to continue journalling. Just remember, to live an authentic life you don't need a tote full of art supplies; just your voice and a pen!"},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"I only say that because I am the definition of that headline -- but VISUAL CHRONICLES made me want to sit down with glue, scissors, and some old magazines...and make something fun. I'm not an artist, but Linda and Karen made me feel like one. This book is inspiring, funny, creative, and wonderful -- and that's if all you do is look at the pictures. The writing is a class above most instructional art books, full of wit, character, wisdom, and enthusiasm.

How can Linda and Karen possibly know all of my reasons/excuses for not giving it a go? They seem to be looking inside my head or something!The way they approach everything in the book, whether in words or art, is with a loving light touch. There is heart & humor in this book and I deeply feel that, with all that goes on in our lives and in the world, both are so needed.Linda and Karen, I am reading every word. There is so much to reflect upon, laugh over, learn from and use in real life. You share an attitude and then explain techniques and applications through exercises that are fun and insightful, not intimidating. THANK YOU! I know that so much goes into creating a book.

I finally know what to do with the pile of concert tickets, boarding passes, and hotel stationery I've amassed over the years. I always knew I couldn't throw these things out because they made me smile whenever I came across them. Linda Woods and Karen Dinino opened a door for me with this book, showing me step by step how to preserve my memories in a way that might even make them meaningful to someone else. I'm no artist, but this book made me feel like one. Anyone out there with a pile of memorabilia or a dusty journal filled with empty pages needs to buy this book.

Visual Chronicles is the start of something big."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"I agree this is a great book to get a person started thinking about how to create a visual journal. It suggests many jumping off points for the creative process. It helps you find aspects of yourself you may want to use as the focus of your journal. However, after I received the book, I realized the photos and suggestions were not very inspiring for someone who has been creating art as long as I have. I feel it is a Visual Journal 101 book and I realize I was looking for a master seminar! The cover suggests something more sophisticated and quite different from the visual depth of the images inside. Get it if you don't have a clue about what and why you want to begin experimenting with journals. But if you have ideas of your own already, I think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Visual Chronicles: The No-Fear Guide to Creating Art Journals, Creative Manifestos and Altered Books","review":"Finally, a book on art journaling that is not just a bunch of picturesof collaborative journals.

Can it be possible?? Visual Chronicles has awakened the creative GENIUS within me, and has shown me how to express it, EFFORTLESSLY! Don't believe it? Well, neither did my son until he saw MY NEW JOURNAL (in which you can find pages and pages full of my [previously presented in black and white but now] very COLORFUL life!!! Honestly, this book inspired me from page ONE. It made art journaling fun, easy and accessible to ME, making use of things I had around the house but never before recognized as ART SUPPLIES. Thankfully, Visual Chronicles is NOT a collection of elaborate journal pages with explanations requiring special tools and years of classes -- this book is about expressing yourself artfully on a moment's notice, with UNBELIEVABLE results.

Like &quot;Love and Fame,&quot; &quot;Carp on the Fly&quot; shows a different Berryman from the one we meet in &quot;The Dream Songs.&quot; Here the emphasis seems to be on man's relationship with nature, both outer and inner, and the predatory nature of our connections with that larger world. The use of fish imagery also, perhaps, suggests the pre-birth, womb-nestled state which haunts Berryman's work and, I imagine, haunted his life as well -- in the anti-poetic society in which he lived, he was truly a fish out of water. Berryman's complicated attitude toward Christianity is reflected in the image of the fisherman, whose bright hooks draw fish upwards toward the surface, where they meet a kind of death that is also a transcendence, a shudder of pure, mortal joy."},{"Title":"Thirty Silver Coins","review":"\\"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\\" Not a question the central character bothered to ask himself early enough to avoid a long boat ride down the River Styx, but one which the author carefully mulled over as the underlying theme of this moody and stylistic tale. Though I never felt particularly sympathetic to any of the characters, all of them were well-drawn and sufficiently compelling to hold my attention from first page to last. What I especially enjoyed was the author's voice, which seemed to mirror his central character's personality at every turn - intelligent and involved, yet somehow withdrawn. A story I will remember for a long time, especially the images of Charon and the river."},{"Title":"Thirty Silver Coins","review":"This book is on the one hand \\"take me away\\" fiction and on the other, full of insights not the least of which is a call to perspective on life.

Rottman provides an excellent summary of America's last great amphibious invasion of the Second World War in Osprey's Campaign #96, Okinawa 1945. Quite simply, this is one of the better titles in Osprey's campaign series and shows that it is possible to pack a great deal about a major military operation into a 96-page format. This book is particularly useful as a case study for military officers, thanks to the author's attention to many pertinent details that escape most civilian authors. Overall, Okinawa 1945 is a \\"must-have\\" for anyone interested in the later stages of the Pacific War.Although Rottman follows the standard Osprey campaign format, the opening chapters of this volume are far more in-depth than virtually all the other titles in the series. An 11-page introduction covers the history and terrain of Okinawa, as well as the American strategic debate about whether to invade Okinawa or Formosa. The section on opposing plans is also quite detailed, totaling 10 pages. Seven pages are used to cover opposing high-level commanders on both sides. Another 12 pages are used to cover opposing forces, including succinct but detailed discussions of tactical organization and strength and weaknesses of each major unit. Pertinent characteristics are included; such as each US Army division in the invasion was about 1,000 infantrymen under strength due to a shortage of replacements and the fact that one of the two Japanese divisions on the island had no organic artillery. Taken together, Rottman provides a far more detailed introduction to the campaign than any other Osprey title, by spending fully 52% of the volume on the background material. Unfortunately, the strength of the introduction leads to the weakness of the main campaign narrative that - while good - is overly succinct. The invasion itself is covered in 33 pages: sections on the initial landings, the continuing offensive, actions at sea, and the push southward. There are three color battle scenes: Japanese suicide boats at Naha, Marines reducing a bunker and the virtual annihilation of the US 193rd Tank Battalion on 19 April 1945. There are a total of five 2-D maps (strategic situation, Okinawa, the initial landings, the Ie Shima assault, and the withdrawal of the 32nd Army)and three 3-D \\"Birds Eye View\\" maps (the Japanese counteroffensive on May 4-6, 1945, the Battle for Sugar Loaf Hill, and the final stand in the south). The author also effectively uses footnotes at the end of each section to provide additional details.Okinawa 1945 has a great many strengths. The author's discussion of terrain and weather (e.g. the impact of rain on operations) greatly enhances the reader's appreciation for the operational environment. Rottman also makes very good use of statistics, particularly concerning military and civilian casualties. For example, I was unaware that 153 of 354 American tanks used on Okinawa were knocked out by the Japanese - a 43% loss rate for US armor. Nor was I aware that fully one-third of Okinawa's civilian population died in the campaign. The author also covers the challenges of civil-military operations (CMO); the US military had to screen and care for over 285,000 indigenous civilians on Okinawa. The introduction of some new weapons - such as the American 75mm recoilless rifles is discussed, as well as how both sides adapted their tactics based upon lessons learned from previous island battles. In particular, the Japanese adoption of defense-in-depth and attritional tactics allowed the Americans to get ashore at low cost, but provided the basis for a bloody, protracted campaign. Finally, the author provides a superb order of battle for both sides, including information on support units such as signal, engineer, medical, quartermaster, and MPs. Even the US Marine Corps' three canine platoons are included.The only real disadvantage of Okinawa 1945 - which is the overly short shrift given to the main battles on the Shuri Line - is not the author's fault, but rather due to Osprey's size limits. The last six weeks of the campaign are covered in about six pages, which leaves room for only a bare-bones account. No eyewitness accounts are incorporated into the campaign narrative, which could have been used to add intensity and grunt-level perspective. Otherwise, the campaign seems just like flags moving on a map, without real soldiers bleeding and dying. The maps are also a bit inadequate, particularly since no map depicts the initial battles or dispositions on the Machinato Line. The question of General Buckner's operational plans is also studiously avoided; over 7,600 Americans died on Okinawa and the question should have been raised if these losses were excessive. Due to the Japanese concentration of most of their forces in the south of the island, Buckner was able to land his troops and occupy the vital airfields and more than two-thirds of the island at the cost of fewer than 500 dead. The Americans came to Okinawa to get the airfields and they succeeded in seizing them at very low cost. Was it really necessary to engage the remaining Japanese garrison - hopelessly trapped in one corner of the island - in a bloody attritional battle for over 80 days? With so many Japanese garrisons bypassed across the Pacific, it seems odd that Buckner never considered sealing the Japanese 32nd Division off and slowly reducing them to impotence by bombardment and starvation. Particularly given the fact that the Joint Chiefs of Staff knew of the impending Atomic Bomb raids, it seems odd that so many American leaders would endorse an attritional battle like Okinawa at this stage of the war."},{"Title":"Okinawa 1945: The Last Battle (Campaign)","review":"Having spent 18 months there while in the USMC in 1986-1988, I found this read interesting since there are still remnants of the battle all over the Island."},{"Title":"Okinawa 1945: The Last Battle (Campaign)","review":"The Osprey format of getting in everything in 96 pages sets any book up immediately for some strong and weak points. First and foremost, this book is way too short to get any real understanding of this battle in either strategic or tactical terms. Forget about the human element, the suffering and sacrifice of the Okinawan people: there is just way too much to cover in a booklet this size.But that shouldn't stop anyone from using this very useful forumulaic book as a companion to a serious read about this Battle. The book's maps make some of the geography easier to understand. You have a sense of where the Marines are, where the Army is and where the two divisions and 1 Brigade of the Japanese army are locked in battle. I find this critical to understanding the movement and retaining any knowledge of a battle. In this sense, the book is a very good help.The Book is divided roughly in two: the events, strategy, dispositions and planning before the invasion and, the invasion and battle. About 2/3 is dedicated to the events and considerations outside the actual battle. Troop planning, tactics, troop disposition and armaments. This sets up the ground well and also allows one to understand who is engaging who... it also helps to understand the numerous landings on the islands in the region (the largest being on Ie Shima and its accompanying battle). This detail is helpful.The last sections on the actual battle are really only thumbnail sketches, but they are useful for understanding and supplementing other books on the battle (usually almost always with the de rigeur lack of maps). In this sense I think that the book is a fair and valuable addition to the Osprey collection."},{"Title":"Okinawa 1945: The Last Battle (Campaign)","review":"I wish Mr Rottman had ten more pages to fill out the battle action for this battle was so difficult and intriguing with the intense defense, the difficult terrain, the Kamikaze attacks etc that I'm sure the author was confined by the page limit. If it was possible, I would have strayed from traditional format and eliminated the couple 2 page color illustrations for more room for the battle.The introduction was very good and helped set the scene for the landing and subsequent engagement. The chapters on Opposing Commanders and Opposing Forces were also excellent but it will take away from describing the 3 month battle. There was only 33 pages devoted to the battle while other Osprey books can have 50 pages or more. This really short changed the battle action.The photos were very good; they helped show the difficult terrain our marines and soldiers had to contend with while fighting the enemy. Most of the maps were good as well, especially the three 3-D maps. Once again, these maps help show the terrain and the relative positions of the terrain obstacles.Within page limits, Mr Rottman has done a good job with this book, like he has with his other books, but feel too much time was spent on the prehistory and not enough on the difficult battle. Its still recommended. For further reading Roy Appleman's or EB Sledge's books will add to your understanding of the battle. If you want the absolute best maps of the campaign then you'll need the book by Chas Nichols."},{"Title":"Okinawa 1945: The Last Battle (Campaign)","review":"Okinawa 1945: The Last Battle (Campaign, 96)by Gordon Rottman is packed full of details concerning the Okinawa landings. If one wants to merely know about troop movements then this is the book for you. However, the battle was about more than troop movments. As, such Rottman's book seems sterile. Thie is espically true after reading Ospery's other books about the War in the Pacific, espically Iwo Jima and Tarawa.What is missing from the book is any context for the battle or any notion that men fought the battle. Okinawa was the last major battle of the War and resulted in a devesting loss of life. Rottman cites the statistics, but in order to understand the battle mere statistics are insufficent. The Ospery format certainly limits the ability of Rottman to move beyond the basics of the battle. However, the books on Iwo Jima and Tarawa prove that it can be done."},{"Title":"Okinawa 1945: The Last Battle (Campaign)","review":"All in all, this book provides a great deal of data but is superficial in its narrative. There is a lot of information on the equipment, terrain, and military units involved in the Battle of Okinawa. The campaign is then covered from pages 51-83. This is only a third of the book. Nevertheless, the book does cover the entire campaign, albeit in a vague manner.The chapter on opposing forces is a tedious read. For example, on page 49, he describes \\"...artillery battalions with 36 X 150 mm howitzers, 8 x150 mm guns, 8 x 240 mm howitzers...\\" Although the author gives detailed information, his writing style is cumbersome. This type of information is better suited in a table or chart, not a paragraph. The captions by the photos are also cluttered with nomenclature. Instead of referencing a BAR, the author repeatedly references a .30 cal M1918A2 Browning Automatic Rifle. This nomenclature heavy writing style simply uses up precious space.On a positive note, other related information is provided in the narrative. This includes the identity of commanding officers and where a particular division was formed. Another example is found on page 52 where he discusses the origin of the term K-BAR as a slang name for the Marine Corps' fighting knife. Apparently, the manufacturer changed the company name when a customer stated he had killed a \\"BAR\\" (i.e.: bear) with one of their knives; hence the term K-BAR.The battle on Ie Shima is a good example of the author's convoluted writing style. This narrative is two paragraphs long. Unfortunately, the author spends almost half the text describing the island's geography and location, to include latitude and longitude. This is useless information that only takes up valuable space. Osprey books are short by design. The author should have remained focused on the battle itself.Sadly, this book suffers from a lack of sufficient 2D tactical maps. The few maps included in the book are cluttered and difficult to grasp. Also, there is no map covering the overall campaign. This shortcoming is noticeable due to the convoluted and difficult writing style. A good map would have gone a long way in helping the reader follow the action. The 3D Bird's Eye view maps are only marginally better.On the plus side, this book contains a wide selection of black and white pictures. The author does a great job of pointing out interesting details in the photos. For example, on page 60, he reveals that the stains on the soldier's helmets were deliberately made to provide camouflage. Unfortunately, many of the photos are out of sync with the text. For example, on page 48, the author includes a photo of the well known war correspondent Ernie Pyle who was killed in the battle of Ie Shima. Too bad this photo is in the section on Imperial Japanese forces. Ernie Pyle's death is then described in the Ie Shima narrative on pg. 69. This is where the photo should be located.Bottom line: This book contains a great deal of data on the battle of Okinawa. Any reader interested in specific details on equipment, geography, and tables of organization will find this book useful. Unfortunately, the narrative is somewhat confusing and superficial. Not a bad book but not a great one either."},{"Title":"Okinawa 1945: The Last Battle (Campaign)","review":"Okinawa 1945: The Last Battle (Campaign, 96)by Gordon Rottman is packed full of details concerning the Okinawa landings.
