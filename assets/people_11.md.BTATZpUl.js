It is well written and interesting. The author, a close friend of Lucille Ball's, gives plenty of info both on her good side and bad. But even the criticism is written kindly.I just wish there had been more pictures."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"Lee's book focused on the post-I-Love-Lucy Lucille Ball and shows us a real woman. His memories of his friendship with the actress are both heartwarming and real. You could feel the love that he had for this remarkable woman. I absolutely loved this book... one of my favorites."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"The author takes you where few have been, up close and intimate with Lucy. It is evident from page one and woven throughout, that this book could only be written by someone that shared a special love with a special person. Written in a smooth, flowing, humorous style, the anecdotes almost forbid you to stop reading. It is an account of this icon's last ten years of her life that is a must read whether you were a Lucy fanatic or not."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"This book is absolutely sensational for anyone interested in a behind the scenes peek into the private life of a very public lady. It read like the wind, made me laugh and made me cry. Lee Tannen has done a terrific job of giving us a simple story of friendship with a very complex star. It's obvious that Lee Tannen loved Lucy and the love was totally reciprocated. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"This guy was so wrapped up in I Love Lucy re-runs that he seemed to forget that Lucille Ball had other talents. For the most part, the author was very good at describing the way people looked and acted and the places he encountered. At times I felt like I was right there in the middle of the action. However in almost every chapter he referred to \\"I Love Lucy\\", like he was living some dream of being Ethel Mertz. It was very distracting and got old real fast. I hope that he had more respect for her and Gary Morton than comes across in the book. He almost made it sound like poor Lucy was nobody 'til Lee Tannen showed up! On the other hand, some of the stories made it hard for me to put the book down and there was a nice little post script that had a list of things Lucy liked, which was enjoyable to read. I recommend this book, but either wait for the paperback, or check it out at the library. I can't believe I actually paid [amt] for this one!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"I purchased this book as son as I saw it on the shelf. Being a real Lucy-phile, I hunger for anything Lucy. I was well aware of Lee Tannen and his relationship with Lucy via Jim Brochu's book, Lucy in the Afternoon. Brochu's book is a great accounting of his relationship with Lucy, her early life and the Desilu years, but Tannen's bok is a blow by blow of Lucy's last decade, of trips with her to Snowmass CO, New York, Massachusetts etc. The reader has the feeling they too were there as it happened. Also, the book sheds interesting light on the relationship between Lucy and Gary Morton, and between Gary and anyone who tried to get close to Lucy. I Loved Lucy also contains great candid photos of Lucy and her friends and family members in many situations and locales, unlike Brochu's which contains photos of her at home and at a few LA locations. Seemingly, the photos in the Brochu book seem a bit like a 'look at me, I'm with Lucy' statement. Tannen's I Loved Lucy has the same sort of snapshots you would find in any family scrapbook. The content is riveting; I read it in one day. Every Lucy fan will love this book, I strongly recommend it as required Lucy reading! Lee, if you read this review, congrats on the book! I hope we get in touch someday, because I loved Lucy too!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"What a shame. A love letter to Lucy devolves into a boorish opportunity to brag about Tannen's glamorous life, glamorous career, glamorous Manhattan apartment, etc. He didn't miss an opportunity to mention his partner's $100,000 salary, his ability to simply not go to work when he didn't want to, all of his fabulous friennds, and wonderful life.Tannen basically horned his way into Lucy's life and writes as if Lucy's life revolved around him. Because I loved Lucy, too, I found the book interesting. It was a peek, not a tell-all, into the private life of a woman loved by the world. It's just unfortunate that the telling of this story was overshadowed by the author's extraordinary need to let the reader know just how grand a life he leads."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"A simply written account of the author's friendship with Lucy that I really appreciate. For some reason there is fascination with celebrities. Its really is hard to fathom what that kind of fame is like. The photos are nice as well and help give an idea how human Lucy was."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"This is Carol Butler's son writing this review. As with any Lucy book, I rather enjoyed this one. Apparently, the author was a very distant relative of Gary Morton, Lucy's second husband. There is one chapter where the author talks about a fight between him (Lee Tannen) and Lucy. She didn't talk to him for almost a year, before she finally forgave him, and began speaking to him again. Their friendship lasted for nearly 40 years, if I remember correctly.In the book, he talks about Lucy's early film career and her start in television. He also talks about her first marriage to Desi Arnaz, as well as her second marriage to Gary Morton. He talks about her friendships with Vivian Vance, William Frawley, and all her other costars.He talks about the ups in downs in her life. The things she liked, and the things she disliked. There's even a list of her favorite celebrities, TV shows, movies, and foods in the back of the book. Overall, a very good book about Lucille Ball, and I'd recommend it to fans, both young and old."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"Totally enjoyed reading this book. Such an intimate relationship with such an icon of the 20th century. Easy to read, well written with such personal accounts, I recommend this book very highly!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"The Hanukah/Christmas holiday season really came early for this reader this year!Lee Tannen's memoir of his close friendship with Lucille Ball titled I LOVED LUCY is an incredibly sensitive, loving, real, amusing, touching, honest, candid and extremely well written insight into the unknown and fascinating final chapter in the life of one of America's most beloved personalities (probably now more than ever). The love, devotion and deep friendship between Mr. Tannen and Lucille Ball leaped off of the pages at every turn. I was engrossed completely from start to finish and was sad to get to the end of the book. I wanted more, more, more!This is a wonderful literary achievement! Mr. Tannen will make many, many readers and fans of Lucille Ball quite happy with I LOVED LUCY!Enjoy!PS. This book will indeed be the perfect Christmas gift for anyone who loved Lucille Ball (which seems to be EVERYONE)!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"Lucy-philes: this is a book for you. The book focuses on the little known details of the last decade of Lucy's life. Through family ties, author Lee Tannen became Lucy's confidant and backgammon buddy. The book provides new anecdotes galore of Lucy's day-to-day life, her opinions, her friends (famous and not so famous), her relationship with her children (a little sparse here, but still interesting) and about her complex, sparkling and very unique personality. Bonus: the end of the book features several pages of Lucy's &quot;favorites&quot; - including her favorite movies, entertainers and best of all, her favorite &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episodes. For those who've read Lucy in the Afternoon, there are also a couple of references to author Jim Brochu (who I see did an Amazon review of this book, too).(There're also some pretty funny anecdotes about Elizabeth Taylor which work themselves into the book when Tannen directs her perfume commercial.)The book absolutely flies and it's almost impossible to put down. Although it's fun to see that Lucy's sense of the zany stayed with her until the end of her life, there are disconcerting insights, also. According to Tannen, Lucy fought depression during this last decade, saddened by Desi Arnaz's death, by the &quot;failure&quot; of her last TV series and unconvinced that her fans were still interested in her (despite the fact that she couldn't even take a walk in her neighborhood without cars and tour buses screeching to a halt.) I was sad to learn that this treasure actually had issues about her own value as her career slowed. I suppose that's only natural -- Lucy was a real person, too, as hard as that is for me to grasp.And, that's where Tannen succeeds so well. Tannen shows you the real life behind the legend. True, at times Tannen is shockingly irreverent towards Lucy, teasing her about her driving, her singing and even ribbing her mercilessly when she comes back from presenting an Academy Award about whether the real Lucy is the glam-presenter-Lucy or the Lucy-in-curlers-and-bunny-slippers who flees Swifty Lazar's party to play backgammon at home with Tannen. (Lucy often developed &quot;shpilkas&quot; in crowds.) But, tough dame that Lucy was, she seemed to thrive on the banter. True, Tannen can be a bit of an obnoxious braggadocio, but the &quot;attitude&quot; only makes the book more colorful. This is a poignant book, a terrific read and a &quot;must-have&quot; addition to any Lucy library."},{"Title":"The Royal Game ; Amok ; Letter from an Unknown Woman","review":"A sales rank of 4 million plus? If people only knew how good these stories were, this book would be in the top ten. This trio of Zweig novellas do appear in other publication forms, so I hope he's receiving a bit more attention than this one entry would indicate.What's so great about Zweig? Well, this just one piece of anecdotal evidence: that I read most days for a little while, happy to set down my book after ten or twenty pages. This one consumed my afternoon. My favorite of the three is Amok, about a German doctor in a Dutch colony who makes crucial choices about the life of a wealthy woman and, in turn, his own. The Royal Game is Nazi-era literature, but unlike anything else I've ever read of the period. The obsession displayed in Letter from an Unknown Woman was a little less believable for me, but no less well written.These stories deserve your attention.

I am also a teacher, and my kids read them as well. I was somewhat disappointed when I perused the book after receiving it. Most of the stories I had already read...in college courses. My kids didn't like them either; unless you have an exceptionally bright child, the stories are a little deep and complex for anyone under 16. Also, if parents knew the true symbolism of \\"The Yellow Wallpaper,\\" they may not want their child to read it. I had a hard time with this story being in the context of a children's book.These stories are also a little too long and out-of-date to capture a child's interest. I teach 7th and 8th grade, and if they got bored with the stories, I'm sure anyone younger would too. If you are an older person, you may enjoy these stories a little more, as we tend to appreciate and understand \\"classics\\" a little better. But, like I said, if you have a bright child that enjoys multifaceted stories, by all means, buy the book. That's my .02."},{"Title":"The Best Ghost Stories Ever (Scholastic Classics)","review":"_The Best Ghost Stories Ever_ (2003), edited by Christopher Krovatin is an anthology of nine old-fashioned and classical ghost stories. How well you like it may depend in part on how much you value something novel. If you do, you may not greet this book with cries of wild abandon. These stories are all old standbys rather than dazzling new and clever pieces. But the title indicates that Krovatin was looking for classic chillers, and it is hard to quibble with his choices. The stories are: Algernon Blackwood's \\"The Empty House,\\" W.W. Jacobs's \\"The Monkey's Paw,\\" Washington Irving's \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\\" Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Masque of the Red Death,\\" Bram Stoker's \\"The Judge's House,\\" Jerome K. Jerome's \\"A Ghost Story,\\" Charlotte Perkins Gilman's \\"The Yellow Wallpaper,\\" Henry James's \\"The Romance of Certain Old Clothes,\\" and Anonymous's \\"The Story of Clifford House\\".The Jacobs, the Poe, the Irving, and the Stoker were tales that I read repeatedly as a child. I remember vividly reading the Stoker for the first time in fourth grade. My God, I thought. That's not the way it _should_ have ended! The other tales were ones that I encountered a bit later in life, when I knew a bit more about the Way of the World and the Finer Works of Literature. The James is given a certain amount of power in its depiction of female sibling rivalry. And the Gilman. Is it a portrait of a woman going insane from weaknesses within herself, or is it an account of a husband driving his wife insane? You decide.The Jacobs, the Irving, and the Poe have been made into radio shows, television episodes, or movies several times. But the original stories have usually remained superior to the various dramitizations. Are these stories effectively scary? Sometimes. But they are always literate. That is their real strength. This book is recommended, especially for young readers._Note_: There are, however, some proofreading errors that I cannot let pass. The Blackwood story is listed as by Algernon _Blackwell_ in both the contents page and the text. And the back cover states that one of the stories included is by Robert Louis Stevenson.

When the second edition was published it was high on my list to review and find out if things got better and get what - they did.Myhre has once again taken the crux of the CCNA exam and put together a book that begins with the OSI model goes on to LAN Technologies and then the Cisco Hardware. Each chapter is updated and detailed for the newest exam and each chapter is complete. Providing the best breakdown of TCP/IP, addressing and sub netting Myhre once again shows why he has become a respected author on the subject matter. Myhre covers static and dynamic routing giving you an excellent look into both worlds without making the material dry.Also covered are access lists, WAN Technologies, Router hardware and 1900-switch breakdown. Excellent screenshots compliment and already great book. Included are labs to practice and questions to review the material covered in each chapter.The cd-rom has several utilities and router tools, however no practice test questions are included.

And he posted a review on the book?I have no doubt the author is a great instructor, however, the errors in this book may not be his fault at all. I understand mistakes will be made in printing, but there were mistakes in the PRACTICE TESTS ANSWERS! Mistakes IN the answers and then in spellings. There are many mistakes throughout the book that will hopefully be corrected when the next edition is published. I'm glad I understood some of these concepts before I read this book. Otherwise I'd be going into the CCNA Exam with the wrong knowledge. Again, I'm not taking digs at the author, but the book has too many mistakes printed in it in the wrong places! (un hem.....the practice test answers)Also, I was hoping the CD was going to be an interactive test prep software. I was WRONG! It's only a Network Management Program. Why would anyone want one of these when they are PREPARING for a CCNA exam. The book would have been worth the money if it was a test prep CD.Last thing, the Labs and Scenario's.....were we supposed to buy our own Routers to participate in these labs?

Elaine McEwan strips the candy coating off such methods as multiage classrooms, School-to-Work, whole language, and Every Day math and exposes them for what they are: viruses that are invading our schools and failing our children. This book not only helps parents identify the problems in their schools, it also gives great advice on how to work at making changes - from dealing with school board members that ignore the facts to listing dozens of websites where parents can get more information. Elaine cuts through the educational jargon used by school officials and writes in a way that is easily understood by all. I urge all parents to read this book - you will be enlightened and empowered by the experience!"},{"Title":"Angry Parents, Failing Schools","review":"As a parent who knew instinctively that something was amiss at my kids' public school, but didn't have the information handy at the time to help me name the problems, I highly recommend Angry Parents, Failing Schools by Elaine McEwan.This book, written by a teacher/principal/asst.superintendent, explains the progressive methodology which has led our schools into the tank via whole language, fuzzy math, inventive spelling, etc. She describes in &quot;real person&quot; language the federal education programs, the education establishment's mindset, and the philosophy behind the ill-conceived programs they are promoting.All parents should have this book to help them understand the current controversial educational landscape in America. Parents will discover the source of that vague uneasiness, or downright frustration so many of us experience each year that our children are in school. And because Angry Parents, Failing Schools was written by an educator, it is not only powerfully credible, but encourages positive action to help heal our public schools. This is a must read for all parents."},{"Title":"Angry Parents, Failing Schools","review":"INITIAL COMMENTS ON:&quot;ANGRY PARENTS, FAILING SCHOOLS&quot; by Elaine McEwanI have completed a first read of this book, and I think there is an excellent chance for it to become a &quot;best seller.&quot; Dr. McEwan does a great job of explaining many of the concerns voiced by parents in user-friendly language.Consider the chapter titles:&quot;Reality Check&quot; &quot;The Customer is Never Right?&quot; &quot;Where Did the Schools Go Wrong?&quot; &quot;The Reading Wars&quot; &quot;Is the 'New Math' Really Fuzzy&quot; &quot;Other Educational Viruses in Schools&quot; &quot;Fifty Plus Things You Can Do&quot;Those alone say a mouthful about the on-target character of this book.Some of the things I really liked:&quot;Tales from the Trenches&quot; are liberally salted throughout the book. These make the points more relevant to common members of the public.There is extensive identification of web sites. Many are good research sources.There is a great history of the development of Progressive Education, short and readable. &quot;Progressivism&quot; is nicely compared to traditional education, as well.The reading wars and the NCTM math deficiencies receive excellent coverage.There are sources for tests that parents can have individually administered to their children to get around the inadequacies of some current state testing programs.The book is directed at non-educators, and terms are very nicely explained in everyday language. A large percentage of the public can read this book and understand the problems with little, if any, extra help.There is an extensive listing of things parents and citizens can do to get active in the education discussions.And a whole lot more.This book is a wonderful reference source. The many subjects covered in &quot;Angry Parents, Failing Schools&quot; are well indexed. All are beautifully clear and accurate descriptions that can be easily understood and quoted.I strongly recommend this book. It should be liberally supplied to legislators, school board members, and anyone else you can think of."},{"Title":"Angry Parents, Failing Schools","review":"Our town could be the model for this book. The detrimental effects of whole language, creative spelling, and now &quot;fuzzy&quot; math (NCTM endorsed program) are causing parental concern and consternation. Parents are told they are uninformed and older curriculum will not teach your child the &quot;skills he needs for the 21st century&quot; and &quot;just trust us&quot; is the watchword of the day. Our superintendent forms Task Forces and Study Committees then packs them with teachers, administrators and PTO parents (who serve as his foot soldiers) to arrive at his predetermined solutions. No honest disagreement is allowed,dissenters are to be personally attached! All the while achievement test scores are falling! American Education grades K-12 is sinking like the Titanic, and sadly those educators trusted to guide the ship have crashed it headfirst into that iceberg. Our children are failing because our educators are more interested in &quot;Feelings&quot; and &quot;Fads&quot;, rather than educational excellence. Well documented scientific research is dismissed as mere opinion and parents with advanced scientific degrees &quot;just don't understand todays child centered learning&quot;. Every parent must read this book and take action to protect their children! Dr. McEwan strips away the phony veneer of progressive education and exposes the incompetence of todays educrats and curriculum."},{"Title":"Angry Parents, Failing Schools","review":"I've just finished reading the entire book and there is a lot of good information in it. The descriptions of the reading wars and fuzzy math are good. I've used the recommended reading list and the education web site list. I agree with a lot of the book, but there is a lot of hostile finger-pointing that's going in the wrong direction. If you're a parent and read the book, don't go immediately jumping on your child's teacher. Teachers have very little say in what or how they teach. This is a quote from Becoming a Nation of Readers:\\"Teachers generally have less leeway for personal initiative and decision-making than members of other professions. Depending upon the school, they are expected to adhere to policies decreed by administrative superiors, which they have had little or no voice in formulating.\\"In my district teachers' opinions don't count for much. We're told what methods to use in teaching whether we agree with them or not. If we don't use them, we get bad reviews by our superiors and could possibly lose our jobs. Don't think that parents are the only ones who have been 'met with suspicion and downright hostility when they've had the temerity to question the status quo.' I've been treated that way many times when I've questioned the teaching methods I'm told to use. I've been made to feel like a complete idiot when I didn't agree with the 'cooperative grouping' and 'discovery learning' techniques that have been pushed on us and, ultimately, I was told that I wasn't cut out for teaching and my job was threatened. I learned to keep my mouth shut. I don't talk to parents too often because what I have to say would get me fired and it's nothing about their children or about them. I can't, in good conscience, defend the methods we use. I'd have to tell them that what we're doing has been proven by research to be ineffective, but that we have no choice.On the other hand, this book seems to assume that all parental complaints and concerns are reasonable, informed and justifiable. I would welcome parents who did some 'homework' and attempted to get some policies changed. Unfortunately, we typically get demands for policy changes akin to a banking customer who has just written several hot checks demanding that the policy for charging overdraft fees be abolished.Consider a retail employee being berated for not accepting returns on clothes that have obviously been worn or for asking for identification before accepting a check. Consider a bank employee being accused of being a 'bad' employee for asking for identification when someone wanted to withdraw money from an account or for not cashing a check for someone who has no account at that bank. All too often, those are the kinds of complaints we get. I've been accused of being an 'ineffective' teacher when I had the audacity to tell parents that their child was weak in reading. The child entered 2nd grade and couldn't sound out 'r-i-p'. But the parents had the child removed from my classroom and put with a teacher who would just 'give' him good grades. By the time the child completed 2nd grade he was so behind that it's unlikely he'll ever catch up. The parents moved him to another school. I had another parent accuse me of being a bad teacher because her child was behind when he got to my class. She upbraided me, accused me of not being able to teach and finally put him in another school. That school tested him and put him back in first grade. They said he was too behind to even be in a second grade classroom - that the second grade teacher didn't have time to teach him first grade material. I've had a parent accuse me of being a 'bad' teacher because her child wasn't making good grades. The child paid very little attention during class (which I had contacted her about several times). The child was extremely weak in reading and needed tutoring, but she refused to even consider that. The child never did his homework so he fell even further behind (My homework assignments are to read for 30 minutes daily and to practice math facts with flash cards 10-15 minutes four days a week.) and she refused to look at his test folder and sign it each week. The only time she showed up at school was when report cards were issued. So, no, the customer is NOT always right.This quote comes from The Educated Child (a book that I recommend that EVERY parent of children in preschool through eighth grade read):\\"...no group is more frustrated with declining standards than teachers. Many are troubled by having to face classrooms in which significant numbers of children are not prepared at home to put forth their best efforts. They are frustrated at having to fight off administrators and parents who claim they want higher expectations, but whose first reaction when children don't meet them is: give these kids a break. \`What happens in reality is that when several students fail, the principal hears from their parents,' says one veteran Texas teacher. \`The students and their parents make wild claims about the unfairness of the teacher. Instead of supporting the teacher's high standards, the principal runs to the teacher and requires him to \`dumb down' his course. When teachers are not supported by administrators, there is no possible way for us to keep our standards high.'\\"Ms. McEwan fails to mention that some complaints are extremely unreasonable. Unfortunately, this is the kind of complaint we get about 98% of the time. Is it any wonder that we're on the defensive?If you're a parent and you have a reasonable, informed, and justifiable concern - please stick with it. A lot of teachers out there agree with you, but are unable to say so for fear of losing their jobs."},{"Title":"Angry Parents, Failing Schools","review":"As a concerned father of two boys, I found this book to be an extremely useful starting point for educating myself about the current state of American schools. McEwan does a wonderful job of wading through the educational jargon, identifying the major issues being debated today, and giving a brief history of the evolution of public schools in the US. The book is full of relevant anecdotes and is heavily footnoted.While McEwan makes no secret of her traditionalist views, her critical treatment of progressivism is abrupt and consequently shallow. My suspicion is that many of the progressivist ideas have merit, but incompetent implementation of those ideas has resulted in such prominent failures that the ideas themselves are condemned. McEwan simply fails to make this distinction.Overall, though, this was a great book that defied me to put it down."},{"Title":"Angry Parents, Failing Schools","review":"Most parents with children in public schools will tell you that they have heard all kinds of horror stories about other public schools around the country, and they are so relieved that their child's school is not doing any of that bad stuff! This is the enigma that Elaine McEwan effectively addresses in her book. How can this untested, ineffective education be happening all over and yet most parents do not realize that it is being practiced on their children as well? This book correctly indicates that the answer lies in the rhetoric that public school administrators use to placate concerned and caring parents. If one term or phrase is perceived by administrators as possibly upsetting parents, they will redefine parent-friendly words (such as high expectations, phonics, rigorous curriculum, critical thinking, real world problems) and use them to describe the progressive curriculum they are implementing. It is a clever and very effective way of silencing any parent who might be moved to voice concerns and to keep all other parents happy because they like the sound of the programs. As this book points out, it is not until a parent starts looking beneath the surface of the curriculum that the real substance of the program becomes apparent. I would recommend this book to be read by everybody with any connection to public education - parents, students, teachers, administrators and board members. Until we all recognize the truth about public schools, as Elaine McEwan (a former public school administrator) outlines in her book, there will be no resolution to the education debate. The resolution to this debate will only occur when the truth is clearly stated and parents are given the ability to choose the type of curriculum that will best educate their children. Thank you, Ms. McEwan, for writing the truth. By the way, many of these progressive reforms are alive and well in Wheaton!"},{"Title":"Angry Parents, Failing Schools","review":"Have the teachers and administrators at your kids' schoolexplained their teaching methods using phrases like&quot;developmentally appropriate&quot;, &quot;child-centered&quot;,&quot;individual learning styles&quot;, &quot;critical thinking skills&quot;, &quot;problem-solving approach&quot;,&quot;discovery learning&quot; and &quot;integrated holisitic curriculum&quot;?Have you ever walked away from the school thinking deep down that they seemed to be wasting a lot of time and effort on frivolous activities that have little in the way of clear learning objectives, but decided not to say anything because they seemed to know what they were doing?Well, they don't. Elaine McEwan makes this fact abundantly clear in this book. All the flowery education jargon aside, McEwan reveals that these &quot;progressive&quot; teaching methods are not just unproven -- they have been actually been shown by controlled, replicated experimental research to be LESS effective than the practices they replace.McEwan explains how the progressive movement in K-12 schooling, which accelerated in the 1990's with such &quot;reforms&quot; as &quot;Whole Language&quot;, &quot;Fuzzy Math&quot;, &quot;Goals 2000&quot; and &quot;School-to-Work&quot;, have brought public education in America to a point that it is no longer focused upon academic learning, but is increasingly concerned with instilling the proper attitudes, beliefs and values in the children it supposedly educates.Parents around the nation are indeed angry. The most vocal are those who have done their homework, looked into the research behind the teaching methods the schools have adopted and found that the schools are headed exactly in the wrong direction. McEwan does a good job of relating the frustrations of the parents who have approached the school to express their well-founded concerns, only to be met by a patronizing arrogance borne of the knowledge that the parents really have very little influence over school curriculum and instruction policy.She describes the awakening of the many parents she interviewed, who after months and years of observation and research have come to realize that the schools have been hijacked by an education establishment that use them to forward their own liberal social agenda through politically-centered and value-laden &quot;curricula&quot; such as multilturalism, environmentalism and health (read: sex)education.McEwan taps into this growing vien of discontent, and provides numerous specific examples of the obstacles parents have encountered when they ask questions of their school officials or try to bring about changes.&quot;Angry Parents&quot; helps people make sense of the opaque jargon school officials use to give their failed methods an aura of professionalism. It's indespensible reading for anyone who has a nagging fear that their child's school is on the wrong track, but have been quiet about their concerns because of an innate trust in the institution of public schooling.McEwan shows that this trust is misplaced, a conclusion that she, as a public school educator, came to only after a period of soul-searching and honest, objective study that we can only wish was more common among our public school officials."},{"Title":"Angry Parents, Failing Schools","review":"I am a Ph.D. student in mathematics and a mother of three children.

In a fever to \\"reform\\" our schools for \\"21st century\\" \\"higher-order thinking skills\\", educational bureaucrats have reduced the amount of substantive content in curricula and replaced it with touchy-feelie psychobabble encouraging feelings, writing about problems instead of solving them, and meaningless goals. McEwan, an award-winning school principal takes the educrats to task. Warning: the subject is not inner-city schools; it may very well include the school YOUR kids attend. Yes, YOUR kids!I found McEwan's book invaluable simply because it is up-to-date and focused on everyday schools that we might suppose would be less influenced by wacko theories.I'd heartily recommend this book to parents, school board members, newspaper editors and others who are concerned about quality in supposedly \\"good\\" school districts.There are some great books that are more detailed and technical (Hirsch, Ravitch) and some that are passionate (Sykes), but THIS is the book to recommend to parents who want to quickly understand the odd practices going on in their own children's school."},{"Title":"Angry Parents, Failing Schools","review":"Review of the book: &quot;Angry Parents, Failing Schools&quot;, written by Elaine K. McEwan.The writing is a dream of easy to understand sentences, paragraphs, and chapters. Considering that it is about 'today's redefined educational establishment', I am amazed. She has made the edubabble understandable. That alone is something to be proud of.My favorite aspect of this book is the way she ends each section with a question like; &quot;Did you just write a whopping check to a tutor or a learning center? It's time to find out why.&quot;It is this aspect, the ability to make the reader think about a specific question - and there are enough in this book to relate to every type of person, from every type of background - I believe will have the most impact on any reader that is just discovering what is taking place in their child's school.This book is what you give to yourself and your 'neighbor' that has no idea of educational jargon, the redefining of terminology, or the reasons 'Why', parents are so angry and schools are failing to teach academics or the 3 R's.Unfortunately most will not like the 'content' of this book as it is in direct opposition of what your schools are telling you. Never-the-less if you wish to understand why America now has over 90 million functional illiterate ADULTS, and why today's students cannot read and understand their own textbooks or do mental math, then this book is a must read.If you have not yet order your copy then get too it! This is a must for every parent, teacher, administrator, legislator, and business owner that is wondering about today's &quot;Restructured Educational Mandates&quot; coming down from Washington.Don't you deserve to know WHY your children are FAILING academics, yet your taxes have increased and will continue to increase at astronomical rates to finalize the implementation of educational restructuring from academic-based 'knowledge' to job training 'performance'?Sincerely yours, C.A. Carroll Woodbourne, New York"},{"Title":"Angry Parents, Failing Schools","review":"The book helped me understand where these &quot;angry parents&quot; are coming from. If my district were full of all the wrongs listed in this book, I'd be angry too. Remember, however, that there are far more satisfied parents out there than &quot;angry&quot; ones.My belief that our district is doing the right things and on the right path was reinforced.I am fairly certain that most schools throughout the country have elements of the good and bad running through them. What this book does via it's title and subliminal inferences is imply that the bad is more common than the good. This reinforces the idea that American education is failing us.....nothing could be further from the truth.Parents should not read this and go out and storm the Board meetings. They should thoughtfully evaluate their schools and work within the system to make it even better.There is far more good happening in our schools than this book would have you believe."},{"Title":"Angry Parents, Failing Schools","review":"I haven't read the entire book but the words digested so far are true. However, fingers are being pointed at individuals who don't deserve it: teachers. I have been in the education field for 11 years, teaching for the last four. I have taught in middle-upper level socioeconomic neighborhoods with a racially mixed student base (though primarily caucasion). I have taught in a very low socioeconomic neighborhood where segregation is the only choice (primarily black). My degree in is in Exceptional Student Education with certification in Elementary Education and English Speakers of Other Languages. My teaching experiences lie in the elementary setting and include second grade, third grade, K-5 writing and 1-5 Educably Mentally Handicapped. I'm writing this to let you know of my credentials. However, let me get on to my opinion of the book.Recently my niece began 6th grade at a private school. She received about 7 different workbooks in addition to 2-3 hardback textbooks. I compared that curriculum to the curriculum used in the same district (Palm Beach, Florida) but at public schools. I agree that education has changed from &quot;hard-core stick-to-the-objective&quot; method to whole language, cooperative learning and higher order thinking skills. However, it isn't always the teachers' desire to do this. It often isn't the principal's or even the superintedent's fault. It lies with each state's and the Federal Boards of Education.Florida gives &quot;bad&quot; schools the title &quot;critically low.&quot; These are derived from test scores. Last year I worked at one of the &quot;critical schools.&quot; Our former commissioner of education, Frank Brogan, felt those schools weren't doing their job and sent in the troops. One such person ($$$$$$$$) was Dr. Bill Blokker (I hope his name is spelled correctly). Everyone at these schools was under alot of stress. Ironically, all the &quot;critical&quot; schools were in the welfare, low/no income areas with high discipline problems. That creates more stress. Schools often do things in ways that they don't want to in order to please the higher-ups. Add to that the unwillingness for parents to comprehend what goes on in classrooms. Unlike a manager in a fast-food chain, we can't hire and fire who we want, we don't have much say in how our franchise is run and we don't get paid to put up with the mental abuse which comes with working in various geographic areas (not necessarily secondary schools). Imagine running this franchise without napkins, catsup, hamburger, ice or cups. Better yet, imagine having to purchase all these items with your own, &quot;slap-in-the-face&quot; salary. For 9-10 different subjects, I have ONE textbook (I teach 2nd grade) and TWO workbooks which can be written in (all others must be copied). (Each child has their own, thank goodness.) Hey, I don't even have a &quot;workable&quot; curriculum for the areas of Science, Health or Social Studies (I do have a lasar disc and material which can be copied but takes 3 hours to plan one week's lesson). Add into that the potential for unfair administration, conflicting messages for methods of teaching (one day practice sheets are OK, the next day they are forbidden) and, of course, increased class size with lack of assistance.I do agree with the philosophies in this book but blaming the schools and those working in them isn't right. We only do what we are told to do with the information we are given. I love teaching. If I didn't, I wouldn't have taken the time to write what I did. We need to get back to the basics but that will take parents doing something major. It will also take more than writing a best-selling book. If you have anything to respond to, please write me. I only want the best for our children, but as the old saying goes, it takes a village."},{"Title":"Dolores: Seven Stories About Her","review":"\\"'New girl?' asked Mary in her minimalist way, displaying absolutely no interest; Dolores had detected a mean and iron spirit beneath her falsely charming demand for fealty from the other girls.

A day after reading it I'm already missing her!

The most poignant scenes in the book are those in which Jimmy is there, time and again, to guard her from harm, to converse with her at the crack of dawn, or to smile and wave at her from up in the bleachers.\\"They heard the sound of things being scraped onto plates.

In &quot;The Chamber&quot; I feel that Grisham has masterfully accomplished all three. Everytime I read a Grisham novel I am informed about some aspect of the legal system that I was not aware of before reading his book. In this book it was the legal and political maneuvering that occurs in death penalty cases. As a novel, I chose to read it for its entertainment value yet in this case, as I read the book, something truly unexpected occured. Up until the this time I was a staunch supporter of the death penalty for crimes of premeditated murder. Even after seeing, &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; I still felt the death penalty had merit. After reading &quot;The Chamber&quot; I could not support the death penalty with the same conviction I did before.

Not this one. I couldn't shake the images of Death Row even when Adam was out in Memphis visiting his aunt. The book ended just like I thought it would, and I felt Sam deserved to die. Nothing in the book led me to believe he was deserving of a pardon or redemption. If John was trying to get us to think about capital punishment, he failed as far as I'm concerned.

I'm sure this is not the best Grisham's book, it can be a little be &quot;slowly&quot; because you won't find so much &quot;action&quot; as you can find it in other grisham's writtings (for example in the runaway jury), but what I really like about this book is the fact, that it makes me get a second thought about the death penalty.

This is the first to ever warrant a comment. This book touched me in a way I have never been touched before. Mr. Grisaham's ability to put the reader in a frame of mind to where that reader feels he is actually there is remarkable. Not only did I learn from this book, I also cried. Somehting that has never happened from the 100's of books I have read before. The story was sincere, could have easily have really happened, and made me feel like I was in the chamber with Mr. Cayhall as we went down it. I will not be able to get this book out of my mind as it is such a reality to many who are in prison. This is what happens and this is what these people feel. This was the first Grisham book I have read but it certainly will not be the last."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I was not sure what to expect before I read this novel.

Sam, knowing that he did was wrong, welcomes the gas chamber and Adam cannot understand this until the end. This is the first Grisham novel in which I liked the ending, usually they are too strange. Many lives were changed by the end of the story and the fact that Adam wants to continue to fight for what he believes in was really cool."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"John Grisham, as usual was phenomonal in his research. This book showed humanity and the unneccesary loss of life that comes with the death penalty. He carefully avoided the direct conflict of whether the lead charecter, Sam Cayhall, should die and for it came out triumphant. He proved that the death penalty has it's limits, but for those of you who are staunch death penalty supporters, Grisham does not choose sides. He carefully wields what happens on Death Row. This is a critical situation EVERYONE needs to understand before they should pass judgement on the death penalty. And to understand death row, there is no better way than by either seeing or reading The Chamber.It is a triumph no matter what others say. Grisham does not pass judgement and in the end, the lead charecter almost seems to deserve death just as much as he deserved life. And today, there are so many others on the row like him. So deserving of life, and yet so deserving of death."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Grisham writes with knowledge and sensitivity which forces the reader to look beyond the death penalty and the heinous crimes that inspire it. The reader is given insight into the experiences of the criminal before and after the sentencing, and the part the slow-moving the American justice system plays in allowing years to pass before the sentence is carried out. Grisham writes clean prose which feels almost autobiographical. The beginning of the novel distances the reader from the crime because of its documentary style, but once hooked, I challenge the reader to forget Grisham's profound message about the role of our legal system and its ultimate failure to provide justice in many capital crimes."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Grisham uses a good blend of characters to keep this story interesting. By using a hated white supremist on death row he directs his readers to look more at the death penilty as fouled then to feel sympathy for Sam Cayhall.

You tend to develop a real sense of hate towards him.However, the only reason I give this book 1 star (other than the fact that this site won't let me give less) is the fact that at the end, justice is served in that Sam Cayhall is put to death.I kept waiting for some twist in the plot, or some dark secrets to come out, but they never did.

He is then joined by pro-bono lawyers (that is, paid by the public), headed by a $400,000 a year attorney (plus all expenses). The team uses every dirty trick and perjured testimony to tie up the system and delay the execution.

The characters are extremely well developed and you find yourself being swept up in an emotional journey as the plot unfolds. This is not a fast-moving action novel, it doesn't have Hollywood-style twists, and it's not a high-octane thriller. But it's not supposed to be.

I found \\"The Chamber\\" to be very enjoyable and it made me concious of some arguments against the death penalty. The absolute boredom of those on death row awaiting the appeals after they have been sentenced to death is brought out by the book. Whether or not the gas chamber is humane is argued. I am a strong advocate of the death penalty but the book softened some of my beliefs; however, it did not change my mind. I thought the ending was good although I expected it to be the opposite of what it was. Grisham kept my interest to the end."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber is a very well crafted story.

As he tries to have his \\"client\\" freed from death row, a man from his clients past resurfaces to keep him from finding out the truth.

It does however require a lot of patience, as it is well over 500 pages long."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This was the first John Grisham I ever read - it was everything I expected, and more. Like in his other works, he uses the 'thriller' genre brilliantly to make us ask questions of ourselves, making us question those beliefs we've always held closest to our hearts. There have been many works of fiction that have dealt with the question of Capital Punishment, many of them often trivializing the whole issue with sentimentality and Hollywoodish emotions - in one sentence, this one doesn't.But what strikes you most about this book is the astonishing realism and the complex plotting. The characters manage not be caricatures - each one of them manages to achieve flesh-and-blood status and never descend into the ludicruous. A very good read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"(...)After getting(...) into the book, I found myself pitying him when I learned what he was going through. I still hated him and considered him a miserable human being, but I didn't think he deserved to die like that. To do something like this with your writing requires incredible talent, something that I believe John Grisham has. Any other author might try to make you feel compassion for an awful and racist person and it certainly wouldn't work, it would probably annoy you. I found this was certainly not true with The Chamber. I have never agreed with the Death Penalty, but that was probably jsut because I grew up in a house were people would tell me that it was wrong. Never really knowing why it was really wrong I just accepted that that was the way things were. I now really understand what's so bad about it."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I had a very difficult time deciding which John Grisham book was my favorite. It was between \\"The Street Lawyer\\" and \\"The Chamber\\". \\"And the winner is-envelope please-'The Chamber'!!\\". I'll make this short and sweet-tremendous plotting, fantastic writing, and tremendously memorable characters. If you only read one John Grisham book, make it \\"The Chamber\\". I'd give this more than five stars if I could."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"John Grisham has written many captivating novels, including The Chamber. This novel is tells of a young lawyer's fight to save his grandfather's life. Adam Hall, a rookie from Chicago, takes on the case of Sam Cayhall, a former member of the KKK who has been wrongly convicted of a bombing and sentenced to the death penalty. (...) While this is not one of John Grisham's best novels, it is well-worth reading."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Very riveting story, after reading first 5 chapters I thought stor is over. Author's way of stretching a simple plot with good dialogues makes it interesting. At times, story does seem to be dragging. Researching the death row, and its gruesome details ... The end was a bit unpredictable. I thought it will be different. That is the power of imagination. I am not sure how many people in US are against death penalty now, but the story revolves around pre civil war era type USA, and its transition to a modern age 1990s."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Excellent read, kept me interested right to the end. Would recommend this to everyone. Well written and easy to follow"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This novel is a family story about Mississippi in the late 1960s, civil rights, and the Klan, and examines all the possible pleas for clemency from a death penalty. It includes a graphic description of death row and the life of the inmates, and examines the arguments for and against the death penalty. Those who study law or want to know about possible legal alternatives may pick up a few ideas. The movie with Gene Hackman does not give the detailed procedures of law, just focuses on the story line. It is interesting to consider what customs have changed since that time and what mind-sets continue the same."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I love John Grisham, but the story didn't have a conclusion I cared for. His later writings seem more crisp."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This book was not enjoyable. It's not only hundreds of pages of soap box (i don't mind that as long as said box is entertaining) but the characters are lacking any sort of appealing personality trait. The atty, Adam, is dullsville, the aunt is the most annoying creature ever (except for Mrs. Norris), and Sam is...well kinda interesting. This book is just long and dull and in no way invigorating. Grish has too many great books for a reader to plow through this one."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"It was a page turner, and written the expert John Grisham style. You never know how it's going to end until the very end. I don't always like how they end, but they're indicative of real life. I can't stop reading his books, and I hope Kindle adds more to its list."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"John Grisham totally engages me, at least when he's writing his legal thrillers. Although several of his books end anti-climactically with just hopping on a plane to the Caribbean, this one does not let you down in any way, shape or form. I think this is a fabulous book, whether you approve of the death penalty or not, this book will make you think about it and analyze the process and the players. Is it right that this despicable man is sentenced to death, even though he didn't do what he was convicted of? Perhaps not, yet he deserves to be there for crimes he was never caught or convicted on. Is he a thoroughly amoral man? Yes, except he won't rat out his compatriots, even to save himself, even though they are nowhere near that loyal to him. Those sorts of contradictions run throughout this book and, like I said, make you think without preaching or trying to bring you to either side."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"One of the appeals I find with John Grisham books is that he can take a subject - insurance company rip-offs in the Rainmaker, dodgy lawyers overcharging in The Firm (although we actually get to feel sorry for them with the Mafia-trap connection) - and give us a great insight into these issues without it ever seeming heavy.A difficult line to walk, but in this case I think Grisham overstepped it. The book at times became heavy to read and, combined with the fact that old Sam Cayhill is a somewhat remote, unredeeming character, made this tough going at times. It could have been 100 pages shorter and lost nothing; indeed, would have probably been stronger with such editing.Possibly too the central, reveal connection between the lawyer and the inmate took some time to come out, so that also gave it a laboured feeling. I kept saying to myself - for God's sake tell him so we can get the show on the road. When that connection is finally made, the book leaps both in its heart and pace and becomes the trademark Grisham we've all come to know and love."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This was a very disturbing but thought provoking novel. The plot is pretty much hashed over and over in other reviews, so I will not go there. I finished the book last night and I am still depressed. But I still gave it 5 stars, why? The message to me was how the fingers of hatred and bias affect not only the initial victims, but the abusers themselves and their families no matter how far removed. We see pretty plainly how family bigotry is planted in children and allowed to grow. We have to ask ourselves \\"if I were born then and there, would I be the same as Sam? \\"What a terrible thought! This is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I found this book compelling, mesmerizing and a strong plea for repeal of the death penalty in the United States. The character, Adam, grandson lawyer of the defendant, is one of the strongest characters I have ever encountered in the redemption of what at first appears to be the unredeemable murderer of two children and their father. How many on Death Row have been exterminated by the unrelenting letter of the law who were not guilty, victims of their milieu or were manipulated by the real culprit. A well-told parable of good and evil in us all."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"In The Chamber, we meet Sam Cayhall, initially a less than likable participant in a hateful Ku Klux Klan bombing who finally is convicted after three trials and sentenced to a painful death in the Mississippi gas chamber. However, by the time he is sentenced to die, 22 years after his crime, he is a frail, 70-year-old man. He has spent almost 10 years on Death Row and has become a jailhouse law expert, helping his fellow inmates with their various and futile appeals. Sam's rookie lawyer grandson, Adam Hall, emerges fresh out of law school to champion Sam's gangplank appeals for a stay of execution. Adam has to come to terms with a lot of family issues in the process, especially because he cannot understand his grandfather's motivations for his hateful crimes. Sam gains our pity and even sympathy in the final chapters of this book, as he experiences a spiritual redemption. He harbors a secret which, if divulged, could hurt those closest to him. I will not spoil the ending for those of you who have not read The Chamber. All I will say was that this book draws the reader right into the legal suspense of the courtroom and the tragic atmosphere of Death Row. And, although this book seems to be a plea to abolish the death penalty, Grisham never attempts to justify the horror of the crime described in its initial pages. Read this book -- it is controversial, and maybe you will cry."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This is Grisham's worst work. What should have been a short story, rambles on for hundreds of pages. Anyone who reads The Chamber will receive a tremendous education about the intricacies of cigarette smoke. If that thrills you, by all means waste a few hours with this text. If not, read something less laborious, like the dictionary."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Unbelievable to me that others rate this work so highly. Weak characterization, linear plot with no twists or turns, and writing that is surprisingly juvenile. The first Grisham book I'd read; I expected far better."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The story is about a racist, who was involved in a murder, of two children, and disfiguring their father. He is being sentence to death via the gas chamber for this murder, that he only helped, but did not fully commit (Although he had committed many other crimes in the past)As one writer said the first half of this book is about this terrible racist man who deserves to die. The second half on the book was about the same man, but he is now portrayed as a guy with a heart, and was truly sorry, and thru the true story you learn that he didn't wish for anyone to die, just a different kinda crime to be committed.I wasn't able to finish this book, because the plot became very predictable, and the facts about what happens when someone suffers at the hands of the chamber became too much for me."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Of the five Grisham novels I've read thus far, this is by far the worst. I'm puzzled to see so many found this book 'thrilling', as I thought it was extremely predictable. I found none of the characters to be likeable. The book contains several sub-plots which either add nothing substantial to the novel, or even more annoying simply vanish without a trace. This book will probably be satisfying to only the most die-hard of Grisham fans."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Boy was this book slow reading...I got about one third of the way through it and stopped. I found the character development shallow and the plot weak. JG can do better than this!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This is the book by Grisham that I enjoyed reading the most. It has all the elements to make it a great read: the lawyer who tries to save his grandfather from an atrocious death, the family wishing to see the killer of their sons finally put to death, and the people involved, wishing to use this case for political advancement. Great book and great plot."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I thought that the tis must be the worst book Grisham has written. I have read every one of his books and I usually enjoy them a lot, but this one was even hard to finish."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The one and only time that I could not finish a Grisham novel. I loved The Firm, and the Pelican Brief, and all of his other novels to date, but found this book completely pointless. The story was uninteresting, and the characters pathetic. I hope that this was a once in a career bomb."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Fantastic insight into Death Row and The Chamber. And all the personalities, from prisoner, to family, to staff, to legal eagles. Great!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"At first, I thought the title referred to a judge's chambers, but this is actually a book about the gas chamber. It took me a litttle while, but after the halfway point I was really connected with the characters and involved with the book. Grisham manages to make the reader just as torn as the other characters about whether Sam deserves to/should die in the gas chamber for his crimes. I got totally immersed in the book, and spent a lot of time contemplating the death penalty in general. This is a masterful story and a good book for anyone who wants to look at the grey areas of the law and what is right and wrong."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"While reading The Chamber i cried many times. Sometimes this book will make you smile, other times it will make you cry, and other times it will make you cry out in anger. Sam Cayhall is on deathrow because in the sixties he was in the KKK and bombed a jewish lawyer's building. But something went wrong when he bombed the building;instead of it going off at 5 in the morning when it was vacant, it went off at 8. Unfortunately, it the lawyer's two five-year old sons were in the building and the bomb killed them. Now, his only chance is his 26-year old grandson lawyer who will try everything to help him, and to keep him from getting gassed in the Gas Chamber.Before reading this book, I was stongly opposed to the death row, but after reading it, well, it makes you think about that. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"For a former lawyer who has never witnessed a death row case, John Grisham's ability to portray such a case was impeccable. John Grisham tells the story of an ex-KKK member who is on death row for the murder of two young boys, and his defense attorney is his estranged grandson. Grisham was able to capture all the emotion and reality of an inmate's life on death row, and the lives of the inmate's family, as though death row cases were part of his daily routine. The Chamber is a complex novel about a controversial and painful topic to which almost every person has an opinion. During Grisham's time as an attorney he represented people accused of a variety of crimes, but never a capital murder case. John Grisham used the expertise of lawyers and members of the judicial system to learn about all aspects of a death row inmate's life and their cases. The Chamber is intended for an adult audience who has an interest in the controversial topic of the death penalty that causes them to reflect upon personal views and beliefs.The Chamber is a compelling story of a family's deep, dark secrets that have been hidden from everyone, including each other... The book captures the reader's attention during the first chapter..."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"At first glance, one might assume that this book's title refers to a judge's chamber and that this will be another one of Grisham's thrill-a-minute page turners like his other books. This well-researched, movingly-detailed story is difficult to put down, but not for the same reason as his other novels. Instead, it closely resembles the author's first book,&quot;A Time to Kill&quot;, an intense courtroom novel examining the politics of Mississippi justice.The chamber in the title is the death chamber, where Sam Cayhall, a nine-year resident of death row, is slated to be killed with cyanide gas in a few weeks. Cayhall, a frail and elderly man, was a Ku Klux Klan bomber convicted in 1981 of bombing the office of a Jewish civil-rights lawyer in Mississippi in 1967. This explosion killed the lawyer's two young sons and badly maimed their father. Cayhall was freed after mistrials in 1967 and 1968; for the next 12 years, Sam led a normal life until an aggressive new district attorney reopened the case.The novel's main action begins a month before Cayhall's scheduled execution. Adam Hall, a first-year lawyer in a large, prestigious Chicago firm which formerly represented Cayhall on a pro-bono basis, asks to represent Sam in an effort to get a stay of execution. Adam's secret weapon in the effort to have Sam agree to his representation is that he is Cayhall's long-lost grandson. Although Adam wants to help his grandfather, he must deal with his guilt for wanting to help someone whose beliefs he detests.When Sam agrees to Adam's representation, a race against the clock begins. Grisham presents a picture of the controlled but frantic coordination necessary during the appeals process. It is literally a legal juggling act requiring split-second timing.This book reads like non-fiction, with details about how the gas chamber actually works and what happens when it doesn't work perfectly. While it was not Grisham's intent to have &quot;The Chamber&quot; alter anyone's opinion of the death penalty, it will certainly cause many readers to re-examine their position."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I feel so sad when reading some of the reviews. One of the most recent ones even commented the book is horrible. It really disheartens me to see that many of the reasons given are usually saying the story is not nteresting, no plots ....etc.I really would like to say something for the book. I agree that The Chamber is not John Grisham's best book. When you compare it to fast-paced stories like The Firm or Pelican Brief, of course, you would not find the same style. Interesting plots and page-turner for sure will attract most readers, but I actually love this book.May be it's true that it lacks the twists of many other books, but I believe Mr.Grisham wants to show us something different in this book. It tells us not all the lawsuits or related cases are interesting and make your heart rate fastened. Some of them may not be as interesting, but they are very real cases. Instead of victory all the times (which I believe most of the readers want), we can see the desperation in this book: when you try all your best but still cannot create a miracle because life is life.We see the main character, Adam Hall, his desperation, his struggles, his frustrations. It is a great character. My heart follows Adam's when the story goes. Despite the missing excitement, yet I find myself totally involved in the sentiments of the story. The end of the story is so sad that I find my tears running down. I respect Adam's final decision and deep down in my heart, I wish I can be his very best friend, sharing his sorrows.One final word, I have to say that if you are too keen on the style applied in books like The Firm, this one might disappoint you, but why not try something different and use your heart to read the book instead of your mind.(Also recommend: The Rainmaker, which resemebles the simplicity of this book)"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This was the first Grisham book that I've read, and I have some mixed reviews about it. While the plot and the story line are interesting and really makes you want to find out what happens next, the way the author presents the story, I feel, is a bit lacking. His writing style is plain and strictly to the point, and I personally enjoy reading novels that tend to be more emotional, elaborate, and powerful in the usage of language. Grisham presents the story, I guess, as a lawyer would, getting right down to the meat of the matter, but I feel he could make it just a bit more enjoyable to read. Also, it feels as if the story could be condensed into a somewhat shorter book; some of the material does seem a bit superfluous. I guess overall, his books are for the story (The plot of The Chamber is actually pretty good) which make for good movies, but if you want to really enjoy a book for it's artistic and literary merit, I'd suggest trying a different author."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I was well aware of the popularity of Grisham before reading anything by him, and was quite surprised that such a 'bestseller' didn't fall into a formula plot. Admittedly he was well established before publishing this one - maybe the others are more conventionally pleasing?There are hints of thriller, and (in my mind) pretty much the assumption of a dramatic courtroom climax, but while either would have fitted easily with the content of the book, Grisham rejects them both.Rather the novel centres entirely on the anatomy of the final days before an execution. There's actually very little action to speak of, but a lot of dialogue, and reams of detailed narration of physical and judicial institutions. Rather than the pieces of the crime gradually being revealed, with a savage and vital twist forcing the pace, the opening chapters of the book simply relate precisely what happened in a neutral tone, revealing to three decimal places the exact degree of guilt of the defendant. So instead of the standard adrenaline ride of tracking down the 'real' guilty parties while dodging bullets and falling in love, we already know most of the salient details in the first few chapters.What takes the book beyond being little more than a dramatised documentary is the personal/family aspect of our young hotshot lawyer (Adam) actually getting to know his ex-KKK grandfather (Sam) while representing him. How did some of these awful things go on in his family? How does the perpetrator feel about them now? Characters appear and recede only as far as they relate to the final days on this death row case. Several seemingly central characters turn out to be red herrings - or, at least, they would if this was a whodunit. However as a detailed narration of a few weeks it feels more authentic to have them come and go as the lawyer tries and then dismisses various tangents in the so called 'gangplank' appeals.While at times he does push his luck with the amount of words devoted to relating precise architecture and procedures on death row, the documentary aspect generally enhances the book. I find it a real asset when the author painlessly incorporates information about something the they're an expert on and/or have researched thoroughly (cf. philosophy/literature in just about any David Lodge, rigging in Levi's 'The Wrench').There is some suspense - this is a life and death situation revolving around appeals that will be judged - but a strength of the book is that it doesn't rely on the dramatic final judgement to make it worth reading.The major weakness, however, is its attempt to convince us of the invalidity of the death penalty. It is utterly transparent that key characters that oppose it are the salt of the earth, but anyone in favour has some basic character flaw (such as the slimy two-faced politician, or the martinet prison guard - blimey, what original characterisations), or is an embittered victim unable to be objective. This is a particular shame because there are a surprisingly large number of positive characters that aren't mere throwaways. Moreover the essential way the reader is supposed to be convinced of the moral corruptness of the bad guys is that the heroic ones don't like them - rather than what they actually say and do. Grisham even tries to reverse this - the reader, for example, is supposed to wryly laugh along with the clever tactic of the good-guys to commit wholesale fraud by inundating the governor's phones with impersonated constituents opposing to the death penalty; this strategy is no better than someone stealing ballot boxes, for example, but we're meant to swallow and even enjoy it, with a vague justification that the end justifies the means.But while some of his self-conscious methods of arguing against execution fail, it's a real irony that the actual resolution of the book is ingenuously a strong argument in favour of death row. It's the salvation of the fallen criminal. What Grisham doesn't seem to realise is that he constantly feeds Sam lines that endorse the redemptive effect of knowing that he's going to die soon. Because of the imminence of death Sam says he 'values life' more than he used to - which enables him to realise the wrongness of violent acts he'd previously felt no remorse for. With the clock ticking Sam writes genuine letters of apology to all his victims which would never have happened without such a threat. Indeed he repents in a staggering straight from a gospel tract scene, opening up to the priest because, in light of the chamber, he wants to make his peace. (This conversion, by the way, while doctrinally sound, is soon clarified as a classic nominal middle American one as Sam says to Adam:I look at you- you're tolerant and broad-minded, well-educated, ambitious, going places - and I ask myself, Why didn't I become ... something like you.'That being said, while Grisham can't help but tack some worldly success onto the inimical teaching of Christ, his presentation of the evangelical priest is startlingly positive, and there are some 'money's not worth integrity' intimations here and there).To convince his audience that it was wrong to send an utterly unrepentant killer - who'd do the same again without remorse given half a chance - to the chair would have been a difficult task. Alternatively Grisham has the intelligence not to present an innocent character wrongfully going to the gas chamber as his argument against execution: that's merely against poor judicial processes. Instead he tries the middle ground of presenting a guilty but redeemed figure. But when the catalyst - or even cause - of that enlightenment is the chamber itself, the moral to this tale is hardly one opposing it."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Grisham, in his usual fasion. has woven together a story that, although predictable, is emotionally drenching and entertaining. It is true that all of Grisham's main characters are essentially the same person ( I've read all his works ) and that his plots are somewhat similar, although I really don't see this as a negative. His subtle humor and clever cynicism make Grisham enjoyable almost regardless of the plot. In this story, there is no need to feel sorry for Sam to like the book. I like the death penalty and despise people like Sam Cayhall and believe that death is too good for them, and I don't think that Grisham necessarily defends Sam in the book either. Regardless of your feelings on the death penalty, the book is an emotional thriller, and Grisham's portrayal of Nungent and his gang as morons merely increases his ability to work humor into the book, rather than turning the book into a political forum. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially for people who have read Grisham and appreciate his humor."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber, by John Grisham, is an emotional \\"court room\\" thriller that will bring you back to reality in a drastic way. Sam Cayhall has been hit with the most crushing news of his life,... the verdict of death. In 1967, Sam Cayhall, then a member of the Ku Klux Klan, bombed a Jewish lawyer's office. The owner's twin boys, Josh and John, were inside at the time that the bomb went off and were blown to bits. Nine years later, after Sam's third and final trial (last trial was in 1981) his grandson, Adam Hall, decides to represent him. This emotional smack in the face will give you a whole new outlook on life. Although this message is hidden deep in the story, it is definitely there. This novel will open your eyes and show you that everyone has two sides.Everyone has a little bit of an angel, and a little bit of devil in their characters. Sometimes we look past that, but this novel brings you back to the true harshness of reality. It also shows that all people have secrets, and that we are all a little bit ashamed of our own identities. We may think that we know everything about our family, and ourselves, but we might not. At the age of seventeen, the main character, Adam Hall, discovered a shocking secret about his past. This secret changes Adam's point of view, and his fate. His dreams and goals change in one night of grieving and sharing with his Aunt Lee. All in all, The Chamber is a novel with an intense and moving heart, that everyone can relate to in some way or another."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"A friend of mine lent this to me saying it's the best book he's ever read. I can see why some people would think this.After just finishing The Chamber my first thoughts are that it was compulsive read but also that the ending left me feeling a little flat. It was fast paced, and at times moving (re the lynching photo and Halls thoughts about it). You're left feeling how awful it is to spend years on death row but...the alternatives are never gone into in depth-there is only so much one can do with this I suppose, especially if the authors trying to entertain as well as enlighten. It reminded me of Dead Man Walking where it took the murderers pending death, moments away, for him to be truly repentant. Like that movie The Chamber inspires sympathy and forgiveness for the main characters and shows that people can change. I got a little disinterested in all the legal procedures and ended up trying to flip through these paragraphs to concentrate on the plot and emotion. There were some loose ends but you can't often squeeze life into a perfect little package.I was very happy with the lack of romantic interest to slow the pace down (Grisham uses an alcoholic Aunt for this) at key moments. And happy that I didn't feel preached to by the author. Even now I'm not sure how strongly, if at all, Grisham is anti execution. He certainly didn't hold back on Cayhalls crimes.All in all a very good book. Very different to my normal fare and one I would strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This is really a remarkable story -- rather a dark look at death row and capital punishment without being preachy (obviously Grisham's a liberal; all his books tout this, but one can overlook it here).It's not really the expected plot-driven fluff. It's a very moving and mature drama, full of details of life on death row which, though perhaps fictionalized, give one a glimpse of an experience quite beyond the norm. I didn't think Grisham could pull off something this good."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I have read this and the Rainmaker. Which was better? Take a guess. The Chamber had a good start, and I liked the characters because they all had good personalities and were outstandinly believable. However, I found it a tad boring, and was dragging on. I am a very avid reader, even at fourteen, and quite frankly I did not enojoy this book as much as I thought I would. Perhaps my expectations were too large (?). Eventhough not my style, I would recommend it to people who enjoy learning about death row and the likes. I personally found it inspiring for my own novel."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This book was very interesting. It was captive"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber has to be John Grisham's best book. It is thought provoking and full of moral and arguments that make sense. The story progresses smoothly as well. To add to that, The Chamber is proof that John Grisham can induce sadness. The book raises many controiversial points against the death penalty and I think that the addition of these comments render the book infinitely substantial. There is also an argument on racism which is to be considered. The book is a rare breede book that makes you think and cry, the book that demands attention, the book that makes you hate the death penalty. Read the book, you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber was only the third book I had read by John Grisham, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It made me start looking for more titles by him. I liked the fact that the lawyer in the story was a grandson of the deathrow convict and it showed a personal side of the convict, as well as the procedures leading up to the final hours. The book made me feel like I was right there with the characters, feeling the heat, hearing the sounds, and more!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Ok, maybe you will find the story and plot are different from his other books. The book IS really different and I love it! Grisham presents us a dynamic human drama as he depicts the relationship between a man who is sentenced to death and his grandson. I understand some people might find the story boring, but that is because they try to put his books into one category--trial and victory. If you read the book from a different angle, you will fully enjoy the story. It is quite surprising for me to find Grisham is a writer who is able to explore human mentality."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Very enjoyable, however not as good as some others but I'm a loyal Grisham fan. The book is definitely better than the movie."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Grisham writes a wonderful book!!! This book caught my attention and kept me reading! That is hard to thing to do because I'm a very picky reader. It brings up the ethical ideas of the death penelty. It really made me think if &quot;An eye for an eye&quot; justice was the best form. It also portrays the procedures used by lawyers to avoid the death penelty for their client. I think that John Grisham is at his best in this book. It's a real treat for those who take the time to read it!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This was a really good book. I really, really liked it! It was so good that I brought it down to Florida for my spring break and read it on the beach!

This book is an argument against the deathpenalty with a totally despicable character that the reader is encouraged to be sympathetic toward. I oppose capital punishment but felt if it were ever deserved, it is in this case. It is never clear why Adam Hall, the grandson, cares so much for this person. *Dead Man Walking* did a far, far better job handling this topic. Glad I didn't purchase this."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This was the most disappointing book I've read in years. Yes, it's well written in that the characters are well developed and you can really feel the emotion of the heartbreaking story. However there is no plot!! Many, many pages are spent laying the groundwork for exciting twists and new dimensions to the story -- but not a single twist or diversion to the story line ever comes to pass. The plot just plods along in 676 pages via a single, linear story line to the logical conclusion."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"John Grisham is one of my favorite authors. I have always been intrigued by all of the John Grisham book I have read. However after reading The Chamber my thoughts have changed. This was by far the worst book John Grisham has written.The beginning of the book starts off great. Sam Cayhall, a biggot who is a member of the Ku Klux Klan takes his hate toward Jews to the absolute extreme. He planted a bomb in the office of Jewish lawyer, Marvin Kramer, with the intentions of killing just him, but the explosion took the lives of two people, neither of them being Sam's intended target. Instead the bomb severely crippled Mr. Kramer, and he was confined to a wheelchair. The real tragedy though was the death of two five year old twin boys, who happened to be the children of the Marvin Kramer. Once the media caught wind of what happened the story went national. Sam Cayhall was at one time the most hated and the most liked person in the country all at the same time. He was hated by the Kramer family and all the people in their town, but he was liked by the supporters of discrimination throughout the country. Sam was apprehended and convicted of murder. He was sentenced to the death penalty.Twenty years later a young and nieve man, Adam Hall, graduates from law school and then gets a job working for a large law firm in Chicago, but Adam had a reason for working at this particular firm. The firm Adam works for used to represent Sam Cayhall, and Adam wants to take Sam's case in a last minute attempt of saving Sam from being executed. The firm is bewildered by Adam's vast knowledge and interest in the Cayhall case until they find out his motive for wanting to help. Adam's family changed their name after the Cayhall bombing because they were related to Sam. Adam Hall is actually Sam Cayhall's grandson. After many arguements and much debate the firm permits Adam to introduce himself to Sam Cayhall and offer Sam his services for free. Adam goes down to Mississippi to be reunited with his grandfather and to hopefully save him from the death penalty.Grisham starts off with a very intense and traumatic murder scence. That part of the book was very exciting but after that the rest of the book is very bland. Grisham spent too much time developing the characters and describing their family and past. There was nothing exciting after the bombing. The book just kept a very steady pace downhill after about twenty or so pages. In my opinion the majority of the book was not based upon saving a man from being executed but helping a young man find out about his past and family. Even though the book was terrible it delivered a strong message to me. It showed that sometimes it takes horrible things to break families apart, but at the same time horrible things can bring families back together in the end.This was easily one of the most boring books I have ever read, and by far the worst John Grisham has ever written. Anyone interested in law practice might want to read this book though. The law part of the book is very believable, but one might fall asleep after about fifty pages of reading. Overall I would suggest not reading this book, but find something else because most books will be much better than this."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber is, in my opinion, one of Grisham's worst books. It is long winded and it has no major plot twists. The story is based on Cayall, a member of the KKK that bombs the office of a Jewish lawyer. He is put on death row and his grandson, who is a lawyer, takes the case and tries to run with it.On the positive side, there is plenty of character development and the ambiguity of good and evil is clear in most of the characters. The story is well described, to the point that the reader really gets involved in the feelings of the characters. However, the book just ends without any major occurrences that would make the reader skip a beat, as usual Grisham thrillers do. Another positive is the overall debate over the death penalty.Overall, this is a decent book, not a Grisham."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"On the long haul from San Diego to Hawai'i, a seaman will read anything that falls to hand, just to break the monotony. This could be a cake recipe, a telephone bill, or the instructions on how to work the toilet--- ANYTHING will do for reading material, when one is facing 22 days of open, blue-water ocean and nothing else to do but stare at waves.Anything will do, that is, except John Grisham's &quot;The Chamber.&quot; It does not distract from the monotony of a weeks-long passage: it greatly compounds the tedium. It is a chore to read: there is no pleasure in it. Indeed, at times it greatly aggravated, if not even induced, seasickness.The reader is not induced by the author to care about the characters in the book; no one cares if the old man gets gassed (indeed, the reader can hardly wait, just so the book will finally end); the reader does not care about the disgusting alcoholic aunt; and the reader certainly is not inspired to care about the spoild, personality-less main character (I mean, like, he's a -LAWYER- after all!). These people were written like cartoon characters: so trite and predictable that they could have been written by any one of ten thousand high school students who write the same dreck (dreck: &quot;trash; exceedingly inferior merchandise&quot;) as a homework assignment.When I finished reading the book (ah, sweet mercy! Another ten pages would have killed me!), I vowed that no one else who came abord the vessel after me would be subjected to the same abuse.I took a nice fat felt pen and wrote the book's own obituary on the inside cover. &quot;We consign this literary pile of steaming dingo poop to the deep watery abyss; to forever sleep in the yawning canyons of black, fathomless, liquid purgatory forever out of the reach of mankind; to remain there for ever and for ever, with the sure and present hope of -NO- ressurection. We also humbly apologice to Poseidon for polluting Your realm with this insulting offal.&quot;I then tossed the book overboard, 1180 nautical miles from the nearest land. I imagined ever sea denizen within a hundred miles felt the shock of impact, smelt the strong, foul odor, and hasty fled in terror. No doubt those creatures not fast enough, succumbed to the toxin and died, floating belly-up.Do yourself a big favor: if you see John Grisham's &quot;The Chamber&quot; washed ashore on the beach one summer day, approach no closer! Rather, call the Environmental Protection Agency and have them come out and clean it up. Same warning goes if you see this book in a book store."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Read the negative reviews before you tackle this one. I wish I had! I only finished this long, drawn out, boring bit of fiction to see if the bad guy really gets gassed. I started scanning parts of the repetitive and predictable narrative -- just too much totally unnecessary description. Creates little, if any, sympathy for any of the characters. No one to root for. I kept hoping Grisham would create some interesting tension by getting Sam's partner-in-crime more involved in the plot perhaps by threatening Adam or Lee. Never happens.

I didn't get the appeal of this book, as apparently so many other readers have. I found it unsuspenseful, and I didn't find any engaging characters. I guess the nuanced issues surrounding the death penalty could have been interesting, but it was somehow presented in a way that made me think \\"hmm, some ambiguous moral soup here, but that's just how things are.\\" Sorry to say it, but Grisham seems to have mailed it in here, in the writing if not the research."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Thought it was another thriller from John Grisham, but my assumption was wrong. Very boring, I found myself frequently skipping pages."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"A lot of reviews for this book center around the lack of action and substance to keep the reader moving through the 600+ pages. But this book is not about the action. This book is one that obviously came from Grisham's heart, sending a message from the author to the reader about his thoughts on such heavy topics as the death penalty and the different forms of capital punishment, the ability of a family to heal the wounds of the past, and the quality of a man's soul.One reviewer said the characters were unlikable. That's the point! The main character is a wimpy, uncertain lawyer who's way in over his head. His client is a former KKK member who's on death row for killing two little Jewish boys with a bomb. The governor is a conniving politician. The whole struggle of this book is not to bring down some shady consortium of lawyers or oil thugs like in other Grisham books. It is about the judgment of man and the power to hang his life in the balance. If all the characters were rosy and likable and completely two-dimensional and un-flawed, what kind of examination would this book provide?!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"John Grisham once again turns out a great story"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"THIS IS ONE THAT IS SO REALISTIC THAT IT WAS HARD TO STOP.THE ENDING IS SO REAL THAT IT BECOMES VERY EMOTIONAL FOR ANYONE LISTENING.

The writing is horrible; the characterization is junior-highschool level; the plot rambles, meanders, and stumbles from nowhere to nowhere without direction. This book lacks any kind of positive trait.Save your time and money: buy a book written by someone who knows how to write."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Note to John Grisham: If you're going to push your views on capital punishment on the public in any future books, please have the decency to ascribe at least one redeeming quality in the death-row character. Give us a little reason for caring. What a waste of time this book was. Any person who opposes the death penalty and reads this book will quickly change their mind. It's incredible to believe that this is the best that the author could come up with to support his view that capital punishment is wrong. He could have fooled me! Skip the book. Jam a nail in your eye. It's probably not as painful."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Though I have not read The Chamber yet; as, I'm in the middle of one of Grisham's other novels, The Partner. The Chamber is next on my list; and then, comes the newest book, The Confession.

My favorite part was when the alcoholic aunt disappeared in the last few chapters. Another interesting thing was the story behind Eddie. The intensity between his past which affect his presents.

The story was flat, dull and boring, a total waste of time. In the beginning, it seemed to have a good premise, however, Mr. Grisham wrote this book to death (no pun intended!). After about 90 pages, I flipped to the end to see what the verdict was guilty as charged, as I suspected. Ah there I gave away the ending with absoltely no loss to humanity! However, The chamber should not take away from Grisham's other fine literary works.

He is a consumate story teller that can develope a character to the point you feel you know them. The chaaracters then fit the story he weves. You know they are supposed to be there and even the most minor one contributed to the tapestry.Grisham just has the talent to tell a really GOOD story.Michael Beck did a outstanding job in bringing to life each character and let you visulaize them as they moved through the story. No small task when you play ALL the parts.This is deffinately a keeper!!!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I love John Grisham. I've read most of his work and most of them are excellent. The Chamber has to be his worst book. It's a nice tale about a death row inmate, along very similar lines of &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; - but there is no intrigue or plot twists, or anything else that makes for a page-turning suspense novel. I kept waiting for something out of the blue to happen, and nothing did. I even had thoughts of things that might happen, trying to guess a potential plot twist, and nothing happened. You are introduced to characters who appear throughout the story, which you expect to become a huge player at the end of the story, only to find them dissapear without a trace. Grisham seems to be building another suspensful, mind blowing story and then 3/4 of the way through the book almost every sub plot disappears never to resurface. When I got to the end of the book I thought I was missing a few chapters because there seemed to be som much left unsaid. I would strongy urge you to stay away from this book - or at least if you read it, don't expect a suspense novel, just a nice description of what someone goes through when on death row."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I believe that John Grisham is succeded casting lots of questions on the system to send people to the chamber as well as entertaining his readers.This novel provides us with a better opportunity to deeply consider social problems than hearing the lectures at low school. It also gives us an idea that the truth is not as simple as what it believed in the past."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I very much enjoyed The Chamber written by John Grisham. The book displays a look back at what life was like in the early days of the 60's to a life on Death Row in today's time. This novel shows many different views from the many types of people who lived during these times. The Chamber also demonstrates the problems that families go through and the troubles to fix these problems. John Grisham has published a book very true in what the days were like decades ago and consequences made by certain people during these days. Over all The Chamber was a book that is unable to be put down. The suspense gets you until the last word in the novel and grabs you in the beginning. The book is an intresting way to spend a day or two with a well know author with true talent."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The type of literature is both realistic and contemporary fiction. It is realistic fiction because the kkk does exsiste and people are killed from them. It is contemporary fiction because the story takes place in mordern time's.

I found the book easy to read in the fact that it kept me turning pages. I thought the character development was good for Adam, but not as good for Sam. I guess it depends on the focus of the book, but which character is the focus on ?? I felt the ending left a little to be desired, and quite frankly, I put the book down wanting more... too many loose ends, Rollie Wedge, his aunt etc etc...However, I must say it was a good read and an eye-opener to some of the myths and tradgies of the Death Penalty."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This book is incredible, it actually makes you feel sorry for a man who is a disgusting and deplorable specimen of an individual.

It starts out with a bombing gone awry. One man meant to only bomb a building, but instead kills two innocent children and destroys another life. Thirty years later, one of the bombers in sitting on death row, a former Klan activist, waiting to die when his unknown grandson appears as a lawyer in hopes to rescue him.Grisham does another excellent job describing a story, with great mastery and fluidity, of one man's last ditch effort to save his grandfather from death. Even though his emphasis on law is profound, he delves into deeper issues such as family, the question of the death penalty, and other emotional issues that one does see in other Grisham novels (with the exception of A Painted House).What's really fascinating is that nothing in this book is not black and white. For each issue he brings up, there are good and bad points - each issue is a gray area. He describes the horrors of death row, but then juxtaposes it with the deaths of the two youngsters. Instead of making the main character purely good or evil, he mixes it a bit. Sometimes you wish the inmate would fry, sometimes you feel he's innocent.Another good point about the book is that it's not a farfetched story, like the Street Lawyer or the Firm, it's a book that could be confused with a documentary. He doesn't revolve action or plot twists, but instead relies on the psychological aspects of all sides of a death sentence.The only bad point, of which Grisham tends to do a lot, is he is repetitive. Many, many parts were repeated over and over again. This 700-page book could have been reduced to 500-page book without any loss of detail. Pages 200 to 400 just dragged on and on and on. The last 150 pages, though nothing exciting happens, is really intense and emotional, and is what makes this book.I highly recommend this book to anyone. It's a slight departure for Grisham, as he delves into more psychological elements, but it works well."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Grisham was never really a good writer -- he just came up with a few good stories and told them adequately. In this book, he even failed at that modest aim.The whole purpose of the book seems to be to give Grisham a forum for arguing against the death penalty -- though I'm not even sure about that. If that was his goal, he tried to accomplish it by making us sympathize with an old, sick man on death row. Sorry, but he was once a young, healthy murderer. Executing him sooner would have solved the old, sick man issue."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber is the sixth John Grisham novel I have read, and, to be honest, I was a bit disappointed, although it is generally well written and in places he poses some interesting questions.The plot is very \`linear', and there is a particular aspect of the story that seems to start to develop and then just fizzles out (I can't say more than that without spoiling the plot). I found this extremely frustrating. Furthermore, some of the characters are highly caricatured, especially David McAllister and George Nugent, and Adam himself seems almost nondescript. Aunt Lee's problems were overdone.The \`thought-provoking' aspect of the book is the way Grisham describes Sam's reactions to his impending death. For me, this is the strongest aspect of the story, and I couldn't help imagining what it must have been like to be in Sam's position. Towards the end of the book Grisham seems to suggest that Sam is a victim of his bad upbringing, and this seems to cheapen the theme of forgiveness that emerges. The idea that cold-blooded murderers could ever be seen as \`victims' is, in my view, very dangerous and naive. They can be \`forgiven', but their actions should never be \`excused'.If this story is John Grisham's attempt to preach against capital punishment then, in my view, he has failed. Yes, it is useful to be aware of the effect capital punishment has on the offender's family, and also important to understand how easily the process can be exploited by unscrupulous politicians. Grisham has raised these points, and I respect him for that. But he has failed to adequately deal with the other side of the equation - what about the victims of the crime? In this book the tragic Kramers are almost \`brushed under the carpet'.This book seems to be an attempt to address a highly complex issue by means of descriptions of subjective personal reactions, and it fails to do justice to the profound moral issues surrounding capital punishment, which affect society at large. I have not made my mind up about the issue of capital punishment, and this book, although \`food for thought', has not really swayed me in any direction.A better Grisham read would be The Rainmaker ... excellent!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Must read for Grisham fans, but not the best place to start for newcomers. Moves along quickly with excellent character developement. Grisham could have spent a little more time developing a less disappointing ending, but was most likely in a hurry to pick up his paycheck."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"John Grisham explores a different style in his book The Chamber. Instead of building a story around a well meaning hero, this story is a character study of a death row criminal and how he got in his predicament. The story does not move very fast,which will lose some readers. It describes how Sam Cahill became the bitter old man that he is. Sam Cahill was raised in a narrow minded world which shaped him into committing a heinous crime. Throughout the story, one can feel all the emotions: loyalty, fear, anger, strength of character of this complex man as he relates to the system that tries to bring him down. It touches on many levels of morals as well as family issues. Whereas there are many legal ploys and a few other dramatics, John Gisham is able to show that he is successful at writing a character study novel."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I am a relatively new Grisham fan, and this is the best book of his that I have read so far. I loved _The Firm_, _The Pelican Brief_, _The Client_ and _The Runaway Jury_, but this was so incredible it's hard to put into words. Anyone who reads _The Chamber_ will become an instant opposer of the death penalty and all its cruelty. Yes, there is less action than in his previous books, but this opens up space for a theme that will bowl you over."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"As always, Grisham gives us a well researched &amp; well written poignant reminder of what may be wrong with our directionless society.

Adam Hall, 26-year-old attorney fresh out of law school and working at the best firm in Chicago finds that grandad is on death row for killing two men (grandady's a card-carrying member of the KKK.) Hall races to the rescue and puts his career at stake to try and rescue the old-timer from inhaling the wrong type of gas! The plot has the makings of an action-packed novel, but Grisham handles it at a much slower pace, heaving in sentimentality in places. Being a writer of proven commercial abilities, Grisham gets away with it - just! He's better off in courtrooms and car chases and his handling of the final pages is, frankly, weak. Nevertheless, Grisham's ability to pen a decent plot raises The Chamber from what could otherwise have been a disaster. If you're looking for Grisham's best, look elsewhere. If you just want to be sure you've tried the whole gamut of his offerings, you find worse, but you'll find better."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber is one of the most provocative novels I have read, and I ranks among Grisham's best.

Hall takes Sam's case to try to get him off death row. He will be challenged by the Governor, the Attorney General, his own firm, Sam's former accomplice and now a fascist leader, and his alcoholic aunt. This book's study on the gas chamber really made me think about it and helped to change my stance on the issue.

It also shows how the actions of one can affect lots of people, such as the lawyer's aunt.

Next, this provokes a lot of emotion, you have to pick how to feel about Sam. Should you hate him for killing the two boys, or should you feel pity for a poor, dying, and later on, repentant old man. I hate to give away the ending, but, the end is very, very sad. I can say that it moved me to tears. Besides all these other things, I can say this book has made me a strong opponent of the death penalty. THis book is a must read for anyone, I mean anyone.

They were amazed that they could actually feel sympathy for a KKK member on death row for racist crimes. I started the book cynically thinking there was absolutely no way I would I even comprehend this character. Well I will say that although the word \\"sympathy\\" may not be totally accurate, I will say that this book did bring out some pretty strong emotions from me. Grisham gives you a little better understanding of what makes a person like Sam Cayhill's mind work. Why they think, feel and see things the way that they do. Grisham seemed to want you to think that this guy wouldn't be so bad of a person if he were brought up in a different set of circumstances.I believe that when a book is able to bring out emotion in you, be it anger or outrage or even sympathy, if it brings you insight or makes you see things from a different point of view so that even if you don't agree with the point, you can at least comprehend it, then it is a very special book.This book as well as \\"A Time to Kill\\" ar two of Grisham's best in my opinion. Obviously written back when he put a lot of time, effort, research and creativity in his work. His later stuff is just not that good to me. Maybe he lost his hunger and/or drive. Whatever.

Unhappy with a Jewish a civil rights lawyer, Rollie Wedge and Adam Cayhall plant a bomb in his law offices. They end up slaying his children and grievously wounding the lawyer. This takes place in 1967, and the prevailing social milieu, combined with the Klan's well-worn strategies of jury tampering, Sam is spared after two trials. It is not until being betrayed by a co-conspirator that he is finally convicted and sent to death row.Fast-forward to the present. Adam Hall, Sam's son, working under a Jewish lawyer, is tasked with gaining clemency for his ancestor. As one might expect, this is easier said than done. Although Sam was merely the child murderer's driver, he did commit heinous acts in his youth that would have sent him to death row had he been of age, and had he committed them after the civil rights movement of the 20th century. This leads to a conflict between Sam and Adam, and also within Adam himself as he wrestles with the death penalty and whether or not it is ever warranted. Grisham not only spins an eloquent tale with the erudition of a master lawyer (which Grisham indeed is). One does not need to be a lawyer to enjoy this engrossing and enthralling novel. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Fresh out of law school, the hero of Grisham's story returns to the South, to his family's roots, to defend his grandfather, trying to save the old man from the gas chamber. As the hero digs into his family's sordid past, he uncovers a shocking history. As always, this is an entertaining read, but Grisham's best tales are still the Summons, the Brethren, and the Firm.If you like Grisham, you might also try The Golden CatchRoger Weston, author ofThe Golden Catch"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Grisham does a fantastic job at keeping the reader interested in this book! This is another one of those books you start reading and finish before you know it. I can still visualize images of the main character in various scenes. I haven't read this book in quite awhile, but I still can't forget its lasting impression on me with the death penalty. I seriously contemplated my views on the death penalty while reading this book, and now this book serves as part of the influence of my view of the death penalty."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"It seems the later Grisham novels are a little slow. This one is too, but it picks up a bit closer to the end. I was surprised by the ending. With all the intricacies Grisham interwove, I really felt emotional for the main character. Hence the tissues."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"At first I thought this was a normal segregation story, as a black person, I always wondered what was the mind set during segregation, between the black and whites, what were people thinking? And I have always believed that peer pressure made its effect in infusing people to do harm during those days. When you are on the winning side .....You really don't have to worry about the losing side. But usually when your life is almost reaching the end ... your confection tells it all; you understand what it is to be human being."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Aside from being slow and fragmented and the characters being just plain shallow, this book is troubling (like all Grisham novels) because it does damage to legal profession's standing in the eyes of the public. Grisham thinks it's OK to have his main characters act unethically and dishonestly (Adam's deception) because the book is about, after all, the death penalty, and who cares about how lawyers and law students are portrayed when he can write on a sexy topic like the death penalty? Dead Man Walking beats the stuffins out of Grisham's book because 1) it's real and 2) Prejean knows what she's talking about, unlike Grisham who boils down the complex world of the law into digestible (and artifical, fictional) bits for the masses. Let fiction be fiction, and don't even try to make it look like reality, lest someone in their Jeep Cherokee in the suburbs thinks this book is for real."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Grisham must've lost his editor in the mail on this one. It's yeoman's work to make us care about a old racist reprobate about to get his just desserts; it's even more difficult when the histrionics (however subtle) go on a hundred pages too long. Combine that with superflouous subplots (the aunt's problems and the dead dad) and you get a seriously longwinded, meandering, unfocused book. Suggestion to Grisham: take two or three good ideas, wrap them around a decent main plot, and interweave them so that they are coherent and relevant to each other."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"After reading the firm and the pelican brief, this book was totally different. There's no organised crime money laundering or anything like that, its just a really well written book that keeps your opinion changing the whole way through about the death penalty. Its Grishams best written book to date."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This was the first (and probably the last) of Grisham's volumes I have read. While Grisham may be popular, it is obviously not based on the actual quality of his writing, but rather on the curiousity of the public about his subjects. The characters all sound the same and a real sense of depth is never developed in any of them. The introduction of Carmen, for instance, leaves a lot to be desired and I was left wondering why she was even introduced. To show the trial to the family? If so, that was a failure. If Grisham really wanted to show the moral dilemmas in the death penalty he would have been much better off not to paint those opposed to it as heroes while those in favor of it (i.e. Nugent) as complete morons. Where is the dilemma in this? Where is the expectation that the reader be left in anyway disturbed? If one is already opposed to the death penalty there is no real tension here. If one is in favor of it then the overblown portrayal of Nugent will be quite simply sickening and again the reader is put off from the real questions. I expect literature to disturb and raise questions and leave me in a state where I don't know what to think, but where I am left thinking. I can't ask that of The Chamber."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"...this is a book that is purely about the issues surrounding the death penalty. The real suspense revolves around whether or not Adam's grandfather, Sam, will receive a last-minute stay, not whether Adam's life is in danger from Sam's old bombing partner who is still out there and watching (which is what the teasers on the cover would have you beleive). It's as if Grisham thought it would be a great plot device but lost interest in it half way through and didn't take the time to go back and either take it out or make it work. And his aunt's mysterious disappearance? You would think it would be something exciting, wouldn't you? Well, it isn't. I'll have to check out the movie, maybe they did a better job"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"And in the &quot;Big Surprises&quot; category, we have a Grisham book with a young lawyer who is a pastiche from &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Captain Planet;&quot; who embodies Grisham's own unoriginal politics; who looks suspiciously like he could be played by Brad Pitt, or even Keanou Reeves; who engages in a shallow moral milieu with benighted society without actually making a damned bit of substantial difference; who worries up banal (if not completely trivial) moral fodder; who catapults from obscurity to a Momentous Event; whose every emotional twitch is described with complete lack of authenticity; who undergoes character development so minimal that we believe he really IS a lawyer. Welcome back to the bookstand, John: you fit like an old shoe with broken laces and no sole"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"1 Star because it is a John Grisham Work. This was Grisham using his best selling ability to write a book against the death penalty. If you are looking for a story that will hold your interest you came to the wrong place. The only reason I finshed the book is because I kept hoping it would get better. A great writer who wasted our time on this one. If you want to read a good law mystery pick Grisham -- just don't pick this one. The Client , Street Lawyer, Runaway Jury, The Firm are all 4-5 Star Books so read those not this book"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Anyone who wants to think seriously about the death penalty should, despite the fact that it is fiction, read this book. Grisham goes into the kind of detail about the process of appeals slated at staying the execution of a convicted criminal that, given his obviously careful research, educates you and keeps you reading. However, even more compelling and poignant is the story of the convict and the lawyer grandson who tries to save him. It is also a story about the racist south then and now which none of us should forget or ignore. Be ready to think, to cry, to change your mind."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"A lonely, bitter old man sits on death row in a southern penetentiary for a crime he didn't commit but could have stopped. He has been assigned an eleventh-hour attorney from up north to see if his execution can possibly be stayed. As these two men work together, they will find they have a lot more in common than they realized.THE CHAMBER may be slow going for some, but it's an absorbing, satisfying read for those in the mood for six hundred pages about racial violence in the sixties and the ethics of capital punishment today. Grisham's sense of plot is as true as ever, and he brings a welcome sense of verisimiltude to his main characters. The book is slow going at first, but it picks up steam and the last third becomes a can't-put-it-down page turner."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"how anyone can criticise this book is beyond me..the rollercoaster ride of emotions from hate to love, from anger to empathy and from loathing to pity is just breath-taking! this book evoked such sadness and also forced the reader to examine their own beliefs about the morality and humanity involved with the death penalty in america. this book strengthens the belief that the death penalty is wrong and tries to convince those who don't believe! all in all this book shows Grisham's capabilities are far more diverse than pure courtroom drama! a real tear jerker...be prepared!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"John Grisham outdoes himself once again on this extraordinarynovel. If this book doesn't make you think twice about thedeath penalty, you didn't read it right! Grisham evokesemotions I never knew I had--it is definitely a heart-wrenchingstory with what I thought was the perfect ending. Although inmy heart I didn't want Sam Cayhall executed, the book wouldn'thave seemed complete if somehow an appeal had beensuccessful. This book had me biting back tears the entire time.Although some reviews said that this book is long and, in placesboring, I feel that every word in every sentence contributed tothe novel as a whole. I loved this book--congratulations, JohnGrisham, on another book excellently written"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Grisham delivers yet another powerful novel about (what else?)law and the justice system. Sam and Adam Cayhall are believablecharacters whose contrasting traits give the novel a more rousingand realistic tone. The ending particularly will grab the reader'ssuspense. The sublime subject matter of a family member's sentenceto death is definitely something that will come up later at thedinner table. The one weakness of the book is that it is slightlyoverwritten and sometimes dull, which makes you rather want to watchCourt TV. But overall it is good, solid entertainment, and gets yournoodle thinking!!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This novel was overall good. It shows how a famly has beenashamed of their grandfather\`s and their great grandfather\`sracist actions. Somehow Adam Hall, a member of this particularfamily, defends his grandfather from getting the death penalty.At the end it shows a moral lesson about racism. It does haveflaws, though. One of them is it is too long and it reallygets boring sometimes. A good thing about the book isthe author\`s style."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This story is more about the lawyer representing the death-rowinmate than it is the inmate.... I didn't think it wouldbe a good candidate for a movie, but perhaps they are aboutto prove me wrong (movie is forthcoming). An excellent read."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"My least favorite of the Grisham books, The Chamber is a slow-paced story made up of tons of dialogue and very, very little action. For me, it started out boring and remained consistent to the very end. It's true, that it became a &quot;page turner&quot; near the end, but not the way you might think... I was hoping that something exciting might actually happen, but mainly just wanted to be done with it. I knew better than expect a good ending from Grisham anyway.Grisham once again revisits the racial issues of the South and even references his other &quot;racial&quot; book (the A Time to Kill) in the process. Unless you've been living in a cave, this is a topic beaten to death and he really has nothing new to ad. I wish I hadn't read it and could not, in good faith, recommend it to you."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"In 1967 in Greenville, Mississippi, known klan member Sam Cayhall is accused of bombing the law offices of Jewish civil rights activist Marvin Kramer, killing Kramer's two sons. Cayhall's first trail, with an all white jury and a klan rally outside the courthouse, ends in a hung jury, the retrail six months later has the same outcome.Twelve years later an ambitious district attorney in Greenville reopens the case. Much has changed since 1967, and this time, with a jury of eight whites and four blacks, Cayhall is convicted. He is transferred to the state penitentiary at Parchman to await execution on death row.In 1990, in the huge Chicago law firm of Kravitz and Bane, a young lawyer named Adam Hall asks to work on the Cayhall case, which the firm has handled on a pro bono basis for years. But the case is all but lost and time is running out: within weeks Sam Cayhall will finally go to the gas chamber. Why in the world would Adam want to get involved?Good question who wants to even read this long boring novel by John Grisham, I bet not many people. I on the other hand have and it's not good. Sam Cayhall's life was filled with bad luck when he and his terriost friend bombed the law office's of Marvin Kramer, Sam didn't want to kill them, he just wanted to give them a good scare. It was his friend who wanted to kill the little Jewish kids, and he did. Sam got caught and his friend didn't. Deep down Sam was never a hateful racist, he was just raised that way, he has a family past full of hatered. And it just was the miserable environment of the racist south. He was influenced by family and peers. I give this book a one star because it was boring and it dragged on and on. And he got gassed at the end. . I am opposed to the death penalty, I don't think they should of gassed him. I do think people like Sam Cayhall and all the other killers and murders out there, I don't think that they should die but to do hard intense manual labor and suffer physically and mentally for the rest of their lives until they die in prison.Read another Grisham novel all of them are good but this one."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"John Grisham never ceases to amaze me with thoughtless writing and trite plots. No characters, no theme, poor writing-a typical Grisham. It started with The Firm, and has continued until this day. His books are a disgrace to all writers in general, and specifically to lawyers and politicians. Every page I read was pure agony as I contemplated burning the book more than once. However, I finished just so I can write this review, and warn people off of this book. It was awful. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I'm on page 317 of a 676-page paperback version of The Chamber. I wanted to send a private email to Grisham or a surrogate, but I could not find an email address. So here I am. Having practiced law for two decades, I learned that when a case goes through the state courts to the high court and a party wants to appeal to the federal court, the case must be appealed to SCOTUS (the Supreme Court of the US). One cannot appeal to the local federal district court. On page 317, JG asserts that the next step from the Mississippi Supreme Court is to the local fed ct. That is an error of law. That was the second time in the book he made that statement. I didn't note the page of the first occurrence because I was in bed and I had neither a pen nor a post-it to mark the paragraph.I love the story. The detail is extraordinary, but there is considerable repetition. His editors should have caught all of it. I shrug as I write this, for given JG's exceptional appeal, the editors likely dared not change a word in his manuscript.It's a page-turner for special readers. It is not a book for readers who want physical action on each page. Its focus is on the sociological history of the KKK in Mississippi. Halfway through the book, I have so far learned about the hatred possessed by the KKK folks for blacks, Jews, and other minorities, but I have no idea yet as to whether JG gets around to explain why the hatred existed or how it developed . . . or whether he remains simply content to show how deep the hatred boiled.I'll end this review now so I can get back to reading the tome.Enjoy!Having just previewed this critique, I noticed Amazon still has me in Andover, MA. I no longer live there. I moved to tranquil Costa Rica two and a half years ago, where Brahmin cows are my neighbors and ugly, disgusting possums get into my house, eat my bananas, gnaw on my pineapples and potatoes, and chew my bars of soap. Grisham lets me escape an excess of pura vida."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I have really started to get into Grisham novels and have read about 5-6 of them now. Just finished this one and I felt disappointed after reading it.Let me just say that in all his books I get the vague feeling that the writer is liberal and somewhat anti-republican...often republicans are put forth as \\"big business\\" and democrats are put forth as more \\"compassionate\\"...but as a conservative reader I find its not strong enough to be overwhelming, and his writing style is excellent and I really enjoy his plots. (I read a wide genre of literature and don't always like modern writers as they can sometimes seem shallow and lame, but Grisham is pretty interesting to me.)The reason this one disappointed me is that it seemed much more blatant as far as sending across a definite political message: Anti-death penalty. Of course as an author he has every right to put forth his views in writing...I'm just saying that while I disagree slightly with the viewpoints in most, if not all, of his books, this one seemed to have a little more of an obvious agenda than others.Also...frankly....while I'm okay with \\"random\\" story endings and often really enjoy some kind of weird, quirky ending....this one made me feel like I wasted my time reading the book. It was like...\\"Huh? I read all that...for this? Oh.\\"But hey...onto my next Grisham...."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Definitely Grisham's best work in which he wrote with his heart and soul. I read this book 4 times."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Grisham has had many bestselling novels. Except this one is boring. Unless you're really into the book you'll maybe like it. When I read this book, I nearly fell asleep. It's just Adam Hall filing out petition after petition. If you loose interest in this book, but still go on you won't know how many petitions Adam Hall filed. It's that boring."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"this is one of the best books ever by John Grisham. The Chamber keeps you captivated and enchanted thoughout the entire book with his wonderful plots and interesting characters. It is definitely worth buying and reading."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I normally think books are usually better than movies, but I think in this case, the movie was much better than the book for sure!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I read this book several months ago and I can still remember how I cried at the end of the book. Grisham writes with such detail that you are totally drawn into the story and start to actually feel sorry for Sam. You also find yourself wanting to help Adam find a way to help his grandfather. I enjoyed the book very much, the movie however strayed from the book and was not portayed as well, I did however read the book just after the release of the movie and could picture the actors in their parts, but after the reading the book, the movie was a bit disappointing. Excellent writing a must read."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Mr. Grisham is a good writer. He just couldn't pull this one off. I'm opposed to capital punishment, but I kept hoping they would fry this guy and get it over with. This character was the best argument for the electric chair since Charles Manson. I read the whole thing, thinking it would eventually get good, but it didn't. Still, an awful Grisham is better than a good somebody else. I'd still rather read him than Clancy."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"When I read stories about the KKK it really makes me cringe to think that someone could be that ruthless to another human being just because they hate a certain race of people. I felt the same way about Sam during most of the book(I mean that man hated anybody but his own family), but I can see the affect that his family had on him when he was younger. It seems that he really didn't have chance because that was all he knew and even Adam said that if he was born 40 years earlier that he would probably be no different than Sam. So I felt sorry for Sam toward the end of the book because he was truly sorry for the lives that he ended and also the lives that he ruined forever.I think Adam was the real hero in this book for staying by his grandfather side even though he knew the things that he had done, and showingSam that living a life of racism results only in Death."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I am a big fan of John Grisham's thriller style books - This is not one of them The ending is not a big climax to the story nor even particularly unexpected. Despite that however this is possibly the best book I have ever read emphasising as it does the very essence of the dilemma with regard to the death penalty. it shows how it is possible to despise criminals and criminal acts and yet to believe that the death penalty is inherantly evil. The book explores the issues thoroughly using the emotions of the characters concerned to great effect. A profoundly thought provoking piece of writing!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I read the book and then watched the movie. I liked the book better because it was more in-depth and just better. I usually like the book better when there is a book and a movie. I read three other books by Grisham and this one is my faviorite. This is a good book for suspense and drama. I would read any other book by John Grisham and I want to read the rest of the ones out now."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I thought that The Chamber was one of the best Grisham books I have read - certainly a lot better that the last two. Like one of the other comments I read, I felt very sorry for Sam too - being involved in the KKK didn't seem to be a choice. I really thought that Sam was going to get off.Excellent book! I would reccommend it to everyone, that and A Time To Kill."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber is one of the best John Grisham books I have ever read. It was a cleverly plotted story. This book keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in law or the death penalty."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber: Adam Hall is a Chicago attorney who takes on a case that could destroy his life. His racist grandfather Sam Cayhall is sitting on death row for the fatal bombing of an office building in the 1960's that paralysed a man and killed his two children. Adam senses there is more to the story and while the nation waits for his execution, Adam tries to uncover the truth with the help of many people including his own aunt who at first wants nothing to do with him or Sam, but she eventually begins to sense a need for closure and so she begins to talk of life with a father like Sam. As he gets closer to the truth he puts his life on the line. Grisham has tackled racism before, but never quite like this. Here we have a character that isn't sorry for what happened all those years ago. Making the main character someone that we cannot like makes it hard to have to read material like this, but Grisham makes the novel work and doesn't become to preachy. The only problem is that the book is really long and I think that the books content could have been trimmed. Besides that it is still another sure fire hit from the master writer."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I've read several Grisham novels and have enjoyed the pace and the suspense - two things that were sadly lacking in The Chamber. The characters were unlikeable, the storyline slow and predictable and the ethical questions too contrived."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"If you want to get thought provoking stuff on the consequences of the death penalty here is my suggestion: Go to a video store and rent the movie &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;. &quot;The Chamber&quot; is a boring, pointless slog that goes on and on and on and on and on until you pitch the wretched thing into the fireplace. Grisham is always switching sides on how we should view Sam Cayhall and never stays on one long enough to make a point. Stay as far away from this book as possible!! You have been warned."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Unlike Grisham's previous novels, this one is slow paced, and redundant. That is, the lead character spends most of his days going between the prison where his grandfather is incarcerated and back to the home with his Aunt. The Grandfather who is on death row is not a likeable character, and does not even seem to have an ounce of remorse for his hideous crime. This slow moving book could have been written in half the pages Grisham did, and would have been a slightly more tolerable read."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I have to admit that this isn't one of my favorite books. I've tried to analyze the reason for this and the only thing I can come up with is that I found this story depressing. My relationships with my grandfathers were much different than that portrayed in this book, which left me with the feeling of not completely understanding (ok, I know that's shallow on my part, but combined with the depressing factor, it's relevant). I also can't understand the depth of the hatred this book shows of its main character.The story is about Adam Hall, an attorney right out of college, who finds out that his grandfather, Sam Cayhill, is on death row for killing two people. As he probes into the case further, he unearths the facts that Sam Cayhill is an active member of the Klu-Klux-Klan and has a hatred for all non-white people, besides being a person few would actually like. Adam decides to try to appeal his grandfather's case and stop his execution.As Adam dug further into his grandfather's life, the reader was shown the hatred racists have for their fellow man. It seemed when you would finally get used to this individual being a racist, another skeleton was found in his closet, and another demoralizing aspect of this character would come to the surface.While into this story, I found myself wondering if people really existed that were as closed-minded as Sam Cayhill. Unfortunately, the answer to that question is YES. Then as I followed the struggle of Adam trying to help his grandfather in court, I wondered why this young man would keep putting himself through the emotional turmoil, especially with a grandfather that has no intentions of having any kind of relationship with his grandson. Cayhill acted as if it was an inconvenience for him to even speak with Adam.The difference between this Grisham novel and his others is the speed of action. There is very little action and it moves a little faster than a snail. I don't mean to imply that you shouldn't read this book, but you do need to realize that it is not a typical action filled, keep you on the edge of your seat, type John Grisham novel."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Grisham's best books are the thrilling fights against powerful enemies not yet fully known; this theme makes The Firm, The Pelican Brief and The Client such exciting stories.That his first book (A Time to Kill) did not sell at fist didn't suprise because it just goes on and on in this flimsy tale of legal chitchat of a starting lawyer defending a black man's murder of the rapist of his daughter.The Chamber gave me the same feeling. It feels like a poor attempt to write a literary, philosophical and ethical thriller - presenting the death penalty as an issue (but not really discussing it) and missing the chances of real suspense in the story.I gave it two stars because of the description of the last hours of Adam and his grandfather, which I found really moving.But they didn't make me forget that I had thought I bought a thriller."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"&quot;The Chamber&quot; is probably Grishams most unusual book (maybe except for &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; who differs because of the light-footed humour). In this story we are forced to think long and hard about the death-penalty. And Grisham does not make it easy: An unsympathetic racist bastard of a Klansman is on deathrow for having killed two kids in a bombing many years ago intended on a Jewish lawyer who defended blacks. The choice is obvious... or what.The description of the life on death row is shocking, touching, emotional, and necessary: it forces us to ask ourselves the question: can the death penalty be justified.While our hero fights time, his client, and all odds to get his Klansman grandfather off death row, the reader has time to make up his/her mind, but it is not easy. I say: Let the man go. Read the story and see what Grisham chooses to do.If this story does not bring tears to your eyes, you have a heart of stone. It is a most human and touching book, with a dark and controversial tone, otherwise unheard of in Grisham novels. Well done Mr. G."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Mr. Grisham is one of my favorite authors and I thought this novel was an excellent and compelling story. Actually, I thought this book was a notch or two above \\"The Firm and The Pelican Brief\\", which I enjoyed tremendously. The book starts off a bit slow and then picks up the pace as you the reader become involved with the young lawyer as tries to save his grandfather from the gas chamber for the murder of a father and two children. Overall, I would gladly recommend this novel by an author that knows how to deliver a thrilling story."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"At first I didn't want to read a book about someone on death row but I figured, it's John Grisham it will probably be good and it is.This books is not an action packed book like some of his others, the Pelican Brief, The Firm or Runaway Jury but it is thoroughly interesting.It takes this KKK member named Sam Cayhill who is on death row and talks about his life and how he got there. It's really quite a sad story for not only him and his victims but also his family who has been torn apart because of his actions, those that have left him on death row and some of those that did not.It's really quite moving reading about the emotions that come to everyone involved when someone is about to be gassed etc and John Grisham does a wonderful job slowly leading you to that point.This book might not change your opinion on the death penalty but it will definitely let you look at it differently through the eyes of a prisioner and his family etc.A good read for those who have time for a slower paced book that leads to a purpose. If you need nonstop action in a book then this is not the one to pick up."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This is one of Grisham's longer books, but well worth it. The characters in \\"The Chamber\\" are better developed than some of his other books, notably some of his more recent books. As the reader, a bond formed between the main characters and I throughout the book. It was this closeness with the characters combined with a well-written story and thoughtful dialogue that provided me with the opportunity to contemplate something I had never really thought about before - the death penalty. I really enjoyed the book and recommend it to anyone who has read and enjoyed any of Grisham's other books."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber is one of John Grisham's best! It was the first time I've gotten an indepth look at the appeals process. For those people who want to form an opinion on the death penalty based on the circumstances in The Chamber, it must be remembered that people put themselves in the circumstances that they face. No one snatched Sam Cayhall of the street and held him at gunpoint to make the bomb for the attorney's office. There are plenty of people in Mississippi who may have thought the same thing but said \\"hold on one minute,let's think about this\\". As in reality, when I've had conversations with acquaintenences about the death penalty, I always encourage them to examine the case and gain an understanding from the victims point of view. The Chamber isn't for the faint of heart and it does make one think. It beautiful illustrates one thing I try to teach my kids: your actions and decisions effects other people."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"THE CHAMBER is not a typical Grisham novel. It is instead a charcter-driven tale of a young southern attorney who feels compelled to defend his grandfather, a Ku Klux Klan member sitting on Mississippi's death row for some racial killings committed decades earlier. In defending his grandfather, the young lawyer is forced not only to confront the unfairness of the justice system, but the ghosts of his own family's racist past.I found THE CHAMBER to be a very pleasant surprise. Unlike many of his other books, Grisham concentrates a great deal of energy on creating colorful, morally complex characters. The setting is also quite fascinating, as Grisham describes, in great detail, how executions are conducted in the deep South. And, of course, Grisham does a solid job with the plot -- there's never a dull moment in this book, and the book is quite gripping until the final few pages. I found this novel to be a great pageturner, and is probably the second best book by Grisham I've ever read, only behind THE FIRM.Grisham isn't a subtle writer, and THE CHAMBER may strike certain readers as obvious, moralistic, or heavy-handed. But I don't mind the direct approach, as long as its well executed, and Grisham delivers the goods here. In the end, this book offers a truly compelling narrative, and I enjoyed it enormously. Reading this novel, I can understand why Grisham became the bestselling novelist of the 1990s.If you enjoy THE CHAMBER, I also recommend trying Stephen King's THE GREEN MILE or Andrew Klavan's TRUE CRIME, which deal with very similar subject matter."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This is a lousy book. It is more like a diatribe against the death penalty with a littlefiction thrown in for support. It is 600+ pages of boredom and sloppy thinking. Irecommend other Grisham books instead of this."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"While the novel was excellent, the condition of the book was tattered and shabby when it was described as \\"Like new condition.\\""},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"If your idea of a good book is one where there is lots of action and fascinating twists and turns of plot complications pop up on every page, you shouldn't go anywhere near The Chamber. If, however, you would like to gain a visceral sense of the issues around capital punishment, The Chamber is a well-constructed fictional treatment. It won't be a pretty or a pleasant experience, but neither is capital punishment.I remember as a youngster carefully following the case of Caryl Chessman, a convicted robber and rapist who was executed in California's gas chamber. Reading The Chamber brought back those visceral memories of thinking through my reactions to the death penalty. I became an opponent. Most people who read this book will too.John Grisham does a good job of making the book about the death penalty, rather than the general flaws in the legal system. He also explains the reasons why gas chambers were an awful way to execute criminals.The condemned man in the story is clearly guilty, by his own admission, in the book; but Grisham makes him somewhat appealing: Grisham wants us to think about what should happen to this old white man, Sam Cayhall, a KKK member who participated in terror bombings in the South during the Civil Rights era. Grisham's clever idea for this book is to have Sam's grandson Adam Hall, who doesn't know his grandfather, handle the last few weeks of desperate appeals. Hall becomes a surrogate for a neutral observer in a situation where there can be no neutral observers.I was impressed by the plotting and character development in the story. Murder creates more victims than most people realize, even among the killer's family. Grisham adds those dimensions in persuasive fashion.The book's main weakness is that he pushes our noses a bit too much into nitty gritty of defending Death Row cases. Unless you are a lawyer (which I am), you won't find a lot of this very interesting. But if you are lawyer who hasn't been near a capital case, you'll find this book to be quite startling in terms of describing a situation for defense lawyers where they have little hope to win . . . but lots of chances to experience a broken heart.If you want a shorter look at Grisham's views on the subject, you might enjoy the non-fiction The Innocent Man more than The Chamber."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Usually Mr. Grishom's caricatures of American personalities are an amusing background to the suspence and action, but here it is the whole book. Also, it was almost embarassing for me to see him expose his own biases so close to the surface. He is not a great thinker, and he really just rehashes the same anti-capital punishment arguments over and over with little cosmetic changes. No action entertainment here, and I would have given it one star, except for some of the amusing caricatures."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This is my 1st John Grisham book. I found it extremely entertaining and thought provoking. If this is the quality of John's books I certainly look forward to reading others written by him."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"For me this was one of his better books. The reason is that I think he took a story line that had some real meaning and most of us see parts of on the TV all the time. He then really got into the characters and story. He develops it all the way to the end. I truly felt for the prisoner at the end of the book. The book does not move off the main path it set for itself. A lot of my friends felt the book was too slow or heavy, but for me I think most of his other books have been to easy and light. You have to and want to spend time with this book. The time pays off in the end with a book that you will remember for a good time to come."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This was a moving book- it had a hard plot. It was about death row life, and the choices that Sam Cayhall made to get there.It is also very controversial- it presents an important decision to be made within the plot about whether Sam Cayhall should be executed for his past crimes, or be allowed to live, since he was an old man and had reformed in his ways. It was not a book for people who can't take the hard reality that things do not always go as we want them to in life.I could not put this book down; it continually captured my interest through the ebbs and flows of the plot, and the surprises that unfolded throughout the story. It was detailed and painstakingly written.It presents past choices and death row life through the eyes of the inmate- Sam Cayhall. Adam Hall, who is Sam's grandson, is a lawyer, and chooses to legally represent him. Adam represents the hope that Sam will get to live.This story is an excellent example of the choices that we make in life, and the different consequences that follow them.I throughly enjoyed this book, and I recommend it to everyone who likes stories of reality, as well as a peek at the unknown stigma of death row. This was truly the best book by John Grisham that I have ever read. Grisham came through with his best once again!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"A thought-provoking tale of the last days on Death Row. Grisham has written believable, flawed characters in the racist old Southerner convicted of planting a deadly bomb in a Jewish lawyer's office 30 years earlier, and the idealistic young attorney fighting for a stay of execution.My husband and I listened to the audio version while driving through the Utah desert. When we arrived at our hotel, after an 8-hour drive, we didn't want to get out of the car because we would have to stop the tape! I've also read the book. I recommend both the tape and the book."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Ive read several John Grisham books and I have to tell you, Ive loved every one of them. I thinks its because every single one keeps you guessing. Every time you thought you had the ending figured out it changed. This book although a fictional story really makes you rethink your personal standing towards the death penatly. I found myself at many times during the book with wet eyes over the way John Grisham describes the scene, the smells and the emotions of the characters in teh story. All in all - I loved it!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Great story with adequate characterisation. However, if you're expecting some actions as in the movie, you'll be disappointed. In return, you'll probably discover the detailed process of a legal execution and read the thought of a prisoner about to be executed."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"A spin shaking thriller that has you from the first page and through the worst of times up untill the spin crushing end."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The book is a suspensful thriller which is impossible to find out untill the last page which tells everything."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"We read all of Grisham's books and found this the worst. It is boring and could last a half of the pages without losing anything. We only kept reading because we were hoping for something to happen at last, but it never happened."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"No one writes like Grisham and this is his best yet; the suspense is high throughout the book and peaks at the end. The characters are developed so fully, and the story flows so well it completely engrosses the reader. The reader can't help but to give thought to the great debate at hand. Don't miss this book !"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This was a wonderfully written book. Grisham is a master!!!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I could not put this book down. I have been reading The Chamber for about three weeks. The last 200 pages took me about 3 hours. Gripping and intense this book will hold you with it's hard hitting reality. I also gaurentee the ending is a shocker. This is the third Grisham book I have read (also street lawer &amp; The partner) and by far it was the most captivating yet. I am waiting to hit the book store soon so I can grab The Firm. I've heard great things and the more books I read from Grisham the more I want to conqer his entire collection."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"i have read four to five of grishams books.among them i find this one the best.grisham gives a sad ending which will make anyone to shed a drop of tear.the death penalty and the racism has been discussed in detailed manner."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This is a really great boo"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on \\"death row,\\" at least in the state of Mississippi, and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences. It touches on activities of the Ku Klux Klan. It was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty. However, some sympathy is found for the victims of crime. The story centers on Sam Cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime. Sam's grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from \\"death row.\\" The latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution. Meanwhile Sam shows repentance and response to the prison's chaplain.I found it to be one of the better John Grisham books."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber is an epic-like excursion into many of the issues regarding the gas chamber as a method of execution. The main protagonist is an old man who participated in a terrorist bombing of a Jewish attorney in Mississippi during the height of KKK activity.The other key character is his grandson, a fresh-faced attorney from a large Chicago-based law firm who only \\"discovered\\" his grandfather a few years earlier. He is his grandfather's last chance.This novel is peppered with facts about the gas chamber and about the litigation of the death penalty in general. The characterization of a large number of characters is deep and it makes you sympathize with a character as hateful as Sam Cayhall.This moves at a slower pace than many of his other novels, but this allows for greater character development, which I really enjoyed. I felt that I knew the characters as the novel was developing. I found this refreshing as many novels these days seem to skip the development of characters.This is my favorite Grisham novel thus far. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things. Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed. The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber. The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, \\"If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the \\"hero\\" to the story.\\" Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending. I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it. Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author. Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Mr. Grisham's book puts a very personal spin on the death penalty with the interesting twist of having a lawyer turn out to be the grandson of a the murderous racist convict. The book shows to literal evil of the codemned man. I was never persuaded to change my opinon of the death penalty. I agree with it. What this book convinced me that at some point a murderer can repent but that doesnt excuse that past crime. The portrayl of the condemned man in this book is brillant. This is an excellent books that flows smoothly and quickly."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This, like any good book, will cause you to think, and for me it was to question something at the time I agreed with. Grisham tells the story of a man who was put on Death Row, though he was only the driver of the get away car. It shows very well that death row is a very horrible place and almost barbaric.At the time I read this I was a believer in the Death Penalty, but this, if maybe not making me change my mind altogether, made me at least question it. This was the first thing I had ever read or even heard on how they treat people on Death Row and what they go through, even though they are criminals.Interesting thought provoking read, though somewhat predictable."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I enjoy the Grisham books for all the legal battle stuff - court rooms, strategy, filing briefs and motions, manuevering, etc.This book is a real eye opener about what life is like for a death-row inmate. Most of us have rather one-sided views - regardless of whether you favor the death penality or not.All in all, it is a good book. However, I agree with another reader who suggested that the ending left him feeling rather flat. It seems Grisham could have done more with the final chapter. He kinda leaves you in a funny spot with some unconcluded business."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"John Grisham's books are never hit or miss, they're always hits and so is this audio version of The Chamber, which centers on young lawyer Adam Hall. Affiliated with the most prestigious law firm in Chicago, Hall jeopardizes his career to defend a death row inmate, a rascist and former KKK member who is also his grandfather.Suspense mounts as Hall investigates a 1967 Klan bombing, uncovers a series of rigged trials, and digs up family secrets that were best left buried.Actor Beck who has performed previous audio thrillers by Grisham gives an able nuanced performance. Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Those who read alot of Grisham novels know that a typical book written by John Grisham is suspensful, fast-paced, and a quick read. Well don't expect that at all from THE CHAMBER. The book is almost 700 pages and the plot and storyline go alot slower, as the characters are more developed.The story starts with Sam Cayhall, a racist KKK member who bombed a Jewish lawyer's office killing his two sons. Sam Cayhall is about to be sentenced to death by the gas chamber. Adam, who is a fresh and young laywer, gets involved in the case. Adam is Sam's grandson who wants to know about his turbulent past. The book is about Adam's fight to try and save his grandfather from the gas chamber.The book is not preachy, but is a novel against the death penalty. It talks about botched executions, racial imbalances in executions, and how it is morally wrong. I am a believer in the death penalty, but this book has softened my views, though has not changed it. The book is also about Adam as he copes with his past, from his father's suicide to his aunt who wants nothing to do with Sam.A pretty good novel, though different from Grisham's usual work. It isn't a bad novel for sure, though it could use a bit of trimming. Grisham does make it hard to sympathize with Sam, because Grisham is well aware that generally the death row inmates are not angels."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I can't say I &quot;loved&quot; this story. Or that it's a &quot;great&quot; story. It's a very hard book to read - the issues raised are very intense and very difficult to read about. I ended up with questions I'd never had before, which made this book really valuable to me.The death penalty, racism, hate crimes, family struggles, forgiveness, taking responsibility for one's actions are all covered in this one book - it was truly an intense read.I cried through a lot of it. This is definitely not escapism, light reading! It's not terribly action-filled - very unlike other Grisham books I've read. But just as good as the other books I've read by him, if more emotional and heart-wrenching.I am very, very glad I read the book, and I'm very glad my son is reading it. Don't expect to walk away from this one with the same views you had when you started it."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I'm now right in the middle of reading John Grisham's \\"The Chamber\\". I discovered John Grisham several years ago. At one point in my life, I had lost my capability to read. When I got that capability back, I found the Author John Grisham. I truly enjoy his mixture of Novel/Educational writing! I've learned so much about our Law Makers and The Lawyers who work with the laws in a very interesting, delightfull way thanks to this special Author! This book concerns the first decade of my life. I can remember many of the events that John Grisham inserts materfully into this book during that decade. The 1960's! My children don't and can't conceive the events that took place during the Black American revolution! This book states the events in a clear manner. I would recommend this book for adults and children at their parent's discretion. If you like to read Novels that educate you, you'll love \\"The Chamber\\" by John Grisham!

Overall, this is one of the most brilliant John Grisham books that I have read.If you have'nt read it - read it. It is thought provoking - would it be ok to punish a peacefully living old man for crimes committed in his younger years ? How do lawyers influence public opinion for a Governer's clemency. Graphic detail of what happens in a death chamber... what if the shots fail ..."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber was in great shape for a used book. I am pleased with the service"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I think this book has portrayed fairly well on the position against the death penalty. It made more powerful argument than, I'd say, Life of David Gail. It has a more realistic ending as opposed to an happy ending of the most novels. The issue is between forgiveness as justice. Are we supposed to forgive even the worst of the mankind? Is death penalty justified for a cruel bloodthirst racist? The author is toward forgiveness in the novel. Anyways it was a book that makes you look at the other side of the coin if you're for the death penalty, and I strongly advise you to read it and give a second thought on death penalty if you support it. (That would probably include most of our politicians.)"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I liked this book but I dont believe its as good as some of Grishams other books."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I've read this book at least five times.

An excellent story line but excessively long. It could have been done better in my opinion. Otherwise this is an okay book."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I enjoyed this book.The Chamber features the usual marks that make Grisham a success -- taught stories, a serious central issue, good characters and believability.This is the story of a fractured family forced to confront its past through the impending execution of Sam Cayhill, scheduled to be put to death by the state for a bombing of a civil rights attorney in the South many years ago.Grisham explores the impact of violent racism and family dissolution on members of that family, the slow nature of the legal system in capital cases, and the changing mores of Southern common culture over the last five or six decades.His technical and legal exploration of the death penalty are not only informative but also interesting. I found his explanation of the mechanics and physiology of lethal injection particularly gripping. His characters, a young lawyer without any family but with lots of questions about them, and his aunt who has smothered her childhood memories with a blanket of booze are well drawn and move the story along nicely.I won't give away the plot lines. Suffice it to say that this is one of Grisham's finest efforts (along with The Firm, The Testament, and A Time To Kill). A quick read and solid story that does make you think."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"As I skimmed through all these reviews I couldn't help but putmy dissenting opinion in. It did not provoke any thoughts on my partabout capital punishment. In addition, I did not feel any connection to any of the characters nor did I care of their fates. The plot seemed to lack any real direction and Grisham seemed as if he was trying to draw the novel out to his standard 500 pages. Despite all of these detractions, This book was able to keep me riveted in a fashion only John Grisham's books can. In my opinion he can only go up from here."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"John Grisham did a wonderful job on this book. The subjuct grabs your attention and won't let go.

Although the crimes were horrible here lies the picture of someone who could have been a decent human being. This novel is thought provoking. Take a child and raise him on the seeds of hatred and you get Adam's pathetic grandfather who could not understand the impact his life made on the innocent ones. I cried for what he could have been. I cried for all of the children of the world who do not have a mother or father to cuddle them and love them and teach them to love others. It is so sad and so true what this book tells of.

I suppose that others did not get anything out of the story, but I sure did acquire a heightened awareness of the death penalty. The Chamber reveals that issues of the death penalty are neither black nor white....there is a lot of &quot;gray area&quot; surrounding each case. Of course, there will always be a conflicting sides on this issue, but this story does give insight into the type of people who do end up on death row.

I loved &quot;A Time To Kill&quot; but after a while, the same theme gets old. I wasn't too enthusiastic about picking up &quot;The Chamber,&quot; However, this book has had a huge impact on me. Grisham finally puts the burning cross aside and takes a real look at the ugly face of hatred. As former Ku Klux Klan member Sam Cayhall sits on Death Row, his grandson struggles to save his life. But the real story lies in the relationship that the two develop as Sam's appeals slip through the cracks. I never thought I would feel pity for a Klansman, but Grisham gives us not just a different perspective, but the whole picture."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"After reading The Rainmaker and The Client, I was suprised at this one. Its about a Klan-member who, along with two other guys, set a bomb in a lawyers office and killed two children. He is sentenced to death, and his grandson comes to help him. Along the way, he learns all about their famalies dark past. This one is much more serious than his other books. It really resembles the movie Dead Man Walking. Oh yes, it is depressing, with moments of lynchings, shootings, bombings, and suicide. But still, this is my favorite John Grisham novel."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber is another story written to appeal to readers who love realism, cold and unvarnished. Grisham is as always spell-binding. However, this story did not have the appeal that all of his others have had for me. It was simply too depressing. No doubt it is a message piece, but we get so much realism everyday and if you are looking for some &quot;reading for pleasure&quot; Grisham is disappointing in The Chamber."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"First of all, I usually despise Grisham novels--they are at most entertaining pieces of pulp fiction. But The Chamber is a truly literary achievement. It explores the burden of the past, especially in the Southern context. You might even have some clue that Grisham is from the great state that produced Faulkner, Williams and Willie Morris."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"A very thin story line, not entertaining, no excitement, disappointing.

Will the suffering endured on death row and the passionate intervention of his grandson make Sam regret his evil life?I enjoyed this book but it is simply not a John Grisham book. He sets you up for a typical John Grisham denoument, but it simply never happens, and I felt kind of cheated at the end.Still, a sobering and saddening look at the death penalty, and a fairly good read."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I hoped to see the earthbreaking &quot;wait&quot;, at the last second of the excution but harsh reality didn't seem to care what I hoped.

About 200 pages into it became clear that Grisham was using his success to make his political statement about the death penalty.

The plot is too simple, and the only exciting bit is whether they are gonna execute the guy or not..There is loads of good books out there, so pick another one."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I don't know what happened to this author lately. He used to write really good stories, but lately his books are kind of stale, and boring."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This is a well-written and gripping story about the execution of a despicable person. What is ironic is that the book is meant to show the immorality and futility of the death penalty but inadvertently shows the opposite. The killer's imminent execution moves him to true remorse for the first time in his life, and his heartfelt written apologies, delivered after his death to the families of his victims, are the kindest acts of his tragic life. It seems doubtful that either the remorse or the apologies would ever have occurred if the killer died in prison of natural causes years later.On the other hand, the book does highlight the cynicism and waste of the legal process, with hypocrisy from lawyers and politicians pursuing the execution and even worse from those opposing it. In fact the defense team knowingly suborns perjury by obtaining false expert testimony that the killer is too demented to even realize he is about to be executed.It is hard to deny that the death penalty, with the arbitrariness and legal game-playing that now contorts it, is an abomination. Yet before one concludes that no one should be ever be executed by any government, one should consider the ethical quandary of what should have happened to Adolf Hitler had he been captured alive by the US. Would life imprisonment have been a fair outcome? Should he have been allowed to live out his natural life in prison with luxuries provided by donations from his admirers, permission to publish and distribute his political opinions, A-one medical care that many middle-class Americans cannot afford, and even conjugal visits? Yet the over-generous interpretation of the ban on \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" would preclude denying a prisoner these \\"rights\\"."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber by John Grishman was an okay book. The good points of the book were the details, the legal \\"terms\\", and the realistic quality. The only downside of the book, to me, was how long it was. I felt that the story was carried out a bit more then needed. Overall, this book is decent. This book is for anyone who is interested in law, controversy, drama, and debatable topics. I also recommend this book to anyone who can stand to read 676 pages or more of John Grishman's writing."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"First of all, I would like to say who wrote the Editorial on \\"The Chamber\\" must not have been paying attention to the book. Adam was a young lawyer who was trying to save his grandfather, not his uncle from death row for killing two 5 year old boys and injuring their father, not 2 men. \\"The Chamber I thought was a book worth reading especially if you are into the suspense and great details about ones past and future. Along with the suspense and great details Adam and his Grandfather, get to know each other more, after they have been apart for 23 years, and they each learn about each others past whether it was about Sam's past with the Ku Klux Klan or if it was about Adams past liveing without a father or a grandfather. It also tells how it was in the south in the early 1950s. So if you are into a good book with esquisite details and this review caught your attention I believe everyone should take the time and read this john Grisham novel."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This is the first of JG's books that I read, and I loved it. It made me cry at the end, yes, but it was still a very good book. Adam is a truly caring person, and Sam seems like he's truly sorry for his sins. I wish that the high schools in this country would have their students read this book and then have discussions about the death penalty. It's a very daunting issue, one that too many of the American people are afraid to discuss because they feel it is too gruesome and too controversial to talk about in public. This book makes you think long and hard about your opinion on the death penalty."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"THE first time I heard of John Grisham is when I saw the trailer for the &quot;The Firm&quot;. I had just seen &quot;A FEW Good Men&quot;, and wondered to myself, OH NO not another movie where Tom Cruise plays the lawyer. To my surprise, the story was really good even if the ending was altered. I thought to myself that this author/scriptwriter must have written other books. Why not have a peek at one of them . That particular &quot;peek&quot; was &quot;The Chamber&quot;, and now, 4 years afterwards, here I am writing this online review. The relationship between Adam and Sam is really well penned. It just shows that bad seeds dont exist, ther is always a time for redemption be it intra or inter generation. Pity that the film wasn't that good."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I hate lawyers. So this book suits me fine. Written in superb Grisham style, the protaganist is a typically idiot lawyer who can't see the forest for the trees. He revels at how well he performs in court while performing service that is basically useless, both to his client and society.These aren't my only thoughts about this book but everyone's said the obvious ones already so I figured I say something different. I really did enjoy it although it was a little slow at times.I enjoyed the documentary aspect of it but then I put up with Michener books which are much worse. I don't see Grisham as trying to sell anyone on death penalty - for or against. He was telling it like it is - it's not one-sided. There are plenty of reasons for/against, none of them overwhelming winners. The whole thing is a mess, which is part of Grisham's point (or at least what I'll accept as his point). And I enjoyed reading about this mess."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"well i'm a really big grisham fan and this book was excellent..one of his best to date! it had me laughing and crying,hating and sympathizing, loving and loathing! it's a real roller-coaster ride of emotions and it poses all sorts of moral questions about the death penalty and the right of the government to legally kill humans! i guarantee you'll enjoy it-just like i did! don't be surprised if you can't see the last chapter through your tears! brilliant!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"While this book does make one think, it isn't really good fiction. The characters never achieve much more depth than they start the book with and the plot doesn't take the reader to any conclusion that feels complete. The book has the feel of a piece of true crime writing about a lackluster case.If John Grisham is really a writer of 'popular' fiction he certainly missed his audience with this one."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This book is BORING. It's slow moving and I wonder how John Grisham thought of such a boring plot. He is a good writer and has written many interesting books but this book is a total disappointment."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"John Grisham is one of the best authors there is who can write very long about nothing, and this book prooves it. Really, after about 20 pages nothing more happens, but Grisham just won't stop writing. The Chamber is a boring book that simply didn't need to be written. Grisham tries to make the dull story a bit interesting by making his standard young-lawyer hero into the convict's grandson, but he never really bothers to explore what this might do to both of them. And as I said, you can't really tell what he does insted, since it seems as if he's just putting words on the paper without knowing where he's going."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books and enjoyed them all except for this one. I found it boring - I don't know why I bothered to finish the whole book."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This is the first Grisham book I have read, and I liked his style of writing. It is an easy, fluid style and it also shows he feels comfortable tackling controversial issues such as Capital Punishment. I also liked the fact he isn't the kind of writer who believes in the &quot;prevailing of good&quot; like the rest of the authors out there do. Grisham is a writer of fiction, but it is fiction which is all too credible- and thus, much more frightening...."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Maybe it was because the Woodward verdict came through whilst I was reading this; that put me of legal eagles for sure, but to be honest I was struggling before that.

However, the last 150 pages was GREAT.. he actually had a different ending.. it was quite emotional. it wasn't the RUNAWAY JURY or the FIRM type ending but completely oposite.. in fact, I already knew if Sam lived or died, and I STILL found the ending to be VERY good.. that saved the whole BOOK.. accept with his aunt Lee... that was lame of what happened to her.. noting happened! she just &quot;appears&quot"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This book kept me reading!

But this was an excellent, dramatic, emotional story and I reccomend it to everybody."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Not one of Grisham's best. I really did not feel for the grandfather that Grisham's main character tried saving. You can read it but if you only had one choice, this is definitely not the book I recommend. :)"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This Grisham novel is one of his best of his works that I have read. It deals with a bombing that did more than it was supposed to. Nearly 15 years later the man is brought to justice. As his execution date draws near a grandson he's never met(who happens to be a lawyer) shows up to fight for his grandfather's life. This is an awesome thriller that questions whether it's worth the sorrow of an execution for justice to come about. I recomend this book to anyone. Be aware there are several portions of graphic content that might make you a bit queasy."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I was absolutely captured by this book. John Grisham is currently my fave as far as authors go. Sam Cayhalls' story was very interesting (I could like and dislike this man, particularily near the end of his story).

I am currently reading more of Johns' work and I do hope I am as interested."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The CHAMBER,is a gripping,mesmerizing,and chilling book that keeps you reading. I stayed up late at night because I could'nt put it down. I imagined the characters as real people and the subject matter is very relevent to our times.The death penalty is a very controversial subject that no one likes to talk about but it is something that we all think about.Grisham relly knows how to make you think. I really felt sorry for the characters in the book; something I thought I would never feel for convicted murders. A whole new insight was acheived. Not the best of Grisham's work,but worth the time."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

This a work by a literary genius never witnessed in any of grisham's works till date. Yes it's slow paced, sad ending and has none of the qualities i consider grisham's typical and aces. Nevertheless it's very informative and well written, excellently articulated and put forward. I did actually experience the life at the death row though not actually regretting the man's being there. Whatever a man does , he does'nt deserve to be killed. THAT is the baseline of the whole book which i think is excellently engraved into the readers mind.

Five minutes later, I figured out how cruel and strange life is, even when we're pretty sure of what to do or what to say. The Chamber is not a classic Grisham's, but who cares? At least it will make one stop and think about some facts and lives that run by our mere routine. Especially for guys who live in a country where executions are usually turned into shows. Don't need to mention it. By the way, I would have punched Sam Cayhall right in the chin."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I have read every one of Grisham's books except the Street Lawyer, and none of them have fallen short of excellent.

All I know is that it's a terrible piece of fiction. I gave up on Grisham after this one. I went along with the hype and read a few of Grisham's early works before I came to my senses and realized that he's a mediocre writer at best. If you want to give Grisham a try read The Firm or A time to Kill. They don't set any new literary standards, but at least they are entertaining. But do not enter this Chamber. It's amonumental waste of time"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This book deals with a grandson lawyer defending his murderer grandfather who is about to be executed. The book gives quite a lot of details bout the last minute moves of the law teams working for the state, but mainly those of the defense team. It also gives quite a lot of details about the lives of the people who are locked up in the death row, and a few stories of executions gone wrong - even though I'm not sure how accurate they are.The only problems in this book are the characters, that could use a little more developing as people, and the fact that even though the crime was described in detail at first, there's not a lot of sympathy toward the victims and their extended family later on - I don't agree with capital punishment myself, but I do think that the victims'family has a right for sympathy too..."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The death penalty is a highly-charged, emotional affair. Knowing this, Grisham proceeds to write a novel with almost no emotion in it. In what seems to be an attempt to persuade the reader against the death penalty, Grisham fails to present a plot which might change minds. Nobody would want the convict in this story to get gassed. Because the convict is such a sympathetic character, Grisham loses the opportunity to argue against the death penalty in those cases where the convict is less sentimental. In any event, the story is only mildly intriguing, but not a bad book if you're taking it to the beach for some easy reading."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I really like John Grisham and have read most of his books. This is a good story and nicely written with a weird last page.

Not a fast-paced thriller, but an interesting read."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Definately a Grisham. It's a great story with a sad and a little bit surprising ending. The man does deserve to be in prison for life (like all Klansmen and neo-nazis, whether they're guilty of a crime or not) but he doesn't deserve the death penalty. It's not like he meant to kill those children."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

But since it is Grisham, I ended up giving it 5. I did love this book, but it did seem to drag on a little bit especially near the end. The book did seem a little long to tell about 4 weeks worth of events. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the book greatly. The plot was well developed. The charcters were well developed. I do highly recomend it. But when you read it, be prepared to have just a small bit of trouble as the book begins to get nearer to the end.

It's an emotionally charged story that grips your interest and doesn't let go. You just can't put it down! The author weaves a tale so compelling even the most avid death penalty supporter might question their beliefs. It is extremely well written but might not be interesting to younger readers, and maybe even a bit too lengthy. Besides that, I'd reccommend it to virtually any reader. So check out The Chamber by John Grisham, another superbly written novel by one of America's favorite authors."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"STORY BRIEF:Three Ku Klux Klansmen plant a bomb in an attorney's office. Two children are killed. Only one of the men (Sam) is caught, and he stays silent about the other two. It is years later.

He is Sam's grandson. Adam and Sam now meet for the first time. The story is mostly about their interaction and Adam's attempts to stop the execution.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This is my fifth Grisham book. It wasn't as enjoyable as the others. I was frustrated that Sam wouldn't help himself by giving up names of others. But I understood his motive. He feared for the safety of his relatives. The plot might be interesting for some, but I wasn't entertained. I wanted a fulfilling or happy ending which I didn't get.

I've given 1 through 5 stars on previous Grisham books reviewed and this was one of the deepest, thought-provoking books I've read by this author. I've always been strongly against the death penalty and this book supports that personal conviction more than I thought a novel could.

It's typical Grisham, with sub-plots ad infinitum. About two thirds the way through, I just got bored and said to heck with it. None of Grisham's books have a definitive ending, they just kind of drift off and leave you hanging. This is no different.

The characters in \\"The Chamber\\" are better developed than some of his other books, notably some of his more recent books. As the reader, a bond formed between the main characters and I throughout the book. It was this closeness with the characters combined with a well-written story and thoughtful dialogue that provided me with the opportunity to contemplate something I had never really thought about before - the death penalty. I really enjoyed the book and recommend it to anyone who has read and enjoyed any of Grisham's other books."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"After a cursory glance at the reviews given this book by fellow readers, I am surprised to see that people cannot appreciate this book for what it really is. Grisham apparently intented to abandon his normal commercially appealing style in order for him to bring an important issue to the forefront. Grisham does an excellent job of weaving through the the processes involved in evoking the death penalty and infuses the story with sentiment from both sides. It would have been easy for him to stack all the cards against the death penalty, and have the main character merely be a pawn which was framed in a crime. Rather every time the reader feels excessive sympathy for Sam, another vile act from his past is exposed, and once again the readers sympathy is put in jeopardy. I think Grisham did a masterful job with this book, the only fault being its unecessary length. This book could have been easily abridged by approximately 150 pages."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Having enjoyed many of Grisham's earlier books, I looked forward to his latest novel. However, this book lacks plot, mystery, intrigue, character, and suspense. Basically, he takes too many pages to say &quot;the death penalty is bad&quot;. I never felt compassion for the convicted murderer and couldn't believe that any grandson would actually go through these motions. Don't waste your money or time on this one."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I have read all Grisham books, seen (afterwards) all Grisham movies, but none is as dissapointing as this book. All through reading the book I was waiting for the suspense to start. I thought many times: when does the story start.

After finishing it I had a very unsatisfied feeling and wanted to read The Chamber II, the sequel... Maybe the story is in there....."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"One of the best of Grisham's batch of legal bestsellers.You'll find it hard to lay down once you start and beforeyou're done you'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll surely questionyour own views on the death penalty. I was an avowed advocateof capitol punishment before reading this book;now I'm notso sure! It's hard to imagine caring about the fate of aconfessed killer, but under Grisham's skilled pen, Sam becomesa real person and somebody you actually feel like you know.Theidealistic young lawyer, Adam, who finds the grandfather henever knew and a cause he never imagined, is a hero who is bothlikeable and plausible.Definitely a recommended read."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Rainmaker is my favorite book. I'm only 11 so you may find me a bit immature to recommend a book to a person who is an adult. I was extremely dissapointed with this novel. The plot was extremely dull, and I could only bring myself to read half of it. I am still questioning whether or not Grisham actually wrote this book. It dragged on almost as badly as &quot;Titanic&quot; and was a complete waste of time. I sincerely do not recommend it to anyone, even if you do enjoy the author's books as much as I do. It is not as exhililrating as &quot;The Firm&quot; and &quot;The Pelican Brief,&quot; as heartwarming as &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; and &quot;The Street Lawyer,&quot; and the book is just a disappointment. I have sympathy for anyone who brought them through the entire book."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber is well-written and has a decent storyline. As such, it is a typical John Grisham legal thriller, although, as it happens, it is not one of my favorites. The plot is relatively simple: a young lawyer discovers that a close relative of his is on Death Row for the murders of two young kids, who were accidental victims of an intended murder aimed at a civil rights worker. (The children were the intended victim's children). No question that the bomb was either intended to or likely to kill people. Just not the two kids. The young protagonist then resolves to defend the murderer pro bono to try to prevent his execution.The problem with The Chamber, in my opinion, is that it takes the racist murderer of two small boys, and spends the first half of the novel making this man out to be a wretchedly hateful racist. Now, this is probably accurate in the sense that the people who perpetrated the murders of civil rights workers in the 1950s-1960s certainly were by and large like that. But then, in the last portion of the novel, the novel does about a 150 degree turn and this man more or less becomes a flawed saint, who flails away at the injustice of the death penalty, and we are all supposed to realize that since this &quot;saint&quot; is about to fall &quot;victim&quot; to the death penalty, the death penalty is somehow unjust. It just didn't make sense to me. This guy deserved to die and is precisely the type of wretch that proponents of the death penalty have persuasively argued merit such punishment. The novel would have made its point much more effectively had the person sentenced to death been wrongly convicted--in my opinion this would have made the novel much more compelling. Oh, sure (**very minor spoiler**) it turns out that another person is much more involved in the deaths of the two kids than the convicted person, but that doesn't change my feeling that the convict deserved his punishment, and that this caused Grisham to miss his point by a Tennessee mile.The Chamber is not a bad read for all that, although it is too long and too preachy. Grisham could have made his point much more effectively than he does here, and also written a better and more compelling novel by doing so."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This was one of the worst books I've read in my life. The dialog was terrible in the book and there were many loose ends and undeveloped subplots in the book. I can't go into details because it would give away the ending, but basically at the end of the book, you end up thinking to yourself, &quot;Wait a minute, whatever happened to this person and this subplot? What did that event have anything to do with anything else in the book?&quot; It was an example of sloppy thinking and poor editing on the editor's part. If you buy this book against my advice, I suggest that you read the dialog to yourself and see how phony it sounds. Nobody talks like that. Basically, Grisham is writing as he always has, he thinks he's writing a movie. It's not literature, it's Hollywood scenes on paper. It's really poor writing."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I've read nearly every one of John Grisham's books and while I like almost all of them, it is my opinion that his best work was done in his first 5 books, those being A Time To Kill, The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, and The Chamber. The Chamber, to me, is the most powerful among these books because more than any other book by Grisham, it brings a hot button justice issue out in the open and it challenges the way people think about that issue. Before reading The Chamber, I was 100% in support of the death penalty for murderers . . . and eye for an eye so they say. I guess in some ways, I still am. However, The Chamber made me question my beliefs on capital punishment. I finished the book thinking that perhaps the death penalty isn't always the most suitable punishment for a murderer. It is just as simple to say \\"an eye for an eye\\" as it is to say that killing is wrong and this book definitely makes you consider both sides of the issue.The ending scene is, without a doubt, the most power scene that you will find in any Grisham book. I am a grown man and I can say without pride that I was moved to tears by The Chamber's final pages. If you're a Grisham fan or a book enthusiast of any kind or even if you have a strong stance on either side of the capital punishment debate, you simply must read The Chamber."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Yet again, another book that outshines the movie! An older one of Grisham's collection, showcases his true talent for writing suspenseful stories.The Chamber is about Sam Cayhall who is on deathrow for a bombing he took part in 30 years prior- when he was a part of the KKK. Now, in the early 90's, his grandson has become obsessed with trying to save his life and uncover the truth about who his family is really made up of.The book kept me interested from cover to cover. I noticed some people did not enjoy so much of the legal stuff, but I found it quite interesting and very easy to follow. I will admit the character of Sam is a hard one to grasp, you hate him for the crime he committed, yet the book is written so well, you can't help but feel for his fear at being put to death. It also raises a lot of questions on whether legalized killing should be allowed."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This book tries to stir debates about the death penalty, but it only stirs debates about Grisham waning talent.If you are a Grisham fan, you will read this book. If you are not a Grisham fan, and you want to see what the fuss is about, pick another Grisham novel."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"A great book...maybe not one of Grisham's best. I have to say it was very unpredictable and not usual Grisham. I say it could've been better in that if it had a little more action, for example: Lets say Sam decided to talk and Wedge decided to take action...That in my oppinion Grisham could have made very interesting, but none the less the book got its message through even to me, a thirteen year old without a whole lot of reading experience, and made me want to read more Grisham."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This is a good book giving insight to the justices and perhaps injustices of death row. It is a long story(Paperback is 600+ pages)which will loose some readers because often the story seems to provide filler information not critical to the plot. However, stick with it, it is definitely worth reading. There are plenty of twists which keep your interest."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This is a very good book , it really touches on the reality of death row. Grisham gets into the head of a death row convict , and also shows how justice isn't always fair ."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The book has a good beginning and plot. The suspense is also good and like all of Grisham's books the twists in along the story line are unusual and suspenseful, but the book tends to drag on and repeat itself. The ending is surpising. Not nearly as good as some other books by Grisham."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This is a great Grisham novel, with most of the classic pieces of his novels, including the great young lawyer attacking a big case. This book is more emotionally charged than others, due mostly to the subject matters. Due to the lack of &quot;court room drama&quot; this book reads a bit slower, but do not give up on this book! It is the whole picture that is worth it, not just pieces."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This is the least of John Grisham's works. I found it slow and at times boring. He attempts to make a case against capital punishment (not a very good one however) and his political agenda overshadows the story line. Worth reading but only if you have already read his other books."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Where was the punch to the book? Very mundane. No suspense. More like a documentary on death row inmates."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Oh my God....it has taken me a month and a half to get through this book. I dread going to bed at night to read it in spite of my dogged determination to get through it. While I find most of Grisham's stuff to be shallow but at least entertaining, the Chamber, however, is dull dull dull. Having bamboo shoved under my fingernails is sound pretty good as an alternative to yet one more evening struggling through this book. Next time you're browsing the Grisham section leave this one on the shelf you wouldn't want to disturb the dust."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Perhaps this book does not have the drama or storyline evoked in such titles as 'the client or'the firm' this book is still worth the effort to read. This is not a storyline that will appeal to everybody nor is it a book that everyperson will have trouble putting down, but i believe that this although not his best work is still up there with the best of them , especially in the way that we are left pondering the fate of sam cayhall until the second last page , where it is confirmed that sam will die at the hands of an executioner."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The last 100 pages of this book are as riveting as any in Grisham's books. It will definitely be thought-provoking and a tear-jerker (if you have any emotions!). One of the most moving books by Grisham. Yes, you need to evaluate your own views on death penalty - but read this book!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"I was surprised Grisham could write something this boring. This is by FAR his worst novel. Halfway interesting at the get-go, this story just turns into a sleeper. I didn't think it was ever going to end (with a predictable ending might I add). Are we supposed to feel sorry for this convicted murderer? I think not. The movie's even worse."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber by John Grisham is a compelling, powerful, and totally hypnotic novel. This dark and thoughtful tale is pulsing with moral uncertainties and will leave you thinking long and hard about the death penalty. A thrill ride from start to finish, it is impossible to put down. In Grisham's usual style, this book is well researched and bitterly realistic. He opens up explosive issues, including capital punishment and racism, with ease and compassion. His amazing insight into the human spirit will leave tears in your eyes. The Chamber draws you in and sweeps you up in a whirl-wind of emotion. It will linger on your mind long after you've flipped the last page. The basic principles debated in this heart-wrenching story will spark intellectual conversation and permeate every reader to the core. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is unsure how they feel about legal execution, and even to those who think they have their mind made up. This book exceedes expectations and goes far beyond entertainment. It is definitly one of Grisham's best!"},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"The Chamber opens avenues for a person to rethink capital punishment. (that is if you are an open minded individual) Well written with characters one feels as if they've know for some time. I find there are 3 groups of J. Grisham fans: 1.) Readers who liked The Chamber and A Time to Kill and think his other books don't measure up. 2.) People who like every book 'other' than The Chamber and A Time to Kill 3.) A person who thinks all of his books are wonderful. Some subjects people find unconfortable to deal with, so their way of handling the situation is to turn their head and look the other way. Living in Texas, up until this book this was my way of dealing with the death penalty. Make breaking the law tougher and the penalties more servere. Taking another life is not the answer. Read this book. Yes the beginning is slow, but it picks up and turns out to be a very fine piece of writing."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Why does Grisham keep selling? I got through the first 30 pages and finally finished this book in bits and pieces over the next year. It's boring and poorly written. Grisham apparently had one good book: the Firm. I hate to say it as a fellow Mississippian ,but with the possible exception of King, Grisham is the most over rated writer today. He should read a Koontz or a Clancy and get an idea of what a good thriller really should be."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"It's a whole lotta book that goes a whole lotta no place."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"This has to be the worst of Grisham. By &quot;sleeper&quot; I mean you will probably fall asleep many times before you get through this one. I started it this past summer and finally finished it in the fall. The book starts out great, but drags along after several chapters. All the slow detals on the gas chamber and the people on death row. Don't waste your time, try The Testament instead."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"Thanks for the prompt, accurate delivery of this product."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"One of his best. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Chamber","review":"It isn't easy for a lover of serious fiction to want to pick up a John Grisham book because of his constant bestseller status. But here, Grisham has clearly written something that ranks with our best serious authors. This book was very informative, gripping and suspenseful. I love the way Grisham got into the mind of the racist South. The passages that describe the gross hypocrisy of Southern racists who commonly slept with African American women (even during the Jim Crow era), while endlessly ranting about African American male lust for \\"the white woman,\\" were much appreciated. Obviously, their obsession had everything to do with fear that if African American men had the same freedom that they took for granted, then they'd do to the proverbial \\"white woman\\" what Southern Caucasian men routinely did to African American women. The complexity of the characters in this book was also very satisfying. This one, at least, is an outstanding example of mainstream fiction."},{"Title":"Caedmon Short Story Collection","review":"This is a truly marvelous collection of short stories on audiocassette. The choice of stories excellent on its own, but when you consider the readers (some of whom are the authors themselves) it's even better!My favorite stories here include &quot;The Lottery&quot; - just as chilling as I remember it, even though I know how it will come out; &quot;Owl Creek Bridge,&quot; which is wonderfully read by McCallum; &quot;The Diamond Necklace,&quot; which is one of the nastiest tricks played on a story's main character that I've ever read; and &quot;Tobermory,&quot; just because it's Saki and cats. [If they'd chosen &quot;Shredni Vashtar&quot; instead as the representative Saki tale I'd have had to figure out how to give the collection 6 stars!] I enjoyed listening to all of the stories, many of which were unfamiliar to me; Welty's reading of her own story is a hilarious, breathless take on a small-town family, Lotte Lenya's reading of Kafka is relentlessly chilling, Kiley's reading of Thurber is dry and funny - heck, they're all good.The only slight quibble I'd make is that there's very little space in between stories; they pretty much lead right in to one another. This means that if you want to pause to contemplate the story you've just heard, you should stop the tape the instant it's over, or else you'll be caught up in the next tale instead."},{"Title":"Caedmon Short Story Collection","review":"I'm currently listening to this series of short stories on CD and thus far they are excellent. The problem is, the titles of the stories are given very quickly and the narrators don't tell the names of the authors. There is no listing of the stories on the cover or on the CD or on the inside jacket. I would love to know the name of each author as the story starts. Would have have been so difficult?"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I love to share books with my daughter from my childhood.

These books really encourage kids and make them WANT to learn. There is no doubt that an advanced reader at a young age is set for life with a superb knowledge of the English language - and kids who read this will want to keep reading.

His drawings add to the fun, helping to create mental pictures for the reader.I often read about how great this book is from kids, parents, and teachers. Silverstein's poem \\"Sick\\" is a popular favorite. I remember hearing this poem read aloud in school years ago.Many of the poems are about wacky characters and are just plain crazy! Other poems give advice. They vary in length from very short to long.The nutty style of a number of the poems is similar to that in \\"Piranhas in the Tub,\\" by Asher Jones.As a children's book author, I highly recommend \\"Where the Sidewalk Ends\\" to kids and grown-ups...."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"The book &quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot; is a very good book full of good and entertaining poetry along with drawing s to go with most of the poems.

I had to read it for summer reading and I had never read poetry. Made me laugh out loud! My favorite is about taking out the Garbage! Funny funny book!"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Of all the Shel Silverstein collections, this one is my favorite. There are many classic poems in this book that I still remember from childhood. My mother refused to give up her Shel Silverstein books when I found out that I was expecting, so I had to buy my own. This is a must, must, must for your children. They will love the catchy subjects and \\"bouncy\\" writing style that Shel has perfected! Read and enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I discovered Shel Silverstein as a teenager, when someone gave my sister a copy of this book. Unfortunately for her, she never saw it. I confiscated it and read it, cover to cover, memorizing many of the poems. (I didn't realize at the time that he was the same author of the quintessential kid's tearjerker, \\"The Giving Tree\\" - another profound look at human motivations, just as this book is.) Later, when I began working with kids, these poems served me well, as I often recited \\"Hector the Collector\\" and \\"The Alligator's Toothache,\\" much to the children's delight.What is truly wonderful about Silverstein is not just his creativity, as fantastic as that is. It's the way he winks at adults through his insights. It's meant for kids, of course, with the requisite sing-song rhymes, colorful vocabulary and witty characters and situations. But throughout it all, it's as if Silverstein is looking over his shoulder at parents, giving us a knowing grin. He's wise, too. More than once, I've remarked about one of his lines, \\"Yes, that's so true!\\"I ordered this new edition because I can't seem to find the book I \\"stole\\" from my sister as a child, and I wanted to read it with my children. Already, the oldest, at just 3, is begging for it, and together, we laugh and laugh. I believe that it's a wonderful, essential book on any family shelf."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Have you ever read a POETRY book straight through? Probably not. This is a book that you will read every page of, and enjoy it all"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Children have treasured Silverstein's poems and illustrations for over 25 years now. He has a way of appealing to the sense of humor of most people. The surprise ending is also a common element that keeps the reader interested. His poems range in style from simple one-line jokes, to narrative epics with a repeating chorus. The illustrations, like the poems, are sparse and very simple. The entire work has a feeling of incompleteness with the vast expanses of white space left on the pages. The voids in the book are meant to be filled by the reader's experience with the poems and illustrations. Everyone will bring something differ-ent to these poems and will therefore be effected in a different way. The page design and illustrations of Silverstein not only allow that interaction between book and reader, but also encourage it.Why 5 stars?:The simplicity of Silverstein's words and illustrations appeal to every reader, not just children. They show how reading can be interesting and interactive. Everybody can find a favorite little verse from this book."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"My teacher read this book to the class when I was 7-8 and I LOVED this book!

Now I work in daycare and I read this book to children.. and I hope it means half as much to them as it did to me..My BeardMy beard grows to my toes, I never wears no clothes, I wraps my hair Around my bare,And down the road I goes.This was just one of the funny, life changing poems Mr. Silverstein has written in this book.. Do yourself and your child a favor and buy this book."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"My only hope is that Shel Silverstein will one day be given his full credit as one of the most important poets of our (or any) time. To say that he was a mere 'childrens' poet wouldn't do the man credit. I won't go into his history, you can do that yourselves.&quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot; is a perfect example of poetry done right. Sometimes it rhymes, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's not. But, just like Dr. Suess' books, we go back long after our 'childhood' has ended. We want to relive our childhood. There aren't enough kind words in my vocabulary to recommend this (or any of his other books) highly enough."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Every child should experience the genius of Shel Silverstein.

Finally I recommend this book because the author is very creative, it is a very nice book!- Keyli F. Gomez"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I've got a lot of fond memories of this book. I used to read the poems over and over again when I was younger. I found them quite hilarious and entertaining. It's no mystery to me that this book has survived and been prosperous for over thirty years.My favorite poem in it is called: Smart. It is about a boy who is labeled smart by his father. Then, to either live up to his father's expectations or to prove to himself the worthiness of his new title, he goes around exchanging his monetary items for ones of higher quantity, but of lower combined value. Example: he exchanges one one dollar bill for two quarters! The humorous climax when the kid tells his dad of his ventures, and the dad's obvious embarrassment help make, Smart, a cute and mind provoking poem that I really enjoyed as a kid and still do today.Children will enjoy this book, and parent be warned, your kids probably will come to you with questions (not that that's a bad thing).Darien Summers, author of The Mischievous Hare, a children's book.The Mischievous Hare"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I love this book!!!

All of these poems are my favorites. This book is certain to get your child reading. Many of his poems are associated with religion like the one about the unicorn especially. I love all these poems and hope you will like them too."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Instilling proper values in children must be done at a young age in order that these values take root and develop into a virtuous code of ethics from which the child may base his/her system of beliefs. This requires parents being disciplinarians. However, the trade-off for taking the role of disciplinarian is the diminishing of the role of friend to the child. Many people find it difficult to &quot;nicely&quot; enforce rules; many children find it difficult to see an &quot;authority figure&quot; as a &quot;friend.&quot;Shel Silverstein provides a method of humorously teaching children not only to read and enjoy reading, but, through the deeper meanings of his poetry, also a fundamental sense of &quot;right and wrong.&quot; Through poems such as &quot;...Cynthia Stout...Would Not Take the Garbage Out,&quot; Silverstein comically portrays the problem Cynthia encounters by not doing her chores. While this seems to be a trivial event, and the child may find great humor in such a poem (as s/he should), parents, teachers, day-care specialists may relate the theme of this poem to different values, such as obeying one's parents, taking responsibility, or the stretch could even be made to the obligation to recycle.Through such poems as Silverstein's, adult role models may advocate for, instill, and enforce necessary values in children by making analogies between these poems and real-life situations without seeming brutish. Children may now enjoy learning about &quot;right and wrong.&quot;"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I remember reciting &quot;Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout&quot; in front of my class when I was a child.

I will treasure them forever as they gave me an excellent reading foundation and sparked my interest in poetry.Excellent teaching tool."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Growing up and attending school, I had to read poetry every single year. Whether it was Anton Chekhov and Milton in college, Shakespeare in elementary school, or Dante and Homer in high school, I found it all boring and sometimes hard to fathom. Instead, the only poetry I found enjoyable were those by Shel Silverstein in this book and his other classic, A Light in the Attic. Before there was Harry Potter, there was Shel Silverstein's poetry. Fun, enjoyable, easy to read, with minimal need of understanding; these are probably the most famous poetry put out by an American author.

Have more fun than you ever remember having for Shel has his own style. This book is written specifically for those kids ages nine through twelve but, once you have on your happy hat, you will be transformed back to happy, happy times.Shel Silverstein has written poems, stories, songs (\\"A Boy Named Sue\\", for Johnny Cash) and plays. He sings, shouts, tells and draws his happy places. It is the reader's fundamental duty to pass these fun filled passages on to the children of the world and never forget the fun we have had with these books.

Don't miss them!\\"The Dirtiest Man in the World\\"Oh I'm Dirty Dan, the world's dirtiest man,I never have taken a shower.I can't see my shirt--it's so covered with dirt,And my ears have enough to grow flowers.I'm musty and dusty and patchy and scratchyAnd mangy and covered with mold.But the water is always a little too hot,Or else it's a little too cold.[Juvenile Poetry--or is it? Students also love to recite such poetry.]The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Like this amazing book actually needs any more praise showered on it. (Well, it's going to get it anyways, so it had better learn to live with it!) Can anyone say anything negative about this book? (well...other than the book banners, but we all know very well what humongous Delusionals they are.) Anyways, everyone's read this book (and if you haven't, then dear, I really do pity you and your lost childhood) and everyone knows how amazing it is. The second and third and fourth rereads only give you more adorable things to catch. It's funny--when I last read this book, I was much younger, and the poems that made me laugh most were the ones involving nose-picking and the like. Now, some of my reactions were the same, but others were completely different. The poem on which the title is based, Where the Sidewalk Ends, is now an amazing, new poem, as is Forgotten Language, which actually had me shed a few tears. But it's not all sentimental. SARAH CYNTHIA SYLVIA STOUT (yes, it has to be capitalized. Just doesn't have the same effect otherwise) is still as laugh-out-loud hilarious as it was when I had to memorize it for an elementary school poetry project. For Sale will still have me half shuddering, half laughing, as I remember my own brother shouting, \\"Sister for Sale, Sister for Sale!\\" after reading it. Some are just stories, some are wise outlooks on life. All of them are sure to guide children from a happy childhood into a happy adulthood, and it's one of the most worthwhile reads you'll ever find.Rating: 5/5"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"The poems are very well written, however, one poem actually talks about multiple personalities so I think, there a little bit inappropriate for children."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"It is a fantastic book it is one of the funniest books I read.

It's a good one I promise.Shel Silverstein wants us to laugh and have fun. Don't be up tight be able to laugh your head off.

It was a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Silverstein is one of the few writers that are as enjoyable on the third and fourth re-readings as on the first. His entire body of work is excellent.One note given the push to ebooks: Silverstein as also an artist who drew all of his supporting art work, selected the proper typeface and carefully selected the paper for its look and even its feel. He never authorized paperbacks. I read a lot of ebooks, but please do not add this volume to your Kindle list. That would be a slap in Uncle Shelby's face."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I bought this for my nephew - and my poor brother who has to read the same things to him again and again.

The poems and stories are whimsical and intelligent with a little tidbit of wisdom to bring away from each. Please buy this"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Shel Silverstein, a great poet, has written lots of books, one being the one I have read, Where the Sidewalk ends. This great book has a variety of topics and uses many different forms of figurative language, such as letting animals speak and having a dentist go into a crocodile's mouth. You can always paint the picture in your mind that gives you a whole world just about that poem. He can make you believe that anything is possible with any of these poems in this book. Shel Silverstein and his book, Where the Sidewalk Ends is a really extraordinary book.My favorite poem is called \\"My Beard\\". It is about a guy who has a beard and doesn't wear any clothes. He wraps his beard around his body, and runs down the road. It is my favorite poem because it is a really funny poem and my sister and I read it together once in a while. I also enjoy it because he is such a little man and he runs and runs around with just his beard as his clothes.Another poem I like was the poem called \\"Orchestra\\". I like it because it tells you that you don't have to have any fancy equipment to be good at something. I can connect to that because the trumpet I am using is really, really, old but I can still play better than some people with shinier and newer trumpets. It teaches lots of people lessons because when you are looking for some kind of equipment for anything you want to do, you normally think that the best equipment will make you better than all the rest, which is normally not the case. It seems like as long as you have fun, you can be the best at anything you want to do. \\"Orchestra\\" is a great poem.One poem coming close to my favorite is called \\"Pirate Captain Jim\\". In it, a captain tries to get a little kid to do some jobs on deck, but he says he cannot do any of those jobs, so he becomes a Captain. Jim says he cannot swim, so he couldn't walk the plank. Then, he says he cannot sail through the gale or go with the saves down to row. He can't work so he can't be a captain's clerk so he ends up being a pirate captain. I thought it was funny how the Captain was so nice so that since the little boy could not swim, he didn't have to go off the plank, and then he was raised in position until he became captain, which he sounded like he had no problem with being. Personally, I think the little boy was just saying that he couldn't do all those things so he would end up as captain, so I think he was a devious little fellow.One classic poem that I like is \\"Generals\\". It is where two generals, General Clay and General gore, don't want to have a silly war. So they try to have an excuse to go to the beach and they like their ideas, but then they think about bad thoughts such as \\"what if the sand is blown away?\\" and other setbacks like \\"My bathing suit is slightly tore\\". So they end up going on with their war and then there is no more of general Clay or General Gore. I really enjoy reading this poem because every two rhymes line, and it has a great rhythm. It is so sad that general Clay and General Gore will not see another war.Personally, I think that Shel Silverstein is a great poet and I think that Where the Sidewalk Ends is his best book. If anyone says that they do not like poetry, I would have to recommend that they would read Where the Sidewalk ends. The books poems just make you want to read one after another after another until you have read every poem in this book ten times. Overall, Where the Sidewalk Ends is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"This has to be one of my most favorite books from childhood.

A great compelation of poems that will have you laughing throughout the day. When I first picked this book up, I couldn't put it down for its gripping the reader techniques with such humorous poems.With characters in his poems ranging from any animal to any human, this book definitely has variety. I love the way Shel is able to rhyme things together and come up with such great stories in his poems......this is very evident in this book.Most of th peoms run about half a page, some long, some short. All of course, though, have humor and really show the work put in to them. This poem book is one of Silverstein's finest and deserves some sort of award.I want to thank Shel Silverstein for creating such a wonderful poem book and such great ideas that make you want to read the whole book in one sitting. That would definitely take time though it would be worth it.As you can see, I really recommend anyone of any age buying this book so they can enjoy it as much as I did.

The author, Shel Silverstein, had an incredible gift. He could make kids fans of poetry! (One of those kids happened to be my 38 year-old father). From the moment I opened the book and recited &quot;Sick&quot; for the very first time, I fell in love with Mr. Silverstein's books.My brilliant teacher had each member of the class perform a poem from &quot;Where The Sidewalk Ends&quot;. He made lovers of poetry of us all, and an actress out of me. For years to come, I won numerous talent contests performing &quot;Sick&quot; for audiences of all ages.I love each and every poem in this book. Everybody who loves to laugh MUST read &quot;Ma and God&quot;, &quot;Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout Would Not Take the Garbage Out&quot;, &quot;The Dirtiest Man In the World&quot;, and &quot;Sick&quot;, my all-time favorite.&quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot; and Shel Silverstein changed my life forever. It was today, May 10, 1999, that I read he had passed away. The world has lost an amazing contributer to children's literature. &quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot; and all of Mr. Silverstein's other books are the delightful legacy that he has left behind.

Do yourself and your child a favor and buy this book."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"My only hope is that Shel Silverstein will one day be given his full credit as one of the most important poets of our (or any) time. To say that he was a mere 'childrens' poet wouldn't do the man credit. I won't go into his history, you can do that yourselves.&quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot; is a perfect example of poetry done right. Sometimes it rhymes, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's not. But, just like Dr. Suess' books, we go back long after our 'childhood' has ended. We want to relive our childhood. There aren't enough kind words in my vocabulary to recommend this (or any of his other books) highly enough."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"This Special Edition is a collection of 139 poems by Shel Silverstein, originally appeared in 1974 - some short, some long and most of them are accompanied by his own drawings, overflowing with humor and heart. When asked to pick a book from a list of 40 titles, both my kids (ages 6 & 8; girl & boy) requested to read WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS and their enthusiasm attests to the warm truth that since his passing in 1999, his words, both unique and universal, still speak deeply to today's kids. Shel makes children laugh. Can you imagine a Hippopotamus sandwich? In this book not only will you read one, you will see one, too! Shel makes children think - just about everything in the most daring original way. Shel sees the world through the goofy imaginative eyes of children and his invitation to take a walk to the edge of this silly wolrd is greeted with excitement by both kids and their grown-ups.\\"And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,For the children, they mark, and the children, they knowThe place where the sidewalk ends.\\""},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Shel's books are a wonderful way for parents and kids to enjoy the experience of reading together.

We spent hours pouring over this book as children. Few can match the zany fun of Silverstein in this childrens poem book. From the crazy drawings, to the crazy lines in his poems. It sparked an interest in poetry and writing for both myself and one of my other sisters. My oldest sister would read aloud to us, or we'd read to each other.

I can still hear my fourth grade teacher hollerin \\"SISTER FOR SALE!!! SISTER FOR SALE!!\\" or my dad's muffling of a man voice as the last line is interrupted by the boa constrictor. Now as a parent I have a new level of enjoyment as I give these memories to my two daughters as they look up gleaming imagining beyond the lines and into the voices of these poems.

The system in America is not here to serve the few; America is here to serve the people - that means everyone. The people own the country and the system. The wicked that are up there cheating and stealing people's money must be eliminated from their positions and the new management must understand that they do not deserve compensation and millions in bonuses. They are not even smart enough to stay in business. They always look for bailouts from the government and its taxpayers. What kind of mentally incompetent management is that? Look at the chaos that they have caused around the world. Look at the chaos and the misery they have brought to people in this country and abroad. What are they - ignorarnt, stupid, or just smart thieves? What makes them think they deserve all of this, and that some other people don't deserve anything? What's so special about them?

I enjoyed this book as a child and thought he may also. Although he is only six months old at the moment he enjoys me reading to him at bedtime and this book is much more fun than the typical infant books.

See from the age of 2 to the age of 15 I was abused verbally and physically by my father and step father and my teacher found out about it and tried giving me safe care by giving me these books to read whenever I needed security or a good laugh.

I am most happy that I can share this book of poems with my 5 year old daughter and hope she finds the same enjoyment I found.This book is highly recommended not only for the poems, but for the illustrations too! The pictures are humorous and will keep any child entertained for years."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Children have treasured Silverstein's poems and illustrations for over 25 years now. He has a way of appealing to the sense of humor of most people. The surprise ending is also a common element that keeps the reader interested. His poems range in style from simple one-line jokes, to narrative epics with a repeating chorus. The illustrations, like the poems, are sparse and very simple. The entire work has a feeling of incompleteness with the vast expanses of white space left on the pages. The voids in the book are meant to be filled by the reader's experience with the poems and illustrations. Everyone will bring something different to these poems and will therefore be effected in a different way. The page design and illustrations of Silverstein not only allow that interaction between book and reader, but also encourage it.Why 5 stars?:The simplicity of Silverstein's words and illustrations appeal to every reader, not just children. They show how reading can be interesting and interactive. Everybody can find a favorite little verse from this book."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"This book is a collection of funny and crazy stories that are sure to please any age. I enjoyed this book as a child and I enjoyed it even more this time. I found that looking at it with new eyes really brought out more humor in the poems. I especially enjoyed the diversity of every poem in this book. I think Silverstein's idea for writing this book was to show children that poetry can be fun. It is a great book to use in the classroom for introducing poetry and a new style of writing."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I remember this book being in my elementary school library.

It is a fun experiance for my whole family."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Dear readers, This book is a great book. I think poems are one of the best types of writing and Shel Silverstein is one of the best poets. I also really like silly books. Where The Sidewalk Ends is a bunch of silly poems and illustrations. I recommend this book for all ages. If you like silly books this is a great book for you. One of the poems is called \\"Boa Constrictor.\\" This poem is about a person that is being eaten by a boa constrictor and he doesn&#8217;t like it one bit. Another one is called \\"Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me Too\\" about 3 people who go for a ride in a flying shoe. All of these poems are good You really should consider getting this book."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Shel Silverstein does it again. This time with &quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot;. A great compelation of poems that will have you laughing throughout the day. When I first picked this book up, I couldn't put it down for its gripping the reader techniques with such humorous poems.With characters in his poems ranging from any animal to any human, this book definitely has variety. I love the way Shel is able to rhyme things together and come up with such great stories in his poems......this is very evident in this book.Most of th peoms run about half a page, some long, some short. All of course, though, have humor and really show the work put in to them. This poem book is one of Silverstein's finest and deserves some sort of award.I want to thank Shel Silverstein for creating such a wonderful poem book and such great ideas that make you want to read the whole book in one sitting. That would definitely take time though it would be worth it.As you can see, I really recommend anyone of any age buying this book so they can enjoy it as much as I did. Thank you for reading my review and have a nice day!!"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I am reading this book right now and thought that I would come onto the website to review it for you.

Absolutely recommend for the lyrical, whimsical fun it makes reading."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I read this book back in 1980 when I was 11 yrs old. I have never forgotten the way it made me laugh and always cheered me up. My personal favorite as a child was &quot;Sick&quot;. &quot;I am too sick to go to school today...&quot; I read that one and several others over and over again.I was an abused child and the book brought something into my daily existence that I sorely needed. Laughter! I would highly recommend this book to anyone (as matter of fact I recommended it to the reading group at www.familyeducation.com). Not only will children find the poems and drawings to be of great amusement, but adults will remember the things in their childhood that brought a smile to their face as well!I plan on buying this book for my children as well as the other Silverstein books. They are all excellent!"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I never read this book when I was a kid, but as an adult, I felt the magic and shared it with MY children. I probably ran across his poems when I was young, but never knew who wrote them. That's a shame because I missed stepping into Shel's world completely until I was in my 20s.My kids love these poems, and have since they were old enough to giggle. I take them to read-aloud in my children's classrooms now, and make darn sure new generations not only know who Shel was, but know that he's the magician behind the poetry.If you haven't read this book, or any of Shel Silverstein's others, you are missing out on an important part of life--to laugh and connect with the rest of the world through childhood and laughter and the silliness of life.I'd give it ten stars if I could."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"This is a wonderful way to introduce children to poetry.

Flash forward 25 or so years and I am reading this to my own son who is just as interested in the fun pictures, word play and cadence as I was. This time, the smile on my face stems from two periods of time - the current in watching my son's reactions and the memories of my past flooding in.I am fairly certain that when I read them as a child, I did not see or understand the depth of what was being presented - I certainly didn't have the wisdom at that time to affirm the sentiment of each poem. I am now finding fun teaching opportunities on practically every page.As expected, this book is finding its way into the bedtime story rotation and will certainly be in need of replacement soon enough.I fully recommend starting your own adventure down the sidewalk. Perhaps the question to ask is, \\"does the sidewalk end after all?\\""},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I had to purchase this one for my children, because I loved this book so much as a child.

Definitely a \\"must have\\" for everyone."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"let me just say first off (and some of you may boo at me for this) that i am not a big fan of poetry, especially those that don't rhyme, layered with so much metaphor wrapped in some sort of old english language. those of you who can appreciate those, know i'm more than eager to submit in the \\"im not worthy! im not worthy!\\" throes. call it barbaric or just plain shallow, but i'd rather stick to the sing-songy rhymes of my elementary days.now, saying that i absolutely loved Where the Sidewalk Ends should not be construed as a statement that Silverstein's work is shallow. piddling my knowledge might be about bodies of poetry, in whatever form, this one thing i am sure of: that though this book can be read to kids (and [gasp!] can actually be understood and enjoyed by them), it somehow still manages to deliver punchlines that could draw forth a surprised smile or chuckle from an adult--at least those not totally drowning in cynicism or morbid depression. but who knows...a lot of the poetry here are funny (not outright hilarious, more like plain goofy), and yet come to think of it, still some of those are actually quite sad, with undertones about life and life experiences we take for granted. like the \\"Snowman\\", \\"Invention\\", \\"What's in the Sack?\\", \\"I Won't Hatch!\\", \\"The Garden\\", \\"The Little Blue Engine\\", and even the subtly poignant \\"Love\\".whether you actively seek a moral in any of the poems or just want to go for some light reading, this book (in my opinion) is sure to leave you with a wistful feeling. exactly about what...well, i can't say. but i loved it. and for me that's more than okay."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"This is such a fun book to read out loud.

They are well written and everyone of them makes me smile. I am 20 years old and someday I want to read Silvertein's books to my kids. They are simple yet have messages in them that children can pick up; here's an example:Inside everybody's nosethere lives a sharped toothed-snail.So if you stick your finger in,He may bite off your nail.Stick it farther up inside,And he may bite your ring off.Stick it all the way, and hemay bite the whole thing off.and one of my favorites is:I've never washed my shadow outin all the time I've had it.It was absolutely filthy I supossed,And so today I peeled it offThe wall where it was leaningAnd stuck it in the washtubWith the clothes.I put in soap and bleach and stuff,I let it soak for hours.I wrung it out and hung it out to dry,And whoever would have thunkThat it would have gone and shrunkFor now it's so muchLittler than I.So I really recommend owning this book.

Recently, now in my mid-twenties, some good friends of mine were moving away with their little boy, and I wanted to get them a going away present. I could think of nothing better than the 30th Anniversary Edition of Where The Sidewalk Ends. When it arrived at my doorstep, I of course could not help myself. Starting at the very beginning, I ready every poem, unlocking so many memories from my childhood as I did so. The best thing about the poems of Silverstein was that his writing is still just as funny now as it was when I was so very young. Lately I have found that to be a very rare quality. So, of course, I have to recommend this book to anyone that grew up reading his poems and now have kids of their own, or to those that grew up without him. You dont have to have kids to get this book. Just keep it on your bookshelf for the neices and nephews and cousins that are bound to visit anytime. If nothing else works, this will definitely shut them up!!"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I've had this book a long time and still love it!

By Kyle"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Where the Sidewalk Ends is a funny poetry book by Shel Silverstein. Many of Shel Silversteins books are funny. In the specific book the poets main topic is about summer. some of the poems in this book include \\"Tree House\\", \\"Jumping Rope\\", and \\"Homemade Boat\\". One reason that i liked this book was that all of the poems are funny and weird. This makes the book greater for little kids. Another reason that i liked this book was that it was mostly about summer. Too me, summer is the best season because of summer vacation. A third reason why i liked this book was because of the crazy vocabulary. Some of his words, like \\"Ickle\\", you can use in everyday life. The final reason why i liked this book was very simple... i like poem books. Poem books are a very unique way of writing. They let you say whatever you want to say, and in what ever way you want to say it. You could even write about Little Red Riding Hood if you wanted to.This book is aimed more towards younger children because some of the rhymes might be core appealing (or funnier) too younger kids.

These are perfect poems to read at bedtime with a young child, picture book style, in less time than it takes to read a story.Of course adults and older children can also enjoy these gems on their own.I think this is the cream of Silverstein's poems. We also enjoy the post-humously releasedEvery Thing On Itbut the best poem collections were published in his lifetime.I also highly recommendA Family of Poems: My Favorite Poetry for Childrenwhich will give you some more \\"serious\\" poems as well."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I grew up with this book myself so I purchased this one for my daughter for her to grow up with.

Silverstein is not only the best children's poet of all time, not only one of the greatest poets of the 20th century, but, one of the greatest poets of all time. His silly, sweet, playful poetry utterly sings right to the profound nature of childhood, imagination, nature, and life.

I used to read the same five poems every night before I went to sleep. Although I outgrew the reading before I went to bed stage I never outgrew this wonderful book of poems. His poems are funny yet genuine at the same time. This book made me enjoy reading and actually look forward to it. Whenever I see this book I instantly flashback to my childhood and it is one I can't wait to share with my own kids someday."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"This book is to be a Christmas gift for my seven-year old granddaughter. I read poems from my copy of this book to her. She has repeatedly told me she wants the book. I am sure she will be delighted."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Few days go by when I don't think of this book -- or the voice that gave these poems life. The collection helped shaped so much of my early life. I'd argue that it maintains its relevance to me, and to others, today because of the truthfulness inherent in the words and the situations. The fact that many of the poems remain so funny also helps. This is a work I can't wait to share with my children."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"This book is so easy to love and fun for every age! The cute poems can cheer you up on a not-so-sunny day and I love the fact that it's just short poems, so you can read just one and feel like you \\"read\\" that day! :) My kids love it, too - even my teenager! I definitely recommend."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"This book was my favorite Shel Silverstein book; it was funny, interesting, and very well-written. I love how Silverstein draws his own pictures with his books though his poetry is really art itself. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"In second grade, my teacher would take about half an hour or so every day to read to the class. I'll never forget listening to Mr. Popper's Penguins, Pippy Longstocking and, my favorite, Where the Sidewalk Ends. Our teacher read most of the poems to us, showed us the funny, weird drawings, and kept our spastic bodies seated and focused on the books.I do not remember much about the other books read to us, but I've never forgotten Where the Sidewalk Ends. During my young daughter's bathtub time, I've read most of the book to her. I suppose (hope) when she grows up she'll remember the delightful humor and artwork in this book and maybe read it to her own kids."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"My seven year old wanted this book because his teacher reads from it at school, and he loves it. The illustrations make it really fun to for kids to follow along with the short poems."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"In 3rd grade my best friend and I loved to listen to our teacher read poems from this book. 29 years later I bought the book for her 5 year old daughter.

Shel Silverstein is pure genious, definitely five stars."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Wake up your mind with this collection of thought provoking poems. Only Shel can find a point of view you never knew existed. Whenever I need to spark my imagination I'll reach for this book and fire through a few of his poems and wham! -- my mind is cooking like beans. All of Shel's books have a grittiness to them that is so real, so close to the bone that it just gets to your soul. He is the Robert Johnson (blues singer) of children's books."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"This book inspired me to start reading more when I was a child! I have since introduced this book to adults, teenagers and children and all have enjoyed it. Most folks go and buy their own copies including a 15 year old boy who didn't enjoy reading anything except comic books! So, no matter the age, pick up the book...you will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Bought this book at the flea market for 25 cents - is from Lock Haven State College in New Haven, Pa. and has Shel's printed autograph - Is a first edition in fairly great shape but surprised me because it said child's book and yet was a college library book. Anyway, read it and must admit that even at 65, the whimsey and fun of his writing is wonderful. Would love to have had something like this when I was growing up as I am an avid reader. If it is well written, I will read it and this book is definitely in that category. I recommend it to anyone who has a love of the fanciful and especially to children. :-)"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"\\"Where the sidewalk ends\\" should be bought for every child born! This book has brought laughter throughout our house, even to this day, 25 years later! The poems in this book are so uplifting that should be shared with eveyone."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I started reading this and other of Shel Silverstein's books when I was about four or five and to this day I have never \\"outgrown\\" him. I mean, who can? His rhymes and poems, songs and riddles, they all work for everybody with half a degree of imagination. The most cursory read of Where The Sidewalk Ends will show you not only how good/funny/imaginative/likable/silly/deep Silverstein is (sigh, was...) but you'll catch on to why he was so darn cool. This man was close personal friends with Roman Catholic Cardinals, hippies, rabbis, other poets, songwriters, and no less an icon than Hef, himself. (Shel practically lived the whole 1970's at the Playboy Mansion.) A little known fact is, Shel Silverstein even wrote a little song for his buddy Johnny Cash called \\"A Boy Named Sue\\". Ever heard of it? And of everything Shel wrote, the many books out there, I think this one MIGHT just be his best.Or, wait...no, maybe it's The Light In The Attic.No, no....maybe it's actually The Giving Tree....Maybe? Maybe it was Falling Up?I can never decide. One thing I do know and that's Where The Sidewalk Ends is Silverstein at his most awesome!"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I remember this book in the second grade! Wow, that was a long time ago. I remember enjoying the poems very much. Well, I stumbled upon this book a few weeks ago and decided to read them again. It had been quite some time. I still enjoyed it just as much as when I was little, if not more. \\"Where the Sidewalk Ends\\" is a literary treat for all ages.The poems are funny and sincere at the same time. I really enjoyed each and every poem. The drawings are also really good. Just to give you a little taste of my Silverstein's work, here's the very first poem I heard from this book when I was little called, \\"Hat.\\" And it goes a little something like this:Teddy said it was a hat,So I put it on.Now Dad is saying, \\"Where the heck'sthe toilet plunger gone?\\"That's only a SMALL taste of the wonders you will find in this book. My other favorites are \\"Hat,\\" \\"Dancing Pants,\\" \\"I Must Remember,\\" \\"Warning,\\" \\"Who,\\" and \\"The Land of Happy.\\" I'm sure there are many more, but that's all I can think of right now. Bottom line: EVERY poem is great.Although this is really great for kids, I think this is something EVERYONE would enjoy. Young or old, \\"Where the Sidewalk Ends\\" by Shel Silverstein is a fine read. One of my favorites.(If you liked this one, check out \\"A Light in the Attic.\\" Very good book as well.)"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Would you like to meet Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout who would not take the garbage out? Or Dirty Dan, the world's dirtiest man? Accept Shel Silverstein's invitation to come inside his delightful book full of outrageous poems and drawings. The unpredictable and humorous actions of each crazy character grabs readers' attention, keeping them engrossed in each poem, and craving for more. Elementary school-aged children will fall over laughing at Peggy Ann McKay's desperate attempt to avoid school, claiming, &quot;I have the measles and the mumps, a gash, a rash, and purple bumps. My mouth is wet, my throat is dry, I'm going blind in my right eye.&quot; Silverstein's use of rhyme and nonsense verse combined with his constant humor captures the reader. His simple pen-and-ink drawings add to the imagery presented in each poem. The reader not only sees, but feels lazy Jane's dry mouth as she waits for it to rain. The application of alliteration, assonance, and consonance makes each poem a delight to read out loud; &quot;For I've been down to the edge of the world, sat on the edge where the wild wind whirled.&quot; Some poems not only depict an array of humorous characters, but also create touching moments and offers good advice. Silverstein suggests playing hug o' war, rather than tug o' war, and assures young readers that, &quot;Anything can happen, child, ANYTHING can be.&quot; Children ages nine to twelve will enjoy reading these well crafted poems that portray both ludicrous and poignant messages."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"One of the best books of all time -- What more needs to be said? This is truly the most memorable book of my childhood. Smile after smile .... memory after memory.

Definitely a MUST HAVE at ANY age!!! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Shel Silverstein has done a wonderful thing with this book. He inspires children to read. My 3rd grade daughter was not too keen on sitting down to read a book, until she found this one in the library. She will sit down for hours now and read and reread all of the poems. Her favoriate is &quot;Sick&quot; the story of a little girl with every ailment you can think of - until she finds out it is Saturday. The poems are things that kids can relate to - and they are an easy and quick read.

Light-hearted, sometimes downright hilarious pictures accompany each poem, and the drawings are sometimes the plot of the joke.

This is a delightful book to read a few poems out of each night to your little ones before bed."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"My favorite aunt gave me this book as a child and all my children love this book! No child should grow up without these Poems. We have an anual Christmas Eve tradition in my family, and we all sit with all the presents around the tree...we sing, eat, then we all recite our favorite poems from this classic! It is funny how everybody seems to have different favoritesm, but I don't think there is a poem in there we miss."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Sometimes I'll lay in bed before work and I'll recite in my head a poem I learned when I was 10 - I can not go to school today said little Peggy Anne McKay.

I will never tire of his genius musings and look forward to sharing them with my children, grandchildren, etc. I'm buying the audio format along with the book for my baby goddaughter for Christmas so that she can listen to Mr. Silverstein's voice narrating his wonderful collection, then read along when she gets old enough.

I was so surprized when I came home one day and my step-brother had taken this book out of library and hid it under his bed because he did not want to bring it back. For someone who would never sit down and read a whole story, this was the first book that he wanted to read again and again. Where the Sidewalk Ends not only appeals to the new generation of readers; but it also touches something in the hearts of those who have loved the simple, humorous side of life through the years."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"If the ratings would allow, I would give the books a higher rating. These same poems were read to me and my class when I was in second grade.

When I have my own children, I hope to own the books so I, too, can recite them."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"When I was a child in the '70s, money was tight for our family. I checked this book out of the library so many times, that the librarian in our small town bought me a copy. I still have it. Now, money is not so tight. I buy a copy for every child I know. It is my own small children's favorite book. They have their favorites (Spaghetti &amp; Listen to the Mustn'ts) and can recite them by heart. I would like to thank Mr. Silverstein for bringing happiness to my childhood, as well as creating stories that lay the foundation for some of the the most beautiful moments I share with my children. The stories are silly (Dancing Pants), as well as thought-provoking (Colors). I recommend it to anyone, and everyone.

What a beautiful, timeless book."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"This book has been around for many years, as have Silverstein's other works. It's such a shame that the author is not alive to see the continued success of his writings. The poems in this book are quick witted, funny, and able to catch the interest of even the most reluctant reader. As a former elementary teacher, I introduced a poetry unit using this book. By the end of the week, my students had checked out every copy of this book from the school library and the public library as well. While adults may wrinkle their noses at a few of the poems, kids love them. Kids may get interested in exploring other types of poetry and maybe even trying to write their own."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"\\"Invitation\\", \\"Sick\\" and \\"Early Bird\\" still make me smile with their simplicity and imagination.

Or a young adult, just wanting to recapture the giggles."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Where the Sidewalk Ends is a really good poem book. If you had ifs about the book and you like poems this is the book to read. Once you read it then you will know why I gave it five lovely stars.

So that is why you should read Where the Sidewalk Ends."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I first heard the poems from \\"Where the sidewalk ends\\" from my middle school teacher (how was the librarian) and that was over seventeen years ago.

The poems take you along for a ride and are great to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"(Please note: I have the original edition of the book, without the new added poems.)For years, ever since I was a kid, I've thought of this as the \\"companion\\" book to Silverstein's \\"A Light in the Attic\\" - although, intriguingly, this one was written first. Now, after all this time and a fresh re-read, I think I finally understand why: it's simply not quite as good.That's not to say it isn't very, very enjoyable, because it is. A couple of Silverstein's absolute classics are here, including \\"Boa Constrictor\\" and \\"Peanut-Butter Sandwich,\\" and several of the poems either started life as or became songs, most notably \\"The Unicorn\\" (which anyone who listens to oldies radio has heard at least once, courtesy of the Irish Rovers). Silverstein's flair for wit and the humor of children is clearly evident in both his prose and illustrations; as usual, some librarians have proved their own ineptitude by banning the book for a couple of bare bottoms and the occasional rude (to an adult) joke.Any personal library of nonsense verse is incomplete without this volume. However, I would venture that any with \\"Sidewalk Ends\\" also requires \\"A Light in the Attic.\\" They compliment each other, and the second builds on the skill so easily appreciated in the first."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"i am 12 years old but Where the Sidewalk Ends is one of my favorite books. This book always put a smile on the face of the grumpiest person!

He is a super writter!"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"This was one of my all time favorite books when I was a child - and I bought it again awhile back - and I just adore it.

It's just too funny..."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"The poems in this book are irreverent but never mean-spirited. They are written from a child's perspective, and touch on truths of kids' experience without judgment and with a hint of naughtiness. The poetry is simple at first glance, but as with the work of many great painters, the whole transcends the simple strokes. The structure, rhythms, words and images, as well as the build-ups and often surprise endings make for work that is fun, that trains the young mind in listening and poetry, and that encourages playful imaginativeness. This is real poetry written with genuine appreciation for kids. The overall effect is uplifting and liberating because it frees us to feel what we do anyway, but without judgment and with plenty of giggles of recognition and appreciation for the absurd predicaments his characters find themselves in."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Fabulous! No child should grow up without this book. Shel Silverstein had the imagination of a child and an inspired ability to express it.If you are too old to have owned this book as a child, get one; and read it to a child. You will find yourself wanting to read every last poem."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I bought this more for myself because I read it as a child and wanted my daughter to have the same experience. At first I thought it too advanced for her, but, I was pleasantly surprised to find that she loves this book. It is so exciting to see a young mind building her own images. We read this for at least an hour every night. She picks out the poems she likes best and I read them over and over again. GOOD PICK! Don't miss out on this one."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Shel Silverstein has made one of the best book of poems I have ever read. The poems are light and cute and some have morals to them. Take the poem \\"Sara Cynthia Sylvia Stout Would Not Take The Garbage Out\\". This proves to kids that if you don't take the garbage out, it will just keep piling and piling up all the way to the ceiling. My favorite poem is \\"The Dirtiest Man In The World\\". I think it is so funny, but in a sick sort of way. There are lots of other poems that are funny, and I would recommend this book to any parent. I know their kids would enjoy them and will keep re-reading the book until they have the poems memorized. Some are short, some are long. The illustrations are cute just as the poems are."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I think Shel Silverstein wrote some good books.One of them is where the sidewalk ends.I also like all of his other books.If I was shel I would feel proud of my self .I recommend his books to my family, and friends."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Hi my name is Dustin morris,And im reading Where The Side Walk Ends.My Author of this book is Shel Silverstein.I have 166 pages in my book.The genre of the book is comedy and peoms.This book was written in the 1974.Its aii made up of peoms and funny things.And all the pages in the book are funny to.The things I like about the book is its funny peoms and it has big letters to I hope you like the way I wrote this poem about Where The Side Walk Ends. thank you Dustin Morris."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"In 6th grade we would get alot of these little poems read to us, they were really fun its a great book!"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"I loved this book when I was a kid, and knew my oldest daughter would love it.

So much from so long ago...still stuck in place and making me smile... while I can't remember where I put my glasses 5 minutes ago. Will we ever be able to thank this author and have him truly know the way he's touched us and our children? My son didn't share the passion for the poems, but he has the giving tree in a very safe spot as he enters the 8th grade, and that book was a favorite in preschool for him.I encourage everyone to find the Shel that speaks to their heart, and to just hold on."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"As I flipped through this book and came upon the stringy, goofy illustrations that have remained imprinted on my brain from a long time back, many adjectives to describe the accompanying poems came to mind: open; fun; funny; clever; even gritty, grisly and bizarre. So I started from the beginning and read each one, rediscovering Shel Silverstein for the first time in many years and still finding his work as lighthearted and captivating as ever. These are humanistic, countrified poems of improbable follies and flubs, mixed with messages of togetherness and a positive spirit as we all cruise through life -- and Silverstein makes it seem effortless, as if he's having a ball. On sturdy paper that feels good to turn, Silverstein's poems of innocence and gentleness intermix with gritty, real-life lessons within his own cartoonish school of hard knocks. People get eaten by lions or eat the entire universe, but all are welcome with open arms from the start (\\"If you are a dreamer, come in,\\" he beckons in the very first poem, \\"Invitation\\"). These may not be world-class works of literary art; in fact, some of these writings are just plain silly. But the words rhyme and flow like magic, outsiders are sometimes championed (or simply highlighted) and, perhaps most important of all, kids of any era will relate to and laugh at this stuff.This anniversary-edition book is worth checking out because of the twelve newly added poems at the end: \\"The Truth About Turtles,\\" \\"Oops!\\" \\"Mr. Grumpledump's Song,\\" \\"Naked Hippo,\\" \\"Who's Taller?\\" \\"Monsters,\\" \\"Weightliftress,\\" \\"Don't Tell Me,\\" \\"Ten-O-Cycle,\\" \\"The Unfunny Jester,\\" \\"Open-Close\\" and \\"Gorilla.\\" Nearly all of these fresh poems are complemented by the author's entertaining illustrations, and in a few cases the words are creatively entrenched within the images as only Silverstein can do.In closing, if Silverstein were to write a poem about me, he'd probably poke fun at how I overanalyze his poems and place me into the mouth of a lion with my arm sticking out uselessly atop my computer keyboard or upon the fishhook of some youngster's fishing pole as sharks swirled nearby, ready to pounce. \\"Just enjoy them,\\" he'd say ... and he'd be right."},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"Funny nonsense poems and drawings. Early and middle elementary aged school children should enjoy the crazy, silly humor of Shel Silverstein's poems, and simple black and white line drawings. He makes reference, in his poems, to other well known tales and stories, such as: a Noah's Arc with no unicorns, Paul Bunyan, who visits heaven, then hell, and &quot;The Little Engine That Could,&quot; that can't. There is a variety of long and short works. Often the two page, longer pieces, are my preference. I especially enjoy: Smart (p.35), Hector the Collector (p.46-7), Sick (p.58-9), The Crocodile's Toothache (p.66), Sarah (p.70-71), Cynthia Sylvia Stout Would Not Take The Garbage Out (p.76-7), The Unicorn (p.76-7), No Difference (p.81), The Dirtiest Man In The World (p.96-7), Spaghetti (p.100), Eighteen Flavors (p.116), With His Mouth Full Of Food (p.128), Band-Aids (p.140), If The World Was Crazy (p.146), Just Me Just Me (p.152), Hungry Mungry (p.160-1), and Merry (p.164). It is a good collection of poems and drawings, although I might enjoy some of Silverstein's later works even more. &quot;A Light In The Attic,&quot; (1981), and &quot;Falling Up,&quot; (1996), take a similar format. Check them out!"},{"Title":"Where the Sidewalk Ends: Poems and Drawings","review":"My sister and I had this book when we were growing up and I tell you, the only time we did not fight was when reading these hilarious poems. So, I knew the moment my daughter was old enough, I would share them with her and I did. She loved them as much as I did growing up. Now, I have a niece that is old enough to enjoy them as well. I love reading them to her and she, my sister, my daughter and I love reading them over and over again. I still get excited as I did when I was young. My daughter and niece share the same excitement.

I had fond memories of Dr. Seuss too, and I WANTED to be as broken up as everyone else was. But honestly, I wasn't.Then, in 1998 or 1999, I got an email saying that Shel Silverstein died and it hit home. I realized what all those Seussers had gone thru. I think I know why I felt as I did:Seuss was Cat In The Hat, was the Grinch frustrated by the happy townspeople who need neither feasts nor possessions, but only love to be joyous. That's swell, and admirable, but to me those books were almost boring.Uncle Shelby's world was dark and exciting. One could fly or not take a bath for months or be stupidly stubborn enough to eat nothing but PB sandwiches. In Silverstein's world, monsters not only existed, but would EAT YOU if you weren't careful. It was full of the things that my dreams were made of, full of giddiness and dread, full of dark things that glittered expectantly in the moonlight, like diamonds...or like fangs.Perhaps you have to be the right kind of person. Like how some people who worship Looney Tunes look down in realistic, anarchic contempt at the saccharine world created by Walter Disney.It's an aesthetic, an aggressive hope, an adventurous fear.

One of his poems is about Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout and LUSH beauty products has a shampoo with the same name. When I looked the name up online I found the amusing poem about a girl who never takes out the garbage.These poems are at times laugh-out-loud funny and at times delightfully silly. There are quirky drawings throughout that make the poems even more enjoyable. One minute you are laughing and the next you are having memories of Alice in Wonderland or other books you read as a child like The Little Engine that Could. The only poem I question is \\"Dreadful\\" but I suppose some people think it is funny.There is a place where the sidewalk endsAnd before the street begins,And There the grass grows soft and while,And there the sun burns crimson bright,And there the moon-bird rests from his flightTo cool in the peppermint wind.~ pg. 64A few of the poems struck me as especially profound while the poem about the Giraffe was very creative.

Many companies come to China with ideas on how to apply Western thinking to their very different marketplace: thus BILLIONS' tips are a necessary set of instructions for any who would break into the Chinese marketplace. From cultural influences in buying patterns to investment challenges and multinational lessons on winning and losing in China, BILLIONS is a recommended pick for any company who would consider entering this new, large market."},{"Title":"Billions: Selling to the New Chinese Consumer","review":"You can find an abundance of books about doing business in China. This one, however, takes a rare approach. Ad expert Tom Doctoroff confines his commentary (for the most part) to a subject he has the expertise to address - advertising - although he tends to generalize a bit about Chinese history and philosophy. He offers evidence and examples from both successful and unsuccessful ad campaigns to support his assertions about what will work if you want to build your brand in China. We find that this short book offers interesting perspectives on the Chinese consumer market, while it also provides a refresher course on the main principles of advertising and brand building in any market, whether it be East or West."},{"Title":"Billions: Selling to the New Chinese Consumer","review":"Great book if you would like to obtain an indepth view of the Chinese Consumer. A MUST read!!"},{"Title":"Billions: Selling to the New Chinese Consumer","review":"I am a local Chinese living in Beijing and work in a Korean company that manufacturers and markets consumer electronics. Most foreigners don't understand us and think they are better than Chinese. That causes big mistakes! Remember the time Nike ads got banned??? :-) But the author really knows Chinese people (its scary) and even seems as to admire us. This book is very perceptive it's hard to believe a loawai wrote it."},{"Title":"Billions: Selling to the New Chinese Consumer","review":"The marketing universe described in Doctoroff's book seems both familiar to Americans (its size, scale and ambitiousness) and utterly foreign. Its Confucian view of the world is brought home with a series of insights that can be used to build a strong brand. One that I particularly liked described how American mothers want their babies to grow bigger, faster, taller. In a bit of marketing mumbo jumbo, Doctoroff calls this \\"transformational benefits.\\" Chinese mothers, on the other hand, are more concerned about the dangers of the world and therefore seem immunity and other \\"protective\\" benefits. This is just one example and there are loads more.Doctoroff's analyses of many \\"sub\\" markets -- youth, men, women -- are pretty fascinating and eye opening. Almost like a parallel universe. The middle section is probably the least accessible to non-marketing types but the rest of the book is surprisingly accessible and easy to understand.A really good -- even fun -- read."},{"Title":"Billions: Selling to the New Chinese Consumer","review":"Standing in the bookstore, the jacket of this book caught my eye, so I decided to thumb through it and then buy it. I have an interest in China, largely because I see the country as a very important part of all of our futures. Still, I know very little about China. So, I wondered whether \\"Billions\\" would be accessible to me. Boy, was it! To my great surprise, a book on consumer marketing opened my eyes to, and brought to life, an entire culture that, as Mr. Doctoroff describes it, is both utterly foreign and worthy of great respect. The book is sharply written. It is also quite lively. Looking through the prism of advertising, one through which all readers can gaze (given that we are exposed the medium on a daily basis), China comes alive. We see how its history, religion, values and psychology are all profoundly different than our own. The thing that comes across most clearly is that, while Chinese want to be modern and successful, they definitely don't want to be western. They value their own rich culture too much. Certainly, advertisers hawking their wares in China will be at a loss if they forget this lesson (or ignore this book). But, so too will politicians, diplomats and anyone else who endeavors to interact with or understand the Chinese. In writing this book, Mr. Doctoroff has provided truly a valuable service. Of course, he gives us a basic but far reaching tutorial on advertising, one that unlocks many of the profession's secrets. (The lessons Mr. Doctoroff has learned from his lengthy tenure as an advertising executive in China literally spew forth from the book's pages, albeit in a way that is quite digestable.) But in treating China as the next vital frontier, in allowing us to understand the mysteries of this distant but omnipresent land, Mr. Doctoroff allows us to better grapple with the challenges and opportunities ahead. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Billions: Selling to the New Chinese Consumer","review":"I've been amused by Doctoroff's blog blitz. His team hit the blogosphere with 12 'Facts' about the 'Confucian Consumer.' Obviously, given our aversion to cultural generalizations, he was bound to step into some doo doo. Many of his conclusions were maligned.I thought, however, they had the ring of truth and ordered the book. \\"Billions,\\" contrary to some complaints, doesn't claim that there 1.3 billions consumers march in unison. The first several chapters cover different market segments. But the book is pretty clear in arguing that a \\"Chinese worldview\\" does exist and, what's more, is relevant when marketing Western goods in China. (Don't Western values reflect a \\"Christian Worldview,\\" despite the fact that many of us are lapsed church goers.?) The insights Doctoroff reveal are, I think, pretty compelling and are rooted in Confucianism and Daoism. Doctoroff has actually written a deceptively important book."},{"Title":"Billions: Selling to the New Chinese Consumer","review":"As I write, Google has just announced that it will censor Internet searches in order to gain entry to China, the fastest-growing Internet market on the planet.Many Americans are shocked --- just as they were shocked when Microsoft and Yahoo agreed to similar restrictions.On another day, you could count on me to be shocked and dismayed. I'm not. That's because I've just read 'Billions.' And I now understand something that liberty-loving Americans don't: Individual freedom is just not that important to most of the 1.3 billion Chinese people. They are still living according to the codes of Confucius, who died 2500 years ago. And while they may not hold to Confucian beliefs for another 2500 years, they are not abandoning them any time soon.But isn't China the fourth largest economy in the world? Isn't China an enormous shopping and manufacturing mall, home of the labels in your shirt and the parts in your hard drive? Isn't the Chinese middle class growing as if it's on steroids? Isn't China, in short, very much like America when we were in a great growth spurt?Yes to all but the last question. And that's where the China story gets really interesting. The Chinese may be anxious to bankroll the America dollar, they may be thrilled to do business with us, but they are not like us in very fundamental ways.Tom Doctoroff, head of an American advertising agency's China division, studies the Chinese market to see how products are sold and how they might be sold better. Those who think advertising is just a matter of inventing clever phrases and making eye-catching commercials have a big surprise in store for them --- the key to success is insight. Deep sociological insight.Another Amazon reviewer has described this as 'a deceptively insightful book.' Just so. It's not what you'd expect from an advertising exec. Or, for that matter, from a sociologist. Instead, it's the work of a world-class cultural reporter, who assembles a thousand interesting facts and then fits them into a conclusion that's the furthest thing from a slogan or easy truism. In the process, he delivers --- almost as an afterthought --- the best look at Chinese life I've seen in years.Consider: Successful Chinese buy Buicks, a brand all but dead here. They prefer the Audi to the Mercedes. They almost went nuts when Toyota made a commercial showing Chinese stone lions bowing to the Japanese car. They like SUVs, especially the Lincoln Navigator, which is called 'The President' in China. They adore Montblanc pens, but mostly for the way others can see the white star when the pen is in your pocket.Did you know there are at least 150 manufacturers of air-conditioners in China and what that says about Chinese industry? Do you understand why the airports look great, but are, in essence, made of tin foil-covered cardboard? Do you grasp why there are sex shops all over the place but no sex in Chinese advertising? Why Chinese TV shows are anything but reality-based? How a local brand can wipe out a multi-national giant? And how the Beijing Olympics in 2008 are 'the most ambitious brand-building exercise in history'?Doctoroff has fascinating answers for those questions and more. But most valuable of all, he explains the schizophrenia at the heart of middle-class life in China --- the split between Confucian allegiance to order and rank and targeted ambition on one hand, and raw Westernized individualism on the other. How will it resolve? It may not. As Doctoroff reminds us, the Communist party is still the biggest brand in China.From shampoos sold to the poor in rural villages to luxury cars and fancy apartments in Shanghai, Tom Doctoroff covers it all. His book is like a visit to China with an excellent guide --- just without lung-burning pollution and street-vendors trying to sell you the latest DVDs. If you're at all interested in China, are thinking of traveling there or are contemplating doing business with the Chinese, this book is required reading"},{"Title":"Billions: Selling to the New Chinese Consumer","review":"This book makes me recall why I went into advertising in the first place. It's written from a psychological and athropoligical point of view. Doctoroff gives the impression that China is, from an brand building point of view, virgin territory, not a market where tactics are everything or we obsess about splintered communication while losing focus on the big idea and big insight.How do I get a job in Shanghai?? The book made me want to pack my bags."},{"Title":"Billions: Selling to the New Chinese Consumer","review":"No, we're not. This is the accurate conclusion of Doctoroff's book. Too many Western companies think we are and, as a result, make big mistakes. A quote from p. 2 says it all...\\"...We (Westerners) are moral absolutists and they are relativists. We value social dynamism, they value order. We view history's march as linear. They view it as cyclical, driven by fate. We believe society is \\"good,\\" they believe it corrupts. We are monotheists...and they are atheists, unified on a spirial plain by a belief in Chinese 'culture.'\\"What's amazing about the book he Doctoroff makes it clear what this also has to do with marketing soap, cars and diamonds.A must read for foreigners trying to make it"},{"Title":"Billions: Selling to the New Chinese Consumer","review":"I read about 30 nonfiction books about consumer culture each year and Tom Doctoroff's \\"Billions\\" is among the five best I've read in the last two years. He instructed and entertained me about the Chinese and how they think, eat, shop, live. It is both a marketing primer and a snapshot of modern Chinese life, and is vital for students, business people, and even upper middle class Americans planning a trip to the PRC. The most interesting twist for me was a think about the Beijing Olympics; will it be the marketing moment of the first half of this century? Now I'm wondering?"},{"Title":"Billions: Selling to the New Chinese Consumer","review":"Love this book. Focus group, quantitative analysis, qualitative research, or any else you learned in the Marketing Research course at the MBA curriculum, may not work in China. WIth 1.3 billion customers, this is the dream market for any multinational corporations: Unilever, Ford, Nokia, Motorola, Sony, Samsung, Protor Gamble, DeBeers(DTC), VW, Shell, Pepsi, Coke, Nestle, Avon, Nike, Siemens, IBM, Dell.... While they are compeitng, the locals are copying quickly: Haier, TCL, Konda, China Mobile, China Unicom, Lenovo, CNOOC, Yili Diary, Sedrin beer, 999 Pharmaceutical..... hundreds of them doing shampoo, shoes, ....every thing under the sun. How can you win? That is the beauty of this book. It got many strategies laid out in the step-by-step fashion. It is a must read for any one who is doing business in China. The book will be better if more comparison can made on the effectiveness of the ad such as Motoroal vs a Chinese brand."},{"Title":"Billions: Selling to the New Chinese Consumer","review":"Confucius, Daoism, Communism, Industrialization, Urbanization, One-Child Families, Great Leap Forward, Education and Profit Is Good: What do these themes mean for those who wish to sell in China? They are all important influences which you need to understand. Each Chinese consumer is uniquely influenced by the combination. The result includes some pretty interesting apparent contradictions such as prudishness about sex in advertising in a country where sexual trade is wide open at the street level.In this insightful book, JWT Greater China CEO, Tom Doctoroff explains those influences and how they operate today. That's just the beginning.From there, he shows you case history after case history of how global and Chinese companies have done well and poorly in acknowledging those influences. I found seeing the actual advertisements to be extremely helpful in understanding the book's points.If that weren't enough, Mr. Doctoroff goes on to provide excellent perspectives into management challenges of properly serving 1.3 billion consumers in China.Most books about China are filled with glittering generalities that leave you just as uninformed as you were when you started. Through careful description, segmentation and exposition of specific marketing challenges, Billions makes you feel as at home in China as you would feel in marketing a new video game to American teens.As an example of how focused the book is, Billions provides:-- Ten basic tips for effective Chinese advertising-- Five mistakes most often made by multinational companies in China-- Five structural barriers within Chinese corporations that harm the development of strong local brands-- Three areas of Chinese domestic brand stagnation-- Three areas of Chinese domestic brand progress-- Six effective MNC-counterattack strategies to offset the domestic Chinese brands-- Ten ways to shape international brands into global icons with Chinese characteristics to serve the Chinese community world-wide.I thought that the description of how the Beijing Olympics should be pursued as a branding opportunity was worth the price of the book alone.Usually, companies send second-raters to markets like China. JWT obviously sent its best when Mr. Doctoroff took over. Read and learn to profit!"},{"Title":"Oops: 20 Life Lessons from the Fiascoes That Shaped America","review":"This hilarious book is lots of fun to read and even more fun to tell people about. You'll be amazed that you haven't heard of these things before. Smith and Kiger have this way of rolling out odd little details in a dry way that really build a humorous picture without trying to be funny. My favorite story was about 10 cent beer night at the Cleveland Indians baseball game in 1974. They start by telling how Cleveland was suffering from an image problem because the river had recently caught fire and the Cleveland Mayor had ignited his hair with a blow torch at a ribbon cutting ceremony.

A range of 'stories' from religious movements founded on interesting sex mores, y2k bug, paper fashion, battle of towers in Boston, plans for assasination of Castro, Cleveland Indians' beer promotion, and Edison killing an elephant (!) are all part of this book. Some stories are so interesting, it is a surprise that they have been obscure so far. On that front, the author scores full points. It is a little disappointing that the authors were not able to locate any interesting pictures or photos of the events narrated. Instead they focus on a very amateurish-looking \\"ingridient list\\" for each of the 'fiasco' narrated in the chapter. The book is very neatly organized - each chapter focusing on a specific event/trend. Quite humorous writing style adds to the enjoyment of the book.

For example, I remember seeing the John Hancock Tower partially covered in plywood on childhood trips to Boston (although the book doesn't mention this, I believe that the surviving panes of glass went to Building #19, a locally famous salvage/overstock store here in the Boston area, for sale for the uses described by the authors). The authors do a good job in filling out the facts behind the fiascoes (I didn't realize that I wasn't the only one who couldn't stand Clippy). As a previous reviewer stated, the one problem that I did have with the book is a lack of a photo section, as items such as paper dresses, the Dodge LaFemme, the rockin' Tacoma Narrows Bridge & Flying Cars need to be seen. I also didn't care too much for the \\"receipe\\" section that ended each chapter. Despite this, I do recommend this book to be added to your own Dynamic File of Trivia."},{"Title":"Buddhism and Deep Ecology","review":"This is an ok book on the subject, but scattered and somewhat self-indulgent.

The method was used later in the FSI State Department courses.There are a few words that dated. Example: words relating to the Soviet government.

This book deals with what seems to be the recent dramatic increase in teen violence such as witnessed at Colulmbine. Volcano is not a book just for kids on the edge, but for kids who are around them and who know what those kids are thinking. With ideas from this book it might be possible to help troubled kids through their problems, or at least know where to go to get help.This book can also help adults understand what kind of stress we kids are dealing with these days, and not be so hard on us. Many times adults have a hard time understanding what is going on inside a kids head, this book will help adults to realize that the stress that we deal with is very real, as is their own. It is possible, through reading this book, that an adult can be better able to advise us (kids) as to; how to get help, where to get help and when to get help, in a day and age that is very different from when they were kids."},{"Title":"Understanding the Human Volcano: What Teens Can Do About Violence","review":"In \\"Understanding the Human Volcano\\" Earl Hipp writes clearly and simply on the complex issue of violence in today's world. In describing the many faces of violence he includes memorable images and a basic vocabulary of psychological terms that will serve a young reader for life.Hipp speaks directly to the reader as he outlines what teens and adults can do to understand, and prevent violence in their own lives and in their community. I felt his caring on every page. He never talks down to kids.The dynamic cover and many illustrations by L. K. Hanson visually underscore the points made in Hipp's organization of topics, open questions, and answers from teen correspondents. A school or church group discussion leader will find this book a vital, workable resource that keeps the reader riveted, the discussions flowing.We will never know the number of lives this book on this topic will change, but I am sure life changes will come about. I'm going to read it again! I'm accepting Hipp's challenge to keep the faith, to work with others and to take practical steps to reduce the violence in our world."},{"Title":"Understanding the Human Volcano: What Teens Can Do About Violence","review":"Understanding The Human Volcano: What Teens Can Do About Violence is a valued and important contribution to understanding the issues involved with adolescent violence -- its causes, containment, and amelioration. Psychotherapist Earl Hipp enhances his &quot;reader friendly&quot; and informative text with cogent quotes, poignant stories, and line-drawn illustrations throughout in order to help teens understand the changes that threaten their safety and the practical steps necessary to reduce the violence in their world. The message of Understanding The Human Volcano is a hopeful one of encouragement, that when teens and those that love them can, in fact, make their community a safer place in which to learn, grow, live, and thrive. Understanding The Human Volcano is a highly recommended addition to every high-school, community center, family counseling resource, and community library adolescent behavior reference collection."},{"Title":"Understanding the Human Volcano: What Teens Can Do About Violence","review":"While this book has some pluses, such as the quotes from real teens, the author overwhelmingly considers teens to be perpetrators of violence, not victims. This viewpoint stunningly ignores the power imbalances that are present in much of the violence kids experience. Gender-based violence is not even addressed in the book (go ahead, try to find a mention of sexual harrassment, dating violence or rape). For a teen girl whose boyfriend is abusive the advice she would get from the chapter on relationships is \\"develop anger-management skills\\". She would probably miss the vague advice to \\"develop assertiveness skills\\". I would not recommend this book for teen girls or for adults who work with teen girls, especially girls who have been victims of violence."},{"Title":"Ties That Bind: A Novel","review":"This book is about Arianna's sons, Marc and Andre.

When Omri insisted his father store the magic cupboard in a bank vault, so he would not be tempted to tamper with the Past, he vowed he would resist the temptation to visit with his tiny friends. But he never did understand exactly how and why this particular cupboard changed plastic toys into living, human beings from the past--with real names, occupations and lifestyles of their own.Now his family has inherited a cottage in the English countryside from a mysterious and much-maligned great, great aunt of his mother's. Omri discovers her diary which includes a confession of a great crime--one which precipitated multiple disasters for the family. For the old thatching conceals a rusty strong box--what secrets and objects of value are hidden within?Soon it becomes imperative to revive the new plastic figures, but meddling with the Past can demand a heavy price--if Omri succeeds in preventing one crime, he may also erase his parents' marriage and his very life! (Shades of BACK TO THE FUTURE!) How will old buddy Patrick help or hinder Omri's private quest to clear Jessica Charlotte's name? Will Ormi's parents finally realize that something odd is going on with their son? A fascinating book which will delight THE INDIAN fans and all readers."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Cupboard","review":"Omri's mother inherits a country house in Somerset, and the family is glad to leave the horrible district (especially after the events of books two and three). The house belonged to her second cousin, whom she's never met, and he inherited it from his mother (her great aunt) whom she'd never met either. For some reason, her family always hated her great aunt, but wouldn't say why. They move into the house, where Omri finds a hidden diary.A theme of The Mystery of the Cupboard is forgiveness. Omri's mother, who inherits the house, had all these relatives who she never met. Omri's mother was incapable of forgiving some unknown mistake, and since nobody would say what it was, she never thought about it. Not only does the secret diary reveal why, but it shows how the cousin's hate and anger gave the cupboard its magic. In some ways, the cupboard was created out of hate, and needed to be found by a kid who could make himself happy. It reminded me of Charles dickens' \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" where the villain (Defarge) is incapable of forgiving, and Dickens makes her the ultimate villain. Though she's a victim herself, he makes her look more evil than the people who killed her family. Dickens believed that grudges destroy people, as it does with Defarge, and that the power of forgiveness is a very strong one. In The Mystery of the Cupboard, Omri and Patrick have to make a choice of whether to reveal the cupboard's secret, or forgive the maker and move on.The first book in the series was great. The second had its funny moments (like the 1940's nurse and the corporal with the cockney accent). The third one was a bore. But The Mystery of the Cupboard is by far the best one. It has a more mature story than the previous installments, and the astonishing plot really pulls you in."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Cupboard","review":"I purchased this book for my youngest grandson.I also read it, I would recommend any of the books in this series."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Cupboard","review":"The Mystery of the CupboardBy: Lynne Reid BanksReviewed by: D. KimThere were two boys named Omri and Peter, who wanted to find out the secret to the magical cupboard. They have found the information of the cupboard from Omri's great-great-aunt's journal. Omri moved to a different state, and he was going farther away from Peter more than ever. He had lost his cat there, named Kitsa. Their new house was a longhouse, and there was also a barn. Omri found the journal before Peter traveled there by himself, and with hard work and destination, they both found out that Omri's great-great-aunt was turned into plastic after she stole her sister's earrings. Jessica Charlotte, the \\"aunt\\" loved her sister's daughter more than her own son, and hated it. When she and her son were alone, she told him to put all his anger into the cupboard, just to imagine it, and she locked it with her key. After this, she turned into plastic by opening it, and now plastic dolls who were put in it where brought to life when it was locked and then opened again. This was the secret of the Cupboard. In the end, Omri started bringing his dad more in on things, so he told him about the cupboard.I liked this book because it made me realize that I have been doing pretty bad things before that I knew had feelings. If I had a clone, and I took his kidney for my own life, then what would happen to my clone? Thinking about this has made a difference in my life, but it was also pretty funny. One quote that caught my eye was this. \\"You should be outdoors, not in 'ere. What's the world comin' to, kids in pubs, I dunno. The author was like every person in the book, together, because she gave them their own minds. Each character was different, in a lot of ways, so I think that Lynne Reid Banks put a lot of effort into writing this.In other parts of the story, things were getting pretty sad. Omri had found out that his great-great-aunt wasn't such a bad woman after all. She just made some mistakes. When Omri asked Mr. Towsler about Jessica Charlotte, he said, \\"I worried about her. When she were with me. Worried she'd be lonely an' that, for people her own size. But she said not to. She were content with me. She said them others weren't much company. Not her sort, she said.\\" The others were the people she had brought to life. Even though they were her own size and had different stories about their lives, she like to have Mr. Towsler around instead of them.My favorite part of the book was definitely the ending, because it was most interesting to me. Omri had just made a better relationship with his father, because he let him in on all the secrets. Omri knew that it could be risky, but he wanted him to know Little bear and the others, because they were just like normal people."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Cupboard","review":"Have you ever read the book The Mystery of the Cupboard by Lynne Reid Banks ?Omri moves into a new house, that was an old relatives, because he died.He finds his great great great aunt Jessica Charlotties note book.Omri learns about Jessica Charlottie's whole life until she gets sick and dies.Omri thinks that his mothers key will fit in the cashbox he found.I think it's a good story about life.I think this is a good book to learn about elders and history.I think that this book would be a great gift.

The main character was Omri. Omri is a boy who owns a magical cupboard that can bring plastic figures to life. He has a mom, dad, and two brothers. He also has a friend named Patrick and a cat named Kista. I liked the book because it was interesting. I also think it would be cool if plastic figures could come to life. The plot was about Omri and the magic of the cupboard. When Omri's family moves he finds a diary and a cash box. In the cashbox there are little figures. When Omri brings them to life he tries to change the past by telling them what to do. Then Omri leans that you shouldn't change other people's past because it could affect you. The setting was in England and in the country.

So he was taking a walk to see what's around. He went into a forest as he was walking he found a cave around the corner.He walked in and followed a light to the end he found a grave yard but in the grave yard he found one grave in the whole entire grave yard.

Chamfort was greatly admired by Nietzsche, and it is easy to see why. It is really unfortunate that this is the only translation available for Chamfort's Reflections. The translation is incomplete, including only a subset of the aphorisms, and in many places it is strikingly inaccurate. Even in cases where a more literal translation would have both sounded better and more accurately conveyed the original meaning, Parm&eacute;e elects to make an inaccurate and awkward one. To make matters worse, the translation adopts its own idiosyncratic numbering scheme for the aphorisms, and no cross reference is provided to any edition of the original French, making it very difficult to locate the original for aphorisms the reader finds important.If you can find it, I would recommend instead the translation by E. P. Mathers, published in 1926."},{"Title":"Beginning Perl (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"Update 02-26-2010: I threw this book out a few months ago even though it had all my notes written on the pages. I wish I had it back. I would downloaded and would like to learn the new est version. There aren't many books on the shelf for computers anymore - especially for programming. I still feel perl is a great language for digging data our of log files etc.Update 04-24-08: I will likely be dusting this book off and bring it in to work. The notes I wrote in it make it invaluable to me. There is a new version too. UltraEdit is a great text editor and only costs $50 for the latest and greatest text version of the program.I spent a year with the book and went through almost every chapter in detail. I typed in nearly every chapter, wrote notes in the book, etc.It's not perfect and falls a little short occasionally in the area of being pro-active. By this I mean there are some areas where the author could have emphasized things a bit more.Also, he makes it seem like learning PERL is a breeze. I found it a lot of work after spending 2000 hrs with the book. I can can code pretty well and consider myself an intermediate non-professional. This language is an outstanding way to learning advanced programming techniques common to all languages. It is also something I will use as I move from windows 2k/xp to Mac OS X Tiger - which has perl built in and is accessible through the Terminal.app window.Bottom line: if you have a need to manipulate text based data files or even excel - since there are many plugins for Perl or want to do Web cgi scripts this is a great book although it does not focus on web applications but primarily on the building blocks of text manipulation and general programming fundamentals, loops, statements, troubleshooting, etc you cannot go wrong with this book. Also, don't be fooled by its size. It is the right size instead of a giant telephone book that you will never read like most programming books.

I think the book would be better with more exercises as the topics progress. By the time one gets to the end of a chapter, the handful of exercises require one to reread the whole chapter to find solutions. Some exercises require knowledge not in the text so far, and there are several errors in the solutions.

It is now also available as electronic edition including Kindle Edition from Amazon.It is suitable for one semester course in Perl. Version covered is Perl 5.8 not 5.10. Some issues covered such as dereferencing of arguments in subroutines are rarely covered even in intermediate books. This is definitely much better and cheaper book then Learning Perl (ignore the lemmings effect in Amazon reviews of this pretty weak book).The strong point of the book is the set of examples (you can download them) which illustrates basic material of each chapter. Running them is a must for studying Perl with this book.Examples are often overcomplicated (like most Perl books authors Simon Cozen tries to impress reader with his knowledge of intricacies of Perl and often loses the sense of proportion; but he is not as bad as Randal Schwartz who is a pathological \\"overcomplicator\\" ;-). Still they are very helpful in understanding the language. A very useful exercise that I successfully tried with my students is the simplification of examples provided.The book is the best for programmers moving from other languages then to \\"plain vanilla\\" beginners. It might be also useful for Unix system administrators who know Unix shell reasonably well.The range of topics covered is really impressive:IntroductionChapter 1: First Steps In PerlChapter 2: Working with Simple ValuesChapter 3: Lists and HashesChapter 4: Loops and DecisionsChapter 5: Regular ExpressionsChapter 6: Files and DataChapter 7: ReferencesChapter 8: SubroutinesChapter 9: Running and Debugging PerlChapter 10: ModulesChapter 11: Object-Oriented PerlChapter 12: Introduction to CGIChapter 13: Perl and DatabasesChapter 14: The World of PerlAppendix A: Regular ExpressionsAppendix B: Special VariablesAppendix C: Function ReferenceAppendix D: The Perl Standard ModulesAppendix E: Command Line ReferenceAppendix F: The ASCII Character SetAppendix G: LicensesAppendix H: Solutions to ExercisesAppendix J: Support, Errata and P2P.Wrox.ComSimon Cozens definitely knows the language well and it shows.The book coveres a lot of intermediate topics like references, databases, OO concepts, CGI, etc.Lists and hashes are explained well although the author often abuses lists and uses them where they do not belong. Both lists and hashes are introduced early in the book.Regular expressions are explained OK. I like the approach the author takes in writing a small program which demonstrates various concepts.The book covers both DBM databases and SQL databases. MySQL is used to demonstrate how PERL interacts with an SQL database. Most Linux distributions have MySQL installed by default, the book also contains useful information about installation and basic configuration, that helps to make MySQL up and running.DBM, which are simple key-value pair databases are covered in more detail. The author demonstrates complex data storage using DBM files. Normally DBM can only store a single value for any key.As for SQL only fairly simple SQL commands are covered, but then it is an introductory books and it's naive to expect full SQL coverage.In CGI chapter the author introduces CGI environment variables and HTTP commands such as GET and POST first. Then he switches to the CGI.pm module which is standard module in Perl but unfortunately introduces a lot of overcomplexity in the topic. CGI security issues are also mentioned.Basic networking is covered in chapter 14. The Net::FTP module is covered in chapter 11 ( Object-Oriented Perl ) which makes this chapter simultaneously an extension of networking chapter.The set of examples from the book greatly enhances the value of the book. It is mostly error free and immediately usable. Also each chapter has exercises with the answers.

It is now also available as electronic edition including Kindle Edition from Amazon.It is suitable for one semester course in Perl. Version covered is Perl 5.8 not 5.10. Some issues covered such as dereferencing of arguments in subroutines are rarely covered even in intermediate books. This is definitely much better and cheaper book then Learning Perl (ignore the lemmings effect in Amazon reviews of this pretty weak book).The strong point of the book is the set of examples (you can download them) which illustrates basic material of each chapter. Running them is a must for studying Perl with this book.Examples are often sometimes overcomplicated (like most Perl books authors Simon Cozen tries to impress reader with his knowledge of intricacies of Perl and often loses the sense of proportion; but he is not as bad as Randal Schwartz who is a pathological \\"overcomplicator\\" ;-). Still they are very helpful in understanding the language. A very useful exercise that I successfully tried with my students is the simplification of examples provided.Due to this the book is the best for programmers moving from other languages then to \\"plain vanilla\\" beginners. It might be also useful for Unix system administrators who know Unix shell reasonably well.The range of topics covered is really impressive:IntroductionChapter 1: First Steps In PerlChapter 2: Working with Simple ValuesChapter 3: Lists and HashesChapter 4: Loops and DecisionsChapter 5: Regular ExpressionsChapter 6: Files and DataChapter 7: ReferencesChapter 8: SubroutinesChapter 9: Running and Debugging PerlChapter 10: ModulesChapter 11: Object-Oriented PerlChapter 12: Introduction to CGIChapter 13: Perl and DatabasesChapter 14: The World of PerlAppendix A: Regular ExpressionsAppendix B: Special VariablesAppendix C: Function ReferenceAppendix D: The Perl Standard ModulesAppendix E: Command Line ReferenceAppendix F: The ASCII Character SetAppendix G: LicensesAppendix H: Solutions to ExercisesAppendix J: Support, Errata and P2P.Wrox.ComSimon Cozens definitely knows the language well and it shows.The book covered a lot of intermediate topics like references, databases, OO concepts, CGI, etc.Lists and hashes are explained well although the author often abuses lists and uses them where they do not belong. Both are introduced early in the book.Regular expressions are explained OK. I like the approach the author takes in writing a small program which demonstrates various concepts.The book covers both DBM databases and SQL databases. MySQL is used to demonstrate how PERL interacts with an SQL database. Most Linux distributions have MySQL installed by default, the book also contains useful information about installation and basic configuration, that helps to make MySQL up and running.DBM, which are simple key-value pair databases are covered in more detail. The author demonstrates complex data storage using DBM files. Normally DBM can only store a single value for any key.As for SQL only fairly simple SQL commands are covered, but then is an introductory books and it's naive to expect full SQL coverage.In CGI chapter the author introduces CGI environment variables and HTTP commands such as GET and POST first. Then he switches to the CGI.pm module which is standard module in Perl but unfortunately introduces a lot of overcomplexity in the topic. CGI security issues are also mentioned.Basic networking is covered in chapter 14. The Net::FTP module is covered in chapter 11, Object-Oriented Perl which makes this chapter simultaneously an extension of networking chapter.The set of examples from the book greatly enhances the value of the book. It is mostly error free and immediately usable. Also each chapter has exercises with the answers. That makes the book perfectly suitable for the classroom.All-in-all this is a solid introduction to Perl which is attractive not only due to the price."},{"Title":"Beginning Perl (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I am searching for a good PERL reference for my Kindle which I just received, and the \\"Programming Perl\\" is not out, nor are any of the other good books that I would normally consider, and the other ones are enormously expensive ... way past the $9.99 or whatever that Amazon says that most books will sell for.So ...

Its capabilities give a single user/operator the ability to do things that not too long ago required the services of a couple of different trade shops and the expenditure of weeks of time and large amounts of money. It gives graphic artists, both designers and photographers, a degree of control over their work they have never had before.Unfortunately, the fact that the natural users of Photoshop are graphic artists--not computer experts--is often overlooked. If nontechnical users can't understand and access its capabilities, they might as well not be there. By providing these lucid and easy-to-follow explanations of Photoshop Elements, Molly Joss has done a real service to graphic artists, photographers, and anyone else who wants to maximize the effect of digital images. Her book belongs in the library of every serious Photoshop user."},{"Title":"How to do Everything with Photoshop Elements","review":"I ordered this book before it was released because I had gotten a copy of another Osborne book about Handspring Visors in the How To Do Everything series and was very pleased with the well written, detail packed content. The PS Elements book is however a joke. It is obvious that it was a rush to print and cash in on a new PhotoShop software program and contains very little, if any meaningful information.Example1: Some of the explanations for use are \\"Just adjust the different settings up & down till it looks good, then click OK\\" Huh?? I mean even PhotoShop instructions are better than this!!!Example2: Instead of the graphics for Chapter 12 title page(among others) being printed there is a note that says \\"cover image here please. need from Creative Services\\" Also some of the Figures referred to in the text are non existent or wrong!!Example3: The screen shots & pictures in this book are of the worst quality.

She always presents information in a to-the-point, easy-to-read manner, and &quot;How to do Everything with Photoshop Elements&quot; is no exception.There's a targeted audience here -- the consumer and the business user who's not a graphic artist -- and the book does an excellent job of teaching photo-editing basics using Photoshop Elements. Instead of the command-by-command approach of two-inch-thick guides, this book focuses on the most-common jobs of occasional users: simple color correction, sharpening, cropping, etc.The book also deaks with some non-photo work, such as drawing and text effects. For the graphics pro, these are tasks better suited for a program such as Adobe Illustrator; however, for the general audience Joss aims for, the details show a great way to get the most power and value from Photoshop Elements.This isn't a book for power users, but Photoshop Elements isn't a software for intense graphics work, either. &quot;How to do Everything with Photoshop Elements&quot; provides some friendly, non-technie instruction that provides basic skills.So why three stars? The writing and instruction are easily four to four and one-half on the rating scale; however, the book could've used more color illustrations of commands and techniques. The book's layout and art quality (including the missing chapter-title art) shows some slap-dash work and inattention by the publishing company; Joss' clear writing and good instruction deserves better."},{"Title":"How to do Everything with Photoshop Elements","review":"I have rarely seen a book that purports to teach graphic design, in one way or another, so poorly illustrated.

As a Macintosh user, I'm accustomed to this sort of treatment, unfortunately.The title page to Chapter 12 is missing and bears a query from the author, presumably to the publisher: &quot;Cover Image here.

Clores is brutally honest about the ups and downs of her spiritual quest. She is a likable and entertaining guide, and the tone is light, despite the seriousness of the topic. This probably sounds funny, but I think that this book would make an excellent Christmas/Hanukkah gift. Too many of us forget that there is a rich spiritual world outside the gates of the major organized religions."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Spiritual Outsider","review":"Throughout the book Ms. Clores wrote that there were many things wrong in her life, and because of that, she was searching for the right spiritual answers. Still, she refused to think about committing to any path. She focused her spiritual journey on quick answers, but no relationship is instantaneous. Certainly a spiritual practice is about building a relationship to the divine.Even when she enjoyed a spiritual event, she found a reason not to participate in a second one. With one excuse or another, she held herself apart. She intellectually analyzed what she might be feeling instead of focusing on what she truly did feel. Most of the time, she did not try to understand the various beliefs. She didn't even ask questions.And so, she learned next to nothing. Bouncing from one spiritual practice to another, she rarely asked questions and often walked away with incorrect assumptions. There was so much she could have learned, but her assumptions blocked the way. She offered a frustrating lack of involvement in her own journey. Much of the information provided in the book is extremely basic and some of it is totally inaccurate."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Spiritual Outsider","review":"I read this book when I was in my late twenties and still \\"searching\\". It was the PERFECT book for that time period because it addressed the spiritual angst I was feeling at a similar age. I had accomplished all my goals (get a degree, get a job, get married) and I was still a member of the church/religion in which I was raised. I *SHOULD* have been content. I was not. When I picked up this book, I had hoped it would address some other options for spiritual fulfillment and it did just that. I never anticipated it would show me how I SHOULD worship; afterall, my life had been filled with people doing THAT and look how it turned out. While the score of 1 review points out that Suzanne's path was never committed to any specific religion as a negative, I, in turn, found that to be a positive. It was the FIRST time I'd ever read ANYTHING that--- rather than attempting to persuade me to see it THEIR way--- gave me logical, thoughtful, and non-biased way to look at spirituality and a multitude of paths. Rather than telling me where to look, this book gave me the knowledge and strength of self to begin my OWN search to find a relationship with the Divine. Is it going to answer all your questions? No. If anything, it should raise even more. THAT is what a great book does :)"},{"Title":"Thine is the Kingdom","review":"Book Review - \\"Thine is the Kingdom - the message of original Christianity\\" by Peter J. Southgate1st edition 1986, 2nd edition 1997The note printed on the back cover of this book says \\"Even a brief reading of the Gospels shows that the Kingdom of God was the very theme of Christ's preaching, and that it was also the main thrust of the preaching of the early Christians. Yet very few modern believers have a clear idea of what this Kingdom is\\".Peter Southgate wrote \\"Thine is the Kingdom\\" to address the situation of almost universal ignorance of this subject, even amongst many who lay claim to the title \\"Christian\\". The title of the book is a phrase from the Lord's prayer, recited by thousands of people weekly if not daily; but many of these same people, if challenged to explain just what they understand by the Kingdom of God, would not be able to give an answer that stands up to scrutiny alongside the Bible.The author marshals some 500 Bible verses to demonstrate what the expression \\"The Kingdom of God\\" really means. In this way the Bible is allowed to speak for itself - the book is in no sense merely the opinions of the author. He shows that the Kingdom of God was taught by Jesus and his disciples, that it is the basic unifying theme of both Old and New Testaments, that Jesus will return shortly to the earth to destroy all forms of human government and on their ruins establish the glories of God's everlasting Kingdom.Chapter 2 on \\"The Kingdom of God on Earth - the earth's future revealed in the Bible\\" shows that the world is not out of control, far from it. History has followed, and current events are following, the path set out in the Bible prophecies thousands of years ago. And the ancient prophecies also describe the Kingdom of God in detailed word pictures that show how the great problems that now afflict the earth will be solved.Chapter 4 on \\"The Textbook of the Kingdom - can we trust the Bible?\\" gives reasons why we should pay attention to this book which claims to be the Word of God. After reading this chapter only the most unreasonable of people will neglect the message of the Bible.Chapter 8 on \\"The Kingdom Lost Sight of - how views on the Kingdom changed\\" provides an interesting historical perspective on how Bible teaching has been corrupted and distorted. This emphasises just how important it is to read the Bible for ourselves and not simply rely on what other people say that it says.Chapter 9 on \\"The Kingdom made possible\\" the author stresses that this is not simply an academic issue - it affects us personally, since through the sacrifice of Jesus it is perfectly possible for everyone to be in the Kingdom of God. What is required is a humble submission to the commandments of God. And even death will not prevent us being in the Kingdom, since by his sacrifice and resurrection Jesus has made it possible for us to be too to be resurrected when he returns to the earth.The Kingdom of God will be a real political kingdom on earth, with its capital city at Jerusalem and Jesus Christ as its king. And it will last for ever. \\"Thine is the Kingdom\\" proves that this is the message of original, Bible, Christianity."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is about a 13 year old boy who is stranded in the Alaskan wilderness all alone following a plane crash and has to learn how to survive. It is based on a real character and is intended for boys, ages 10 and up. It was a cool book for me because I hunt and camp in the wilderness a lot and it made me think of what it would be like to be stranded. So I easily related to this character. The author did a good job of drawing me into the story such that I felt like I was in the Alaskan wilderness myself! When he was lost, Brian, the main character, learns a lot of stuff about life, himself, and how to survive in the wilderness. Unfortunately, it was all learned the hard way. This book is written in narration, like a stranger watching from afar, but who can see Brian's thoughts. The story also appealed to my senses, for example, \\"his leg was instantly torn with pain, as if a hundred needles were driven into it,\\" allowed me to get a real sense of his pain! This vivid writing combines to make an interesting, spell binding, enriching book, clearly written by one who knows about the wild. Gary Paulsen has run 2 Iditarod's, which are long races across Alaska by dog sled. He also is experienced in trapping and hunting, which he has been doing since a young boy. This is truly one of my favorite books and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventures or just good books. You might also consider reading Brian's Winter, the sequel to Hatchet, that describes what he would have had to endure in the winter, if he had not been rescued. Paulsen wrote many other adventure books, but these are two are my favorites!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"After 20 years, the paperback version of Gary Paulsen's classic tale of a boy surviving in the wilderness alone is still in Amazon's Top 3000 in Sales.

I think the drawings by Drew Willis and Gary's own author notes, make that version of the book worth a the extra cash.)As for the story, it's about a teen boy, Brian, who suddenly finds himself stranded after the Cessna he was in crashes in a lake-- the pilot dying beforehand of cardiac arrest. It becomes a coming of age story not only because Brian has to overcome his own weakness, but because he also has to come to grips with his parents recent divorce and his mother's infidelity.This is a wonderful book that draws most kids into reading the entire series.

My fourth grade teacher had read the first few chapters and I was just blown away.Gary Paulsen has a gift. A gift that some people do not have. The gift of creative writing. The way Gary Paulsen can suck you into the book by the 3rd chapter is AWESOME! I had never read his books. So now I am going to start reading his books more often. So now I will tell you a little bit about the book.Brian(a 13 year old boy) is in s plane. He has never been in one. It is a plane for to people. The two people on the plane are Brian and the pilot. The pilot shows Brian how to fly for a small moment. But after passing the border into Canada something happens to the pilot. But I cannot tell you. Brian is forced to fly a plane that is about out of fuel. He tries to get the head set off of the pilot to call for help. But the plane jerks a little off course and Brian flies the plane for more than an hour after that small jerk. He is in the Canadian wilderness with nothing to see but trees. As he looks out the window, the plane losing altitude, he sees an l shaped lake and tries to land in it. As the plane quickly moves down, he cannot see the lake anymore. But then.....Now he is in the middle of who knows where and his only tools are his hands and a hatchet. Will he survive? Will he ever be found?Read the book, and you will find out."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Obviously, with over 1,000 reviews of this work posted on Amazon alone, there is very little I can add to the way of enlightenment or insight into this wonderful little work. I can only give it my endorsement (for what ever that is worth) and make a few observations from a personal point of view.I must say that this is a first rate survival story, i.e. man (or in this case boy) against the wilderness. Briefly, a young lad, Brian, is traveling to the far North Land to join his father for the summer shortly after his parents have divorced. The pilot of the small aircraft suffers a fatal heart attack and the plane crashes in a lake in the remote wilderness of Canada. The boy, Brian is completely alone and all that he is left with are the clothes on his back and a small hatchet which was on his belt when the plane went down. This is his story; how he survived for an extended period of time in quite a hostile environment.The story is quite well written and is quite realistic in just about every aspect of the setting and circumstances. Anyone who has spent even a brief time in a wild area will appreciate the author's meticulous research on the subject. The author has also been able to nail perfectly the young man's reactions, not only to the situation at had, but his thoughts and emotional turmoil over his parent's recent parting of the ways.There are a couple of points which need to be considered when choosing this work, either to read, or to assigned it as a class read. First, if you examine the text closely you will find that the author has repeatedly reinforced the fact that one of the reasons the boy is able to survive is through knowledge he has consciously or subconsciously received via school, T.V. and reading. This is important; the boy, a city boy, is not completely clueless.Secondly we have the author's ability to stress the fact that a cool head and the use of a bit of logic, after thinking things out, pays off in big dividends.It should also be noted and stressed that this is simply a well written book, good story and well constructed on all levels.Now I note that overwhelmingly this book has received approval from its readers. I do not that there are a number of less than flattering reviews. If you read these not so good reviews you will find that the vast majority are written by the younger set that have been \\"forced\\" to read them in literature or English class. This of course is quite natural. I would suggest that these folks that found the book \\"boring, repetitive, poorly written, etc. read the book again in a few years, on your own time, under your own steam, and see if your take is the same. I know that many of the works that I was forced to read in school, which I hated at the time, became some of my favorite reads as grew older. Your views, taste and general knowledge changes over time and what you are put off by when you are quite young, you will look at with completely different eyes as you grow older.This read is perfect for the middle school group, sat from 10 to 14 years old. It is though a good read for any age. Hey, it takes a couple of hours to read, is truly a page turner, and a well done piece of literature by most standards. A careful reading of this work will teach many good lessons that can be applied to most aspects of life...you just have to leave your mind open for them and if you are \\"made to read it\\" by your clueless English Teacher...don't fight it. Chances are you will thank them in later years.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was an unpredictable, adventure of a young boy. It made me feel like something freaky was going to happen, cause a tornado happens in this book, how exciting. I was totally captivated-stoked at every turn."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is an amzing book full of suspensful parts, like when Brian dropped his hatchet in the plane while trying to get the health pack. Sure, this book has some boring parts, but after you get into it, you'll really like it. I reccomend this book to people. Here's a short summary of it:Brian Robeson is a boy who has parents in a divorce. He is going to see his father on a small plane with a pilot over the wilderness. But, when the pilot has a heart attack in the middle of the plane ride, Brian is shocked. He has no clue how to fly the plane, but tries his best. After a Brian is bruised up and very tired. So, he makes a small shelter. Then a bear attacks him one of the nights and tears down his shelter. Brian has to make a new on. The story goes on like this, like when a small tornado tears down his sturdy fort. He survives by eating fish and \\"Fool\\" birds. Finally, after he thinks no one is coming, he remembers that there's a survival packet in the plane somewhere. So, he makes a raft and floats out on the lake a cuts a small hole in the tail of the plain. He accidentily drops his hatchet in the tail and into the water. Then, he dives down to grab it, and sees the rotten face of the dead pilot. He gags and swims back up. So, he tries it again, and this time getting the hatchet without looking at the pilot's bloated face. He also gets the survival packet and presses a button on the transmitter and nothing happens. Brian thinks it's broken, so he leaves it alone. The next day, Brian is eating his food and a plane lands by his camp. Brian is shocked. The pilot takes Brian into the plane and leaves.I reccomend this book to anyone of all ages(Accept for people 7 and under. There was a few bad words)."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I screen each book I buy for my son's reading. Got started on this one one day while waiting for the phone man. Couldn't put it down! I love outdoor things, and I loved the way this book was written and presented. I thoroughly enjoyed how the main character was made to seem so real when he'd break down for a bit and feel as if he couldn't make it. But the human spirit is strong, and he would rally again and realize he had no choice but to make it. I found that to be inspirational to me for the problems I deal with in life. Lots of interesting scenarios, never a dull moment. My son will love it when he gets to this one. Very good read for boys, as well as girls who are interested in outdoor skills. Who knows, it could even save a life."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I am sure there are a number of parents who have middle-schoolers, who remember the need for a book purchse for school, DUE THE NEXT DAY!

Now being a good parent I required my forgetful middle schooler to pay me for the overnight shipping! Responsibility first!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Both of my boys loved Gary Paulsen's books when they were 9-12 years old. Good books to get boys to read and really like it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book I am reviewing is Hatchet by Gary Paulsen and I give this book a five star rating.I gave this book a five star rating because of the plot and the details of the book. The plot is one that no one would think of. Who would make a book about a thirteen year old boy that is in a plane crash and is stranded out in the Canadian wilderness? Now he must survive with just a hatchet. I find this book so fascinating because Gary Paulsen wrote this book about past experiences. He actually did some of the survival skills in this book in real life!The other reason I love this book is because of the details Gary Paulsen uses. When Gary Paulsen writes about mosquitoes biting the main character, it is so descriptive I actually start to itch! This is what makes Hatchet such a fantastic book.Other titles I would recommend are Brian's Winter, Woodsong, and Brian's Return. I am an eighth grader at Harris Road Middle School."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Somebody help me! Hatchet is another great and amazing title for this book. Gary Paulsen has a very adventurous style in his great realistic fiction books. Brian was going up in a private plane to see his dad in Alaska. His parents are divorced so he spends summers with his dad and the school year with his mom. Brian's mom bought him a hatchet for his trip. On his way up the plane's pilot has a sudden heart attack and the plane crashes into a lake. Brian has to learn how to survive. Brian faces many challenges like finding food, water, and shelter. Many different animals attack Brian. Brian, my favorite character, is depressed because of his parents being divorced. Brian is my favorite character because he is basically the only character and he has great survival ideas. This passage shows Brian's survival ideas. \\"Storing live fish to eat later was a major breakthrough, he thought.\\" There are other books in this series such as Brian's Winter, and Brian's Hunt. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventures and wildlife. This book was an extreme, intense adventure and I strongly recommend following this adventurous series; I know I will!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"GREAT STORY !!

It will lead to great conversation about survival, relationships, and appreciation of our own creature comforts!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Overall great book, I found it hard to put down. It had everything from adventure to some funny parts. The way Gary Paulsen describes what Brian had to endure while being stranded after surviving a plane crash in the Canadian wilderness was a true inspiration. The book shows you how a young city boy who knows nothing about the woods can learn through mistakes and become a survivalist. This is a good book for all ages, and you can really use your imagination in this book!!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"\\"The nick wasn't large, but the hatchet was important to him, was his only tool, and he should not have thrown it. He should have kept it in his hand, and make a tool of some kind to help push an animal away.

He was to stay through the school year with his mom and the summer with his dad, on his flight to visit his dad in a small plane, the pilot had a heart attack, jurked his leg and set a new route for the plane to nowhere. Brian, being the only one on the plane besides the pilot could not fly, and the plane crashed leaving the pilot dead and Brian stranded with only a hatchet for a tool. Brian must learn to survive in the wilderness, alone.This realistic fictional book teaches you to never give up. If Brian had given up on getting food, building a shelter, or hope that some one will find him, he would have died. I really liked Hatchet and you if you read it, you will love it too.

I live in sunny San Diego, California, where it never snows. I can only imagine being in CANADA lost in the forest, surrounded by all that wilderness, and only having a hatchet to survive. Raw fish, berries, turtle eggs, and no fire for the first few days are definitely not my idea of fun. And after that, finding out the fish Brian's been eating have been feeding on the dead pilot's flesh almost made me puke. How about when Brian gets into a fight with a moose that almost breaks most of his ribs? Finally, Brian decides enought of that, he needs to find a way to civilization.

I read this book when I was in junior high, and again in college for a YAL class. The book is very entertaining and easy to read for the less advanced readers. Paulsen is exceptionally good at introducing more difficult words, and then explaining what those words mean. In this way, he can expand the readers vocabulary without confusing them. The book could also appeal to those with more advanced reading skills, because of it's almost peotic rhythm. The author gives his reader the emotions and background of his characters, and then lets the reader fill in the blanks as to how their own senses would react. I would recommend this book to teachers and parents of students who need to devolope the love of reading."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian was 13 year old boy who got lost after getting on an airplane with an older man.

This book reads easy and has a very direct path to the different sections of the reading. There are not too many hidden underlying aspects of the plot; it's more like a non-fiction read that lays out the facts in the order they are occurring. A 13 year old boy name Brian Roberson is the main character and takes up the majority of the book with his crisis and constrains in his new environment. He is very smart for a 13 year and has a self confidence about him. Well groomed and solidly built he transitions from boy-to-man in just 54 days; this being the main idea the author utilizes the tribulations Brian is experiencing with this parents. The story unfolds its structure based on the rugged Canadian Tundra setting and landscape, it is contained to just a small area that Brian hugs to the entire time. Paulsen utilizes this small setting to exaggerate the vast outer land that could be conquered by no man.Brian's mother, worried about him being away from home in Canada for the first time gave him a hatchet that the he uses for nearly everything. This is the relation of Brian with his mother, how she has always taken care of him and kept him safe; now he needs her more than ever and the hatchet which she gave him is representing the mother's presents in the crisis he is in. The complication has exposed itself as the reason Brian is going to his father's new home in Canada is that Brian witnessed his mother having an affair with another man. As mad as Brian is at his mother for her actions he is always reminded of her support by the hatchet in his hands that has saved his life up to this point. The crisis is easily seen by the boy stuck in the wilderness and winter is fast approaching with no real shelter or woodsman knowledge. He struggles through with bears, bugs, wolves, food, fire, shelter, and of course painful memories of home and his mother cheating.There is two climaxes that build from another; Paulsen takes the reader up, down, and then up again but they are two different climaxes with two different missions of delivering feelings. Brian swims to the plane wreckage and hatchets his way into the hull, he drops his hatchets and swims down into the plane to recover it and finds a survival pack, emergency transmitter, food, even a rifle which he had survived without. Now the hatchet given by his mother has delivered the means for escape and rescue. He believes the transmitter is not functioning but a fur-trading plane picks up his signal and brings him home. Other conflicts of the plot come later after the climax; once Brian is being rescued he misses his time in the wilderness alone, away from the drama and conflicts of his parents; this compiled with the transgressions obtained from a 13 year old boy going through his own bodily changes and outlook on life.This novel may seem simply put together and nothing but a story about a boy lost in the wilderness, but it is apparent the author carefully placed the structure of events and narration to deliver more than this. Brian has endured a number of tribulations, he learns and moves on from them being careful to not make the same mistakes again, much like he wishes his mother had never cheated. The boy his mother sent off to visit his father will emerge as a man with a new outlook on life. The resolution sets in as he see's life through new eyes, star struck at site of abundant and verity foods at the grocery store that he always took for granted, and his mother's fail and his coping father never letting go of being stung by the affair. The struggle of survival, and the tragedy of his parents getting a divorced all rolled into a hatchet that saves his life represents the carefully concealed details Paulsen delivered in this captivating story.References:"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is great a perfect read for anyone who likes adventures or survival.

Its about a kid that survies a plane crash and is stuck out in the woods without anyone else. He has to do what most can't. Like survive with only the clothes on his back and a hatchet that his mom gave to him. Anouther reason I like this book is because in away its like real life and not something you can't relate to. In the book he makes spears to kill prey and also makes a bow and arrows to kill what he calls foolbirds and other things he can eat. There is some pretty cool things that go on in this book like when he gets stuck by a porcupine and when he throws the hatchet at it he misses and the hatchet hits the wall. When this happends its makes a spark and thats when he started to use the rock in the shelter for starting fires.

Did you know that I feel so sorry and sympathetic for Brain because he had to stay in the Canadian woods for 54 days? That, for me, is a very long time! All this time Brian was only eating turtle eggs that he found under the sand. He also ate some fish and some raspberries. Brain met a mother bear with her two cubs and he also met the first wolf that he saw in his life. I was wondering if Brain would kill the bears and the wolves with his bow and arrow that he was making with his hatchet. Did you know that he had two best friends in the Canadian woods? They were the fires that he made with a big black stone and the hatchet. Brian cannot live without fire and hatchet! He needed fire for cooking and keeping himself warm at nights. The fire was also the guard to protect him from passing by wild animals. Never had he ever imagined that the Hatchet was so crucial to help him survive. Surprisingly Brain heard a plane approaching him. So he said to himself, &quot;If that is a plane, someone must be here to save me!&quot; But he was too late, the plane gone......gone. He could not understand why the plane was gone so fast. He mumbled to himself,&quot; I was too slow and could not make a smoke signal. I am lost...lost!&quot; I really think that E.B. White and Gary Paulson are brothers. They both share similar writing styles. In Charlotte's Web E.B. White did not introduce the main character Charlotte until the 5th chapter while in HATCHET Gary Paulson used million words to describe a scene. Both authors like to paint pictures in your mind. They are very successful in keeping the stories so interesting that people glue their eyes to their books and cannot get them off!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I was pre-reading this book for my 10-year-old who enjoys adventure stories (along the lines of \\"My Side of the Mountain\\") and was glad that I did. Some of the content of this book is NOT appropriate for this age -- for example, when the boy recalls the details of witnessing his mother engaged in an adulterous passionate kiss with her lover, which became \\"the Secret\\" his father did not know about. I'm not saying it is a bad book for an appropriately aged reader -- but I do want to warn parents looking for an innocent adventure story for their children -- this is not it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I have read this book twice. Once in middle school and again in high school. Still I believe this is my favorite book of all time. Hatchet is an epic battle between man and nature. In this instance, man wins, but nature gives him a run for his money. This book is about a boy, Brian Robeson, who is flying in a bush plane on his way to Canada to see his father, who had just seperated from his mother. As they are flying, the pilot shows Brian the basics of steering the plane. He is afraid at first, but he gradually gets more comfortable with it. Suddenly, the pilot has a heart attack at the wheel, and Brian is left to navigate the plane on his own. He ends up crash landing in a lake, in the middle of the wilderness, where he somehow gets out and ends up on shore. He is left there to fend for himself, with nothing but a hatchet which he had received before he left for his trip. He built himself a lean-to for shelter, but his biggest threat comes at night with coldness and the inability to build a fire to stay warm. Throughout his time in the wilderness, a few other obstacles get in his way including: being attacked by a bear and a moose which he barely survived, and being sprayed by a skunk, which he probably barely survived either, while coping with hunger, all while trying to find a way out before winter sets in. Luckily he gets out by the time it really hits hard. He was very lucky. He became very strong mentally and physically. This is a great book. I would recommend it to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Stranded in the Canadian wilderness after his two-passenger plane crashes, thirteen-year old Brian Robeson is forced to tap into reserves of resourcefulness and determination that he never knew he had in order to survive. In Hatchet, Gary Paulsen has managed to take the classic idea of a survival story and with it create an original and engaging masterpiece. This is definitely a book that everyone should read sometime in their life, and is one that especially every teenage boy must read. Paulsen's writing style and creativity are sure to capture and keep the interest of every young reader. This book is written especially for teenage boys, and they are extremely able to connect with it. In Hatchet, Gary Paulsen makes excellent use of characterization and realism to effectively connect with and captivate male young adult readers.One of the first instances in which Paulsen uses characterization effectively to connect with readers is when, while Brian is flying north in the bush plane, the pilot asks Brian if he would like to try taking the controls of the airplane. Brian at first responds the invitation doubtfully: \\"He had never been in any kind of plane, never seen the cockpit of a plane except in films or on television\\" (4). This example reveals to the reader that Brian is just an ordinary thirteen year-old boy just like them. He has not had any special upbringing or training that would prepare him to meet the challenges that he will face; he is just a regular teenager. Before the action of the book has even begun, similarities are presented between Brian and the reader. As the reader begins to identify with Brian, they become interested in how a person that is like them will respond to the challenges are put in his way, and so become more involved in the book.Another example of characterization is when Brian is reflecting on the recent divorce of his parents: \\"How he hated lawyers who sat with their comfortable smiles and tried to explain to him in legal terms how all that he lived in was coming apart\\" (Paulsen 2-3). This example shows again that Brian is just a normal teenager with his own struggles and difficulties. While many readers may not be going through a divorce, they have their own problems in their lives that are hard for them. This struggle gives Brian's character more depth and allows the reader to more fully identify with him. As a stronger connection forms between Brian and the reader, the reader becomes more interested in what will happen to Brian and becomes more fully invested in the book.This connection is strengthened further through Paulsen's use of characterization when Brian tries to light a fire without matches for the first time. He has a very difficult time getting the fire started, and finds himself thinking: \\"If only I had matches ... How did they used to do it? he thought. Rub two sticks together?\\" (65). Many times throughout the book, Brian finds that nothing in his earlier life has prepared him to solve the problem that is before him at that instant. Again the reader sees that Brian is a normal person with a background that is probably very similar to their own. They see that this is just a regular boy who is used to life in the city, but who now has these challenges thrust upon him. Once again, the reader becomes concerned with how Brian will overcome his challenges, because perhaps they would make choices similar to the ones made by this boy who is so like them.Paulsen uses effective characterization again when describing Brian's emotional responses to his challenges. On the second day that Brian is stranded alone in the wilderness, after a particularly difficult night, Brian is \\"almost overcome with self-pity. He was starving and bitten and hurt and lonely and ugly and afraid and so completely miserable that it was like being in a pit, a dark, deep pit with no way out\\" (70). This response to his trials is a very normal and human response. The reader recognizes that it is very ordinary to have such feelings when going through such a hard time, and indeed realizes that they themselves would most likely feel much the same way. Once again, the connection that the reader has with Brian and the story is strengthened.In addition to using effective characterization, Paulsen also successfully uses realistic and believable events to connect with the reader. One of the most significant ways in which Paulsen makes the plot of the story believable is that bad things happen to Brian. When Brian finds some berries to eat on his first day in the wilderness, he thinks that he has finally had some good luck, but the berries end up making him extremely sick: \\"Never anything like this. Never. It was if all the berries, all the pits had exploded in the center of him, ripped and tore at him\\" (67). This is just one example of the many misfortunes that come to Brian throughout the book. This makes the story seem very realistic because bad things do in fact happen to everybody. Brian does not have any extraordinary luck or fortune; he is just like anybody else. Anybody who reads this book will know that misfortunes are a fact of life. This allows the reader to form a connection with the book because it reflects what the reader has observed in his own life.Another way in which this book is realistic is that events occur suddenly with little or no warning. Only a few days into his isolation, Brian goes to sleep feeling good about the day's success only to be woken up the next morning being injured by a porcupine: \\"So fast, he thought. So fast things change. When he'd gone to sleep he had satisfaction and in just a moment it was all different\\" (81). Throughout the book, Brian experiences many other sudden changes in his fortunes. Again, this makes the story seem realistic. In real life, events occur without any warning. There is rarely any foreshadowing to signal that something bad is about to happen. Once again the reader sees truths from real life reflected in the book, and the story becomes easier to believe and to connect with.The story is also realistic because it is hard for Brian to find solutions to his problems. For example, when Brian tries to make a bow to use to catch fish, his first attempt is a failure: \\"He put an arrow to the string, pulled it back to his cheek, pointed it at a dirt hummock, and at that precise instant the bow wood exploded in his hands sending splinters and chips of wood into his face\\" (124). This failure comes after he has already failed at making and using a spear to catch fish, and even after he later successfully makes a bow it is difficult for Brian to learn how to use it effectively. Brian must figure out solutions to his problems by himself just like people in the real world must find their own answers to their difficulties. Those answers are not magically presented to him. The reader realizes that this is the way that things actually happen, and so again the story becomes more believable and reader becomes more interested in it.Paulsen also uses excellent imagery and details to make the story seem tangible and realistic. When Brian stops for a few moments to pay attention to his surroundings, he hears things that he has never experienced before: \\"When he started to listen, really listen, he heard thousands of things. Hisses and blurks, small sounds, birds singing, hum of insects, splashes from the fish jumping--there was great noise here\\" (41). Details and images like this are found throughout the entire book. These descriptions allow the reader to form picture of where the events described in the book are taking place. The details that are given make the setting seem richer, fuller, and more tangible. This firm setting allows the reader to sink deeper into the action of the book because they now have a place established in their minds where the events are taking place.All of these instances of characterization and realism, as well as the countless others found throughout the entire book, work together to effectively attract the interest of male young adult readers, as well as other readers of all ages. Paulsen is able to masterfully use these techniques to create a story that is engaging and captivating. This is one of the best books for young readers that I have come across. I would strongly recommend it for anyone who is looking for a good book to read, and if somebody is not looking for a book I would recommend it to them anyways. This book is a must-read for everybody!Edition Cited:Paulsen, Gary. Hatchet. New York: Aladdin Paperbacks, 1987."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet was an amazing story of the survival of a 13 year old boy named Brian Robeson in the Canadian wilderness. I really enjoyed this book and it held my interest with extraordinary descriptions and intense suspense. Hatchet contained adventure, but it also had deeper meanings not usually found in adventure stories. Although this book was not hard to read, and it was not very long, the descriptive details of the wilderness and the survival tactics kept me turning the pages.My favorite part of the story were the conflicts. The main conflict in the story was a boy trying to stay alive in the wilderness alone with no food. There also was a strong internal conflict that surfaced about \\"the secret\\". \\"The secret\\" was that Brian found out about his mother's affair. In trying to survive, smaller external conflicts occurred, such as animal attacks, tornados, and starvation. All of the conflicts combined made an exciting story. Another thing that I liked about the story was the theme. The theme of Hatchet was that Brian learned from his mistakes, and moved on. This was extremely important to the story because every mistake was very crucial. For example, when Brian's shelter was not closed securely, a porcupine was able to get in to the shelter and stick Brian with its quills. This injury caused Brian great pain and limited his ability to get survival supplies. He learned from his mistake and made his shelter more secure so animals could not enter as easily. Because Brian learned from his mistakes the story was more realistic.I disliked the mood of the story because some parts were sad. For example, the mood was sad when Brian thought his situation was hopeless. Actually, the sad mood was the only thing that I did not like about the story. I think that someone who likes adventure and challenge would like this story. A person who dislikes the outdoors probably would not like Hatchet. I enjoyed reading this book and I would read it again. I do not think that this book would make a good movie, because there was not much dialogue in the book, and I really do not think a movie without dialogue would be very good.A good lesson I learned from this book is that being positive will always help make a negative or difficult situation better. Reading this story really gave me a new appreciation for the necessities that I take for granted."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen is an adventurous story about a teenager, Brian Robeson, and how he survives over two monthes in the woods. Brian's pilot dies in the plane, so Brian tries to fly the plane and finds a safe place to land. Brian has to try to survive in the woods with many setbacks. For example, Brian is a city boy. He relies on his parents, a store where he can easily get food, and his house. During this experience, he learns from trial and error, common sense, and a little bit of what he learned from watching television. Brian has encountered many wild animals including a moose, a wolf, a bear, and a skunk. Brian goes through so much and so many set backs, it's hard to believe he lived for more then two months in the woods by himself with only his brain and his hatchet. He matures greatly and quickly when he pays more attention to what happens around him. After one month, the police and his parents quit looking for Brian assuming that he is dead. Will Brian survive through the harsh winter, or will he be saved? I would recommend Hatchet because it let's you see what it is like to live in the wild with nature and wild animals. In this adventurous story, you see how Brian is able to survive in realistic events, as well as see how he matures throughout the book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book Hatchet is about a 13 year old boy named Brian, who is in a plane crash while on his way to visit his father.

My favorite part is when Brian, who lives on his own for 54 days, finds \\"the survival pack.\\" Hatchet would have been an even better book had it not been so concerned with \\"the secret.\\" Without this part of the plot, it would have been strictly a survival story, which is really where the author did the best storytelling.

A 13 year-old boy, Brian Robeson was going to see his dad in Canada when the pilot of the two person plane got a heart attack and they crashed. Then he was stranded in the wilderness with only a small hatchet on his belt. A good plot. The writing style of this book was pretty good.

(OK, I read it. . . and enjoyed thoroughly) Hatchet By Greg Paulsen.It is about a young boy who finds himself in dire circumstances with only a hatchet for survival. Not a unique storyline, but the nuances of the writer, his amazingly unique 'voice' and the rich details that he points out are ingrediants for an excellent experience.At one point the young man observes something to the effect of: \\"Life was difficult, every bite had to be fought for, worked for and sacrificed for, and yet as I looked out over the setting sun, on the L shaped lake, drew in the rich clean air and listened to the sounds that city-life had deafened me to, I found I only wished to share. Wanted someone, anyone to say, \\"LOOK! LISTEN! TASTE!\\" But there was no one to share with. There was only me, and indescribable beauty\\" (That isn't a quote, but the essence of the feeling I had from the passages)Worth anyone's time, but I believe the reading audience was intended to be from about 10 - 16.

(#2063 as I write this.) And it's because of this kid-tested longevity that I'm going to suggest you buy \\"Hatchet\\" as the illustrated hardback. I think the drawings by Drew Willis and Gary's own author notes, make this version of the book worth a the extra cash because plainly put, it's likely to be a book that your children will keep and hand down to their own children, another 20 years from now.As for the story, it's about a teen boy, Brian, who suddenly finds himself stranded after the Cessna he was in crashes in a lake-- the pilot dying beforehand of cardiac arrest. It becomes a coming of age story not only because Brian has to overcome his own weakness, but because he also has to come to grips with his parents recent divorce and his mother's infidelity.This is a wonderful book that draws most kids into reading the entire series. Gary Paulsen's writing and his knowledge of how to survive in the wilderness is addictive.Great story that's been kid-test.a Pam T mini reviewBooksforKids-reviews"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book hatchet was a good book. I recommend it to people that like a lot of suspense and books that you really have to think about. I also recommend the book to people in between the ages of 9-14 because if you're any younger or older it might be too hard or too easy.This book is about a 13 year old boy that is going to see his father in Canada and gets in a plane crash on his way and he is left alone to fight the wilderness with only a hatchet and goes through life changing experiences.My favorite chapter is the first one because in my mind I think that it was the best one that he wrote because it was very descriptive and it was the chapter that he got into a plane crash. Also if you do read thus book you will notice that she repeats things and I think it was kind of annoying but it really helped you understand the book.What I liked the most about the book is the things that he figures out in his life and another thing is how you see him change from depressed and sad to funny very, very smart and nice well I mean at least from what I read.The last I want ot say is the bad things about the book one of them is the auother needs to cool down with the bad things in life and that's really it.Well I hope that you read this book I promise you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Thirteen year old Brian Robson is without food or water and injured in the middle of nowhere... He's a everyday teenager that goes to school. His parents are divorced and he's on a plane to see his dad when disaster strikes... his pilot has a heart attack and dies. But the plane is still running. In a panic, Brian takes the wheel and aims for an L shaped lake with a little sand bed next to it. He crashed and survived... barely...Brian is smart, brave and strong. He was smart enough to figure out that the lake was made during the ice age and the beach was made by a big rock tumbling and a glacier crushing it. And if someone isn't brave surviving a plane crash then I don't know what is. He's physically strong by surviving a plane crash and after being very injured he still had the will to survive.This book is completely full of nature. It had some parts where nature threw everything it had at Brian like when animals were stealing Brian's only food. Brian never had any human friends to comfort him, but he met tons of animals like fool birds, fish, porcupines, bears, annoying bugs, wolfs, and some other birds. He also saw some mountains, trees and \\"gut cherries.\\" But the only not natural things he saw were his hatchet and his clothes.Brian had a huge struggle. Not only did he have to survive, but he had to survive alone. Imagine you're stuck on a island with nothing but the ruined clothes you're wearing. But Brian wasn't completely alone he had only one friend, his hatchet that his mother gave to him. The hatchet plays such a big role in this story that they named the book after it. He made stuff with it and almost died with it.The author's style of writing is a fish hook. If you don't know what that is I'll tell you. It's when the book gets so bad for the character that if you had a graph then all you would see would be a line down. Then something good happens and makes the arrow go up and the end result is the graph would look like a fish hook. The author also throws a lot of bad things at the character. But Brain did more than suffer, he accomplished a ton, like surviving a plane crash and more, but I don't want to ruin the book for you.This book is full of suspense, action, and drama. You should read it if you like books where the author likes to bully the character. You would also like this book if you like nature. Because I like nature and it seemed that I liked the book because I love nature. You might like this book if you like food. Because the food that he struggles to get makes you think more about food. And how grateful you should be for the stuff you have.Over all this Newbery Honor Award book has a hatchet swinging, sparks showering, and it is breath taking. If you like reading then you will never want to put this book down. And if you did read it and you want more then there are two sequels; the first is THE RIVER and the next is BRIAIN'S WINTER. I loved this book and I want to share the love for anybody that hears the book Hatchet mentioned. I promise if you pick it up you CAN'T put it down."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read this book to my son...he loved the adventure part of the story that I read tohim.

Ruple8R Literacy11 May 2012The main characters or should I say main character in my book, Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, is Brian Robeson a thirteen year old boy who is from New York City. The setting for a bit in beginning is in a small plane, but the main setting is the wilderness of Canada during the summer. Brian's parents are divorced and he lives with his dad in the summer and his mom during the school year. Brian was on his way to his dad's place to say during the summer when the pilot of his plane has a heart attack and Brian fights to keep the plane flying and does for a little while, but eventually he runs out of gas and crashes in an \\"L\\" shaped lake and is stranded to fend for himself and to survive; thirst, hunger and shelter in the endless green wilderness of Canada.The pace was, in my opinion, a great compliment to the story introducing new struggles Brian has to overcome throughout the story. Brian I think is a very likable character because of his confidence, determination, and his survival and analyzing skills. I think the theme the author was trying to get across was, you could be surprised by what you can do to survive. I do think Paulsen successfully got this point across because of all the obstacles the \\"city boy\\" Brian overcame during his survival in the wilderness. He became accustomed to, instead of the city, nature and what he had to do to survive.I would recommend Gary Paulsen's Novel, Hatchet, to any person of any gender and age as long as they are looking forward to a nerve racking adventure and an eye gluing book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"When Brian Robeson is strabded out jn the Canadian woods he has two big options life or death Brian must learn how to survive jn the woods after an unexpected events tuen to the worst.

I always carry a knife with me or some kind of blade close by. I enjoy reading how-to books on camping, hunting, fishing and survival, but sometimes I just really want to enjoy a story. That's when I thought of this book. I read it when I was in grade school and thought it was really interesting, but with my new interest in the great outdoors I bought a copy for myself.I was mostly interested in the survival aspect of the story, but that does not mean the parts before the plane crash did not add to the story. All because he was lucky to have a hatchet with him after the plane crash he was able to create tools for fishing, hunting, building a fire, and building shelter. Close to the end of the book the importance of having that hatchet really shines. He could have had a machete, but it probably would not have been as effective. The book also does a great job of transforming Brian from a city boy to a survivalist. He learned many things about nature and the creatures that dwell in it. The book also shows the importance of thinking fast and acting fast, but not to be reckless since he could have died from starvation, the cold, drowning, wild animal attacks, and anything mother nature could throw at him. This book is a fun way to learn about survival and help the reader become a better person for other situations."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet by gary paulsen.I am doing this review for a book project in my english class. I picked this book because I always hear people talking about how good it is. So I decided to find out for myself weather it is good or not. I'm not really big on reading so not to many books intrest me but when I read the first page of this book it had my full attention and I did not want to put it down. The first chapter is full of action and excitement. Throughout this book a thirteen year old boy tries to survive with very few supplies. Luckly for him though it is summer and not winter. He has a hatchet that his mother gave him and a few more supplies from the plane.I'm not going to spoil the rest of the book for the people who have not read this action, thriller book.

While studying IB Unit of study \\"Sharing the Planet\\" and talking about how the survival of any species depends on it's interaction with outside variables and the adaptations that allow the species to continue to survive, I thought about introducing a book about survival for humans rather than leaning toward the adaptations of animals as is the usual focus. I am SO glad that I did. My students were absolutely enthralled by this novel and are so excited to take on the rest of the series. It's great to have student be able to identify with a character like Brian. Many of my students are living in homes that have been adversely affected by divorce or are currently undergoing a similar transition. The area that I teach in is a very transient area and I feel that this connected to my students on an emotional level, personal level, and additionally it integrated their current unit of study and allowed them to really envision and identify the adaptations that a person must go through to survive...in any situation! Great book! Definitely would have to be used as a read aloud considering the (at times) higher level vocabulary, but the kids were able to use context clues effectively to understand the meaning of words they may not have understood...like fuselage!Can't wait to read the next one, The River!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read this book when I was a child and felt it should be a must read for my boys.

This particular book was different and unique than any other book I have ever read. I can still remember the book clearly.The setting of the story took place in northern Canada. Brian, the main character, was flying to visit his dad in Alaska. The pilot had a severe heart attack and dies while flying. the crashed in a lake below and luckily Brian survived. He somehow got out of the plane and swam to shore on an island. The island was heavily forested and had plenty of wildlife. It was autumn at the time but winter was coming soon. I really enjoyed the way Gary Paulson, the author, described the island. he used many adjectives and made it sound beautiful.The main character, Brian, was a shy, fourteen year old boy. He had black hair and was about 5'8\\". During the story he was stressed and a little bit depressed because of his parents recent divorce. But during the whole book he was determined to get off the island, yet at some points he really wanted to give up and just die. Actually at one point he tried to kill himself by slitting his wrist. I still admired how he handled the problem and obstacles that came to him.The conflict of this book was that Brian was stuck on the island with the cold, harsh, Canadian winter approaching. At one point in the book he screamed out in agony, \\"I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I'm hungry!\\" As he is being tortured with no food, shelter, communication, nor protection. He was in a very scary situation and when you read the book to the end you will be surprised at what happens.The book Hatchet is one of the best books I have ever read. It has suspense, a lot of action, and also good lessons to be learned."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"A must read for the adventure seeker and wilderness lover!Brian Robeson, thirteen, boards a small bush plane along with thepilot. He is going to visit his father in Canada, after his parent's separation, knowing the secret, the reason for their divorce. Brian leaves New York with a hatchet, a parting gift from his mother. Most of the book is about Brian's experiences on his own, learning to take from nature to find food and shelter, learning to hunt and fish and protect himself. Does he live? Is he saved? These questions keep the reader intrigued for all 195 pages of the text. Brian is a strong, well developed character. He evolves, learns and matures from his experience. His story is one of bravery, determination, and the power of positive thinking. Gary Paulsen's writing style is naturally flowing, highly descriptive, and easy to read. The book is a fast read, but is easy to set down and pick up again without losing one's place in the story. A Newbery Honor Book that deserves to be read!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Fabulous story. I have a 13 year old who is a reluctant reader.

Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"When I first read this book with my Freshman English class, I thought it was a bit simplistic. Funny thing, though: the class really liked it. Over the years (I've been teaching 13 years now), it remains a hit with my students. For many of them, it is the first book they have finished from cover to cover.The novel is basically a survival story. Thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson's plane crash lands in the middle of the Canadian wilderness, and much of the plot revolves around his attempts to keep alive until he can be rescued. Other reviewers have mentioned some themes (suicide, marital infidelity) that might trouble younger readers, but no students as of yet have ever voiced any discomfort with reading about these topics. (The sad fact is that many are already too familiar with these in their own lives.)Great literature it is not, but the kids really enjoyed it. Over time, the novel has grown on me because of the kids' reaction. If some students really enjoyed this first installment, Paulsen has a series of books centering around Brian. The sequel, \\"The River\\", is more action and less character driven than \\"Hatchet\\". I haven't read \\"Brian's Return\\" or \\"Brian's Winter\\" (which is an alternate ending to \\"Hatchet\\"), but again, kids might like them."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"STORY BRIEF:Thirteen year old Brian is the only survivor when a small plane crashes in the Canadian wilderness. He has no supplies other than a hatchet which was on his belt - a gift from his mother just before he boarded the plane. It's a story of survival. He needs shelter, warmth, and food. He suffers from insects, other creatures, and the environment.REVIEWER'S OPINION:Parents wanting to encourage your middle school and teenage boys to read - give them this. It's also wonderful for girls and adults. Jacqueline a Goodreads reviewer said that parts frightened her 8 year old, so keep that in mind.At times I was wincing in pain for Brian. Other times I was joyful, relieved, and hopeful for him. I was smiling a lot during the last 15 minutes. There are occasional sprinkles of interesting thoughts on life and what's important. A fun scene was when Brian found something normal to someone in a normal life, but his reaction was \\"I'm rich!\\" Something I liked a lot was seeing how Brian changed his way of seeing and thinking. I like seeing characters grow, learn, or change in a book - which this does well.This was the author's first book. It was so popular that he wrote four sequels and other books. The narrator did a fine job.OTHER BOOKS:The author wrote many books, but the Hatchet series consists of:5 stars. Hatchet (read first)5 stars. Brian's Winter (read second or third but I prefer second)3 stars. The River (read second or third)4 stars. Brian's Return3 stars. Brian's HuntDATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 3 hours 37 minutes.

The answer is probably nothing with the point being that Amazon allows each of its customers an individual voice, despite how many there might be.As a children's librarian (including those middle school children), I know that \\"Hatchet\\" is a great recommended read for reluctant readers for whatever reasons. Why haven't I read this book, I continued to ask myself. So--this summer I asked my great-niece and -nephew, 12 and 10, if we could all read and discuss this book? All agreed, no one finished. Here's how the first couple of chapters go: Brian, aged 13, is flying to a remote area in Northern Canada to stay with his dad. Because the area is so remote, a private plane must be hired. That means one pilot, one passenger in a tiny two-seater. Then, as it so happens from time to time in the real world--out of nowhere, the pilot has a heart attack and dies. In a rush of panic, Brian takes over and flies the plane until fuel runs out. Then he must land. Therein lies the difficulty. With so many lakes and rivers in the Canadian wilderness, where he is, at that point and moment in space and time, reveals an unsatisfactory water bed, but he must land anyway. Water is like concrete to a flying object on impact. Brian hits his head and wrenches his whole body in the crash, but he makes it out and swims to shore in icy water.Now that's an exciting beginning. Who wouldn't want to read further, but I didn't. Finally, when I discovered that none of us had finished the book, I picked it up again and continued reading. At exactly that point begins one incredible episode after the other in Brian's personal and up close experience with a life threatening adventure. A city boy, Brian knows nothing about survival skills or even simple camping. What resources he calls on are two: television programs and a teacher's mantra that each of us is the person to most rely on.As an aside, Paulsen spent a few nights camping in his backyard, using stones and sticks to start a fire. Finally, his wife asked what in the world was he doing? (I think this is just a neat story to relate about the background for his book and not really true.) He replied, \\"Trying to start a fire.\\" \\"Well, why don't you just use matches?\\" she asked. \\"I don't have any,\\" he responded.And neither did Brian, so the description of his efforts to start a fire ring true--because they are. In his two month sojourn (not intentional, mind you), Brian meets a bear, fool birds, chokeberries, a crazed elk, rabbits, a tornado, and a continuing incredible (but believable) array of obstacles and milestones and little victories.Brian fully expected to be rescued within 24 hours until he remembered how off-course he probably flew the plane himself. Hours turned into days, days into weeks, and .... I wish I could comment on the ending because I have some things to say, but in whatever subtle way I said it, I would reveal spoilers. Allow me this: I had been right there with Brian the whole way. The ending stunned me. I mean it--I was stunned!Because of the ending I began researching what else Paulsen had written, and discovered more Brian books. I cannot say anything about them either, but I've ordered them for my school library.Now I know why I can recommend this book to reluctant readers--and of course, anyone who loves a good story!! Hatchet? Didn't I mention it? It's really not the hatchet that saves Brian for so long--it is Brian himself wielding the hatchet. This book is definitely a great read!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This story takes place in 1988, in the Canadian Wilderness a very exiting setting. Most of this story place in that area. The Canadian Wilderness has caused him to starve. It has caused him to grow skinny and fragile it made him into a new person a new Brian Robeson.This story is mostly about a young man by the name of Brian Robeson. A troubled young man and it all happened because of the secret. It all happened when plane flew out of control and crashed in the Canadian Wilderness leaving him to deal with the dangerous wilderness. Now he's just trying to survive.In my opinion this book is truly a disappointment. I hope you agree with me. The ending was good but, it did not change my mind.

And after fifty-four days, he knew how to cook, make fire, catch food, make shelter, and most importantly, how to survive. This book deserves to be granted four stars. Why not?

Then the next few days after that he made a fire.He made a spear but it didn't work. So he made a bow an arrow to kill fish and fool birds. He also made it for protection from animals.He had a signal fire to signal planes if they flew by and when he went and got the survival pack he turned on a transmitter.

Material meaning the forestry and way of starting over as man had to begin. The fact, rythem, and series of events all were very realistic.

Brian,ther main character, tried to slit his rists and then realized the wonderful world around him. The whole chapter seemed to make very little sense and was very on going and repetative.The main story elements were what firstly seemed to be the conflict. Brian vs nature, survival,and the ever hanging will to die. Finally the resolution was abrupt and sudden.

What I like about this book is that it has a lot of action parts like when the plane crashed or when the porcupine poked him. I like when he tried to kill the porcupine and when he learned he could make fire with the hatchet his mom gave him. I also liked when he took over and drove the airplane because the pilot had died of a heart attack and the plane ran out of fuel.I would recommend this book because it has action and adventure.

But on that day something tragic happened that will leave a scar for Brian for the rest of his life. The pilot had a heart attack! Brian cried out for help through the CB but no one responded.

Luckily Brain had survived the crash, he only had a few things to survive with such as a hatchet. He found many other things aboard in the plane's survival kit and many other weapons such as a rifle with a few shells. Brian never gave up hope no matter what the circumstances were. He had many flashbacks of his family which made him feel bad but also helped him out with his fight and his will to see his loved ones once again. He finds out new ways of doing things every day in the woods which was a struggle nothing was ever easy he finds shelter it looked like a pack of wolves would live but it was abandoned.

He would just wander out to the woods and bring back stuff for dinner or some other helpful supplies. The main reason I gave this book a 5 was because most of the books I read are a pain for me.

Another reason would be that it was a very interesting story about survival. For example, any mistake that Brian makes could cause disaster. \\"Small mistakes could turn into disasters, funny little mistakes could snowball so that while you were still smiling at the humor you could find yourself looking at death\\". Another example is when Brian tries to start a fire, but does not know what to use. \\"Clearly there had to be something for the sparks to ignite, some kind of tinder or kindling-but what?\\" In conclusion, if you are interested in survival and adventure, then read this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The main events in Hatchet are related to the conflict and the solution.

He also had to find food by hunting and fishing. He had to make a fire to help him survive and be seen to be rescued. He was successful because he was rescued.I rate this book 5 stars because it showed how 11, 12, and 13 year old boys can take care of themselves when they are alone in the woods for 54 days.It also was interesting to read because Brian was keeping a secret and never told his dad. It was exciting because you would not know what was going to happen next."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Many others have written wonderful descriptions of what this book is about. I agree that it is is captivating and realistic about survival in the Canadian woods.Now I am teaching English in South Korea and the middle school kids need something to read in English that captures their interest and inspires them to want to read English. Such a book is &quot;Hatchet&quot;. Not only is the story an interesting adventure written in language that is not too difficult for the more advanced young ESL reader, it also provides an opportunity for city kids in another country to learn something about the lore of Canada. One boy that is reading it now can't wait for each new lesson to see what happens next - a rare thing among these kids who seemingly never get an opportunity to learn through sheer enjoyment."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is more than just a survival story. As Brian, a 13 yr old who is the only survivor of a plane crash while going to visit his father, learns to survive, he learns about himself as well as his surroundings. It is different than other survival books I have read because it guides you step by step through his thinking process. It is a primer on how to think, how to reason and problem solve, for this reason alone, I would love my children to read it.Beyond that it is really entertaining. It is suspensful and full of surprising twists and turns. You feel as if you are right there, as if you were Brian.The author Gary Paulsen has spent a lot of time in the woods; he has run two Iditarods (an Alaskan sled dog race). He says (after Brian's Return) that most of the things that happened to Brian have actually happened to him at one time or another.I recommend this book for 10 yrs and up.

He has only a hatchet as a weapon. Brian needs to learn how to be independent or he will never survive. I recommend this book because it kept me interested, it was usually touching, and has a very detailed setting that is absolutely astonishing.In the same way the theme in this novel is Brian trying to adapt or change to his surroundings, the woods. Three supporting details or examples are building a shelter out of wood. Another is finding materials to make a fire. Lastly he eats fresh fish, berries, and other things he finds to survive.Over this entire novel is about Brian, the main character, who is very believable because he will do everything humans would to survive. Often he tries to contact someone for help. He panics when his life is in jeopardy. Also he's brave and changes to depend on what he has to live.In this novel the woods were so realistic and beautifully detailed. Woods plus wild animals with rivers and lakes spread across the land. Almost every day Brian interacts with wild animals. Miles of land filled with bright, green, and fresh trees. One L shaped lake rights were he crashed glistened when the sun beamed down on this beautiful site.In conclusion I recommend this mid blowing novel to most people who enjoy adventure and ailment put into one amazing story.

Well if you haven't here is a way you can get ideas and read a great story. This book is about a boy named Brian and a terrible thing happens and that gets him stuck out in the wilderness. All he has is a hatchet that his mom bought him. I recommend this book because it can teach you things and it is a wild, shocking, and some times funny!This theme of the book is all about surviving, courage, family, and friends. Brian gets stranded and has to learn how to survive. When Brian has to find a bear or some times other animals it takes a ton of courage to do that because I would be scared if a bear tried to attack me. In the book something happens to Brain's family and I don't want to spoil it so you have to read it to find out. Another theme is friends. Brian is very lonely until he finds someone or something and the thing saved his life!The main characters in this book play a big role too. If there were no characters in the book there wouldnt be a story! Brian, Mom, Dad, the Pilot, and another friend were the main characters in this book. The most main character was Brian because that's what the book was about. Mom and Dad played a big role in this book because a huge tragedy happens at the end of this book. The Pilot did because something happens to him.The setting is another place that if it weren't there the story wouldn't make sense.The setting takes place most in the woods but there are other places like the airport and at home but there is one other place that he goes and it is pretty mysterious but he comes to find out what it is. But those are not so much of the main setting areas. The main area is the woods because through out the whole book Brian is in the woods most of the time.I was kind of mad at the end because I thought it ended at that point. But a ton of kids wrote letters to Gary Paulson sohe would write a sequal and he began to write sequels. I really like this book so I think you would really like it if you like Gary Paulson and survival stories. I also think this would be a smart and very awesome book to read because you can get ideas so if the same thing happens to you, you would know what to do.

Brian is flying in a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and the plane crashes into the water. Now Brian has to get used to living in the wild. Brian didn't know much about living in the outdoors but then he started learning more and more each and every day. Brian has to go through many obstacles like bears, mosquitoes, and even a tornado! It would be very hard to do all of this on your own. Brian is almost always hungry. It is a good thing he found a lot of berries.Now I will tell you about Brian. Brian is very strong and funny. He also has a great personality. The book would not be the same without his great personality. Brian is the only main character in the whole story. That is probably because he stranded all by himself. Brian gets very smart at living out in the wild. Brian starts out just lying around and sleeping but then he gets up and starts doing work.Now that I have told you about Brian I will tell you about the setting of the book. Brian lives on a beach with a shelter. The beach surrounds a huge lake, which is where the plane crashed. The plane is still there throughout the story.

The setting is believable. The setting feels real. The setting makes you feel like you're acutely there.The character is brave. The character is smart. The character is happy in some parts and sad in others. The character is cold when he gets out of the water from the plane at the bottom of a lake and warm at night by the fire. The characters name is Brian.Hatchet is about survival. He must survive in the wild. He uses a hatchet to survive. Brian uses the hatchet to make bow and harpoons.He uses survival skills like fishing and hunting to survive. He survives in the wild because of the food there. The food he calls gut berries.Overall Hatchet is good. I give it a rating of 10. At the end the boy survives. A plane picks him up. He goes home in the end. Hatchet is a book by Gary Paulsen. Hatchet is from Gary Paulsens own encounters."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is the most exciting book I have ever read! Paulsen's words come alive right off of the page! I like it beacuse the main character is a kid close to my age, he's 13 I'm 14, that I can relate to. This book starts off strong and keeps going strong all the way to the end. Once you start reading you won't be able to put it down. I can almost Guarantee you will love this book weather you like to read or not."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The pilot lets Brian have control of the plane for a second and gives him a short lecture on the main controls. After the lesson, the pilot takes control again. A few minutes later, the pilot grabs at his chest frantically and falls over onto the controls. Brian pushes him off the controls and tries to steer the plane back into the sky but it's too late. The plane crash lands into a lake in the middle of the Canadian forest. Brian Robeson is thirteen years old and is on his way to visit his father who lives in the Northern Canadian woods. On the way the pilot has a heart attack and dies. Brian crash-lands the plane into a lake in the forest. When he regains consciousness, Brian takes a look around and is at first frightened. After a little, he decides that he's just going to have to survive until he is rescued. Brian is put through many tests of survival and is injured many times. When a storm hits near him, it displaces the water in the lake next to him, revealing the sunken plane. He finds a way into it and grabs the survival kit. The kit has a lot of food in it and an emergency beacon. Brian turns on the beacon but it doesn't seem to work so he throws it aside. A couple hours later a helicopter comes and rescues him. It turns out that the beacon did work. I enjoyed reading this book. I would recommend it to people of all ages. There are survival situations in which people need to know some necessary actions to take. Brian is also a great character. He shows complete determination and emerges from this nightmare successfully.Brian is forced to get his own food, shelter, and clean clothing while staying in the forest. He does this by teaching himself to create spears, a bow and arrow, and other weapons and learning to hunt wild animals. Brian must also cook them and successfully creates a fire in which to cook them. He uses the lake next to him to wash his clothes and for water (thought it isn't completely clean). He also builds himself a little shelter made out of leaves, sticks, and mud.Within this dangerous adventure, Brian is injured many times. After being stuck in the leg with a porcupine's quills, he doesn't give up. He just, painful though it may be, pulls them out. Brian also becomes very ill from eating a bunch of nasty berries.By the end of Brian's nightmare, he has gathered enough food for more months to come and has acquired better tools from the plane in which to work with. He knows how to create a fire for cooking, a small hut for shelter, and use the lake to clean his clothes. He has also mastered the art of catching fish and hunting wild animals.As said before, I would recommend this book to anyone that is willing to read it. It teaches good morals and shows complete determination. I never got bored of reading Hatchet because I always wanted to know what problem Brian was to encounter next and how he was to emerge from it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a story about a boy who has divorced parents and is taking an airplane trip to see his father who lives in Canada. One thing that he took was a hatchet that his mother gave to him. On the airplane something went wrong and the plane crashed on an island. The story is mostly about his adventures on the island and all the animals that he encounters on the island.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves adventures books-not just boys, but girls also."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is a story about a boy whose parents have divorced. He was flying on a private plane to his dad's house, but there was a plane crash. He has to live in the forest for days - no months.I'd give this book 4 stars because it's interesting and fun. I liked it sssssooooo much. It's surprising how much you learn but still have fun. I think this book is heart-stopping because you never know what's going to happen. Will he survive? Will they ever find him?"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book rocked!!! I really like the wilderness and stuff like that so it was really enjoyable. If you ONLY like action books than I wouldn't recommend it. But it's about a 13 yr. old who is going to see his father for the summer in a plane with only him and the pilot. the pilot has a heart attack and dies. The plane crashes into the forests of northern Canada and he's stranded there for months. He discovers how to make fire, catch fish and stuff like that by using his hacthet.

Good."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robenson is flying on a two passanger plane over the Canadian wilderness to visit his dad and then... BOOM!!! The pilot gets a heart attack and dies. Luckily, the pilot showed Brian how to control the plane because it was so \\"easy\\". So, the plane crashe when it runs out of fuel. Lucky Brian surrvives. Now he has to figure how to surrvive with only a hatchet.This was an excellent book. Paulsen is a genius! Ignore the kid who thinks it stunk because they are completly wrong. Anyway, they described the book so well, it was just like giving it 5 stars.The other books (The River, Brian's Winter and Brian's Return) are also good, but I think this one is the best. Happy reading!!!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchetby: Gary PaulsenIn the book Hatchet, Brian Robeson is taking a plane ride to Canada to visit his father. He is going because his mother and father are divorced and his parents live in two different places. On the plane ride it is silent as a sleeping baby until the pilot decides to teach Brain how to fly the plane.The kind of plane they are riding in is a small bushplane with easy controls. The pilot teaches Brian the basic controls like how to turn and how to fly up or down. Then suddenly the pilot starts moaning and groaning that his arm aches and Brian starts to smell something funny. The pilot jokes it must be something he ate. Next, the pilot starts jolting back in his seat and at the next moment, the pilot has a heart attack and dies.Brian now has to pilot the plane. The plane starts leaning, turns to the sharply and goes off course, but Brian doesn't realize it. Then the plane starts running out of gas and starts going down. Brain keeps looking for a lake to land in. Finally, Brain sees a clearing that leads to a lake. He flies the plane down, pulls up to slow down, and the plane crashes into the lake. Brian survives, but the plane sinks to the bottom of the lake.All Brain has left is $20.00, his hatchet, and a smashed watch. He finds berries to satisfy his hunger and the lake that he landed in is fresh water. Brain realizes he has his hatchet to start a fire to keep warm.Another scene in the book was when Brain encounters a black bear and thinks it's going to eat him. Brain stands perfectly still. Next, the bear stands on its hind legs and sniffs Brian. Finally, the bear just leaves him alone and walks away. I was on the edge of my seat until I found out that the bear walked away. How many days will Brain survive out in the wilderness? Will somebody find him? This is a great book. I encourage you to read the rest of the series, which are the books The River, Brian's Winter, and Brian's Return."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book has pain, change, adventure, animals, bad weather, and survival if you like theese things you will like Hatchet.Their is a boy named Brian Robinsion and his parents are getting diviorsed and so he goes on a brush plain to see his father and his mom gives him a hatchet before he leeves and when they are flying over a forestnand small lakes then the pilot is suddenly is having a heart attack! and Brian doesnt know if the pilot is in a coma or dead so Brian Robinsion is going to have to land the plain or die will he survive the plain and live in the woods or will he not!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is an adventure book and a nature book. It's a fun book to read. It's very suspenseful, you never know what's coming up next. It's also exciting because it is dangerous. It is about a boy named Brian who is stuck in the wilderness all alone with only a hatchet. He was out of sorts. He would do anything for food so he made a bow and arrow to hunt fish and birds and he made a little shelter. So if you're into nature and adventure books then go to a book store and buy Hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book called Hatchet is about a boy named Brian who is going on a single engine plane when suddenly the plane crashes because the pilot died of a heart attack. Now Brian has to survive in the wilderness until someone finds him. What made me read this book was a recommendation by a friend...I liked this story because it was about a boy who was trying to survive out in the wilderness and was learning really good things. When he first stayed out in the wilderness, it was hard for Brian to survive, but after a few weeks and months, he started to understand things out there. Like how to survive, how to get food, shelter, and understand animals.My favorite part of the story was that when Brian was going to get some berries he found near by a tree, a wolf saw him and attacked. The next day Brian was all wounded. But when he saw the wolf again, the wolf and Brian understood each other by looking staight in the eye of the both of them, and the wolf didn't do anything to Brian this time. That is how Brian understood animals."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I first read this book in 6th (or 7th grade). I liked it at the time, it was pretty good.

He discovers many conflicts on his journey to survival. This book is excellent for kids 8 and up."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Yeah, at first, I liked this book. In fact, it was the book that caused me to be a Paulsen fan, if you read any more of my reviews. But after reading more books along with Hatchet, a second time, it just doesn't appeal to me any more. Sure, I like survival stories, and own(or owned, I'm not sure) two copies of this book. Nevertheless, I think he's written better. This novel depicts a young man, or just becoming one, crashing in a private airplane due to its pilot's heart attack. Surviving with only a hatchet for a number of days, (I think more than a month) it's not hard to see the end coming. I know I sound like the CRANKY CRITIC but I really did like this book. It was a hard story to put down and, if I recall, I finished it in one day, so it's not that hard of a read. Still, I think he would have done better by combining all four of the Brian series(Hatchet, The River, Brian's Winter, and Brian's Return) into one long novel, even though most of the thoughts that prompted Paulsen to write these recent additions to the series probably didn't occur to him until after Hatchet was published. Still, don't take me wrong. Like I said before, this was the reason I became a Paulsen fan, but it's not as good as most people say it is."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"BuIf you like adventuresome books, you should read this one.

I read it when I was in elementary school and got lost it's story. I would notice that I often wondered how I would fare in Brian's situation. It was years later that I watched the movie Castaway and was immediately reminded of Gary Paulsen's series of books that dealt with similar situations. I loved this book and it is one of my fondest memories of childhood reading. Thank you Mr. Paulsen for your time and dedication put into writing such an excellent piece of literature.Randal"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is a must read for all young men. I read this book probably six years ago and it still is fresh in my mind today. It kept me coming back for more everyday, I couldn't put it down. For that young man to go through all that alone must be so tough but at the same time your thinking that you would love to be in that position. You imagine yourself in that situation and you think about what that would be like. Gary Paulsen does a great job with the detail and being realistic about what might actually happen. He isn't making the boy out to be some super survival man, he is just a regular guy like any of us. When reading the book you really feel for the guy and I know I found myself so deep into the book that I saw myself in the story. I would like to sit down and chat with Mr. Paulsen about the inspiration behind Hatchet, one of my favorite books. It would be great to pick his brain a little bit. He is an outdoorsman and I am an Eagle scout and an avid hunter so I'm sure it would be a great talk.Be sure to read this book, its a classic in my book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Even if your child or especially if your child is not a reader, introduce him to Gary Paulsen's books.

The book was in excellent condition and is a keeper..."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"When \\"Hatchet\\" was first published, I was 17 and heading off to college and was losing touch with young adult novels. Twenty three years later, I heard my son mention this as required reading in a 5th grade reading challenge our county library, King County Washington, puts on every hear. Once again, I paid little attention until about three weeks ago and we were in a book store, this was sitting on an end-cap and he mentioned how much he liked the book and that I should give it a try. Right there, I went on my phone and downloaded the kindle edition and started reading it when I got home. One nonstop sitting later and I was done, completely enveloped in the story of Brian Robeson that Gary Paulsen created.This coming of age story about survival and finding oneself after being left to ones own devices in the wilderness. This novel reminded me a lot of another young adult book I read a few years ago and loved, \\"Touching Spirit Bear\\". Unlike \\"Touching Spirit Bear\\", \\"Hatchet\\" starts with Brian, child of recently divorced parents, being sent to visit his father in Canada where he now works. Brian is being flown from his mother's in Long Island on a single prop plane when the pilot has a heart attack mid-flight, dies and Brian survives the crash of the plane.Like all good coming of age stories, Brian encounters his share of believable, but harrowing encounters with nature, animals and his own internal demons (his parents divorce and the secret he knows that led to their break-up). As a child of divorce, I can still relate to the emotional turmoil that Paulsen creates with Brian and can imagine how much more powerful this book would be to an early teen going through life transformations, especially someone in a similar family situation. As an adult, I found this to be a entertaining read and adventure and will be certain my younger two children read it as they get older."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet has been one of my long time favorite books. I have read it to classes as young as 4th grade and as old as 7th grade. It reaches a wide range of kids. Boys and Girls enjoy it, as Brian has to problem solve his way out of a life or death dilemma. It is a great book to teach foreshadowing, prediction and problem solving. It also has a great message about how to handle tough situations and the choices you have when faced with these situations. I recently read it on our car trip to New Orleans and even my reading reluctant husband enjoyed listening to what would happen next to Brain Robeson. There are also some great sequels to this book which keep the excitment going!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Last year my entire class and I were forced to read Hatchet. I can truthfully say it was the worst book I've ever laid eyes on... Not only is it slow paced and so repetitive that I once seriously wondered if Paulsen had Alzheimer's, but the teacher made us read it one chapter at a time drawing out my agony.The detail, while amazing, dragged on way too long, (If you can't sit through a thousand different descriptions of the same tree stump don't read this book) and the whole book was completely predicable. So much that I found myself constantly, desperately pleading mentally for Paulsen to either get Brian rescued or kill him off and put me out of my misery.As if the plot and place setting being flawed weren't enough the Protagonist is a complete idiot! It is very hard to feel genuinely sorry for him when the survival pack sat at the bottom of the lake for the entire book and he doesn't think to get it until the books almost over. And as for the scene where the moose attacks Brian, I can't honestly say that I wasn't rooting for the moose.Furthermore, before you even start, don't even try to say I'm just some kid that hates to read because I assure you it's not reading I have problems with (having a genuine love of reading and almost all the book in the local library under my belt) it's this book. To make someone who enjoys reading suffer through this is the worst kind of torture in a civil society I can possibly think of! And I can't image it being any better for someone who can't read well or hates to do so, it could more than likely turn them off reading for life!In conclusion the book got one star because Amazon doesn't have a lower rating."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is the wrost book i have ever read! there is no excuse for Gary Pulsen to write shull a dull book!

In this book the main character Brian has to fight for his life alone. Brian has to defend himself and find food and a city boy doesn't know all of these things. Brian is lost and he only has a hatchet.The book Hatchet wasn't the best book but it wasn't bad the only part I really didn't like was when he is extremely hungry and he can't remember that he saw a survival pack that could save his life and when he finds it he gets saved after about 3 days but that's only because of the radio transmitter but I don't care because I just didn't like it didn't have enough action.The hole book wasn't bad so I don't have any regrets for reading this book so in all I am happy for this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"People,readers,hypocrites, let me put it this way. It would take a person with no imagination to read this book. When you read it, it is like Gary Paulson is feeding you the story and you don't even have to think. I found the plot boring and lacking insight. The protagonist could have used some real brains. He managed to get himself pricked by a parcupine, and attacked by a moose. Come on, I know people half his age who have survived in the woods longer than he did. Nothing against Gary Paulson but he could do better.I have read Gary's books for many years. When I was young I thought he was good but as I got older and re-read his books I discovered that my tastes had changed and that I was very youg and naive.In fact his books disturbed me so much that I had to write this book review.It makes you think there is no point in life. The book gives off a sense of depression and makes you feel stupid. It makes people look completely stupid. He is stupid because he got scared by an squirrel and cased by a bird. Hatchet is a book that defines all that is not holy.

The pilot has a a heart attack and Brian has to fly the plane. But he crashs into a lake and is in the wilderness till someone finds him. The one thing he has is a HATCHET."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetDate:9-20-02The book I read was Hatchet by Gary Paulson. This book is about a boy named Brian who is on a plane from Hampton, New York. He is on his way to see his dad that lives in the north woods of Canada. On the way the pilot of Brian's plane has a heart attack. When Brian lands in the middle of a lake he is not sure if he is going to make it to the shore. As he keeps on swimming he is determined that he is not going to survive. Brian knows that he has to make a shelter and find food to survive in the woods alone. Brian also has to be aware of the animals like bears foxes and raccoons. As he walks through the trees looking for a shelter, he holds his hatchet by his side. The reason Gary Paulson wrote this book was to show people how hard it is to be stranded in the woods in Canada. This book also has many survival tips too. For example, you should know how to get a fire started without using matches. All of these would help you if you were stranded in the north woods of Canada for 54 days like Brian was.There were many important events in this book. One event that I thought was difficult was trying to find food. This was difficult for Brain because there is not that much food in the woods. At first all he was eating were bright red berries. Later one night while Brian was sleeping, snapping turtle had laid eggs. Since there was hardly anything else to eat he decided to eat those. While he was doing this he thought of his Uncle Carter because every morning he ate raw eggs. He also ate fish (caught from lake) and \\"foolbirds\\" (birds slightly smaller that chickens). It was important that Brian was able to find food for him to be able to survive.I would recommend this book to people who like adventure books. This is an adventure book because after the plane crashes, Brian has to find a way to survive without food or shelter. For many days all Brian ate were bright red berries. He ate them because he knew that without food he would not have survived. While he is in the woods he has many animals come and visit him. There were many bears and mosquitoes. This book was a great book and I didn't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is really good. I would read it again. In the book the main character \\"Brian\\", is in a plane crash and survives. this story is written by Gary Paulsen, and he does a great job writing this book. In this book, Brian also has to live in the wilderness with his hachet. Brian is all by himself too, because the pilot died in the crash. So if you are looking for a good book to read then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I am 14 year's old kid who doesn't like to read books, but when I picked up the book hatchet it was a different story. Hatchet is based on a story with a young boy named Brain who is going to see his dad a long ways away from his house and then he runs in to a problem you can picture what is always happening during the book. When you need this book you never want to stop it is always exciting. Read hatchet to find out more about this book because it's a really good book. I really like to read what the main character of the book is always getting himself into."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I recommend this book to whoever likes survival and adventure books. Another reason is that it has great suspense and action. When the pilot had the heart attack, no one knew what was going to happen next. When the narrator said, \\" The pilot stopped jerking, his legs contracted up into the seat and his eyes rolled back until the whites in his eyes were showing\\". This part of the book gave me the feeling that time just stopped because Brian is stuck with a dead pilot and is still in the air. Brian doesn't know how to fly a plane but manages. When Brian eats a raw turtle egg that he finds in the sand, this shows his fight to survive. He is going to survive any way possible. He has to do some brave things like pulling out porcupine quills out of his leg. \\"He grasped one of the quills, held his breath, and jerked.\\" That was brave because they were deep and the pain would so bad that someone could go into shock. I think that the adventure that Brian has is very well put in the book. Everything that happens to him and everything that he does is exciting in some way. So if you want to read a book that has lots of adventure and action in it, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Imagine being on a plane to visit your father thinking \\"In just a few minutes I'll be getting of in an airport to spend some time with my dad!\\" when the next thing you know, your plane has crashed and you're in the middle of the forest with no supplies except for a hatchet that your mother gave you. This is the story of Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. It's the story of a 13 year-old boy, surviving in the wilderness on his own. It's a very descriptive book and you will find yourself drawn to it from the start. The suspense is so great, you find yourself thinking \\"What's going to happen? Will he be found? Will he?\\" You actually find yourself imagining yourself as the main character. What are you waiting for? Read the book and see what happens!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in survival. This book would help you if you were on a plane and it crashed in the northern woods. This book taught me so much about surviving in the wilderness. It also educated me how to make a fire. \\"As he was rubbing the sticks together, he realized that he needed something out of metal and as he blew a fire came.\\" Another example of what it taught me would be when he killed his first rabbit \\"He cooked it like he cooked his first bird he cooked it on both sides until it was crisp on both sides.\\" In conclusion, if you are fascinated by the outdoors and you would like to know how to survive, read this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"My 9-year-old daughter was assigned this book in school and after reading it she encouraged me to do so.

He has to find shelter, food, fire and weapons to survive in this wilderness. He battles mosquitoes, bears and even a moose. But in the end he is saved. I really enjoyed this book, so much so I have read the two sequels, Hatchet: Winter and Hatchet, the Return and I highly recommend Hatchet: Winter to all readers that enjoyed Hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"May 7,2002Mrs.HollA-4In the novel Hatchet by Gary Paulsen describes a survival situation of a young thirteen-year-old boy. Brian was going to Canada to visit his father during the summer vocation when the plane crashed in the wilderness. While in the wilderness Brian learned how to live by himself by using survival skills. The most important thing that Brian had would be his hatchet. I think that Brian didn't have a hatchet he wouldn't survive forty-four days in the wilderness.In the wilderness Brian met several wild animals such as: moose, bears, porcupine, turtle, and skunk. All these animals at the beginning attacked Brian. The first animal that hurt Brian was a bear and then others. The moose attacked Brian hardest because this animal is not so small; he weights much and is bigger than human. The good thing what Brian got from turtle was turtle's eggs. Brain could eat those eggs and then be full, and of course it's much better than berries.The wilderness changed Brian life forever. Now he was different. What are you impressed? Is Brian such a strong person like the others? What kind the boy can survive forty-four days without human being, without normal and regular food? Brian did he lived those days he never talk with anyone just by himself. Brian should be with his father and have a good time. But now is everything different. He is alone in the wilderness. He should be proud of himself because he learned many things how to make a fire without any matches, how to find food without any store and how to live in the woods. Could any of his teenagers survive like this how he did?I think if I would be in this situation lost in the wilderness, I would like to have Brian with me because he is such a smart boy. So time to say my opinion for this book I'll give 4 stars because in this book were some details which I didn't like it. I don't think that in real life could happen that thirteen-year-old boy could survive by himself. Maybe author could made that boy was a little bit older about sixteen year old, maybe it would work then, but it's just my opinion maybe others think different than me.In the novel Hatchet describes a survival situation about a young boy who survived in the wilderness without anything just a hatchet. He met many animals and now he knows more about the nature and life in the wilderness. This experience had changed how Brian thought about life. He learned that things don't always go as you expect.By: Gintare ..."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a very suspenseful book.

Read the book and see what happens to Brian.The River, Brians Winter, and Brains return are all the next books. They are all as good as Hatchet with adventure and suspense. Read Hatchet and work your way to these three other books."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I had heard wonderful things about this book, so I decided to give it a shot even though I am not very interested in the whole survival motif. This was the first book I have read by Paulsen and I have to admit I loved his style. The text is almost poetic in the way that phrases will repeat to add emphasis.When 13 year old Brian's plan is forced down in the Canadian wilderness, he must fend for himself for nearly 2 months. At the same time, he is dealing with his only personal struggles, such as the divorce of his parents, the death of the pilot and his emerging adolescence. Brian learns that his determination and perseverance will get him through this struggle. The problem-solving skills he develops are also a key topic.I would plan to use this book in my classroom in a literature study setting for 3rd-6th graders. The book is appropriate as far as the material and is on their reading level. However, I did take one star away because, while it was well written, I never got into the survivalist aspect. I enjoyed the language and the themes, but not so much the basic plot events.Why 4 stars?:While the book is beautifully written, I was never able to fully get into the plot. I would still highly recommend this book be used in classroom settings for small groups, as there is much to discuss."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is about a 13 year old boy named Brian going to the Canadian Wilderness to see his father.

Brian is in the copilot's seat. When the pilot embarks to have shoulder pains, Brian is pondering about his parent's divorce. Brian never told anyone that he knew about the divorce. The pilot teaches Brian how to steer. Then the pilot has a heart a tack. Brian will now have to steer. He makes a plan. His plan is when he finds a lake he will land in knee deep water. Brian spots a lake; he hits trees then goes out in the lake. He swims a-shore and lays down and sleeps. Brian is very swollen on his forehead. He has to find some food. Brian saw two birds that flew to some berries. He figures that if the birds can eat them he can, too. Brian thought that he was going to get rescued in a few days. A month goes by; he stills does not get rescued. One day Brian was getting fish out of the lake when a moose came and threw him into the lake. Then that night a real strong wind like a tornado came and took everything Brian had. The dead pilot is still in the head of the plane. The end of the plane stuck out of the water that had the survival pack. Brian has to get that pack. He makes a raft. Then the next morning he sets out first thing to get that pack. He starts to pound on the plane with the hatchet his mother gave him before he gets on the plane. Pretty soon he has a hole that is as big as him. He gets in there and gets the survival pack. Brian gets it back to shore late that night. He unpacks all the belongings after a long nights rest. Will Brian get rescued after he got the survival pack I recommended this book to 3rd grade and up, because it is suspenseful, thrilling, and makes you think about what if that happened to you. !"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This realistic fiction book was full of suspense and excitement. When Brian was flying and thinking about the divorce, the pilot, Mr. Jake, was having a heart attack. Brian was trying to get radio signal when he found a plan to land the plane. According to his idea, he landed the plane in a lake and made it to shore. Brian was in shock, but he was gazing at the wilderness. Although Brian was famished and thirsty, he was thinking about how far off the flight course was. Brian had water but he was looking for food and shelter when he found berries. After he had gut cherries, he found a patch of raspberries where a bear was, but it didn't harm him. Brian learned that feeling sorry for himself didn't get him anywhere. He was trying to make flame, but he didn't have oxygen and finally made fire. When Brian was thinking that he didn't want the fire out, he heard something and found turtle eggs. As his bow was getting finished, he heard a plane and started a bonfire but the plane turned back. After Brian made a spear, he finally learned to catch fish. When he finished his new shelter, he made a pen to catch fresh fish. He was trying to get a fool hen, but he scared them and finally got one. As he was working, a tornado hit and he saw the plane's tail sticking out of the water. As Brian looked around, he saw all the damage that the tornado did, and Brian decided he wanted to get the survival pack out of the plane. Will Brian get the survival pack? To find out read the book.

Then one day he built a raft to get over to the plane to get the survival pack. Then he dropped his hatchet. You should read this book if you are10+. Read this great book and don't put it off. I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetDo you really think you know yourself? Are you sure? Well you might think that over after you read Hatchet, Brian Robeson had to. When his relaxing plane ride went horribly wrong, he found himself stuck in the Canadian wilderness with just the hatchet his mom had given him as a gift. That was the beginning of an epic adventure of life and death, kill or be killed. It was really a struggle for him to survive, as nature threw at him the toughest obstacles he had ever encountered.Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen is a realistic fiction for kids of all reading abilities. If you are a fan of action, survival, and exceptionally vivid details that make you feel like you are in the story, then this book is for you. It is peppered with excitement and drama that will leave you on the edge of your seat.Watch as nature put Brian through a training camp to teach him all about life, as he gradually changed throughout the book. He was not a city-boy anymore, but a patient observant young man. A man that had acquired all the skills it took to survive the wilderness; he was a quick, quiet, and observant hunter. In addition, he learned to look at problems as a whole, while he was carefully assessing the right thing to do. I think he learned a valuable lesson in this book. Even though nature can be rough, it is a beautiful place with luscious natural habitats, unlike the city.Brian matured in many ways. For example, when he first crashed in the wilderness, he could not get anything right. However, as he grew stronger, both physically and mentally, he found better ways of doing things by thinking back to the things he learned in the past and experimenting with new and different ideas. It took several tries to make his first fire. He also was able to fix his raft with just a few minor modifications, and learned how to shoot the \`fool birds' with his bow and arrow. The first time he saw a bear he ran away. Later on, he encountered a few wolves, but simply nodded to each one, accepting that it was their land, and their area, not his.I found Hatchet inspirational. Brian had to reach deep within himself, to find what he really needed, and he showed me you could do anything you put your mind to. It just takes a little thought and motivation.Recommended by Josh"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a book wrote by Gary Paulson.The main character is Brian.

My wife and I camp and I have found the knowledge I gained from the Hatchet books to have been invaluable in my camping experiences.

He was on his way to Canada to see his dad at the oil mine when suddenly his pilot had a heart attack and the plane crashed into an L shaped lake. Brian had made his way of the plane and he went to shore and then he fainted. When he woke up he did not know where he was. He looked around and was surrounded by many trees and bugs. With no one around he got hungry and found berries, and then he got sick for days and stung by bugs. After he got stung by bugs, he went to find more food in the very dark woods and then it happened. He saw an object heading his way. Then a big black bear popped out of the bushes and was standing on its two hind legs, Brian thought \\"I am going to die.\\" But the bear just looked at him and left him alone. After he got more food he went back to the shelter he made when he arrived there. When he was sleeping an animal went inside and was looking for food. He found Brian's food that he had saved for later. Then he made a wall of sticks so an animal wouldn't come in and steal his food again. I really liked this book. When I read the part where the bear was standing on its feet and I thought Brian was going to get killed, I started to worry for Brian because the bear could have hurt him badly but the bear just left him alone. I think it was a good adventure because he got to check out the place where he was in the Canadian wilderness. He learned how to get food in the wild and how to survive. I could imagine I was there because the author made it seem like if I was there in the wilderness with Brian just waiting on someone to come and save us.

The first time I read it, I didn't enjoy it at all. I thought it was very boring. But then I read again just this passed year and I really enjoyed it!! My point? You should always give a book or anything else a second chance before deciding on whether you like it or not. You might end up liking it the second time. I know I am 15 years old, but I still really did like it and I think anybody would like it. It is a really good survival story and I think it is a really good book to read (especially in the summertime). It is definently one of my all-time favorite books! Some other books by Gary Paulsen that are really good and that I have read are &quot;Cayons&quot;, &quot;The River&quot;, &quot;Brian's Winter&quot;, and &quot;Brian's Return&quot;. Those are some suggestions for the people who love books by Gary Paulsen."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is a story about survival. A young 12 yr old boy finds himself stranded in the canadian wildness after going for a flight for his birthday. The pilot dies from a sudden heart attack and the plane comes falling down. The boy calls for help but there's no answer. He has only his 'hatchet' to use for food. Somehow he survives and gets rescued later on by another pilot. I recommend this book for the 8-14 age group."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet was a good book- except that it was slightly far-fetched, it lacked good dialogue, and kept on using repeating words. On the good side, it showed a great story of survival in hardship. Hope you enjoy/dislike this book!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Very well written and compelling. My favourite childrens book by a long shot. Well worth buying.

Then on his way to Canada, the pilot had a heart attack and Brian tried to pilot the plane but it crashed. He built a shelter in a cave and had to eat berries that he thought made him choke. He got all bit up by mosquitoes. Then a tornado came and blew his whole shelter away. But, during the tornado, the end of the plane came out of the water. Brian made a raft out of wood (from the tornado) so he could get out to the plane. Then he dropped his hatchet in the water and he had to go down in the water to get it. He got his hatchet and used it to get inside the plane. When he got in the plane, he looked around the plane for the emergency packet. But while he was looking for it, he saw the pilot's head in the water. Finally he found it and used the communicator to call for help. This was the best nature book I have ever read. If you ever decide to read this book, from my experience, you will have a good time."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet, I did not want to put it down but I had to because I am reading it in school as a directed book.

The main character did his best to live in the wilderness with harsh conditions the best he could. He was physically beaten by large massive animals, bitten by many mosquitoes, and the anticipation to leave. He also wondered about the situation with his mother and her mysterious lover.

Well, that is all I have to say about the wonderful book of Hatchet"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet has won the Newberry award and it's one of the best books we've ever read. The author of Hatchet is Gary Paulsen. You should read more of his books (if you have not read one already). The genre is realistic fiction, adventure and action. The main character is named Brian Robeson. Brian is on his way to visit his father, because his parents are divorced but on the way the plane crashes. Suddenly he finds himself in the Canadian wilderness all alone with nothing but his Hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book Hatchet was a really great adventure book.

All alone, he has to learn how to find food, make a fire, and not give up the hope that he will be rescued.Gary Paulsen is a great writer and I hope that if you get Hatchet, you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I thought the hatchet was an all right book but it wasn't the best book I've ever read. Gary Paulsen could have expanded this book and made it better. Because it was really short and he could have made it longer. It was only 200 pages. I can relate to this book because Brian and me both hunt and love outdoors. I also know what it feels like to lose your stuff by a tornado because this summer my house was hit by an tornado. If you liked Gary Paulsen you should check out some of his other books because they are al full of adventure"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hachet, by Gary Paulsen, is a very strang book. Brian Robeson must survive in the wilderness by his observations of nature. He's a kid who has horrible luck and then good luck. For example, Brian is cold and mosquitos are biting him. He learns how to make fire, which gets rid of the coldness and the smoke gets ride of the mosquitos. I like the book because of all the animals Brian sees in the forest. he sees wolves, rabbits, porcupines, birds, turtles, and fish. I also like the way he survies and how he depends on one single tool. I would recomend this book to people likes adventure stories."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I'm sorry, but it was BORING! I really disliked it. It was kind of interesting the way he survived, but still it was boring. It seemed to drag on forever, and there just seemed no point. I mean I know there was a point and a plot, but I don't think it was shown very well."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Oh, sure, Paulsen is brilliant. And in theory, this book should be, too. Paulsen does a good job of writing, but he does in the wrong way. It's far from a Swiss Family Robonson or a Robinson Crusoe. Heck, after this, you'll be yerning for Gilligan's Island! With little events and nothing happening, the book gets old...fast."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read.

I guess I have kept this memory for so long because it really made me think. I never wanted to stop; I constantly found myself wrapped up in this great story filled with adventure, suspense, but tenderness in its own special way. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I found myself ordering it on tape to listen to during long car rides. This book is about a young man that gets lost in the wilderness; nothing with him besides a hatchet his mother gave to him before he left. His intelligence and skills lead him into a surreal adventure through thick and thin, from where to sleep to what to wear the next day. All in all, I belive strongly that everyone will enjoy this book in one way or another and they will find that they will wish to keep the memory of Gary Paulsen's perfect book with them forever! Order this book today and be ready to embark on a fabulous adventure through the mind of a confused, yet intelligent young man and through the cold, unforgiving wilderness"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is an excellent survival type book for both young adults and adults.
