Hoover is qualified to write this work for two reasons. First, he has worked with young adults as a college campus minister. Second, he is also young himself and has personally navigated the \\"spiritual roadmap\\" he speaks of in his book . Hoover's basic premise is that young people are often raised in a religious tradition, but abandon it at college age. He does not see this as a reason for discouragement since many people rediscover their religion in a new and vital way. The book discusses many of the ways young people lives their faith in ways which are both familiar and different. Hoover has much to offer for people looking for ways to strengthen their faith and offers many suggestions for people hoping to deepen their faith. In many ways the book presents similar themes found in Scottie McLennan's FINDING YOUR RELIGION but the emphasis of the Hoover book is more specific to the Catholic faith. People who are looking to strengthen their faith as well as people in ministry will find this book helpful ."},{"Title":"Losing Your Religion, Finding Your Faith: Spirituality for Young Adults","review":"Losing Your Religion, Finding Your Faith: Spirituality and Young AdultsExcellent advise, should be read by all young adults."},{"Title":"Walking in Memphis (Piano Vocal, Sheet music.)","review":"This a a great music piece for beginners or advanced musicians!

A brief and informative history about various tobacco products/inserts and manufactures is provided. The book is organized principally into two units: N-series for 19th century cards (N1-N694) and T-series for 20th century cards (T1-T177). Each entry includes a brief description of the set and card appearance (front and back). The overwhelming majority of entries include an actual size photograph of a representative card (front and back) and a list of all cards in the set. Comments pertaining to card variations and prices are useful. The edge of each page is labeled with the set number to aid with rapid location of descriptions and card images. The work is peppered throughout with short vignettes and essays (published previously in various trade journals) by Dr. Terry Mitchell about specific sets or card themes. Although this is a soft cover book, the pages are printed on high grade gloss stock paper that tolerates repeated handling. Suprisingly, the book is neither overwhelming or boorish in its presentation. The brief descriptions and inclusion of images for virtually every set are effective strategies and make the book exceptionally user-friendly. No other work to date has done such a masterful job at capturing the variety of subjects, visual appeal, and historical allure of tobacco cards. This book is a must-have item for novice collectors and enthusiasts."},{"Title":"American Tobacco Cards: A Price Guide and Checklist","review":"Colorful and interesting pictures provide an easy to use reference guide.

I was reading the new Hemmingway book, but after reading the first chapter in the story of Stalingrad I was hooked and read this instead! The characters are real, and you feel their hardships and victories. You feel as though you are in the trenches behind the scope squatting next to the &quot;Hares,&quot; and &quot;Bears.&quot; One of the best I have read. Not since Steven Pressfield's &quot;Gates of FIre,&quot; have I felt like I was in the story alongside the characters fighting and striving to survive."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book has given me a lesson in WWII history I will remember far beyond anything I ever read in years of school. The author's insight into the psychic of both men and women under the pressure of life and death, civic duty versus human need, was astounding. His detailed description of warfare and survival made me cring yet I couldn't set it down because I never knew if the &quot;good guys&quot; would indeed win. As a woman reader, I was especially impressed that the author could be so in touch with Tania, a woman fighting for a cause. I felt I was running and sneaking and dogging sniper bullets with her. Mr. Robbins enlightened me to a war fought long before my time that is still worth crying over. That two people could fall in love in the trenches fighting for their country gave it an edge over being just another historic novel."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Not since Michael Shaara wrote &quot;The Killer Angles&quot; has a war novel held me so completely in its grip. I was overwhelmed by the images created of opponents during a desparate battle and would recommend this reading to anyone interested in this period of history."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"A waste of time and money. Technical details in historical war novels DO matter, especially novels based on pivotal historical events where the historical outcome was directly influenced - in part - by levels of technology, and this book was filled with them, e.g. referring to a 410 as rifle which was only one of many. The point is, if the author had mistakenly referred to Stalingrad as Leningrad, no one would defend this story by stating that that's what geography books are for, or that this wasn't a story about geography (hopefully).I was also bothered at how the Russians in this novel were portrayed as noble and good while the Germans were portrayed as evil and stupid - a manipulative ploy to make the deaths of German soldiers seem exciting and good, since the portrayal of battle scenes was not very convincing. Also, the romance descriptions were unbelievable, especially if you have any realistic knowledge of the non-stop ferocity of the battle at Stalingrad. Try Mila 18 by Leon Uris if you want the greatest historical (and technically accurate) WWII novel. Try Enemy at The Gates by William Craig if you want to read the best book ever written about the battle at Stalingrad."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I was unable to complete this book because the author's credibility approached zero by about page fifty due to numerous factual errors. I cannot be &quot;transported to Stalingrad&quot; if most every time a historical fact is stated, it is incorrect.I found the characters overly romantic and idealized. They are not real people, they're characters invented by the author to manipulate the reader down an emotional path.I'm very disappointed that I purchased this book."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"The premise of this book is great. The plot is great. What isn't great is how verbose this book is in places, and how mind-numbingly dry it is in others. There were about ten places in this book where I thought I'd never finish a page, just because of how tedious the writing had gotten. It's a shame too, because as I said before the plot is tremendous, the setting unique and interesting, and three out of the four characters were very well fleshed out and intriguing. The character of Nikki, however, takes the sails out of this narrative...there was no reason why the author needed this character in the book. My other main grievance is - not enough attention was given to the German sniper...this book could have easily benefitted from taking about fifty pages worth of dull descriptions, histories, and chapters and devoting them to Thorvald.Dissapointing, to say the least. Don't bother unless you're an absoulute WWII enthusiast."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book...for about the first 90% of it. The suspense of the battle between the two supersnipers, Zaitsev &amp; Thorvald, was intense and compelling, even if you knew long before the climax how it would end. Unforunately, the denoument did not live up the the buildup. Another problem was the lack of followup on what happened to the main characters after the events in the book transpired. All in all, though, it was a very compelling read and I definitely recommend it to any who are interested in WW2 novels."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I listened to this book on audio and it was one of those where you don't even realize how much time has passed between tapes, its that good. Yes there are historical inaccuracies in the background, but there were historical inaccuracies in \\"Enemy At The Gates\\" too an otherwise perfectly good movie.As for the plot-Its basically the Hare(Zaitsev) setting up a sniper school with a fellow sniper with whom he precides to kick German(Nazi) butt.Only thing I didn't like about the book is that the last chapter seems to have no place in te story. It would have been find had they just left it at the end of the sniper duel, but thats just my viewOverall-Good book all round"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Reviewed by:Timothy E. McMahon, M.S.Principal Web DeveloperThe McMahon GroupI'll have to agree with many of the other reviewers on this one: This book is well worth the read.After reading Beevor's Stalingrad, I was gripped by the horror of that epic battle. David Robbins' version of events drew me even deeper into the quagmire of dread that was Stalingrad. He fleshes out the bones of long dead combatants and makes this a personal war where we actually come to know, and feel for, many of the players in this grim reality play.Robbins has woven a rich tapestry of fact and fiction so compelling that the reader has to step back and ask him or herself, &quot;Where does truth end and fiction begin?&quot; This is an excellent read and one worth recommending."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"If you are a stranger to war (you are blessed), this book will bring you as close as any I know to the reality of something you can never really know. If you have seen the beast, it will wrench your guts with memories you'd have hoped never to recall.In its brutality, honesty, hopelesness andd horror, War of the Rats carries you through the human monstrousness of the battle of Stalingrad. It tells the true story of two remarkable killers and their personal duel in the midst of unspeakable carnage. This true story is fleshed out with fictional characters and incidents to create a very human epic. In truth , it's not easy to recommend this book; it will not leave you happy, more likely with scars on your heart. But, this how it was."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I have read many historical books and novels on WWII, and The War of the Rats is one of the best. Realizing that this novel is based on based on true events makes it more interesting than many other war novels. And the writing is marvelous. Robbins is no hack."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"The movie coming out on March 31 is entitled Enemy at the Gates, but it is really based on the novel War of the Rats. Enemy at the Gates by William Craig, focuses on the whole battle of Stalingrad, from August 42' right up until the German POWs returned from Russia in the late forties. Craig only devotes about two pages to the Vassili - Konings duel while War of the Rats makes it the centerpiece of the story. Interesting side note: The Waffen SS never had any Major Konings in its records, so either he was made up by the Russian Propaganda, or the SS destroyed every trace of his existence to avoid embarrassement."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I receive this book in the mail, free, last summer through USA Today newspaper. &quot;LUCKY ME!&quot;... I put off reading this novel until this summer. This happens to be the better than average historical novel. In fact, I would not call the book historical, but a novel of suspense. The story surrounds 4 characters, but Robbins concentrates on the characters of Vasily Zaitsev and Tania Chernova. They were two snipers in the Russian Army out the get the Headmaster Sniper in the German Army in World War II. The story is based on some true fact of this war. You may think the story is all about war, and in some cases and places it is, but on the other hand these characters explore there feeling about this war and their role in the war. This story will not put you to sleep. It is a fast read indeed."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"A good read. If you don't know the history of the combatant subjects, the book could leave you a little anxious. Zietsev lived to survive the war and was made a Hero of the Soviet Union. The German Colonel, who's real name was Walter Konigs, was of course killed. Moments before he was shot by Zietsev, Konigs had killed a Soviet Kommisar who was accompanying Zietsev on his hunt for Konigs in the rubble of Stalingrad. This was a battle between two men that was being watched and cheered for by both sides. For a fictional account of this very real battle, I found this book extremely entertaining. A MUST read for any history buff of the Eastern Front Theatre of WW 2."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"War of the Rats is a surprising and wonderful treat.

I normally am not a big reader."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This is my second foray. I complained before that the author confused rifles with shotguns. That complaint was nugatory. Having finished the novel, I would recommend it to anyone interested in a gripping, vital tale that manages to make an immense tragedy comprehensible. Robbins creates vivid characters--the Hare, the Partisan, the Headmaster. His German master sniper is even likeable, which I didn't expect. A novel succeeds or fails on the strength of its characters, and these characters are vivid and moving."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"&quot;Every seven seconds a German soldier dies in Stalingrad... one... two... three... four... five... six... seven...&quot; - from &quot;War of the Rats&quot;Before I read this novel, I never gave the battle of Stanlingrad much thought. To me, WWII on the Eastern Front was just too murky, a bleak and incomprehensible conflict between socialists and facists. Boy, was I wrong. This one of most &quot;human&quot; novels about war I've ever read and it transcends the sickly political beliefs of the Nazis and Soviets. I finished the book days ago, but unlike most of the novels I've read, I can't seem to get this one out of my head. I'm now seriusly considering visiting Volgagrad (formerly Stanlingrad) just to see the rebuilt city where these events took place."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Much has been written about the destruction of the German Sixth Army at Stalingrad during WW II, a slaughterhouse that resulted in the deaths of over 1 million German and Russian soldiers in vicious urban combat. David Robbins has masterfully crafted a tale of one such war within the war at Stalingrad, the duel between the best snipers each army had to offer. Whether you are interested in the general history of the Second World War, are a German or Russian Army enthusiast, or just happen to like historical fiction, &quot;War of the Rats&quot; is an absolute triumph that you won't be able to put down. With characters that are very much alive and real, you will find yourself caught up in their daily struggles to survive the cauldron of death that saw snipers on both sides exact a heavy toll on the unwary. I devoured this book in less than two days and would read it again in a heartbeat. &quot;War of the Rats&quot; is easily the best book I've read in quite some time."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Let me first say that I am glad I read this book. Learning about history through fictional novels helps history to come alive and attaches more emotion to it than would otherwise be possible. I wish more authors would attempt what Robbins has: a great premise with historical context and accuracy. This has encouraged me to go find other books in this same vein, so it was at least worth that.Unfortuntately, the book does not fulfill its promise. I found myself disappointed with it, although not remorseful about the time or money spent on it. The prose is not elegant. The devices used to reveal the various histories of the characters are too obvious. The sexual encounters are unwarranted and terribly conceived. The emphasis on a love story did not seem to work well with the primary objectives of the book. The ending is very disappointing, unfulfilling, and even vague in some regards.But there are also many things about the book which make for good reading. The constant use of geography is good - I enjoyed having to refer to the city map in order to better imagine the scenes described. The use of time was interesting - events are often portrayed from two different vantage points, so you experience the same moment in time twice. Geez, this is starting to turn into a book report or something, so time to finish.Apparently, according to some of the other reviews, you're not going to enjoy this book if you have technical knowledge of guns or the Russian language. But there are redeeming qualities of the book, so I give it a marginal 3 stars."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"When I first picked up this book I was hesitant, given that it is a novel and not a non-fiction. But Robbins descriptions of Stalingrad really seemed to put me right into that hell-torn city. While i'm sure that the story of Vasily Zaitsev was fabricated a bit, it was nonetheless an exciting read. The duel with Heinz Thorvald was particularly thrilling as well, although most historians doubt the man actually existed. I could have done without some of the cheesy love story with Zaitsev's fellow sniper/lover Tania though. Overall, this book was one that I had a difficult time putting down, and I even learned a little bit from it."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"David L. Robbins will probably be best known for this work. It is one of the most exciting books that I have ever read. The plot twists are absolutley stunning. The way that he decribes the combat is bar none some of the best that I have ever read. Both snipers come across as genuinely likeable characters making the reader have to choose between which one will or should die. Really classic stuff, If you are on a bummer about not having something to read, do yourself a favor and pick this book up. Just be warned, you might not be able to set it down."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I do not give 5 star ratings to many books but this novel set in the ruins of Stalingrad definitely deserves the max rating. It is Red supersniper against Nazi supersniper in a battle that can only end one way. Vasiley Zaitsev is running a local sniper school right in Stalingrad during the height of the struggle for control of this non-strategic value city that Stalin and Hitler chose to wrestle over. He gains fame thanks to the writings of a politrook, or political commissar of the Communist Party. With Nazi corpses piling up at an alarming rate from the Hare as he is called, SS Colonel Heinz Thorvald is dispatched from the Wehrmacht sniper school at Gnossen with only one mission: kill the Hare and come back home. The cat and mouse game in the rubble of the city between these two is incredible. The back and forth from Hare to Headmaster as the story progresses is genius by the author. This is the book that the movie Enemy at the Gates was based upon. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"David Robbins has a way with words. He has a way with characters. He is by far a master of character development, a task made all the more difficult when one is constrained by reality. Vasha Zaitsev, Tania Chernova, Nikki Mond and Heinz Thorwald are all historical characters in a compelling setting. You can't help but bond with the two protagonists. You share their fears, their joys, their passions, and their accomplishments.The Battle of Stalingrad is likely the most costly battle in human terms of any in recorded history. History repeats itself as von Paulus' 6th Army is totally destroyed by the Russian forces under Chuikov, as Napolean was defeated earlier. Without losing sight of the larger picture, Robbins focuses on a small segment of the battle and the incredible people who form one small part of the total operation. We learn about the tactics of snipers and their specialized skills as hunters. We witness street battles and door to door combat within the ruins of a great city. But most important, we learn how ordinary people become heroes.I don't want to give anything away for fear of detracting from your enjoyment. Suffice it to say, I could hardly put this book down. I would read and look for logical break points (subchapters, etc.), but invariably was driven to read further. When I finished, I was driven to do further research on my own to verify the reality of the characters and their actions."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Bravo to Mr. Robbins for putting all that historical research into this book. I thought he successfully captured many of the more profound implications of Stalingrad while the various sub-plots unfolded.I found myself anxious to learn how the individual skills and personalities of the two snipers, Z and T, would result in one besting the other after a long, challenging duel. As it turns out, Z shoots T only after T fails to fire on Z, and after Z stupidly exposes himself as a result of the failed &quot;shell-casing&quot; trick. So, basically Z wins because his horrible blunder turned out to be less horrible than T freezing up and failing to fire his rifle.Z wins as a result of dumb luck, not skill. T loses because he failed to execute his greatest skill - firing quickly. An odd conclusion to the duel, but perhaps rather than dull writing, it is another example of Mr. Robbins analysis of Stalingrad - random, unmerciful destruction."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I'll be brief, the book is excellent and the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is that the author took a few real people like Zaitsev and mixed them with fictional characters to make a story. The story itself is superb and is set in the battle of Stalingrad where a Russian sniper, Zaitsev, is hunted by the Nazi super sniper, Thorvald. I'd have preferred fictional names throughout to avoid the reader believing certain incidents actually occurred when they didn't but otherwise this is an exceptional novel and so well researched that the reader should get a feel for what soldiers on both sides felt in the Battle of Stalingrad. The battle itself is well documented in a non fiction work titled, Enemy at the Gates for which the movie version of this book is named. My advice, buy the book, rent the movie, and don't expect them to match very closely. This book is by far the better of the two."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I have always wondered about the Russian perspective on Stalingrad and particularly Vasily Grigoryevich Zaytsev, who may have the most sniper kills known to man. Also liked the relationship it painted with Tanya, a girl from New York and a partisan in Russia. We never hear much about her, until this book and of course the movie."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the best accounts of the Battle of Stalingrad I have ever read. While not as epic as Thomas Craigs' \\"Enemy At The Gates\\", Robbins does an excellent job of dramatizing one of the most interesting stories of the battle: the notorious sniper duel between Vassily Zeitsev and his German counterpart.The movie \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" is truer to Robbins' telling of the story, while the actual events of Zeitzev's duel is actually only three or four pages of Craig's book.War of the Rats is a definite page-turner, from start to finish. It's very fast-paced, and the focus on key players prevents the casual reader from getting lost in the story.One of the better WWII-themed books I have ever read."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This is such a good book, a must read. So interesting about how the battle was fought at street level and the tactics both sides used to survive."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Robbins does a great job of getting into the heads of the characters, jumping from one to the other while keeping the action flowing. When this flow concentrated on the two dueling snipers, I couldn't put the book (or Kindle in my case) down. But when it shifted to the point of view of the other two main characters, I wasn't as interested, even though they're brought to life well enough.I loved the way the author gave each of the two snipers a vastly different personality, mind set and approach to his craft. The final shoot out is really well done.This is definitely readable, but I think it would have been a five start novella with just the duel. As it is - four stars."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"A vividly imagined novel by an author who appreciates the scope of his canvas. I enjoyed it overall and noticed only a couple of technical errors.As a novel, though, it does have flaws. Robbins can't decide if he's writing a history of the battle, or fiction about a sniper duel that's a tiny part of it. So the focus jumps around, and leads to, among other things, a long, anti-climactic end.I also feel that he takes far too many liberties with Mr. Zaitsev's character and personal affairs. This was (is?) after all a real man who deserves more respect. For his purposes, Robbins should have invented a character - he's good at that.Also, the reader spends far too much time in the head of the protagonists as they consider the meaning of life etc.; this becomes very wearing. I found myself skipping this stuff after a while.Altogether, the book was good but would be better at two-thirds its length. I merely note this fact since - as publishers clearly no longer employ editors - a more thorough effort would be too much to expect."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Well it's a good war story. Lots of action and it goes into vast details of the Russians and the Germans soldiers though out the war. The story line deals with two snipers Russia's best and Germany's best. Pits man aggainst man to see who can out fox who. I'll cut it short very good book but then it gets drawn out. It's seems like the book never going to end."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"An excellent read. What a great choice of subject matter. The two main characters, the German sniper Thorvald and the Soviet sniper Zaitsev are well constructed. When the novel concentrates on their thoughts, motivations and actions it works extremely well with great atmosphere [appropriately bleak.]This book is a real page turner. However, the one flaw I did find was too much ersatz poetic rumination on the part of the Soviets. The inevitable love story also detracted from what could otherwise have been a ''thundering good read.''If Mr. Robbins had kept War of the Rats a quote-unquote ''man's book'' [I'm sure men are 95% of his readership] then he would have been better served. More emphasis on the snipers, their thoughts and actions. A more linear story along these lines would at least put this book on the same bookshelf with The Naked and the Dead. Still a good read. Recommended."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I drive quite a bit during my commute to and from work, so I got this book on tape from my library. In three years of borrowing books on tape, this one was by far the best of all and every minute of the story was enthralling.I am interested in the battle for Stalingrad and had read William Craig's &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; but found Robbins' tale much more vivid and compelling. Whereas Craig paints a somewhat dry, remote picture of the conflict of Stalingrad, Robbins throws the reader right into the heart of it with a keen eye for description and superb use of larger-than-life characters. The main bulk of the story concerns a &quot;duel&quot; between two famous snipers; one Russian (Vasily Zaitsev), the other German (Heinz Torvald), but Robbins also covers the broader scope of the Stalingrad battlezone including the encirclement and surrender of the German 6th Army. You can almost literally smell the stench of war (especially in one memorable scene involving three Russian soldiers sneaking through a sewer tunnel) around you as he weaves the plot.There is much to be learned from Robbins' work concerning the battle, Russian and German life, the art of sniping, and the methods of the Soviet Union. The book on tape included an interview with the author in which he describes his writing patterns and attention to detail and he struck me as a very dedicated researcher with a good storytelling ability. I will definitely be on the lookout for further works by Mr. Robbins; I was quite sorry to get to the end of this tale."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I drive quite a bit during my commute to and from work, so I got this book on tape from my library.

First, George Guidall does a his usual terrific job with the narrative. More importantly, my edition included an hour long interview with the author which crystalizes just what an accomplishment this book is.First, this is only loosely fictionalized fact - Zaitzev is a real person. Indeed, Robbins was able to interview him for the book (and Zaitzev was so excited he had a heart attack). Chernova is real except for the fact that his publishers made him make her an American. And yes, Zaitzev and Chernova did fight and love together. Likewise, the duel with Thorvald is also real although Robbins admits to fleshing in his character. Even some of the side stories are real such as the story of the Muslim who delievered food to the snipers. And, he admits that &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; was a major resource and inspiration for this book.As for the reading (listening) experience, this is a darn good book. It starts off a bit slow but then I'm not a hunter. My hunter husband loved all the detail about the guns and successful sniping. I was more fascinated by the characters inner thoughts on war and killing. Zaitzev snipes by hunting intuition. Chernova hunts the &quot;sticks&quot; out of pain and anger over the murder of her family. Thorvald snipes people using the language of skeet shooting. The details of the courage in spite of the suffering are very inspiring.Bottom-line: an entertaining education about an aspect of WW2 most Americans know little or nothing about."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"In the book War of the Rats he wrote good but he didn't know anything about the weapons that were used. He say's &quot;And when **** got there the bullet went through the snipers scope. Everyone knows that shoots guns know that that would be an impossible. I give it a 4* rating."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Fans of Stephen Hunter would not go wrong picking up this historical novel. The duel between the Nazi and the Russian drawn from the survivor's memoirs is highly readable. The horror of Stalingrad is captured for all to see. Good read."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"this book, although fiction, has a great plot, and for a while you are thinking it is real....but then you ACTUALLY LOOK AND SEE IT's FICTION, you're bummed. Great author- 2 thumbs up for him!"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I never imagined that history would go down so easily as it does in Robbins' novel, War Of The Rats. I learned so much about the Battle of Stalingrad and I loved every exciting minute of it. I can't wait to read Robbins' next novel about the fall of Berlin at the end of the war. More history and fiction blended seamlessly. War Of The Rats features fantastic research and really alive, authentic characters. Bravo! And keep 'em coming."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I knew who would win the duel. I hoped I would be surprised but I wasn't. In short, this novel let me down in the end. Anyone who has seen the movie \`Stalingrad' cannot but be disappointed in this effort. Must war novels of this kind maintain the stilted morality of the victors? I mean the American Woman character (another addition of women characters botched by male authors) and the amicable relations between communist party functionaries and front line soldiers was almost laughable. Most soldiers were caught between the Gulag and the Germans for most of the war and after. This kind of glossy politics and history is forgivable (I mean this is no \`Gulag Archipelago' or \`Tin Drum') for most of the novel because Robbins does build up the \`High Noon' dramatics with masterful sniper detail and suspense. But in the end, it's a let down.However, for all its flaws, this novel a thriller that is a cut above the pack. If a decent war novel is your thing, this one hits a the outer ring of the bullseye for summer reading. And there's enough good stuff in here to make me think about buying his next effort."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"An outstanding book. This book was a historical master piece.The devastation and destruction that was heaped on Stalingrad as a result of the German invasion of Russia was very well spelled out. The suffering that the populace of Russia had to endure was pointed out as well in this book. The duel between the Russian and German supersnipers made this book a classic. The Russian sniper school added a good touch to this book. The background of the Nazi sniper was also very interesting. The final shootout between the two snipers wrapped up an interesting confrontation. The final section of the book told of the cruelty that the war effort had taken on both sides. An excellent book. Be sure to read this one."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"If you liked Follet's war-time classic, &quot;Key To Rebecca,&quot; you'll love David Robbins' &quot;War of the Rats.&quot; Robbins pays keen attention to historic detail-- the kind you'd expect of a Keegan or an Ambrose. But it's still a work of lively fiction with something for every reader: Action-- lot's of it. People you get to know, love and hate. A powerful sense of place. A high-stakes historic backdrop. I love this book! David Robbins, keep 'em coming."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Found Robbins' book disappointing. It wasnt' so much the technical errors (e.g. rifles mixed up with shotguns, etc) as the melodrama and predictability of the plot. My highest praise to the author for picking an intriguing scenario but, with so much potential, why so little delivery?"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"The book has a very promising premise - war at its most primal reduced to the individual battle, plus the promise of learning about sniper psycholgy and tactics. But the florid and melodramatic prose just keeps overwhelming the narrative and the characterization. The German &quot;generic&quot; corporal, Nikki, the farm boy caught in the cauldron of Stalingrad, is done best but I found Tania, the American expatriate, to be the least compelling. Good book, but it shouldn't be compared to All Quiet on the Western Front or The Killer Angels."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"yeah, I love the book too. But on page 147, Robbins makes a huge mistake which calls into question all his research. He refers to Heinz Thorvald's .410 and 12 guage shotguns as &quot;rifles.&quot; This is no mere verbal slip, as he does it repeatedly. As all gun enthusiasts know,a rifle and a shotgun are very different. I don't think Robbins is a shooter."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"War of the Rats is one of three war books that I can read over and over again. All three of them take the reader back in time, and make them feel as if they are participating in the battles of the Second World War. My other two favs are Enemy at the Gates and Tale of a German Sniper."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book starts out extremely well.It appears to be a terse account of the battle of Stalingrad;One looks forward to a duel between two snipers and a gritty account of this horrific battle;however the female character is introduced and the novel takes a complete turn as if another author takes over the writing. It then becomes one of those literal romances without insight into the characters and any discernment or accounting of this historical tragedy."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This is a bad book. The characters are wooden, the plot is not existant. The suspense, which could have been good is not. I cannot believe this book got the hype it received. There should be good books on this genre, but, this is not one of them. Even the facts about being a sniper are suspect, didn't he do any research?"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"My original review, below, dwelt on errors in research by the author. Some of the other reviews that I have scanned excuse this, saying that it is after all a novel. Yes, that's true, but when you claim what you have written is based on a true set of events you up the requirement to be well researched. Even a quick look in any good public library would have revealed some of these errors. And it is claimed the author travelled to Stalingrad to gather facts. Hope he got a lot of good pictures.By comparison one might whish to read &quot;Stalingrad&quot; by Theodore Pliever, who lived in the Soviet Union through the Great Patriotic War and interviewed many German POWs from Stalingrad before writing his historical novel. Plievier's is not a book for the faint hearted, it describes in detail many of the horrors of war in the nearly frozen city.If you enjoy &quot;War of the Rats&quot; that's great. I didn't and quit part way through. Too many other good books waiting to be read to waist any further time on second rate ones. I read very few of the books by the authors who gave it a good word or two."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"War of the Rats gripped me during the first half of the book, with its captivating personal story of Zaitsev. After the mid-point mark it began dragging, a problem I attribute mainly to two shortcomings: First, the character of Tanya was an unnecessary and unconvincing distraction. The life and death struggles faced by Zaitsev and other soldiers in Stalingrad is compelling enough without trying to cram in an unnatural love story, especially one involving someone as unsympathetic and unlikely as Tanya. Second, Robbins does a poor job of developing the character of Thorvald. Here he is, the best sniper in the entire Third Reich, yet he is depicted as lazy and inattentive. He'd have been killed during his first day in Stalingrad if he were truly as inept as he is made out to be. Another complaint I have, but one which affects the entire book as opposed to just the second half, was that the book fails to adequately depict the true human suffering that occurred in Stalingrad. The physical desolation of the city itself is depicted well, but in terms of the sheer inhumanity and awfulness of the place I thought it fell short.Despite all this, I still think War of the Rats is worth reading. Just realize going into it that there are certain shortcomings that make this a good book rather than a great book and you should enjoy it."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This novel is great, it makes feel you on the battlefield of Stalingrad. The 2 lead person CMS Vassili Zaitsev and the SS Coronel Heinz von K. Thorvald gives you a idea of how was this battle be on the real life."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"David Robbins, with this novel has done for me what I wish I could do for myself. Being faithful to the facts, he has taken me to Stalingrad, and allowed me to experience history on a personal basis.The research that went into this work is remarkably detailed, but it is rendered to the reader in a way that only a few of the greatest novelists can.I am a lifelong student of history. I wish I could walk the battlefields of the world, or explore the archives that are out of my reach.Robbins does this for me with War Of The Rats. I hope he is at work at some faraway battlefield, or in a library in Europe or Asia, laying the groundwork for the next one."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"The War of the Rats was a great read for those interested in the one on one battles in war. I WILL re-read this book."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I wanted to read this book beacause of the title. I thought it would present an account of the war from the ordinary soldier's experiences, not just a focus on the sniper's part in the battle. You can read a summary of the hell that was Stalingrad in Alan Clark's &quot;Barbarossa&quot; in the conclusion of the chapter &quot;Verdun on the Volga&quot;.The comments of the German lieutenant in two paragraphs says it all."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"The disappoinment of the summer. I eager to read a fictionalized account of an extraordinary and riveting battle between two superstar snipers during the battle of Stalingrad.

Way off target."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I heard about this book (War of the Rats) and I realised I didn't read yet. I thought it will be the fastest way if I'll order it via Amazon.com. It was my first order but the process was easy and fast. I received the book in one and a half week from the order, even I living in Hungary. I'd like to say thank you for everyone..."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"&quot;War of the Rats&quot; is a maddening confection of solid, tight prose, finely-tuned characters, tension that rachets up at a steady pace ... and an absolutely abominable ending. Where other Amazon reviewers have termed the finish &quot;weak,&quot; I take it a step further. This novel HAS NO ENDING. After 400 pages or so of escalating madness ... it just stops. The fate of arguably the novel's most engaging character is left completely unresolved, and one is left with the thought that, no matter how entertaining the rest of the book is, the (lack of) resolution makes you wonder why you ever started reading in the first place. This is a crying, crying shame because otherwise, Robbins' work is a smashing read. As an aside, the concern for the portrayal of Nazis in other reviews at this site is disturbing. Are there really that many Nazi sympathizers out there? Folks, regardless of how much you may hate Communism, the Russians were on the right side of the war, and the Germans were on the wrong side. This, coupled with the fact that the Nazis were the invaders here, more than justifies Russian actions in the novel. Yes, the Russian army was brutal and committed untold atrocities, sometimes against its own people. Robbins addresses some of this behavior in the epilogue, to his credit. But please, people ... we all know the legacy left by the Nazis."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This was an interesting novel in many respects, but ultimately disappointing. IMO, Mr. Robbins should have written a fictional story based on totally fictionalized characters, rather than a hodge-podge of real life and fiction. In the forward to the book he states that three of the four main characters, Zaitsev, Chernova, and Thorvald are real, and the fourth, Nikki Mond, is totally fictitous. He then goes on to state that he did fictionalize some of the details of the Thorvald character. In reality, this character is so far removed from the German sniper he represents, even having a made-up name, as to also be considered a fabrication. I have never heard of the female character and don't know if she's accurately portrayed or not, or even a real person. In her attitude about everything from war to her sexual forwardness she reads like a woman of the '90s rather than the '40s. Robbins has a gift for descriptive narrative that makes you able see what he is describing in great detail. Unfortunately, the internal conversations his characters have with themselves are equally wordy and don't ring true to life, though I concede that the concepts of life and death and duty they agonize over might call for a bit more verbage to cover than lighter material would. My main gripe was the cliffhanger style ending given the two principle &quot;real&quot; characters a whole chapter before the epilogue. I expected the epilogue to clear it up, but it did not. This might have worked in a novel of pure fiction, but in dealing with people who really lived it is unforgiveable."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"&quot;War of the Rats&quot; is a waste of time and money. The writing is clumsy, like a new-born calf. The bad similes are endless, like ants at a picnic. The charaters are flat and worn, like an old floorboard. The female heroine, Chernova, was an actual participant in the battle. Making her into an expatriate American - whose unnoticed accent allows her to pass as a Russian - is ridiculous - explanable only as an excuse for pages of narrrative about what her life would have been. (Far better would have been enough research to write about Chernova's actual history, which included ballet and medical studies; or even research on the life of any imagined Russian woman fighting in the war). This is a bad character study; the love scenes are comic; sloppy editing. There is no &quot;white-knuckled tension&quot; as promised by Frederick Forsyth on the dust jacket - simply pages of repetitive ruminations by the two snipers. The best fiction about Stalingrad is still Plievier's &quot;Stalingrad&quot; (he was a German communist, writing in 1948); exciting non-fiction accounts of this great battle include: Anthony Beevor, &quot;Stalingrad&quot; (1998), and William Craig, &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; (1973). If your time or money mean anything to you, do not waste either of them on this book."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This should have been a great story. The human side is well done, and the descriptions of the battle for Stalingrad and its outcome are certainly well presented, but at its core it's all about snipers, and that's where it got shaky for me. The author's understanding of rifles and shooting technique come up &quot;Maggie's Drawers&quot;. He confuses rifles and shotguns, imagines a &quot;gas system&quot; on a bolt action rifle, mis-states the effects of shooting up and downhill, and repeatedly mixes up a number of other shooting-related details. The shot-through-the-scope-trick is overdone. This first appeared in &quot;Marine Sniper&quot;, the biography of Viet Nam sniper GYSG Carlos Hathcock, wherein it was correctly presented as a freak occurrance with chilling undertones. Once would have sufficed for dramatic effect, but here it is performed several times on purpose, something just not possible, given the conditions and inherent accuracy of the rifles of the period. It causes me to question the rest of the research that went into the book. Robbins is no Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"An obvious plot, dreadful dialogue, and an insipid romance. Even the setting couldn't save it."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"The only action I saw between these two protagonist love birds was their love making. If I wanted a romantic novel I would have purchased Romeo and Juliet. So for me, a WW II history buff, this was a profound let down. I was only able to tolerate 15 chapters, and that is actually the MOST I have ever been able to handle in a book that is about 2 love birds. While I am at it I am going to torture my next door neighbor by giving him the book because he is a WW II buff as well. This book promises correct information about life in Stalingrad during WW II, but is a sadly incorrect (in many cases) depiction of a love story set supposedly in Stalingrad during WW II."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Too short on actual fact and way long on unreality. Stalingrad comes across more like the summer of love in San Fran in 1968 than the meat grinder it actually was. It was hard to finish as a historian."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I had the opportunity to read David L. Robbins' War of the Wats both before and after viewing the movie Enemy at the Gates. I reread the novel for no particular reason other than to reaffirm the flaws I found in the movie, however I now feel the need to review the novel here. War of the Rats provides us with a detailed and accurate picture of life in Stalingard.Robbins' ability to paint us a picture of the war-torn city is astounding, and every word is abosrbed the reader feels more and more intimate with the very believable characters and even more inthralled with the world provided for us. With almost morbid attention the reader is taken through mass death, fesces-lined sewer, and blood-stained dirt. All of this, however, simply adds to the authenticity of the novel.Each character in the novel is paid due respect, and up until the very last word of the novel there is no clear-cut antagonist and no clear character who is destined to succeed. Many novels and films are often predictable because we know that the &quot;good guy can't die.&quot; Fortunately, Robbins characters keep the reader guessing throughout the entire novel.It is unfortunate, however, that upon finishing the novel we discover that som eof the events and characters in the novel are false. Though this does not dampen the delight instilled by the novel, it does serve to frustrate some and leave questions unasnwered. Only after significant reasearch was I capable of reconstructing events.In conclusion, the novel is a definite four stars, though not a classic to be read by all generations. Robbins does a fantastic job of allowing us to watch events transpire in Stalingrad, and we can truly feel the pain and happiness of the characters in the novel. War of the Rats is definitely worth a read by any World War II, military, or historical fiction fan."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I chose to read this book before viewing the movie, Enemy At the Gates, and I was glad that I did. The book details the harshness of Stalingrad more than the movie depicts. The lives of the snipers, both Russian and German, and the consequent hunt made the book difficult to stop reading. But, more than that, this book inspired me to read the book, Stalingrad, an excellent account of the battle of this Russian city."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book is by far the best novel I have read dealing with WW2!

War of the rats is an amazing book that needs to be read again and again."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This is a good account of the Stalingrad portion of WW2 and the history of Russian snipers and their service during that battle, if you like the movie Enemy at the Gates this is good additional fanfare."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Authors writing novels in a winter setting can find hundreds of phrases here to fit any situation. Whole paragraphs are devoted to a sequence of sentences attempting to convey bitter cold. But enough already!!!Similarly, the book has countless passages devoted to participant reflections about the senselessness of war. Buried under these predictable viewpoints is a bright spot as the snipers draw the distinction between what they do and the actions of other combatants. A sniper's conduct is closer to murder than a killing in the heat of combat. A person who throws a wild punch at an unsuspecting bystander is not a boxer entitled to claim any honor for the outcome; Robbins does a decent job of drawing out this aspect of the sniper's actions but surrounds it with romance novel anguish from everyone.And speaking of romance, the inclusion of Tanya was sound and reflected the reality of Stalingrad but the romance with the Hare was a complete waste of ink and my time."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This author really knows how to write. I enjoyed this book quite a lot.Ultimately it's a novel and not a historic document, so there some details were changed to make for a more entertaining story. This shouldn't surprise anyone.The plot was good, the characters believable, and the setting was about as dramatic as it gets. His use of language is great, and I could really picture war-torn Stalingrad. I never had a lot of interest in this part of the war, but this book made me want to learn more.Now I need to go read some of his other books."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I think that it is a well put together book. The movie \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" is remarkably similar though."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"A great story of one-on-one combat in the midst of chaos. It is a story based on the real life Soviet sniper and the German sniper sent to hunt him down in war-torn Stalingrad. Told from the Russian perspective, you cannot help but chear for the young hero in this contest. He is the common man hero pitted against the cold and calculating professional assassin. The book is even more exciting than the later movie adaptation, _Enemy at the Gates_.The naration is superb in this audio recording only enhancing an already fast-moving and inspiring action adventure."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This is the best book i've ever read in my life, the first 200 pages are awesome, it does start to slow down a bit in the end but over all i love this book"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This was one fun book to read. I was total consumed by the gritty descriptions of the bombed out city of Stalingrad and the suffering of the Russian and German soldiers. David Robbins does a wonderful job of creating the smells and misery surrounding this horrible period in history. Basically the story pits two snipers, one Russian, the other German against each other. But what I liked most, was the character development that D.R. sets up for us.Both Snipers are total different in there outlook at life, they have a different style of hunting and there reasons for fighting are total different. But there bond is strong for they are good at one thing. I was up till all hours of the night waiting to see how it would turn out which was a tad quick. My only regret was that the book continued for additional 40 pages, which was more of a history lesson rather than a suspense novel. But worth the time if you like war novels."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This novel is not a novel that leaves you. It shows just how awful war can get and how people stand up to this test. It also shows the rollercoaster of emotions that war can bring out. I hope it gathers a wide audience. It deserves it!"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book was a wonderful rendition of the battle for Stalingrad. This would be a great book for anyone that is a war fanatic or someone that enjoys all that is gory. I loved all the horrific details and the insight towards the characters. If you enjor action adventure, blood &amp; gore, or war itself, buy this book now !"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I loved to read this book. The story between 2 master-snipers during the siege of Stalingrad is well related and grasping. With this book, you can really understand how life could be in Stalingrad: every aspects is related at a moment or another: civilians, female entertainment, soldiers from both sides... What is missing to this novel is volume, pages. I would have loved it more if it had lasted some 300pages more. It's missing description of the city of the people... the author is too fast in action and could have lingered to describe more. The release of the movie from this novel: Ennemy at the Gates (due in february 2001) will certainly give a new push to this short action story."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I usually dont get into war novels but this one intrigued me due to the fact that it was mainly about two men hunting each other amongnst a huge and dirty war raging all around them. Also there was an interesting angle in this story that the two antagonists were so much alike, and yet so different in background and country. The characters were very rich and interesting, and I liked the American woman turned sniper angle also, that was done very well. The only reason I did not give it a 5-star rating was the ending was quite too abrupt for me as a reader. I was not sure what happened to the survivors and the final confrontation between the two men was not as exciting as I have read in other action-like novels. But still a good read and I am looking forward to the movie coming out on this book in February titled &quot;ENEMY AT THE GATES&quot;."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Two master snipers, one Russian, the other German, face off in the hell that is the battle of Stalingrad. Vasily Zietsev is a hunter from the Siberian steppes whose marksmanship and woodcraft ability are instrumental in his appointment of head of the Russian sniper troops. In fact his troops are so succesful that the Germans finally call on their master, Heinz Thorvald, to end Zietsev's life. So begins the duel in the rubble of Stalingrad from which only one man will emerge alive.I found this book very well written. The prose is quite lyrical and not what you'd expect from a war story. This novel is not a techno-thriller but deals with the characters and how the siege of Stalingrad has affected them. The sniper duel is almost an afterthought as Mr. Robbins spins his tale of love, death, cowardice and heroisim. Even if you don't like war stories I think you'll find this book entertaining."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Ever since I read Alan Clark's &quot;Barbarossa&quot; I have been fascinated by the duel between the master Russian and German sniper (the story is in the Russian's own words, and though it only occupies a couple of pages in Clark's book, every reader of &quot;War of the Rats&quot; would find it worthwhile). For this reason, despite the complaints some will have with character development and good guys/ bad guys approach, I recommend the book: it is the ONLY novel about one of the most fascinating stories to come out of WW2."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I've read many historical novels... fact as well as fiction. This novel gripped me from the first paragraph and never stopped. Normal people could not even begin to imagine the devistation, loss and suffering that was Stalingrad unless they had been there to experience it (or survive it). Robbins takes you there with unparalelled accuracy and rubs your face in the horror and brutality of war in such a way that you can almost smell the burning buildings and hear the screams of pain and terror. The actions and thoughts of the characters, while fictionalized, are as real as it gets. I can only hope that Speilberg has read this book!!"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"In brief, this is a fast-food dish whipped up from Russian ingredients by an American cook. David Robbins became a writer after, apparently, a midlife career switch. He's thrown himself into his new vocation with visible gusto. According to interviews available elsewhere on the web, he researched this story very doggedly, if not completely thoroughly. For instance, he knows the diminutive forms of many Russian names--Tolya and Anatolushka for Anatoly--but apparently not the more formal Russian habit of addressing people by name and patronymic--Anatoly Ivanovich. This is not an account of the entire battle of Stalingrad, so the background is broadly brushed in. Military buffs as well as the general reader will quickly grasp the setting. Since the principals are snipers--silent and deadly--there is a lot of internal monologue, to help the story along. Zaitsev the _okhot_, the Siberian hunter, is well-realized, while his adversary Thorvald is just slightly B-movie-ish. Tania the female sniper is an anachronism. Making her an American and giving her modern gender political attitudes must be the author's way of appealing to his Western readership. The love scenes strain plausibility--one occurs right after the snipers have crept through a sewer. The reader already knows what a hellhole Stalingrad was; there's no need for the author to flog the point like that.There are many fine turns of phrase in this book, and the sniper duels are frequently very exciting. Tom Clancy might have treated the technical aspects of the weaponry more convincingly. Lous L'Amour certainly would have brought out Zaitsev's hunting abilities more vividly (read _Last of the Breed_) But Robbins deserved credit for making a woman the co-lead in a novel like this. It's a brave gambit to include so many gooey love scenes, even if they are unwanted by most readers. This book doesn't hit the bullseye, but it is an enjoyable account of a conflict within the larger battle."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"If you're a sniper, love a sniper, or want to be a sniper, this is the book for you. The story relates the duel between the top Soviet and German snipers during the battle of Stalingrad during 1942. The descriptions of the rubble-strewn battleground are brutal. The plot is &quot;based on a true story&quot; with charcters who were real and places that existed. What seperates this story from the run of the mill World War II shoot-'em-up is the way the author gets inside the mind of the shooters. He talks about the rifle &quot;firing itself&quot; when everything is right--I have experianced this (not as a sniper!) and he's right. The book is not without problems (if possible, I would have shaved off 1/2 of a star). There's a gooy love-interest sub-plot that bored me and the gutty NKVD commisar made me want to vomit. Probably not for everyone or even all World War II fans but if sniping or the history of the Russian Front during World War II interest you, give it a try."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Could not put down. Excellent character development. Great for history buffs!"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Some who've reviewed this book didn't like the ending; I thought the ending was great, it leaves you hanging! The battle scenes that are described and the more intimate sniper scenes in the book are described in detail, right down to the players thoughts. Don't waste your time with the Left Behind series; that's summed up in Ezeikel 38 &amp; 39, get War of the Rats."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I don't read many WWII novels, but this book was very engrossing. I learned something about the seige of Stalingrad and came away with an appreciation of the Russians who fought there. Also, based on what I know of the Russian mentality, the characters were well written.(SPOILER) As far as faithfulness to fact goes, I cannot refute the opinion of a prior reviewer. I can attest that the History Channel, featuring a story on the battle, showed footage of a snipers' duel and the location of a bunker where the German died. Maybe Thorvald was not his real name.Also good: The Terrible Hours"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"David Robbins simple literary style is used to great effect in bringing you straight into the story, which is engrossing if a little predictable. The four main protagonists are believable, and the reader is given time to get to know them, and inevitably care what happens to them. The story itself, based loosely as it is on a true story, moves along in a fairly linear way, and the twists and turns which I felt the first half of the book promised, never really materialised. The young beautiful American, who having lost her grandparents to the Nazis, decides to join the partisans and dedicate her life to the war. Her passing herself off as Russian perfectly at all times even though she was raised in New York, before inevitably becoming the love interest of the main character, stretches credibility a little. That this entirely gratuitous character, who it transpires happens to be an excellent marksman, having probably had little real reason to make the most of her talents whilst growing up, does not irritate more, is testament to the skill of the writer. In deed to some degree she becomes believable, which given the number of clich&eacute;s she represents, is no mean feat.The Stalingrad of 1942 that these characters inhabit is elegantly and subtly described. By understating the description of such squalor and deprivations we know existed and choosing instead to leave these things in the background, and refer to them only as they apply directly to the characters, David Robbins has produced a wonderfully authentic setting for the story. And therein lies its real strength. History must be more than dates and facts if it is to have any value, the real worth of such an authentic description is that it allows us to better understand the past."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"David L. Robbins wrote a fine book about Stalingrad, a devastating WWII battle. Internal, personal battles and the actual battlegound are both described to great effect. Robbins is extremely perceptive, and gets inside the heads of his main characters. The foreshadowing for three of the characters imply their ultimate fates. I look forward to reading more of Robbins' work. He's on his way - his experience in writing this book will result in finer writing and improved quality of research in future books."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I cannot agree more with the previous review. The story is written so that the reader grows to like both sides and wishes that neither would ever catch the other side! And the characters' emotions are so real that I nearly cried for them as they deal with their fears and anguishes and loves and hates. Robbins is an excellent writer with amazing insight into the lives of the characters."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"War of the Rats transported me to Stalingrad. I found myself crawling along side &quot;The Hare&quot; during the Battle of Stalingrad. No Field Manual could have illustrated the mechanics of sniping the way David Robbins has. This is a must read for anyone interested in Sniping whether it is the history, or the practice, this book brings it to life."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"The prose, character development and ability to create time and place is excellent. However, it is how Robbins uses the horror of Stalingrad to tell the tale of an individual's soul that makes reading this book such a gratifying experience. Done with art and intelligence, War of the Rats should stand as a significant contribution that gives the legacy of Stalingrad an accessability that is overdue. An important book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Opening with the historical background of the battle for Stalingrad, the author then slips behind the lines to offer two perspectives on the battle and the war itself. The telling of personal battles being waged amidst the greater battle is well done."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Patricia Cornwell and John Grisham may be the hottest selling authors in Virginia but it's time to make a special place for David Robbins. War Of The Rats is a thrilling historical novel depicting one of the epic duels of World War II, but it is also one heckuva tender love story. Robbins manages to pull it off with characters that are able to examine their vulnerabilities (the revelation that Thorvald thinks of himself as a coward is convincing) and motives in the ghastly battle of Stalingrad. Most importantly, he made me care about a part of the war many Americans have overlooked. I'm inspired to read more about it and I eagerly await Robbin's next effort."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Robbins does a great job on two fronts - First, a vivid depiction of what the Battle of Staligrad must have been like for the soldiers - Second, a strong, suspenseful story in which modern war becomes personal for the snipers who fight each other. This book kept me reading; I had no idea how it would end. Looking forward to more from Mr. Robbins."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I was expecting somewhat more from this novel than it delivered. The setting was excellent, and I have no problem with the \\"pro-Russian\\" slant which offended some other readers -- it was, after all, written from the Russian protagonists' perspective. Keeping in mind the Commissars' propagandic exploitation of Soviet heroes, I found the \\"noble\\" portrayals of the Red Army appropriate and realistic. Some of the technical discrepancies were distracting, but in general not enough to ruin it for this reader. It's a novel, after all, a fictionalized account of real historical events and people. (Zaitsev's training of his \\"hares\\" is well-documented, although it's questionable whether the \\"famous\\" duel ever actually occurred.) What damages the book, in my opinion, is the sappy love-story. It really detracts from the gritty realism of the Battle of Stalingrad. I'm glad the character of Tanya was included, since many female combatants fought and died for their Motherland. I wish she had been written as the Ukrainian upon whom her character was based; maybe the author felt that an American presence was needed to \\"connect\\" his American readers to a Soviet conflict. But the \\"hot-to-trot\\" seductiveness of Tanya dishonors the sacrifices of Zaitsev's real women snipers, who had no time for bed-hopping antics. And the \\"romantic\\" scenes were simply unbelievable -- (lovemaking after crawling through the muck of a sewer? after lying in wait for hours in the freezing snow?)-- and so excruciatingly clumsily written that this reader was actually embarrassed for the characters. Moreover, the sexual situations undermine the real Tanya's war record: she was already a partisan and sniper before meeting Zaitsev, and scored some 81 kills in avenging her family. (For more accurate depiction of the contributions of Soviet women to the Great Patriotic War, read \\"On the Road to Stalingrad\\", K.J. Kottam's translation of the memoirs of a woman machine-gunner; or \\"Night Witches\\", Bruce Myle's story of Soviet female combat-aviators.) The romantic interludes also degrade the characterization of Vasya Zaitsev, the sniper. Here is a real-life person and a legendary hunt in an embattled city, which hold fascination aplenty, with no need for superfluous embellishment. Overall, I enjoyed the book because of my interest in the War on the Eastern Front, my love for Russia and her people, and my appreciation for the exploits of Vasiliy Zaitsev. I wish the author had paid a little more attention to the details of battle and a little less to the \\"matters of the heart\\". What could have been an extraordinary, exciting read was ultimately reduced to entertaining fluff. This is a good book with which to occupy your time during a 12-hour airflight."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"WAR OF THE RATS is a superb novel of combat. Combat in a theater of World War II that most Americans, dismally familiar only with the fighting role of the US in the Pacific and Europe, know little about - the Russian Front. Specifically, in this book, the Battle of Stalingrad at the end of 1942.Chief Master Sergeant Vasily Zaitsev (\\"The Hare\\") is an expert sniper in the 62nd Army, that force of the Red Army desperately maintaining a toehold in Stalingrad, under siege by the German 6th Army. Zaitsev is so good at his job that he is ordered to establish a sniper school. One of his students is Tania Chernova, an American woman of Russian descent fighting to avenge the execution of her grandparents at the hands of the Nazis. The graduates of The Hare's training become so proficient at killing Germans that the morale of the 6th Army's front-line troops is seriously threatened. Zaitsev becomes a Red Army hero and a winner of the Order of Lenin. As a counter, the Reich's most expert sniper, SS Colonel Heinz Thorvald (\\"The Headmaster\\"), is flown from Germany into the Stalingrad battle. His orders - to find and kill The Hare.There is no superlative too extravagant to describe this book. At 470 pages in paperback, I absorbed it at one sitting on a flight from Washington, DC to Los Angeles. Zaitsev, Chernova and Thorvald were all actual combatants in Stalingrad. Their roles, as well as the movements of both the German and Russian forces in the battle as a whole, are facts lifted from historical sources researched by the author, David Robbins. The insight Robbins gives the reader into the skills and training of the military sniper is absolutely riveting. The action is gritty and realistic. The characters are finely drawn.One measure of a novel's excellence is its ability to inspire the reader to delve further into the subject. I've just added to my Amazon.com Wish List a history of the Stalingrad siege."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Set in the hell of the Battle of Stalingrad, Mr. Robbins give us a novel that poignantly explores what it means to preserve one's humanity in a bitter struggle for survival. Not a simple &quot;war story&quot; or a Tom Clancy-like obsession with the technical details of warfare--although plenty abound in this book--&quot;The War of the Rats&quot; vividly confronts us with real people caught up in a desparate effort to cling to life and love. Robbins brings us an intimate portrait of the human condition set against the broader canvas of the devastation of war at its most brutal . His characters are real; the narrative is gripping; and the satisfaction one feels on reading the book is immense. Robbins brings home, through the device of a sniper duel between the master snipers of the Red Army and the SS, what Stalingrad meant to those who fought the battles and bled and died in the greatest single confrontation of World War II. Despite whatever minor technical flaws one may find in the novel, Robbins is a master of his craft. His achievement will be come a classic of the genre alongside &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; and &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front.&quot;"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":".. try to get the history right. Particularily such obscure facts as which month Germany invaded the Soviet Union. And that is just one of the small mistakes that add up to make this novel not a very good piece of historical fiction. There are *many* errors about World War 2 history that even an amateur such as myself found glaringly obvious and severely detracted from what should be a historical scene set in Stalingrad. I will not detail all of them because they are simply too many and the novel does not work as a work of historical fiction, though it might fall into the genre of alternate history.I will next address the problems of simple military accuracy. In this matter I rate myself even below an amateur, but the mistakes are *staggering* and once again detract from any sort of 'supension of disbelief'. The German sniper changes his rifle not once but *twice* during the hunt for the Russian sniper, and the second change is to a sort of rifle he's *never* fired before. If you were hunting the best sniper of the other army would you switch from a weapon you knew intimately to one that you'd never fired before (and in spite of what is written in this book) is *widely* agreed upon to be the inferior weapon? I sure wouldn't and it severly detracts from the plausibility of the duel. Other less severe errors abound, such as the author not understanding the difference between machine guns and sub-machine guns etc. etc. Once again, one can simply set these concerns aside and accept that perhaps this is an alternate history and move on to other concerns.The characters: Wow, the Nazis sure were bad people, not much question of that, but the author feels the need to beat the reader over the head with it, talking about the SS sniper shooting wounded and nurses and doctors etc., but of course, the Soviet sniper would never *dream* of such a thing because the Soviets are the 'good guys' and the Germans are the 'bad guys'... at least in this book. And another point, that I believe another reviewer was making. This might come as a surprise to some (including, probably, the author) but not all Germans were Nazis. In fact not even most of the German army was Nazis, in fact, a very *small* number of Germans soldiers belonged to the Nazi party. I could digress into illustrative points about this but suffice it to say that the other simply refers to every German as a Nazi, throughout the book. Fine, I guess, from the point of view of the Soviet soldiers, they were indeed all just Nazis... A finer look at the characters reveals very large pixelated people, no defintion to them at all, simply stereotypical charicatures that no one could possibly care about. I certainly didn't and the possibility that one or more of any of the four main characters might die just filled me with... well nothing, I didn't care if they lived or died.And now the female character and the love affair between her and the Soviet sniper. OH.... MY.... GOD! This is the most pathetic part of the novel, IMHO. The American-Russian woman (uh-huh, whatever) is so sexually liberated that she wants to have sex after crawling through a sewer for several hours, during which one of her party was overcome and died from methane poisoning, and while she and her other companion are still covered in dried feces. Yep, nothing turns me on like a good trek through the sewer of a city of several million people. And the sex scenes are the most clusmily written and awfully described sort of these I've ever read. It got to the point where I simply would skip over these little vignettes and move on. And the trip to the brothel... oh, please, please stop writing this.And now, on to the writing itself. It is not good, rather it is like a man who has found a list of metaphors is writing very poor descriptions of something he hasn't read nearly enough about. The writing is just plain not very good. It's clumsy and overly-wordy and clearly not properly edited at all.Any one of these things about the novel would detract from it slightly, but still make it interesting and readable, but the list of errors, cardboard cut-out characters, and poor writing of the author makes it less a work of fiction and more like work trying to get through it."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I enjoy Historical Fiction and David L.Robbins is very good at crafting a tale around History's Events. In, &quot;War Of The Rats&quot;, he recounts the, &quot;Duel&quot;, between Russia's Chief Master Sergeant Vasily Zaitsev, and Germany's Colonel Heinz Thornvold, as they played out their sniper's match and starred in the propaganda battles their countries staged, all in the wreckage of Stalingrad. I also enjoyed the alternative view of war that the Author related. The tens of thousands do not fight this particular violence of war, nor do the millions engage in it. These are very personal acts of killing. While it is one individual with a single rifle, the area that can be controlled through the terror their unique talents allow is an amazing study in Human endurance.Historical Fiction can be tricky as it is hard to set rules for how closely the Author must follow the facts as he or she knows them. There is no excuse for knowingly writing a story that is error prone and excuse it as fiction, and then call it History when it is easily documented. I do not believe the Author is guilty of this. I do think that any attempt to document all facts surrounding the exploits of a Soviet War Hero as chronicled by their Wartime propaganda mentality is virtually impossible. This is the same military mindset that had the submarine Kurst hitting a 50 year old floating mine, and had those on board alive for days when in fact they had died horrible deaths. This latter event was in peacetime, and still pride required lies that were absurd. During a war, facts often are changed, minimilized or embellished. The management of facts is a major part of any war effort.If you really want to see a distorted view of these events, see the movie, &quot;The Enemy At The Gates&quot;, they got the location correct, beyond that is was marginal to wretched. The story that actually occurred in Stalingrad had the entire dynamic any good movie needs. Studios are so clich&eacute; in their portrayals of certain groups that the truth is never bad enough it always must be embellished.Single individuals can have a great effect during a given event or events. What I found fascinating is the degree to which great snipers can control large critical areas of the battlefield not only by their ability to hit a target from astounding distances, but by the fear alone that they cast over an area before a shot is fired. Once their presence is established they can paralyze a large field of conflict with only one man or woman and one rifle.In the end I don't know how many errors the Author made, and if he made any how important they were. I can say if you enjoy historical fiction, or choose to take the entire work as a novel, you will enjoy the time you spend with this man's work."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Harsh comments made concerning Mr. Robbin's research efforts being, shall I say, &quot;lacking&quot;... are unfair. He is NOT a &quot;gun person&quot; -- and doesn't claim to be one -- but he is quite the detail-oriented historian. His forte is with events of the past. That he made mistakes with respect to shooting and facts about Mausers or Mosin-Nagants is forgivable. He relied on the (obviously-flawed) &quot;expert advice&quot; of an &quot;ex Special Forces&quot; chap who led him completely astray with regard to uphill/downhill shooting, and so on. Yes, yes... I know... while the &quot;.410&quot; designation is actually a caliber and not a gauge, he errantly called a shotgun a rifle. Frankly, all of Page 81 and the first part of Page 82 should be rewritten. As a matter of fact, the author is AT THIS TIME making diligent efforts to correct his mistakes, lest he offend even more shooters, but there are thousands of copies of the current printing in circulation and these corrections won't show up until the next printing.This is actually a story of humanity. True, it is &quot;sniper heavy,&quot; but that too is correct; snipers played a very significant role in the battle for Stalingrad, and that Mr. Robbins chose such individuals as vessels through which he could tell his story was right, fitting, and just. In &quot;War of the Rats,&quot; you have a scholarly member of German academia, Thorvald, pitted -- and quite reluctantly at that -- against a Siberian hunter, Zaitsev. Makes for interesting reading, I must say, and I learned more about the hardships endured by both opposing forces -- not only in Stalingrad but along the entire front and throughout the war itself -- than I'd ever known before. Mr. Robbins did what he set out to do... that being, to tell a story. To educate. To relate a harsh piece of history to anyone with a desire to learn. We owe it to those who went before us, in harm's way, and paid the ultimate price, to learn WHY. &quot;Why&quot; there was a war. &quot;Why&quot; there was a Hitler. &quot;Why&quot; there was a Stalingrad."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This author has done a great job of taking both a World War Two historical battle - Stalingrad, mixed in a sniper duel using factual characters and created a story that could almost be mistaken as non-fiction. The details of what took place at the battle are as real and detailed as any of the non-fiction books out there that describe the battle. The sniper story line is also close to the facts including the tactics and weapons described. The author does a good job at describing the town, or what is left of it during the battle. He also paints a vivid picture of what the battle and living conditions were like during the siege.My only issue with the book was the love story sub plot. It did not seam to work for me; the book is taking place in a hell on earth battle with death all around them, if there was a romance there it just distracted me form the story. I did not pick up the book looking for a love story nor did I expect one thrown in. Besides that it was a very good book. If you are into World War Two historical fiction this is one of the better ones out there."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"If you like wartime novels this is a book for you. You will want read it straight through, but you won't want it to end. This is as close to being in the hell that was Stalingrad as you can get without having been there yourself. You will feel that you are crawling through the demolished buildings, keeping your head down to avoid the instant, unseen death that snipers deliver. Indeed, this book is about the ultimate sniper duel. The top snipers from Germany and Russia are sent to kill one another - if Stalingrad doesn't kill them both first. Here you will see both points of view, you will experience the desperation of trying to survive the winter and the war, and you will know what it is like to be a sniper. The stalking, the waiting, the shot, and then you move - before you become another sniper's victim. The book is based on real-life events and extensive research. Details are presented in such a way as to not interfere with the well-developed characters and story line. The entire Stalingrad expereince is present, including the way many of the fighters simply vanished into the fighting or the Russian winter."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"'Victory goes not to the side with the biggest guns, but to the side with the best shots...'Staged against the backdrop of the shattered city of Stalingrad, War of the Rats is both a cold-sweat thriller and a heart-rending glimpse at one of the pivotal battles of the second world war. The real events on which the book is based have be alternately dramatised since; in the Jude Law film, Enemy at the Gates. This novel however is far more engaging, chock full of nail-biting cat and mouse encounters as the two patriotic snipers duel to the death.Like good Clancy or Crichton, Robbins' novel cleverly balances historical and technical fact with dramatic fiction, thrusting the reader into the thick of the action. Its not all gunplay however, and perhaps the real strength of this book is the chilling human realism given to the quieter moments...one can't help but feel a shudder of grief at the thought of the main, and supporting characters surviving day by day amidts the horror of war.Despite that last comment, this isn't really a 'war is hell' novel, and there's nothing preachy thrown in to upset the pace. What you do get is gritty, often brutal action and believable empathetic characters. I'd highly recommend this to any WW2 buff, but equally to anyone after a cracking good thriller."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"As a work of pure fiction, this book would be mediocre and somewhat enjoyable. As a work of historical ficiton, it is noticable light on the \\"history\\" and heavy on the \\"ficiton\\", and thus fails on several levels.As others have pointed out, there are many technical inaccuracies. Robbins' insistence that the Mosin-Nagant is a superior rifle to the K98 because of its reliability, ruggedness, etc. leaves out the fact that Soviet soldiers had special oils and lubricants to keep weapons functioning in cold weather (it is not an intrinsic property of the rifle.) His allowance that the K98 is a gram or so lighter is rather irrelevant (we're talking about a heavy pair of rifles here, and a gram's difference in weight is not really worth noticing, especially in relation to snipers who will be firing the majority of their shots in the prone position.) These sort of details are important in a book so centered around rifle marksmanship.In another instance, a platoon of Germans sing the Horst Wessel song together (the song of the Nazi party.) Now, the Germans are certainly the villians and agressors in this conflict, but aren't there enough true bad things to say about them, without implying that they are all card-carrying Nazis as well (in fact, only a minority of soldiers were.)Tania Chernova, a real combatant at Stalingrad, is transformed from a Russian into an American who gets involved in the conflict because she happens to be visiting her Russian grandparents when an SS einsatzgruppen rides into her village and kills them both. She manages to pass herself off as a Russian and fights as a partisan before the Stalingrad battle. Because her parents are Russian, I can accept that she can speak the language like a native and that she knows something about local customs. I cannot accept, however, that she has traveled between the US and Soviet Russia multiple times during the paranoid years of Stalin's purges. There is enough the write about the real Tania Chernova (ballet dancer and medical student), who really did fight the Germans, without having to resort to fiction. Instead, she is essentially a Bond girl, screwing half her squad one minute and dealing death to the Wehrmacht the next.Commisar Danilov, a real paticipant according to William Craig (Enemy at the Gates), also makes an appearance. He is protrayed as the common grunts' best buddy, which is somewhat surprising considering that the Comissars were the ones who turned in soldiers for \\"defeatist attitudes\\", shot them in the back if they hesitated while advancing, and didn't take part in combat themselves.The biggest fabrication, however, is the driving force for the entire plot; namely, Heinz Thorvald, evil German sniper extraordinare. Recent research indicates that the famous \\"sniper duel\\" of Stalingrad probably never happened, despite the claims of Soviet sources (who don't exactly have a record for honesty.)In any case, Heinz is more of a sterotype \\"evil Nazi\\" than a realistic character. A fat, condescending, coldhearted aristocrat, Heinz has no qualms about shooting medical aid workers in cold blood to draw out Soviet snipers (the heroic Soviet snipers, of course, do no such thing.) The scene in which Heinz exchanges his personal rifle for an enemy weapon is beyond belief (sniper's weapons are often tailor-made to fit their user exactly, and I have a hard time believing that the top German sniper wouldn't possess such a weapon.) Since the reader has a fair idea of how it's going to end, there is little suspense when the duel is settled. Afterwards, Robbins does try to create some suspense by having a character's life hang in the balance, but this remains unresolved, other than the generalized \\"the Germans lost the war\\". In fact, the entire thing pretty much remains unresolved, contributing to the number of comments here about how lousy the ending was.Still, the book does have its moments, such as Zaitsev's platoon's suicidal attack across the Volga at the Germans, or the desperation of Christmas Eve in encircled Stalingrad.Better books on this interesting and tragic battle are \\"Stalingrad\\" by Beevor and \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" by Craig."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"It's always nice to see war novels use the Russian Front in World War II; especially the epic battle of Stalingrad. \\"The War of the Rats\\" is the book on which the screen play for \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" was based. The book is a reasonable portrayal of the horrors of war especially street to street fighting. The characterization of the Communist political officers, the German Gestapo and the high ranking officers on both sides are two dimensional and horribly predictable. The \\"heroes\\" are righteous, valiant, selfless and experts in their sniper knowledge domain. Both want to share their knowledge and generate clones of themselves.Sound formulaic and trite? You are correct. But, don't go to the movie for any relief. It is also formulaic, trite and has an unbelievably hokey love scene. If you want a really great war movie see \\"Black Hawk Down\\".

A competent writer like Robbins could not - and does not - fail to have some involving elements in telling the story. Howver, given the subject matter, I was surprised at how \\"by the numbers\\" it felt. By which I mean, I felt that the author had simply read, for example, Wm. Craig's earlier book, wrote down incident upon incident (sewer transits, dangerous river ferry crossing, disabled German tank (from any Stalingrad photo or even the drawing on Craig's book), sniper duel, singing to cover tunnel digging, reputed Soviet mastery of street fighting via using \\"storm groups\\"(as if assaults like Zaitsev's sailor comrades'charge never happened), etc., then added a love story and some biographical details to fill the narrative out and thus: War of the Rats.

If six out of five stars were numerically possible, rest assured &quot;War of the Rats&quot; would get it from me."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Enjoy it 100%!!! I think that if David L. Robbins didn't get a movie right from the producer of 'enemy at the gate,' he should sue them. 'cause the movie itself is definitely originated and based on mr david robbin's novel. if they goofied it by claiming it was inspired by william craig's 'enemy at the gate,' then they are definitely lying. 'war of the rats' could be read as a sequal to 'the master sniper' by stephen hunter and if you like the great snipers' novel, you would be greatly enjoyed by reading stephen hunter's 'point of impact' series (except the detoured one, 'dirty white boys.' 'black light' and 'time to hunt' are both great books after 'point of impact.' the other great and fasinating sniper novel is: 'white star' by james thayer, an amazing duel between two retired american and russian snipers."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I must start by saying I am not without bias; This book is my bible. I spent an entire summer vacation researching the movie \\"Enemy at the Gates\\", and I found this gem three days into the research. I read it in a record four hours, without as much of a bathroom break. I read it again. And again. Twelve hours later, I found myself irreversibly adamant in rooting for SS Col. Heinz Thorvald and his assistant, Nikki Mond. The writing is extremely easy to digest, as easily as some of the books I have read before. The book is extremely accurate, though a bit fuzzy in the lines of fact and fiction; but Robbins does well in conveying the human drama to a historical backdrop. If six stars out of five were numerically possible, rest assured this book would get all six from me. And in relation to the move Enemy at the Gates, I have seen the Behind the Scenes featrurettes in the Special Edition, and I can honestly say that I feel Ed Harris was the only one who actually read this book. Jude Law, maybe, but I'm not sure on that."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"War of the Rats is supposedly a 'suspense filled novel about a sniper duel in Stalingrad', which has received great reviews from many readers, and respected critics alike.Here is basically what the story is about (as I read it):Vasily Zaitsev, (an intelligent, cultured, and peace loving man from the Siberian tundra) heads off to Stalingrad. After his unit of sailors is all but wiped out, Vasha transforms instantly into a veteran sniper, and singlehandly blunts the Nazi BlitzKrieg.Vashas talents are spotted by the local communist party official, and he is politely asked to start a sniper school. Within a mere 3 days (I kid you not), a group of snipers has been recruited AND fully trained, including a blonde blue eyed American women (what else) who can shoot the wings off a fly at 1 mile.For the next couple of days, Vasha and his band of snipers destroy half the German Army (correction: The Nazi army, complete with Stuka Fighters), who like the wicked fascist thugs that they are, keep popping their heads over the trench line to see who is there. The characters are developed well at this point, and the courage, depth of feelings, sheer stoic heroism, and all round goodness of the snipers left me with a tear in my eye.At this stage of the book, I had to go get a drink of Vodka, walk outside in cold and sing a few bars of 'the Internationale'.Now, it is important when reading a book to build up the correct imagery in your mind, so that reading the book is as visually stunning as going to see the movie. Originally, my mental imagery conjured the Germans as dusty, sweaty and dangerous beings, in muddy shades of greys and greens - like the quite well done German veterans in Private Ryan. However, in War of the Rats, you have to imagine the Germans (correction: Nasty Nazi Soldiers), as wearing black uniforms, long thin shiny riding boots, and big black helmets with a gigantic silver swastika painted on the front, just to go along with those shiny black Stuka fighters of theirs. Oh, and you have to picture the Nazis as ugly too - not like the blue eyed blonde American girl who has now slept with half of the sniper group. (as you do).The whole book is simply dripping in realism - the author states the correct calibres of the both the Kar98K rifle, and the Moysin Nagant rifle, and even decides to throw in the rate of fire of the PPsH Machine Gun ! There is even a map of Stalingrad in the front of the book, complete with the location of the Red October factory - I did a quick scan on the web and was stunned to find that there really was a Red October factory in Stalingrad - simply brilliant research really makes this book shine !Now the good part comes along - With the growing reputation of the Red snipers, the Nasty old German Jerry High Command decides to send over their best sniper to do battle with the Russian. Remember Mel Gibson as 'The Ghost' in The Patroit - well that is Vasily Zaitsev, and this Nazi Thorvald is none other than the colonel of the British Dragoons himself. If you missed that film, then picture Russell 'Gladiator' Crowe in the Colliseum up against the wicked inbred Emporer.Sure enough, a sniping duel ensues, and just guess who wins !! That is the whole point a great suspense novel isnt it .. that the reader is glued to the pages in anticipation of what could possibly happen next. Needless to say, the suspense almost killed me. That is probably the only flaw in this otherwise perfect book - the suspense is just too much for the average reader to handle, and is potentially even a health risk I would suggest.Anyway, the nasty Nazi gets overly arrogant, and Zaitsev manages to put him away, keeping his 1-man-1-bullet record intact. I was so releived that I cried out 'Thank God for Vasily Zaitsev' on the crowded public train, since the Nazi Thorvald was such a mean, arrogant and foppish monster of a person, totally devoid of moral fibre and physically repuslive to boot, that he would be too much to even get a position on the board at Microsoft.So there you go, an excellent book that brings back realism to the war genre - much like the old commando comics that told it like it really was. If you thought that Missing in Action II was the ultimate realistic war movie, then you will love this book. If you watched that other film about the sniper (Oliver Stone's 'Saviour' with Dennis Quaid), and ended up scratching your head saying 'What was all that about ?', then you will probably also love this book - since the author takes the reader down a narrow track and tells you how to think.I cannot wait for the authors next book - maybe the author can re-count the famous battle of Warsaw, where Hitler's nazis burst in Poland with 100,000 Tiger Tanks, and were halted at the gates of Warsaw by the Polish cavalry .. commanded by Sylvester Stallone, who's horse carries a half-naked Nastasia Kinski on the saddle.I cant wait !"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"A missed opportunity to tell a truly great story. What's up with girl from America? Sell out! That said, I still enjoyed it, and recommend it."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book gives the reader a good feel for what was going on at the time it takes place. The author seems a little confused at times on things like the difference between an SMG and a machine-gun, or that not ALL German soldiers were Nazis (in fact, very few of them were members of the Nazi party). The book is definitely one which portrays the Germans as the &quot;Bad guys,&quot; and the Russians as the &quot;good guys.&quot; I thought Grandfather's Tale: the Tale of a German Sniper was a lot better book about WWII snipers."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Simply put, this book is a sheer waste of time. The author fails miserably in an attempt to brew a concotion of fact+fiction. Although this book has all the right characters (Vassily Zaitsev, Heinz (Koenig) Thorvald, Tania etc), it is evident that the author cannot weave a compelling plot.If you are interested in the duel between Vassily and Thorvald, see \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" MOVIE. If you want to know about the battle for Stalingrad, read \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" BOOK. Stay away from this one!"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"You've watched \\"Enemy at the gates\\" and bought David Robbins' \\"War of the rats\\" because you wanted to read a fictional account on Vasily Zaitsev and the Battle of Stalingrad? So did I. But forget the movie. The book has little resemblance to what you've seen on screen. A few characters, and the settings. That's about it. \\"Enemy at the gates\\" is pure Holywood. \\"War of the rats\\" is much more close to reality.David Robbins did a reaching research before he worte this book. That shows in the story. Stalingrad - or what was left of Stalingrad during the war - is very well depicted: the icy Volga, the destroyed buildings, the german attack, and the russian resistence. Staligrad is as much a character in \\"War of the rats\\" as is Zaitsev, the siberian supersniper. Robbins writes about the two sides of the story, the russians and the germans. The russians have stablished a sniper school, lead by Zaitsev and his troup of sharpshooters, as a way of mining the will of the Wermacht. The germans, trapped in a frozen urban landscape, try to reach the Volga and the unnocupied and resourceful lands beneath it. The russians use a tactic of guerrilla warfare, where Stalingrad is a no-man's-land of sorts, and the germans bring in Heinz Thorvald, the ultra-confident german sniper. In the desolate city, these two masters of precision will fight each other to death, without even seeing their faces at close.Robbins' style is dry, objective, almost as journalistic as his character Danilov, the propaganda reporter. There are no hollywoodian showdown, no impossible or heroic feats of war. In fact, the war is shown as it really should be: ugly, bloody, a complete waste of human and material resources. That's the main thing about \\"War of the rats\\". I think there are many ficitional aspects in the book, but I also think it is very close to reality, in the sense of human relationships during a terrible conflict, not in technical aspects. Zaitsev is no hero. Thorvald is not a manic monster. They were two people fighting in opposite sides in a war. And Robbins portrays that fight very well.Grade 8.2/10"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This is the only 'war' novel I own ... I have The Naked And The Dead by Mailer, but that's it. When I saw the movie, Enemy At The Gates, I was blown away by the sniper plot between Jude law and Ed Harris: if you felt the same, and loved that movie, get this book and read it right away.This is a factual novel, with some writer's guessing thrown in, but with clarity and just cause: a lot of this is documented in letters that survived the war, but there are some scenes in the book, conversations between characters, where the author has to use his own creativity, and he does it brilliantly.If you want a great plot, the sniper's hunt between each other, plus some great, powerful prose that puts you right in the fighting, then grab this one right away. You'll zip through the pages and make this a keeper on your bookshelf.5 STARS *****."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"First off, David L. Robbins' WAR OF THE RATS is a wonderful read. Gripping, supensful historical fiction at its best. His latest THE END OF WAR is even better, a little more on the historical and less on the fiction side when compared to WAR OF THE RATS though.That having been said, I urge the reviewers who claim that the new movie ENEMY AT THE GATES is the movie adaptation of WAR OF THE RATS to do some research and get a clue! ENEMY AT THE GATES is based on a book of that very same title by William Craig that was published a full 26 years before WAR OF THE RATS!! The dualing snipers is a factual story that pops up in every account of the Battle of Stalingrad, even Antony Beever's unbelievably well written non-fiction STALINGRAD."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I read these days for pure entertainment value. I listen to the news heading to work, and of course like most people I work all day. So when I recently was at a bookstore, and saw the War of the Rats book, I wasn't very enthusiastic about buying it. However, I was in a hurry at the time.. thankfully.This book is amazing.. while staying focused on basic &quot;could have happened&quot; events, it manages to be incredibly entertaining, creating very realistic hero and villain figures. The book manages to stay fast paced, yet goes fairly in depth into character development.I really enjoyed the fact that Robbins managed to give both the hero and the villain flaws, which just extended the feeling that this was more of a historical story, rather than yet another fiction book.Greatly entertaining, one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously at first. The premise - a duel to the death between the two premier snipers available to the Russians and the Germans in the ruins of Stalingrad - held promise of an exciting story and grand climax. Unfortunately, the story seems to lose focus early on and limps to an unsatisfactory conclusion, leaving the fate of some of the characters unknown. I enjoyed the main characters, but felt that not enough was really done with them. Most of all, I missed a bigger sense of what was going on in Stalingrad. Granting that the duel between the two protagonists is the real story here, the 'stage' was sketched in with very little sense of the numbers of soldiers and the complexity of daily existence here.Ultimately, I just didn't feel that what I was reading was true. The story seemed pared down for effect, while the conclusion seemed more like a whimper than a bang. I was hoping for much more."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I picked this book up with high hopes; Stalingrad is a personal favorite and new information and reading is always welcomed. I quickly became dismayed. Yes, there are the obvious blunders: the incorrect information about the weapons that any 8th grader could point out, and the dubious decisions by experts--would a master sniper really discard his personal weapon in favor of another that he just got the other day? Such could be forgiven if the rest of the novel: the characters, the dialogue, the sense of place were strong and vibrant. Not so. Sure, the characters are &quot;interesting&quot; with all their quirks and such, but not to a point that I began to care about them. For example, hot sex in a Stalingrad hell-hole is not something I expected, and thankfully the author spares us the grisly details. I just wondered, though, why he bothered to have the characters get it on. Did he think that would deepen my understanding of their plight? Of their humanity? It just felt liked a tacked on sop to readers.Sure, parts of the book were entertaining, but I was more interested in the subject than the characters and what I got was thin soup indeed. Lots and lots of books have much better information on Stalingrad, and lots and lots of books have much better characters and writing."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"For example, the Germans invaded Russia in June not July and to call a Stuka a fighter is really glorifying a rather pathetic airplane."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Hi there ,This book is a good book , thrilling all the way through , except there are some boring parts ( you'll notice them ) but in general its a good book . sure kept me awake a couple of times ..

I felt like I was there."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"What a wonderful read... anyone who loves WWII history should read this book!"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"A friend of mine who is also a social studies teacher like myself high recommended this book. As a fan of historical fiction, a teacher always looking for &quot;readable literature&quot; for the kids, and a student of WWII I highly look forward to reading this book.The book is very readable and will only take a couple of days. The author does a good job describing the total battlefield of Stalingrad while at the same time providing well rounded and interesting characters. As another reviewer stated, the author also does a good job keeping the story human and avoids making the book a technothriller.Bottom line is the book is good but not great. The sniper duel itself is not overly exciting. Its good reading but its not very thrilling at all. Also, I find it very hard to sympathize with any of the German army characters in the book. And this is not limited to Thovald the German supersniper. Yes, the eastern front was horrible. And Yes, not every German soldier was a Nazi. But I still have a tough time reading fiction or non-fiction that gives a German perspective on WWII and feeling bad for them. I felt the same way after watching the German film &quot;Stalingrad&quot; which also looked at the battle. Das Boot is probably the only WWII story that made me feel bad for German military personel during the war.I am amazed that War of the Rats was based on true events and find the story itself intriguing. But I guess I was hoping for something like a WWII Alls Quiet on the Western Front. The book does not do that. This book while entertaining does not leave the reader with much emotional impact. I left Saving Private Ryan emotionally impacted. The recent TNT film of Nuremberg left a deep impression on me. At the end of War of the Rats, I felt like I had killed some good time at the beach.War of the Rats is a book you will enjoy reading but its not one that you will remember."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Having read multiple accounts of Stalingrad, I can say that David Robbins has done his research well. His time in Russia definetly paid off. I wonder what made Mr. Robbins to decide to focus his story on the Russian snipers and not discuss any of the other German snipers? And since this was a novelization of history, it would have been nice to hear what happened to the actual characters. Perhaps Mr. Robbins can add that information as a review to the book here at Amazon?Overall, a good book. Made you feel Stalingrad."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"The book was a good read. It had plenty of action and historical content. It had, however, one major technical flaw that told me I was reading fiction and not history.

The ending was too abrupt. But, overall I admit I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"The book was a good read. It had plenty of action and historical content.

It is an excellent way to learn about the greatest battle of the 20th century. From the first page onwards, I couldn't tear myself away from it. The writing is crisp, and Robbins balances technical information with the human elements of the battle in a way that gripped me from the beginning. The cat and mouse game played by Zaitsev and Thorwald--the Hare and the Headmaster--was almost like a boxing match, with fortunes changing from round to round and from punch to counterpunch. I highly recommend this book.Incidentally, to counter some misinformation in earlier reviews, the Russians certainly refer to their country as the Motherland. In fact the great memorial of the battle at the top of Mamayev Kurgan in Volgagrad is a statue which the Russians call &quot;Motherland.&quot; It is the Germans who refer to their country as the Fatherland. In fact, in this two different views of their respective homelands, one can learn quite a lot about the differences between the Slavic and Nordic cultures.In addition, Robbins was in no way &quot;racist&quot; by coming down on the side of the Russians and against the Germans in the battle. It is difficult to see how he could do otherwise, since, after all, it is Germany that invaded Russia and not the other way around. The Germans hoped to conquer the &quot;inferior&quot; Slavs and turn them into slaves for their &quot;master race.&quot; The Germans found out the hard way that the Russians weren't so &quot;inferior&quot; after all. In their amazing victory at Stalingrad, the Russians gave the Germans exactly what they deserved."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I thought the author did a wonderful job of turning an event involving millions of men and women to something that revolved around only two men. He did a great job personalizing the war from a different point of view."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"War of the Rats is a surprising and wonderful treat. Surprising because it goes far beyond the usual prose seen in this genre. There isn't a sentence in the book that doesn't in some way move the story forward. Also, character development is of a caliber that can hold it's own anywhere. If you're an intuitive reader who prefers a well crafted, \`you are there' sense of what propels the action as opposed to ninety nine odd pages of technical attachments then you will find War of the Rats a rewarding surprise. This novel is a pleasure to experience and perhaps one of the best books I can remember reading in a long time. Love it or hate it one thing is obvious David L. Robbins is here to stay."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"A great and superb account of the horrors of Stalingrad. Gives a compeling, and exciting story, while at the same time Robbins gives great information and detail on the battle of Stalingrad and the conditions. Definitly a must read for people who love war novels."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"David L. Robbins novel, 'The War of the Rats,' is a horror-filled look at the demise of the German Sixth Army at Stalingrad, and the legendary sniper duel that took place amid so much destruction. The narrative presents the Russian super-sniper, Zatsiev, as the protagonist and the German, Thorvald, as the less-than-dynamic villian who challenge each other through the crosshairs as two mighty armies clash along the Volga river. The Russian Zatsiev is made a hero in communist newspapers throughout the Soviet Union when he proves the greatest sniper in the Red army. To bring down Soviet moral the German command decides to send Thorvald, the leader of Germany's elite sniper school at Gnossen, to beat Zatsiev at his own game. What happens next is an exciting battle of skill between the two warriors. While at times the story slows down, Robbins' treatment of the hardships of the largest battle of World War Two are brought amazingly to life. The reader can't help but pity the common soldiers of both armies as they are needlessly sacrificed by their respective governments. A first rate thriller, 'The War of the Rats,' is must reading for fans of great military fiction, (the story is a novelization of actual events.) Wonderful!"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"If you're the sort who likes not just action and history but great character development, this is the novel for you. I couldn't put it down. The stories of Zaitsev, Throvald, Tania and Nikki intertwine so remarkably, not just in the historical battle but the way Robbins does it, intertwining their timeframes, fates, emotions, even their thoughts. Tough to pull off, but really rewarding and vivid for the reader. I also understand there's a movie being made from this story, starring Joseph Fiennes, Ed Harris and Jude Law. I can't wait to see Stalingrad and these characters on film. I hope the producers do half the job Robbins did on paper.

Overall some of the research seems questionable. One clarification to some of the earlier reviews. The soon to be released Paramount movie &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; is not based upon this book but upon the historical events. I am actually more excited about the soon-to-be published novel &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; that provides a more comprehensive account of these events. Some of the early hubub indicates that this work was much more thoroughly researched and hence provides and more exciting and realistic account of the events. War of the Rats just seemed a little too rushed and didnt really give you a good feel for the ultimate outcome of the Stalingrad campaign."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I am somewhat amazed that readers failed to notice the mistakes the author has made. A few are just signs that the book has not been carefully read by an editor: the Stukas were not fighters, but divebombers; the SS did not wear brown shirts, but black ones; (has Robbins seen a war movie?) a Soviet soldier would hardly call an officer &quot;Sir&quot;, rather &quot;comrade colonel/lieutenant/...&quot;.These are minor mistakes, but one does not have to be a history buff to notice them.However, the tale of the Russian girl is pure fantasy. Let me recall what she does:- she lives in the US, and before World War II REGULARLY visits her grandparents in the Soviet Union.- She is deeply sympathetic to communism, and despises her parents in the US who are not.These years were about 1938, when a few million Soviet citizens were deported to the Gulag, and practically EVERY Soviet citizens' family was touched by the purges: someone was deported, or at least arrested, and interrogated. One could hardly &quot;visit&quot; Russia, and fail to notice this, even if Western visitors were as free to come and go, as Tania.After all this, on one of her leisurely journeys, she invites her grandparents to join her in the US, but they reject the offer, since &quot;they feel like their duty is to remain in Russia&quot;! (I don't remember the exact words, but they DECIDE to stay there)According to this, emigration to the US was a matter of personal preferences in Stalin's Soviet Union!Has the author ever bothered to read a history book about the Soviet Union (other than about the Stalingrad battle, which he probably had to..)?This said, the book was OK to kill a few hours on the airplane. Just this level of silliness was getting too much..."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I would like to take this opportunity to revise my previous review of this book. My only proplem with this book is that the Author claims that it is based on an actual sniper duel between Zaitsev and Thorvald, when in all actuality the supposed duel NEVER HAPPENED! It was nothing but a Soviet hoax invented for propaganda purposes. Many reports have different names for the German; Thorvald, Thorwald, Konings to name a few. When in fact no such super sniper existed. There was no SS sniper at Stalingrad, check the records. I challenge the Author to prove his claim."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I am absolutely livid at the fools and gun freaks who think this book is just for them, just about snipers. It's not! You can't possibly read this fantastic, powerful and insightful novel and come out of it disappointed that the author did or did not get some miniscule detail about long distance shooting correct. Hear me, people, it is UNIMPORTANT! War Of The Rats describes so much more about the human condition, the misery of war, and the tragedy of loss, that the morons and rifle fanatics who've given it less than stellar reviews should take another look at themselves if they were immune to this marvelously crafted story. Robbins made me cry over the fate of Stalingrad, for both the German and Russian soldiers. He taught me more about the history of the battle for Stalingrad than I ever believed I would know or care about. This book has history, love, war, magnificently drawn characters: for Heaven's sake, what more do you want in a novel? I'm sorry if I sound overly defensive about this book but I'm so tired of the dumbing down in our nation's literature that, when a really great novel like this comes along, to see it torn down by some of these readers has made me edgy. Ignore them, Mr. Robbins. You wrote a beautiful book, a well-researched one by all standards, and a classic that will surely outlast the nay-saying brain deads who didn't get what you were aiming at. I did. Bullseye! I await your next books."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"If you know anything more about WW2 other than that it happened in the 20th century you should stay away from this book.It may seem ok for a few pages then starts to be more and more annoying with every scene. To give but one example, two russian and german groups are stuck in a building, in two different halls and the separating doors are locked. What to do? They both decide to dig a tunnel (!) underneath the room to the other side to blow up the enemy, and both start singing to cover the digging noise. \\"Frightful\\" suspense follows, until an explosion is heard in the night, and shortly afterwards, a russian song. I bet the author thought he came up with a masterpiece of suspense.Simply ridiculous. Stay away."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"War of the rats certainly has a promising idea -- a personal sniper battle in the middle of the greatest and most destructive battle in human history -- Stalingrad. But the premise is undone by poor writing.Other reviewers have already pointed out the author's mistakes about guns. There are other mistakes that come to mind -- for instance, a Russian refers to Russia as his Motherland (its Fatherland in Russia).Changing the real-life Russian Tania into an American strains credulity to the utmost. I suppose Robbins did this to appeal to American readers, but its a wasted effort, since the character isn't really &quot;American&quot; in any way. The very first time she opened her mouth, Russians should know from her accent that she's American. Okay, maybe she had developed a Russian accent, but that should have been mentioned.The story also has soldiers cracking jokes at Stalin in a few places. Admittedly, internal repression had been reduced a little in WW-II, but it still strikes me as unrealistic that soldiers would crack jokes at so ruthless a dictator as Stalin -- someone who had purged the army several times.The final confrontation between the snipers is a little anti-climactic. I realize that Robbins wanted to stay true to the real story here, but this is one case where some literary license should have been used to make the story more exciting."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"War of the Rats is a novel of the epic battle of Stalingrad during World War II. The movie Enemy at the Gates is based in part on this book. I'm a graduate student in history and before reading this book I spent the better part of a semester researching and writing about the failure of the Nazi's at Stalingrad. As such I became very well aquainted with the battle. I found War of the Rats to be an extremely compelling book and overall an accurate one. The dual between Zaitsev and Thorvald while being the central focus of the book was not really the focus because the story was about people, the soldiers role in the battle. I found the final confrontation between Zaitsev and Thorvald to be a little anti-climactic and abbreviated but then again a well aimed bullet takes no time to kill someone. This is a compelling book and serves to introduce the reader to a place far from the shores of Normandy where many more people died to stop the Nazis."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"When I got this book at the book store I wanted to learn about Stalingrad, and after reading it I was amazed at how much I learned and how much fun I had reading it.

It doesn't work that well, for several reasons.First, what is happening beyond those few characters is largely ignored. There's information at the beginning, and a rapid windup at the end. In between, far too little about the larger battle taking place for the city.Second, the characters are too one dimensional. The Soviet sniper is painted with an heroic brush and does no evil. The Nazi sniper has little to redeem him. In fact, the Nazi is called a butcher for his many killings, while the Red's many killings are seen in a favorable light.Third, the story drags all to often as Robbins plays amateur psychologist, describing a character's ruminations as though they give great insight into the person. They don't.I was entertained, and to a degree informed, by this book. However, I found it easy to put down when I'd had enough--not the gripping tale others have experienced--and I skipped lots of the draggy internal-thoughts sections to try keeping up with the action."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"One of the better historical fiction novels I have ever read. Mr. Robbins places the reader in the middle of the action in the Battle of Stalingrad. In this novel, a master Russian sniper, Zaitsez, nicknamed the \\"Hare\\" due to his slight frame and quickness, becomes a hero among the Russians because of his dexterity with long range rifles. The German government has become aware of the \\"Hare\\" and decides that killing him will help destroy morale among the Russian troops and give their army a bit more momentum. They decide to bring in a \\"schoolmaster\\" who trains young German soldiers to be snipers. He's also got better shooting range than does the \\"Hare\\" and enlists Nikki, a bright young German soldier to accompnay him the field.What's interesting is that an arrogant General by the name of Nikita Kruschev makes an appearance to award the \\"Hare\\" with a medal of courage for his efforts in the war.Reading the final 150 pages was like watching an intense chess match. Robbins has scored big with this one and I am looking forward to reading more books by him."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"The inaccuracies in &quot;War of the Rats&quot; ruined it for this reader. It's a question of credibility. Even with fiction, I like to get accurate information--especially in novels that are supposed to be based on real events. If so much is sloppily researched, it's hard to take the book or author seriously. As has been pointed out before, Robbins' firearms descriptions are not accurate. The female protagonist was based on a real person--but the real person was Russian not American. Even small facts that most people should know, are off. E.G. Mr. Robbins' reference to one of his snipers taking top honors in his village's turkey shoot makes me wonder why Mr. Robbins doesn't know there could be no turkeys at that time in that place! The writing is tedious, and the love scenes so poorly written one wonders if this topic also begs for better research by the author!"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This novel by Mr. Robbins has many faces, some of them good but most of them below average. First of all you have to remember that this story is based on a Russian legend, in which only the Russian sniper Zaitsev is genuine. It seems that there has never been a Thorvald enlisted in the SS. See also : http://users.pandora.be/stalingrad/snipers.htmlThis novel has a great feeling of &quot;i read that before/I saw that before&quot;. If you have read many books on ww2 then you find many facts in this back, apparently the author has done a lot of reading and picked his facts for this book. The prefered way of killing by Thorvald comes straight out of 'private ryan', in which an American sniper kills a German sniper by shooting through his rifle's scope. The novel is flawed by the lovestory of Zaitsev and Tania, an American girl with Russian parents. This lovestory constantly diverts the reader from the real and adds nothing of value to the novel. In my view the girls' nationality is meant to make the novel more acceptable to the novice American reader. The nucleus of this novel, the sniper duel, is somewhat neglected and as a climax very disappointing. The result is always clear and there's no suspense or surprise at all. The personalities are very one-dimensional. Thorvald is the bad Nazi, arrogant and brutal, a killing machine only. Zaitsev and all the Russians are the good, poor Russian farmers, forced to kill Germans because of the invasion of Mother Russia. Not a mention that many Russians welcomed the Germans at first as liberators of the communist oppression. And who is responsible for killing more people: Nazi-Germany or Communist-Russia? In this respect the book is like a bad Cowboy v. Indian movie!The novels best assest is that it gives you an insight in the role of a sniper during the battle of Stalingrad. And it refreshes many little facts that you once read a long time ago.Because of all these shortcomings the book failed to grip me and as a result it took me several months the read it. If you want to read a book about a sniper's mission, read Forsyth's Day of the Jackal. If you want to read about Stalingrad, read Beevor's Stalingrad, the fateful siege. If you want to read about a soldiers live in ww2, read Sayer's The forgotten soldier. If you want to read a book that's very predictable and reads like many other books, then go for this novel. But only if you have nothing better to read/do!!!"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"The positive hype surrounding this book truly puzzles me. Being a WWII buff, I am utterly at a loss as to why this book was so raved about. True, the topic of a sniper duel loosely based on a true story set in the backdrop of Stalingrad is fresh stuff, and most Americans have little appreciation of the degree of sacrifice (20 million people) that Russia made in her titanic struggle against Fascist Germany, but all that didn't take away the fact that this was a badly written book. The story is fragmented and uneven in its perspective between Russian and German points of view, and the romance and gratuitous sex episodes between Zaitsev and Chernova totally detract from any tension and suspense it purportedly had (I didn't find any, since it took me over 3 weeks to finish this yawner). Nowhere does this book come close to capturing the sheer drama that was Stalingrad, and the dramatis personnae all ring hollow. I find it difficult to sympathize with Zaitsev, Chernova, the Colonel or even Nikki Mond, as I did Xeones, Alexandros, Dienekes, Polynikes and Leonidas in Steven Pressfield's masterpiece &quot;Gates of Fire.&quot; If you want to read quality books on Stalingrad, my suggestion is William Craig's original &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; or Anthony Beevor's more recent &quot;Stalingrad&quot; instead."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I have heard of this book over the years and thought it would be a good read. Having read a lot about Stalingrad and the monumental struggle for the city, I thought this would be great. I am sure the story is fine but it did not fit in with what I believe to be true about the battle. I recommend some sniper biographys instead.Doug, Virginia"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I read this when it first came out in 2000. It was an excellent read then and has lost nothing. Many of us have read the historical accounts of the massive Soviet counter-offensive on November 19,1942 and the encirclement of the 6th Army.Mr. Robbins doe an excellent job in describing not only the supposed duel between Zaitsez and Thorvald (which is still being debated by historians) but his ability to paint the picture of a city ravaged by the opposing forces is phenomenal. He puts you in the heart of the dieing city. Can you imagine the closets metropolitan town in your vicinity being decimated to hulks of sagging I-beams, burning timbers and crumbled concrete structures. Yes, it is worse than the current destruction we witnessed in Joplin, Mi and Tuscaloosa,Ala (all weather related).This book, like the movie Stalingrad traverses every human emotion imaginable. The fortitude of the Russians to fight for the Rodina, not for political ideology but for themselves and the thousands of Russians caught in the grips of the Nazi war machine. He also paints a vivid description of the invaders. The arrogance has been left far behind. Stalingrad is a war unto itself. The once proud Wehrmacht is faced in a titanic struggle for what? Will the battle bring them victory or will is be just another conquered city along with thousands of others? Will the war end or will it continue to drag on taking with it tens of thousands other lives?Only one way to find out. Get a copy and start the journey to victory or utter defeat."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Robbins writes in his forward that the events depicted were actual but he takes liberties in filling in the interstitial details. Unfortunately 95% of the book consists of his own imaginary story and reads like a bad soap opera.One would think that in writing a book about snipers the author would at least do a little research regarding sniper shooting technique. It is clear to me and any other former Marine that the author (a lawyer) hasn't a clue in this regard. He describes a sniper &quot;slowing her breathing&quot; while firing!!! To shoot accurately it is necessary to HOLD your breath and get the shot off within 2-5 seconds. This book is exactly what I would expect of a lawyer with no military experience trying to write a book about sniper combat. He is simply unaware of his lack of knowlege. The title should have been &quot;Stalingrad, a Politically Correct Love Story&quot;."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I enjoy historical fiction, but this book was barely tolerable. I'm not a gun/sniper freak, so the inaccuracies in that area didn't bother me.The cliches, bland description, and unoriginal characters killed the novel. Love in war is fine (See Wouk's War and Remembrance)-- but not under these circumstances."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book failed me on two levels, technical accuracy and character development.The characters were caricatures. The Russians were all noble warriors and patriots. The Germans were all either pathetic victims or selfish, arrogant aristocrats.The technical gaffes were enormous. I know some of the other people who commented on this book are dismissing these complaints as &quot;picky and picayune,&quot; but when an author makes mistakes of this magnitude about something so central to the story, I feel my willing suspension of disbelief drying up and blowing away. Nothing else the author has to say about the era or situation can be trusted either. It means that all of the hype about being &quot;terribly authentic&quot; and &quot;the accuracy of his military detail&quot; is obviously just that, hype. To put it in perspective, if you were reading an &quot;authentic&quot; story where the protagonists are highly-skilled drivers of automobiles, how would you react if the author confused motorcycles with cars or dismissed a model of car because its &quot;afterburners can fail in cold weather?&quot;"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Once you purchase this you won't be able to put it down. This is so much better than the movie. It goes into so much detail about the two men....and how they tried to get eachother. The ending is great (so much better than the movie). Also, you can really see what Stalingrad was like. Be warned, there are a few scenes of high despiration in this book. I would advise all to read this."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book really gives some insight on what life what like during the battle for Stalingrad, albeit mostly from a Russian/sniper point of view. I didn't read it for technical accuracy. They have gun magazines and pamphlets for that. The one thing I found disappointing was that the author leaves you hanging as to the fate of the surviving main characters. I read somewhere else that Zaitsev was later blinded by a land mine."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I could not put this book down towards the end. I really enjoy a book when you learn about the hardships people went through on both sides. You get the sense of how psychological the war was and is. The sniper deul was not only a battle on the field but a battle of the minds as well."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I knew about Nazism, but I had never really considered the enormity of the war as fought between the Germans and Russians. Their conflict was exhausting, raking, bitter and terrible. Though the novel was almost too painful to read at times, I endured to the end of War Of The Rats because it is the telling of a tale that happened. Thank goodness for the love story and the personal touches in the novel which Robbins handled so well. I also felt keenly what a cold and inhospitable landscape Stalingrad must have been. At some points I felt like I was personaly having to trudge through it myself. I recommend War Of The Rats to anyone with a yen for historical fiction. This is it, of the highest caliber."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Weapons-savvy readers may snipe at the technical side of this novel, but they should forge on anyway. It's eloquent homage to the Russian fighting man (and woman) who endured and finally prevailed over the most professional army of modern times. Heroism is a story that always deserves retelling."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"If you want to read a gripping romance and true-life adventure story I highly recommend David L. Robbins' War of the Rats. It stuns yet richly entertains in its detailed retelling of one of the grisliest battles of WWII: Stalingrad. We in the USA cannot imagine the horror of being locked in combat for months within the boundaries of one of our cities but the Russians lived it in Stalingrad. David Robbins tells the story as it must have been lived, with desperation, richness, horror, hope and hopeless despair. It is still unimaginable. But War of the Rats makes it visible in the mind's eye and thereby teaches the terrible lessons of war with fresh urgency. It takes skill to tell a story well enough to keep the reader interested when the ending is known. David Robbins has sufficient skill and more."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Reading through the recent reviews of this book highlights the weakness of this sort of review system. I have seen claims that War of the Rats is 95% inaccurate, complaints about the english spellings of Russian names, suggestions that the names of the sniper teams were too cutesy to be real, and so on and so on.Having accompanied the author on one of his research trips to Stalingrad, and having been one of the very few in the west who was lucky enough to read the english-language translation of Zaitsev's own book on the battle (done privately for the author, and not otherwise available in English), I can definitively state that 95% of the events depicted in this book are indeed true, right down to most of the seemingly improbable details that draw so many reader complaints.Perhaps if the reviewers had to state their qualifications along with their reviews we would be able to focus the review process more on the artistic merits of the book, rather than allowing this to become a forum for tiresome and pompous skepticism about all the little things that in the end mean virtually nothing in the context of a truly great book."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book is an interesting novel that dwells about the individual struggle of two human beings,a german and a russian sniper, with totally different motivations and upbringing, against the background of an immense tragedy: the Battle of Stalingrad. For the general public, I would recommend it. However,the historical background is not accurate. The russian sniper's name (Zaitsev)should have been left out, because the man really was there, but using other weapons and doing other things."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Not unexpected, but this book was a far better re-telling of the siege of Stalingrad than the movie. I would recommend skipping the movie and reading this and A Grandfather's Tale. If you enjoy sniper related operations and first hand accounts of battle, this book is for you. You can almost feel the cold and taste the soot that blankets Stalingrad during those fateful months in 1942. A compelling picture of the terror of war."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book is mainly about a Soviet sniper who is basicly the best in the Red Army at Stalingrad (Volgograd). A German Sniper is sent from Berlin to kill him. This is the book of their duel. When I bought this book, I thought I would see mopre of the action at Stalingrad. Not just sniping. Sniping and some small raids is all you will see. That is why i took off 1 star. Other then that, the tale is told beautifuly. Although, the former Red Army claims it is a true story, ( They hung Zeitzv's rifle in Red Square), there is no record of the German Sniper, Heinz Thorvald, or his assiatant, Nikki Mond. I thought the addition of the character Tania Chernova was good, rather then bad, like many reviewers here say. She added emotion to the story, which is always needed in war books.Soviet propeganda, or true story? Since the breakup of the USSR, records were lost from the Battle. Overall I give this book 4 stars for its story, excitement, and its ending."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"David L.Robbins thrilling \\"The War of the Rats\\" tells of the battle for Stalingrad through the eyes of expert snipers whose task it is to pick off Nazi officers at distances where the officers think they are safe.

There's a movie \\"The Enemy at the Gates\\" recently filmed in what was East Germany about the snipers at Stalingrad. Skip it.

There, in a cauldron of ruin, mayhem and death, the Russian Army defeated the German Army and turned the tide of World War Two.In the midst of this battle that claimed over one million lives, there is the true story of two master snipers - Russian Chief Master Sergeant Vasily Zaitzev and German SS Colonel Heinz Thorvald - who are assigned to seek out and kill the other.Author David L. Robbins uses this true story and this desolate/desperate setting as the framework of his novel. The result is compelling story that moves fast, fascinates, and skillfully blends fact with fiction.Mr. Robbins distinguishes himself as a storyteller. His writing is neither literary nor florid. It's designed to grasp the reader and carry him or her like a train on a fast track that rolls, rumbles and weaves from page one through to the final scene.You'll never be bored reading a war novel by David L.

I felt cheated when the story matter barely touched on the chaos and terror of the horrendous battles that took place in ,in some cases, a single building. There is such a wealth of potential for the portrayal of the gamut of emotion and human behaviour and I came away with very little feeling for this aspect of the story. I also felt that Mr. Robbins did't do his home work on the fire arms. Being interested in the firearms of this period, I don't think that I have ever read an account that rates the Moisin- Nagant as being more accurate than the 98 Mauser. I have no knowledge of the optical systems."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This was, on the whole, a fine effort -- good in the dramatic sense, revealing and serious in the historical sense, sincere and hard-working, if not perfect, in its stab at authenticity.I thought War of the Rats was as good a war novel as I have read in quite some time. The book conveys a strong sense of the doom and senselessness of war, especially at the end. The duel between the snipers is tense and exciting, but many other parts of the book are actually better -- German soldier Nikki Mond, for example, is a compelling character: Stalingrad through his eyes is truly hell -- not so much so through the eyes of the other characters.The book's weakest aspect is its love story. The writing simply isn't as strong here...too melodramatic, and so on.But no doubt about it -- this is a fine book. I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in history."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This is not the first thriller based on the story.

Not being a war buff, I was drawn to the story by it's compelling characters. Tania, Fedya, Nikki, Thorvald and Zaitsev are so well drawn that you can picture every move they make as they battle their way through the ruins of Stalingrad.

I hope we hear from you again soon!"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book was excellent! I couldn't put it down, and have been faithfully reading it since I bought it. The story really makes you feel the hardships that the soliders faced in the hell that was Stalingrad. It's a literary Saving Private Ryan in that it leaves you shell-shocked. The fact that the story is true only makes it better. Robbins shows that a hunter's true instinct and heart were the tools that these warriors had to hone on the battlefield. Zaitsev is a super-sniper, but Robbins shows that he is also a man who shows honor in his occupation. Thorvald is the opposite, the other side of Zaitsev's coin. He has the skill, but not the heart, of a hunter. An excellent read, and I'll recommend this book to everyone I know."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"A well written and researched book.

Robbin's technique is to relay both side's story during the German invasion by concentrating on a microcosm war between the two most skilled snipers. This is popular history at its best: one is enlightened to the reality of the battle while being seduced by a suspenseful plot and love story hidden within the twisted carnage of war.One telling point Robbins drives at is how the soldiers lost their identity as men and women within the battle. They became rats or mere pawns of their respective leaders ideals. Stalin's refusal to &quot;step back&quot; to the Germans in the city named after him, and Hitler's denial of admitting defeat was surplanted in the soldiers. Eventually, rat instincts won out.You may feel a bit disappointed that the stories were not neatly wrapped up in the end, but neither was the war. In all, War of the Rats will seduce you with its scope and plot and will excite you like a bullet speeding toward your head."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book was a nice easy read, however, the author needs to do some research on the weapons, I really doubt the Germans prefered the Moison-Naigant to the K-98 Mauser.

Anyway its a good book for a long flight."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I found this historical novel interesting enough to both read the hardcover and listen to the unabridged tape version. I did find the novel flawed, though, due to the lack of explanations as the absence of other German ground forces and the Luftwaffe during the critical Hare(Russian)/Headmaster(German SS) sniper duels."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"The people who are touting that Robbins' work belongs next to &quot;All Quiet On The Western Front&quot; and every other great classic of war are much, much closer to the truth than those picky and picayune spirits who carp that he called a rifle a shotgun, or confused up and downhill shooting. The magnitude of research which so clearly went into this novel is so much greater than these minor technical details (which, by the way, have nothing to do with plot or characters). It's laughable to read how anyone could express disappointment with Robbins' effort or meticulousness. Trust me: If you have not read War Of The Rats and you choose not to based on the complaints of a handful of readers who can't see past some misplaced obsession with guns, you're missing out on one of the most powerful portraits of war and humanity ever crafted.

It is truly a great read."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book attempts to chronicle the Stalingrad Urban Legend of the two opposing armies having their champion snipers confronting each other in a death match worthy of a classic epic. Unfortunately, the author, while credibly describing the progress of the Stalingrad campaign as a whole, misses the boat. The author makes some glaring errors regading the snipers arms and equipment and attributes shooting skills to them which would be impossible given the limitations of their weapons and ammunition. To further compound these shortcomings, the author attempts to develop a romance between the chief Red Army sniper and a female protege inside the Red Army salient during the course of the frigid winter battle. I don't think so. What is really lacking here is an understanding of what winter warfare is really like....cold all the time, bone tired all the time, and with one's thoughts geared only to overcoming the misery and doing one's job. Been there done that (Korea DMZ 1970-71. Having said all that...this book is a)Interesting and b)mildly entertaining but c)mediocre.

The result was far short of my hopes. (1) The writer seemed to know little about guns and shooting, which is important in a story when most of the characters are snipers, (2) the description of battle was strangely boring and unmoving [try &quot;the forgotten soldier&quot; or &quot;black hawk down&quot;], (3) the love story was simply silly, (4) making the woman American was pointless and unrealistic and (4) everything was relentlessly pro-Russian. Not worth reading, especially considering the weak writing and excessive cliches."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I was looking forward to reading an interesting book on how the German and Russian Sniper hunted each other in Stalingrad.

I mean, aside from the dialogue apparently being lifted from a book on phonics? Hares and bears, a chorus of &quot;O Tannenbaum&quot; rising over Stalingrad on Christmas, Thorvald and his sandwiches. Gag.David Robbins clearly has no knowledge about war or Russia. But that's irrelevant because he's got no business writing novels at all. With his grace, he ought to be writing manuals for electric powered toothbrushes.A small note, despite the risk of sounding like a Russia dweeb: the diminutive name Vasha does not exist in Russian. The main character's name is Vasily, the diminutive should be Vasya. &quot;Vasha&quot; is the feminine for &quot;your,&quot; as in, &quot;I throw your book in the trash.&quot;I know, I know, it's nitpicking, but imagine if some author had a character named Robert and went through an entire book calling him &quot;Berb.&quot; Sounds a little weird."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"After wandering through 50 or so Reader Reviews[I won't take the time to read all 180],I was struck that no one knows[or at least cares], that a .410 is a shotgun.Aparently,Mr Robbins is not much for blood sports,nor are his Editors.I actually found the book reasonably enjoyable.Unfortunately,an error like the .410&quot;rifle&quot;makes me suspect the author's accuracy for the rest of the Book."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Bad writing and absurd story make this book a waste of time and money. Romance novel pretends to be factual historical storytelling, placing Russian lovers in the highly romantic setting of the Battle for Stalingrad while they single-handedly kill endless scores of Nazis.

The only woman in the book is given the worst lines - &quot;We will kill for you&quot; she tells her lover as she grips his hand. Casualty figures at front of book differ from figures at end.

Dreadful."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This is an excellent novel and I look forward to Robbins' future efforts. One of the most interesting things about this book is that it is based on actual events and soldiers involved in the Battle of Leningrad; you can find the main characters' names in accounts of the battle. The sniping scenes are on par with those of the Stephen Hunter &quot;Bob the Nailer&quot; books. I guess there's nothing as exciting as having two men aiming at each other, with one going to win and the other going to lose it all."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I bought this book for a couple of reasons. Probably the best reason though is that W.E.B. Griffin gave it a good review. I love Griffin. Well, I didn't get a Griffin book, but I got something just as readable and absorbing. This book pits a Nazi against a Communist. The author allows the reader to choose his hero not based on ideology, but on humanity. Ultimately, this book lets the reader choose good versus evil, not because you have to choose the lesser of the two, but because the author has portrayed war (Stalingrad in particular) as the ultimate evil where essential goodness shines through. In the end, you don't cheer when the good buy wins, but you do feel a sense of hope that man will seek to free himself from senseless violence. All pretentious mumbo-jumbo aside, I must say that this book kicks butt. It is a really gripping story and it keeps you on the edge until the very end. I've heard that this story may be continued. All I can say to that is that I hope I don't have to wait too long!"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I have no idea why the author placed a lengthy interlude in the book where the hero's girlfriend visits a field brothel with a couple of her male comrades. The passage is unintentionally hilarious as well as being a good argument against the presence of women in infantry units."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Until War of the Rats, I thought that Joseph Heywood's &quot;The Berkut&quot; was the best WWII novel that I had ever read. This truly rivals it for sustained action, wonderful characters that the reader really cares about and better still, it's based on real events and people. An outstanding read and a worthy addition to anyone's permanent collection. Get it and enjoy. P.S. If you haven't read &quot;The Berkut&quot; scour the used book stores and WEB site til you find it."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"David L. Robbins uses history as the thread with which he masterfully weaves a seamless, brutal novel about the depravity to which men and women stoop during war. Thankfully, the author avoids burdening the reader with superfluous detail or armchair analyses about the virtue and glory of war -- you'll not find any heroes here. This novel is instead a gutsy, lean to-the-bone depiction of the hell and barbarism that was Stalingrad. In a larger sense &quot;War of the Rats&quot; really exposes the morally barren psyche which blackens the human soul in any war. Mr. Robbins obviously put his heart into writing this book -- the meticulous and time-consuming research gives the novel an honesty all too frequently lacking among other writers of this genre who are merely commercially driven. From its opening pages, &quot;War of the Rats&quot; sucks the reader into the pestilence and devastation of the city, which has been brutally reduced to a &quot;mere&quot; arena where the Soviet army's and the Wehrmacht's top snipers stalk one another while the brutality and death around them become almost anecdotal. Mr. Robbins has earned a membership in that exclusive club of writers such as Eric Maria Remarque (All Quiet on the Western Front), James Webb (Fields of Fire, The Emperor's General), Sven Hassel (Comrades of War), and Hans Helmut Kirst (Night of the Generals)"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book is a great read. Unlike too many other thrillers, it poses tough questions about the human condition. The story is a true one, and it is gripping. It brings the horror and degradation of war to a human level, told, at the participants' level, in the context of one of WWII's seminal events. The last 50 pages both horrify and tear at one's heart. Of all the characters was, Nikki Mond, a good, decent German farm boy sucked into the Wehrmacht, is the most real. His disillusionment with the barbarity of the Nazi government and its SS functionaries illustrates beautifully the victimization of the common soldier for political ends which, once he understand them, he cannot tolerate."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"It takes less than four pages for Robbins to drag you screaming into the cauldron of Stalingrad. The fact that the story involves two past/present enemies of the West does not in the least diminish the compelling story of men and women at war. The characters, drawn from real-life participants in the epic struggle, come to life on the page and hold you to the end. A carefully and beautifully drawn picture. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in history."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Set during the battle for Stalingrad, recreating the atmosphere of this, arguably military turning point of the war, this is a poignant love story within an historical thriller-adventure that rivals Follett, Higgins, Ludlum and McClain at their best, and the equal of the master of sniper fiction, Stephen Hunter. While it may be contested whether the German and Russian master snipers ever really faced each other, it is an historical fact, both were present at the battle and, inexorably, stalked one another. Highly recommended, this book is well researched with on-site inspection of Stalingrad by the author"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"David Robbins' novel of World War II and Stalingrad is a wonderfully imagined work. Based largely upon fact, it relates a gripping story of one of history's most brutal battles. Concentrating on a team of Russian snipers, and a Nazi counter-sniper, Robbins displays a depth of background and understanding that few writers can match. His discriptions of combat and, particularly, sniping, are, as a shooter would say, in the &quot;X' ring. Imaginative writing, plausible yet inventive plotting, believable characters, and adrenaline-pumping action make this book one that souldn't be missed. It's writing of a very high standard."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book is nothing short of amazing. Unlike the majority of other war books I've read, this one is devoid of any and all of that Hollywood garbage. As far as its depictions of the warfare itself that is. Somewhat peculiarly, while the warfare itself is as vivid as it is believable, the characters, and their interactions with one another, could've been taken straight from any stereotypical action movie **cough** tenia **cough**.Also, though I wouldn't want to spoil anything, I will say the ending is climactic, but, overall, somewhat of a letdown.Nitpicking aside though, from an entertainment perspective, if you enjoy war books, you'll definitely like this one."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"For pure entertainment value, &quot;War of the Rats&quot; merits high accolades. It is highly engaging and suspenseful, and the snipers' duel provides compelling narrative. (I agree with previous reviewers who complained about the sexual interludes -- unnecessary, superfluous and wholly unrealistic.)Regardless of whether this duel ever happened (historian Antony Beevor, in his classic history &quot;Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege&quot; says it did not), the book was more than worthwhile."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"As a college student, I studied under Gerhard Weinberg, one of the foremost experts on Nazi Germany. Since then, I have maintained an interest in Nazi Germany, particularly war on the eastern front. I think I've read most every book on the subject of Stalingrad, and I enjoyed this one the best. What made it so appealing to me was that it was set against the backdrop of the battle, but involved individuals, not army groups and generals. In many way the story could have been a classic American western, a Louis L'Amour type novel, yet these characters were historical, and I know from previous reading that the basic facts are true. History is a summary of happenings to individuals. War of the Rats takes history's biggest and most influential battle down to the struggle of a few historical individuals. In doing that, the book is a classic. The best non-fiction work on Stalingrad is Stalingrad, by V.E.Taarant. The best historical fiction work is now War of the Rats."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"As one of the few people lucky enough to have read this book prior to its publication date, I feel that I almost have to add my name to the current list of reviewers who think that it may be a real classic.I was with the author when he researched the book in Stalingrad and elsewhere, and knew the story was fabulous long before the book was written. The raw material was just so strong that it couldn't miss. What I hadn't expected was how well David would integrate the adventure, romance and humor found in one of the bleakest battles in history to create a classic tale that covers all aspects of the human spirit.As a historian, I found the book well researched and worth reading for the understanding it gives of the Battle of Stalingrad alone. But there is so much more. You can't read a single chapter without being drawn to read the next, and you can't find a single character that doesn't stir the imagination. This is a great book, and I'm really proud of what David has done with the basic story he found on his travels to Russia. It is a fitting tribute to all those who fought in Staligrad, and to David Robbins himself as an author."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I was disappointed with this book. At times I felt I was reading two different novels: One a love story during WWII (a poor Danielle Steele) and the second a military duel between the two primary antagonists.I'm not sure why the author decided to stick a love story in this novel. He seemed to be doing fine when he stuck to the military aspects of the story but then that love storyline would rear its ugly head and screw things up. I didn't find it all that difficult to believe some of the lines/thoughts the author attributed to the main combatants during the military confrontations, but the love story angle was just silly.My recommendation: If you're interested in this particular part of history, look for a history book. If you need to read this book, borrow it from a friend or from the library. Finally, if you absolutely need to buy it, purchase the paperback version and save some $."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Fantastic. Mr. Robbins has done a terrific job of inviting the reader along for a thoroughly believable tour of downtown Stalingrad, 1942. The characters quickly become your friends, telling you their horrifying stories of what a terrible waste human combat really is. An astounding amount of research is tightly, seamlessly woven into this great novel.If you're looking for heroics, for characters who feel great accomplishment when they defeat another in battle, go elsewhere. When one causes the death of another, who really wins? If you're looking for a happy ending, stop reading historical war novels. If you're looking for pure history, read non-fiction. But if you're looking for a mental picture of the widespread emotions of war, this book should do it.Fiction is entertainment. I was entertained. This will be extremely hard for the author to top, but I sure hope he tries ;)"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I read quite extensively (mostly classics, scientific and sci-fi/fantasy) and was looking for an intense story with colorful (and not so colorful) depictions of a gritty world filled with gritty people. Instead this book has all the drama of newspaper clipping with half the details. The duel was quick and anti-climatic and the romance was a complete yawner. Actually, it was annoying. The characters were the mere shell of a stereotype.And here I am searching the web for what happened to these two historical figures, these &quot;heroes of Russia&quot; (since the book didn't tell me) and I'm finding nothing. Sigh..."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Robbins does a magnificent job of bringing the utter horror and despair of the Battle of Stalingrad to life. He's apparently done his homework and, despite some minor technical errors, vividly portrays both the macro-level German siege against the stalwart Russian defenders as well as the war-within-the-war between the master Russian and German snipers. Robbins deftly brings us into the minds of his main characters, giving us a good sense of the complex thought processes (often agonizingly conflicted) that soldiers exhibit when put into the dire struggle for survival that was the Battle of Stalingrad.My only complaint was that the ultimate fates of three of his four main characters are left to the imagination. While that would be just fine in most instances, the fact that two of those three characters are real-life historical figures leaves the reader wondering what happened to them after February 1943. One can make assumptions and, perhaps do further research, but an endnote about the actual fates of these characters would have been a more suitable closing for this truly outstanding book."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I am, in the words of previous reviewers, a brain-dead, dumbed-down, moronic, nay-saying NRA nitpicking fool, and as such I feel that criticism of those who found fault with this book on technical grounds is unfair. Of course the book is about more than snipers, and yes, some of the errors have no bearing on the outcome, and yes, the interpersonal drama and the depiction of the futility of the whole situation are quite profound. But, Robbins chose the genre and he chose every word in this book. He included the technical details and jargon to create what were supposed to be very vivid scenes and in order to appeal to those readers with an interest in shooting and military history and tactics. He even cited references and consultants to lend credibility to the details. If the errors are distracting, it's Robbins' fault, not mine.Some reviewers have compared this book to All Quiet on the Western Front. I reread that book after reading War of the Rats and posting a critical and much-criticized review, and the thing that struck me was the lack of technical detail in All Quiet. It's all about the characters, and I think that's what sets these books apart. An author can describe things in general or specific terms. If an author includes fine details, they must be correct, or the book will only truly appeal to those unfamiliar with the details. Had Robbins written, simply, \\"She aimed and fired\\" then those who have aimed and fired can fill in the details based on their experience, and those who have not can use their imaginations and all is well. Robbins, however, chose to go into excruciating (and often erroneous) detail throughout the book, and in so doing, only satisfied those readers unfamiliar with the subject. Those who don't recognize the incongruity in a scene think, \\"Oh, so that's how that happens\\" and move on, while those who do recognize it find the story beginning to unravel.In this case, the subject is rifles and shooting (which I believe adds to the shrillness of some of the book's supporters), but the same would be true if the subject were sailing, horseback riding, geology, Paris, or medicine. Readers familiar with a subject are disappointed when it is presented incorrectly.Incidentally, I avoided the use of semicolons in the foregoing; they were unnecessary."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Quite intense novel and it reads well. It gives a good idea about how bloody and cruel was fighting between Russians and Germans on the Eastern front around Volga River in 1942. Hundreds of thousands soldiers died just because two evil politicians (in this case Hitler and Stalin) set their minds on Stalingrad city and did not want to give up.Maybe there are better books and novels about urban warfare and life in a cities tormented by fighting; I recommend learning about September 1944 Warsaw Upraise. That is why this book was not something extra revealing to me. However, I would still recommend \\"War Of The Rats\\" to the young Americans on continent that was not directly affected by WWII.And finally, descriptions of Russian snipers drinking constantly vodka and aiming with deadly precision are not quite credible to me. The author must be exaggerating one or the other."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This book is a great read. The comparison that comes to mind immediately is Tom Clancy's Patriot Games, but with even tighter plotting and the added bonus of a well-done historical setting. It's been quite a while since I have been so thoroghly sucked in by a book. Mr. Robbins depiction of the decimated Stalingrad is well-done.What makes it more pot-boiler than great historical fiction, though, are two things I think. First off, the writing style is pretty basic. You'll rip through this book in no time, even at almost 500 pages. Secondly, the characters are rather weak. Their contemplation of life and death in Stalingrad is interesting reading, really quite good, but there is no sense of actual character development. And Mr. Robbins pays only lip service to the immense psychological stress of war. All of the characters seem to survive more or less emotionally unscathed, which seems unlikely. While that's OK for the genre this book is part of, it doesn't add to the novel's credibility. My impression of the true violence and bitterness of the struggle in Stalnigrad really isn't represented. Both the Nazis and the Soviets managed to escalate warfare to new levels of savagry; if you want history, read Anthony Beevor's &quot;Stalingrad&quot; (which Mr. Robbins credits in his bibliography) instead.And then there is the ending. I actually didn't have as much of a problem with it some other reviewers had. The odds of survival for everyone, especially the Germans in this particular case, are so long that it didn't bother me especially that the fates of everyone who wasn't outright killed is left tantalizingly vague. By the time you reach the end of the book, you really do have a sense of having come through somthing, that you are a long way from where you started; I think it's reasonable that it the end it is clear that there is still a long way to go and everyone's fate is still quite uncertain.So anyway, while it fails a few of the tests as historical fiction, that's really just somthing to bear in mind as you enjoy the book. As a &quot;historical techno-thriller&quot;, it's really quite well done. If you like WWII history and if you want somthing to keep you rivetted for a few days, while presenting a nice high-level overview of the feel of the battle, this is highly reccomended. If you want real first-person history, try Guy Sajer's The Forgotton Soldier instead."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"War of the RatsDavid L. RobbinsI don't read much fiction, but this is good historical fiction. I have some interest in war and guns, just enough to pursue a book like this, with the details of being a sniper interesting and holding my attention. But my major interest is in this novel as a window into the big picture, how humanity fights and dies. That is the value of novels, for they can (as this one does) reduce these big issues to two men hunting each other in the winter snow, waiting for the one shot which results in the death of the looser.I basically read the book in one sitting, addicted to get to the climax and see whose body it was freezing in the snow. And who won by picking the pockets and claiming the weapon of the looser. That is the judgement of a good book, do you read it greedily? War of the Rats passes this test. The second test is does it help you to think new thoughts, feel new emotions, identify with the characters and learn from the time spent?From the details: shooting through mortar shells, helmet on a brick rather than a stick, shoot then move, to the big items: 1.5 million Germans lost in Stalingrad, 30,000 made it back to Germany from 1948-1954, while 90K died in Soviet Gulags, the book weaves the issues together, forming a coherent and interesting whole. From the German as intellect and his Siberian counterpart as instinctual wolf hunter on the taiga, to the issues of walking dead they just don't know it yet, the book yields lots of paths where you can follow the author's reasonings and have hours of reflection to add to those pleasant hours with your head in this book.I do not really understand why humanity fights. Perhaps that is a lesson only those who have experienced it can really know. But as i reflect on what i learned from these few hours reading i sense that there is this awful imbalance. Of anger and hatred, fear of the other, the willingness to kill with just a thin veneir of civilization, love of neighbor, self-sacrifice to try to hold that evil in bay. From the moment the rage and insanity of war begin, to the walking shells of men dead to the world from their experiences, to the horror the survivors must feel when they see their burned and bombed out homes, the evil has the upper hand. A novel can drive these issues home in a way that history texts can not, for they enable you to try to feel what a character might have felt, to sympathize and identify to the point of being there. And that is the value of the time spent with a book like this, perhaps in some small way, we can see the horror of war and turn from the actuality of it in our real lives. I'd hope so."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Although a good read, the Author neglected to mention that the sniper duel between Zietsev and Konigs was nothing but Soviet propaganda and never happened."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I have to say that this book was at best inconsistent. As long as the author stuck to sniper tactics and actual war &quot;footage&quot; the narrative was quite enjoyable. His attempts at portraying the determination of the Red Army soldiers and civilians to kill the Germans did not measure up. The descriptions seemed to be filled with crude oversimplifications, almost insulting to their memory. The names of the heroes were sometimes misspelled, sometimes misplaced. General Zhukov's name(one of THE key figures of the Red Army) is Konstantin-not Konstatinovich.The names of the non-Russian soldiers were often inappropriate-for example the Georgian didn't sound Georgian etc.In addition- the love scenes-especially the one in the bunker made me shudder with awful,awkward imagery. The scene read like something out of the &quot;the young and the soviet&quot;"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This is not a bad or insulting read but when it ends you find yourself thinking there really should have been a little more depth. Particularly, it is the story of a group of Russian snipers in action during the horrific battle of Stalingrad during World War II, and generally it is about the battle of Stalingrad itself. There is also a significant subplot about a German supersniper who is sent in to kill the ace Russian sniper and their duel with one another.The sniper business is interesting. The author makes us understand that the craft is more about quiet and patient observation than anything else, and that once a kill is made, you retreat and wait for the next opportunity. He knows quite a bit about the guns which were used, their range, the importance of the scope, and concealment on the battlefield. I was disappointed, though, in the resolution of the duel between the two enemy snipers. The author goes to great pains to show us how clever and ruthless these two were, but the conclusion of their cat and mouse game was not particularly surprising or original.And then there is the girl. One of the members of the elite Russian sniper team--and one of the main characters of the book--is not only a female, but an American female. Now I know that the Russians were in a desperate fight for their lives, and I know that many women fought as partisans, but I don't believe there were that many women on the front lines, and I would be astonished to learn that there was even one American woman in the Soviet army at all. Okay, for the sake of dramatic license, I'll concede the point, but only very reluctantly.The author does a pretty good job of setting the scene--possibly the most hopeless, hellish battlefield in the history of warfare--but the ultimate failing here is his inability to develop his characters enough so that we care about them. Yes, we get thumbnail biographies but unfortunately we really don't get a sense of their individual inner natures. This is something that you have to have when you write a novel, and there's just not enough here to distinguish these people from one another. The Russians are all for the most part fearless and solely motivated by their hatred of the Germans--excuse me, Nazis--and the Germans--excuse me, Nazis--are mostly despairing, war weary, and, yes, brave.This is not a bad effort. If the characters were fleshed out more thoroughly and the plot a little more focused, this might have been an outstanding war novel. But as it is, it's not quite there."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"&quot;War of the Rats&quot; proves that one should not judge a book by its title. Initially I had no interest in the book, then someone, who knew of my interest in cultures, told me it was about dueling snipers at the Battle of Stalingrad. With this new frame of reference I found the book riveting, tight, tense, and culturally insightful about the differences between Germans and Russians which are still true today. The ending was weak, flat, and written to justify the misleading title. Too bad: an ending for a book alternatively titled &quot;War of the Snipers&quot; or &quot;War of Wits&quot; would have worked better and been much more gratifying.Josh Hammond, co-author, &quot;The Stuff Americans Are Made Of.&quot;"},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"This was one of the most poorly written books I've read in a quite some time. The characters are poorly developed, and the plotline is constructed on a shifting pile of cliches. Very formulaic and trite. I would not bother reading anything else by this author....."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Although the book came highly recommended, I found that I stalled reading it about half way through. I found the characters to be one-dimensional and the storyline dragged on and on. Maybe it was just me... However, the book Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942 - 1943 by Antony Beevor was all that War of the Rats was not -- fast paced with plenty of insight into the minds of soldiers who fought, and their military leaders. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in WWII military history."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"Despite what some NRA reviewers have said, this novel in not about ballistics, or the inner workings of a gun. It is not about identifying a rifle properly. It is about love, adherence to a calling greater than oneself, and gut-wrenching suspense. And surprisingly for a tale of action, there is poetry scattered throughout.Never have my eyes raced over words as in one of the final chapters, and wished so fervently for a woman to take a good, healthy pee-- an act vital in saving her life. Got your attention, did I? This is only one of many suspense-filled chapters.A final word to the naysayers: stop nitpicking and enjoy--or maybe you'd like to pick apart placement of semicolons? For the uninformed, a semicolon is that symbol identified by a period above and a comma below."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"There are many fine books to buy on Amazon.com, but &quot;War of the Rats&quot; is not one of them. We have far too much racism in our world today --so why fill your mind with more of it by reading this book? The author's bias is clear. This novel depicts Germans as either stupid or evil, strongly implying that the only good German is a dead one. This is an entirely unacceptable concept. The book implies, however, that Russians are noble in each and every case. I agree with those who have said the book is poorly written. It is not just firearms descriptions that are inaccurate. For example, the female protagonist was Russian in the true story upon which the book is based --how ludicrous to make her American in this book! In addition, the sex scenes are laughable. The writing is less in quality than one would expect from such a good publishing house."},{"Title":"War Of The Rats","review":"I was eager to read a fiction book on the pivotal and historically significant WWII battle for Stalingrad. Unfortunately I was deeply disappointed with the book and found myself skimming through the final monotonous chapters.First of all, the characters lack depth and I found it difficult to identify with any of them. This book is certainly no &quot;All Quite on the Western Front&quot; and reads like pulp fiction.Second of all, the heroine of the book, a female Russian sniper, was portrayed in much the same fashion as the women in the 007 James Bond movies - an over sexed nympho who sleeps with half her sniper team. Give me a break. Many Russain women served bravely in the Russian army and in fact several female Russian snipers earned the highest decoration of the Russian military - Hero of The Soviet Union. I think the author's portrayal diminishes the contributions of these woman.Lastly, the book drags on and on and on. The last third of the book featuring the climatic sniper duel between the top German sniper and the top Russian sniper was an utter bore.There is absolutely nothing thought provoking about this novel but if you like pulp fiction maybe this is your kind of book."},{"Title":"Exploring Jazz Scales for Keyboard","review":"I agree with the other review on this book, one thing it must be notice is that this book covers pentatonic and blues scales only, not more than 7 scales, but to point a positive aspect, the examples on the book aren't just on one key, so that you will have to figure out the aplicaation, fingerings and construction of the scales in the rest of the keys. All the keys are developed on charts at the end of each chapter and with sugested tips for it's usage.To say it clear, this is not a bad book, but it may be adquired with a wrong idea of it's content and the way to be used. This is way I belive this should be pointed out, especially when buying on-line. This is more a reference guide than a book, it is all about short examples that ilustrate the charts of chords and the recomended use the autor point out. But this examples and the material presented wont really teach you scales and their aplication. It would give you a theoretical idea(very brief) and the knoledge of the sound that this scales can produce in the context of the exaples studied. This is what the book can offer to be used at: to be aware of the sound of this scales and some tips on how to use them.The rest is more up to you, to figure it out how you can apply this ideas by your own, by experimenting them however you may. Dont expect this book to be a kind of how to or a deep explanated book on the matter. This book wont make a lot for your playing by it's own, but the study of the examples can be a way (maybe a very dificult or discouraging one) for you to start experimenting with pentatonic and blues scales in the jazz context, if you figure out how to beneffit by studying this licks and brief examples and finding ways to apply them."},{"Title":"Exploring Jazz Scales for Keyboard","review":"Boyd's succinct volume offers a thorough, chapter-by-chapter analysis of pentatonic scale usage in jazz solos, intros, and endings. It does not, however, discuss other scales in common use by jazz pianists and other instrumentalists, and this renders the title misleading. This book is negligent of critical areas in the jazz idiom.On some pages, readers will encounter fine-print disclaimers. Pentatonic scales, according to the author, are only a small part of what a true improviser uses in order to create convincing solos. Most people understand this; I don't know why the author ignored other possibilities. Readers need to be aware that if they expect to see how diminished, altered dominant, and modal scales are employed, they won't find guidance here.Another drawback might be its short musical examples. Though tasteful, they are often only eight bars long, usually demonstrating a typical ending or intro. Longer etudes would have added to this work.Every chapter closes with a complete fingering chart for the pentatonic scales presented (right hand only). Some may consider this unnecessary; other jazz piano books, in fact, leave it to the reader to figure out pentatonic fingerings.Perhaps the most valuable asset is its discussion of harmonic context. Every chapter illustrates the type of chords that complement each pentatonic scale. In this regard, the book delivers, offering ideas for exploration.In all, one should think of this as a supplemental volume to other, better realized instructional books. Nevertheless, since it does contain some valuable information and is relatively unexpensive, its vague, misleading title may be forgiven."},{"Title":"A history of the art of war in the sixteenth century,","review":"Let me begin by stating that I am a military history junkie. It isn't my profession, but I have a profession largely to support my military history habit. I bought this book for the simple reason that I knew very little about 16th century military history. That, and I needed a fix. After reading Sir Charles Oman's work, I cannot believe that I made it this far in life without it.To put it bluntly, anyone who claims to know something of modern military history, without a thorough grounding in 16th century warfare, is simply a pretender to knowledge.Sounds harsh? It is not, and please let me explain why. Everything that evolves into the modern military establishment emerges in a recognizable form during the 16th century. It is the military history equivalent of the first fish struggling out of the antediluvian muck onto land and taking that first breath of air.The 16th century bears witness to several critical military developments. The most obvious is the emergence of firepower on the battlefield. Gunpowder was several centuries old by that time, but it remained a rare and expensive siege weapon. In the 16th century, all of that changes. Cannon are lighter, limbered on smaller and more maneuverable carriages. Suddenly, armies have a powerful and portable siege train. In a matter of a few years, every castle in Europe becomes obsolete. Furthermore, cannon, for the first time, can be handled effectively on the battlefield. This spells ultimate doom for the large, unwieldy formations popular in earlier times, such as the Swiss pikemen's phalanx.The new power and portability of artillery forces a radical evolution in fortification. The tall stone walls of the medieval period are now indefensible. Instead, huge, broad and low fortifications, covered by over-lapping fields of fire, become essential. This new style, the \\"trace italienne\\", will dominate warfare until the wars of Frederick the Great. Indeed, one finds combat conditions in heavily fortified regions, such as the Low Countries, that resemble World War One: Interminable battles fought in muddy trenches, where snipers dominate No Man's Land and the grenade and mortar are the weapons of choice.Gunpowder also spurs the rearmament of the infantry. A judicious mix of arqubusiers and pikemen become the favourite mix of battlefield commanders. Interestingly, gunpowder helps to revive the cavalry arm. Long helpless against the Swiss pikeman, German landesknecht and English longbowmen, the mounted soldier regains his effectiveness with the advent of firepower. Artillery now breaks up formerly untouchable infantry formations, making them vulnerable to a cavalry charge. Cavalry also embraces the pistol, giving them firepower in addition to shock value. Gustavus Adolphus, in the next century, actually has to use considerable effort to wean his cavalry off of firepower and its excessive reliance on the caracole.These technological advances require a new level of prefessionalism on the part of soldiers. The professional warrior of the Middle Ages is replaced in the 16th century by the professional soldier of the modern period. In turn, the nation state finds itself required to maintain a standing, professional military. The increasing dissatisfaction of commanders with mercenary troops only accelerates this move to national, professional armies. This process becomes an essential catalyst to the birth of the modern nation state.As is his wont, Sir Charles tells the story of this historical process with a lively and engaging prose. His explanations of the political factors behind the wars of the period are succinct and immensely informative. With grace, wit and scholarly aplomb, Sir Charles will quickly convince any reader that he was quite mad to have imagined that he would proceed through life without a thorough understanding of the 16th century's military revolution."},{"Title":"A history of the art of war in the sixteenth century,","review":"Sir Charles presents the matter in a pithy and convincing way.If you are interested in the great battles and battlefields of the 16thcentury, and the way armies evolved, you will find this work well worth your time.The rise and reign of the Swiss pikemen, who defied the charge of heavy cavalry withtheir perfect drill and unyielding will, is chronicled with engaging color and satisfyingdetail. So, in their turn, are the other principal armies and battles of the era. The generals, the underlying conceits of the armies' organizations, the errors and failures,all are recounted in a concise style that avoids dryness or verbosity.M.Dane"},{"Title":"A history of the art of war in the sixteenth century,","review":"Charles Oman's book is an excellent resource for learning about the history of the period from the military point of view, but, having been written over six decades ago, the book shows signs of its age by (naturally) failing to take into account what historians have learned about the subject since its writing. This leaves the book as valuable, yet not one you can entirely trust. Unfortunately, Oman also fails to add go into developments in Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Empire."},{"Title":"A history of the art of war in the sixteenth century,","review":"This is a magnificent work - both scholarly and easy to read - that focuses on a time that most military historians gloss over. It focuses on the technology and organization of &quot;pike-and-shot&quot; armies of the sixteenth century (1500-1600)with detailed sections on the Italian wars, England, the Wars of Religion in France, the Dutch revolt against Spain, and the struggle in the East against the Turkish Empire. The only failing of this book is the combination of great length (770 pages) and an index of people and place names only; if you look for something more nebulous like &quot;fortifications&quot; in the index you will be disappointed. Put it by your bed or on the medicine cabinet and read it in short bites - you'll keep coming back for more."},{"Title":"A history of the art of war in the sixteenth century,","review":"Oman wrote this as a follow-on to his History of the Art of Warin the Middle Ages (q.v.), and gave it his usual opinionated all.Some of it shows its age, now, but nevertheless it's essentialif you're studying either the sixteenth century in general orthe rise of modern warfare.I get particular pleasure out of Oman's digs at his sources;despite drawing from him frequently, he really, really doesn'tcare for poor old Blaise de Monluc (which Oman and hiscontemporaries insist on misspelling &quot;Montluc.&quot;) Anyway,buy the book if you're nostalgic for the old-style, &quot;decisive&quot;school of military history, from the pre-Keegan era."},{"Title":"LEWIS CARROLL (ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND, THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS, THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK","review":"I cannot think of a better way to introduce the poetry of Lewis Carroll than this small volume. The selection is excellent and of interest you the young reader. The commentary is quite relevant as are the pictures which accompany it. I find that often now, our young people go all the way through the early grades in school and many of them have never heard of carroll,much less read their poetry. This was the sort of stuff my generation and the generation before it grew up on and cut our teeth on. I do not feel I am any worse for the wear. I am fearful that we are bringing up an entire generation (rightfully or wrong, although I feel it is the later) of young folks who will have no appreciation to this great art form and will miss a lot. This book helps. This entire series helps, as a matter of fact and I certainly recommend you add this one and the others to your library. Actually, it is rather fun reading these with the young folk and then talking about them. Not only do you get to enjoy the work your self and perhaps bring back some great memories, but you have the opportunity to interact with your child or student. It is actually rather surprising what some of the kids come up with. I read these to my grandchildren and to the kids in my classes at school. For the most part, when I really get to discussing the work with them, they enjoy it. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Sex and the Gender Revolution, Volume 1: Heterosexuality and the Third Gender in Enlightenment London (The Chicago Series on Sexuality, History, and Society)","review":"\\"Sex and the Gender Revolution\\" is superb on in its well-argued synthesis of voluminous archival sources.The posted review from \\"Booklist\\" ***mistakenly*** assumes that Professor Trumbach fails to perform a synthesis of the evidence in this dazzlingly authoritative book.I don't know how anyone in their right mind could come to such a conclusion after seriously and carefully reading this book. (The word \\"careful\\" will come up again in my review as I believe this is what is lacking in many people's examination of deep scholarship such as this book.)The \\"Booklist\\" reviewer also makes a curious claim about empiricism. Ha! In an age where newer modes of scholarship about gender and sexuality often retreats into theoretical claims without firsthand evidence and primary sources; in an age of where these newer modes are often more about polemics than syntheses of specific evidence, we surely need Professor Trumbach's (I do not know him) far-reaching arguments *about* his evidence.This book is the first in a series that treats the same topic: that is, the furious cross-institutional resistance to rising compulsory heterosexuality in 18th century (etc.) London--a resistance informed by previous bouts of sexual diversity among men, women, young boys, and so forth; a resistance contested by even more rising male dominance and violence towards women.May I suggest that the definitive review of this book is Deborah Valenze's careful discussion in the Winter 2000 edition of the Journal of Social History.A careful and generous reader will realize right away the extreme value of Professor Trumbach's excavation for generations to come."},{"Title":"Sex and the Gender Revolution, Volume 1: Heterosexuality and the Third Gender in Enlightenment London (The Chicago Series on Sexuality, History, and Society)","review":"Well composed, contraversial and smart, Trumbach is a brilliant man and professor! - Garcia Baruch College"},{"Title":"Stung (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force #5)","review":"Hi my name is Jessica and the Left Behind series is a detailed fiction story based loosely based on what the Bible says about the Apoxalipse(?)

Reading it today for about 30 minutes, I must say that this piece is the worst publication I have ever laid my hands on. The contents of this book are 60% listings of factory TSBs. No, not even the long detailed version, just the short listing version... 60% of the book are totally worthless and wasted paper.Now, for the first part of the book. It deals with the various C4 models, changes from year to year and some information on how the C4 was incepted. BUT!!! much of the info is rudimentary or superficial. Some incomplete. The Corvette Buyers Guide and the Corvette Black Book have much more info and detail than this book and they are both much cheaper.The entire book looks like someone printed it on his home printer in th basement and copied the pages.

For perspective, here is what Corvette Fever said in November 2001 in a review on page 65: &quot;Of particular interest for C4 owners would be the Performance section&quot;, and &quot;Over half the book is committed to service bulletins designated by year [which]can help someone searching for a c4 by letting them know some problem areas and what years were affected.&quot; In their October 2003 issue, Corvette Fever lists the book as &quot;mandatory&quot; for a c4 enthusiast's library (page 25). In April 2002, Vette Magazine had a full page review on page 72. Read it and then decide if the book is worthwhile. For instance, Vette Magazine says: &quot;The listing of error codes and service bulletins alone make the C4 Corvette Sourcebook...worth the price.&quot; And, about chapter 2; 'Buying your Dream Car', &quot;...a pretty comprehensive guide to checking out a used Corvette...Loughmiller covers just about all the bases.&quot; So, whose review do you trust?

Its written from the point of view of the hunters, a different one for each section. The book does not have any game mechanics, its pure story. It begins with a few tips for novice hunters, something you should get your players to read through. Then it goes on to describe each continent. It spends a lot of time discussing the world outside of North America, so if your planning on running a game in a different country then this is the book for you. I liked the fact that since the information is given out by hunters, it is full of various facts that are completely not true, so your players can read through the book and still not have any of the real information.

The prairie evokes nostalgic feelings for the west and the settling of our nation. In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in preserving prairies, understanding prairie biology, and even in making prairie parks for people to visit. Konza Prairie is located in the Flint Hills of Kansas, some of the best remaining native tallgrass prairie in the nation. Dr. Reichman tells the story of Konza Prairie, and prairies in general, in interesting detail for both the novice and the serious biologist.

However, the book does provide an exhaustive and good theorist's view of sexual harassment -- which is good if in fact that is what you are looking to read. My interest were more aligned with the victim's perspective and thus more interested in a practitioner (vice) theorist view of: (1) victim experience(s); and (2) detailed harasser profile. One thing I have found that this book lacked as well as several others is that most assume that the female/victim is the subordinate and that the harasser is the &quot;supervisor.&quot; The (3) key issues in subsequent investigations are an examination of the: (1) advance, (2)response and (3) employment consequence -- where the female/victim does not necessarily have to be the subordinate. Believe this book and others should address this issue in greater detail."},{"Title":"Norwegian grammar and reader: With notes and vocabulary","review":"As noted by the publisher in the description, this is a scanned photographic image of the original paper book. Because of this, text cannot be resized or highlighted in the ways available for normal Kindle books. Although this Kindle edition has a Feb. 2012 publication date, the original book was published in 1898. No editorial changes have been made. This means that although the texts provided in the reader appear to be good examples of the language through the end of the 19th century, they may not be useful for people wishing to learn more modern usage. This edition was disappointing because each page in the original book has been cut in half; rather than presenting the full page in portrait mode, the top and bottom of each page are shown as separate pages, sideways. This is not true landscape mode -- placing your Kindle in landscape mode will result in the text again appearing sideways. The page cuts have been poorly done, often resulting in a line of text shown cut in half at the bottom. Although this does not appear to result in any missing text -- lines that are sliced in half appear to be duplicated in the next image -- it looks like shoddy workmanship by the people who put this Kindle edition together. Since this edition consists of scanned images rather than electronic text, this book is much larger in size, and may not be suitable for devices with limited storage (e.g. Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Keyboard, etc.) Also, since the images appear sideways, it is not suitable for the Mac or PC versions of the Kindle app. Finally, note that this book is in the public domain, and is available as a free ebook from another reliable source elsewhere on the web (starts with Goog...) The publisher of this edition notes that the text has not been OCR'd (i.e., converted from image to electronic text.) However, since a better-formatted version of the scanned text is already available for free elsewhere, the publisher would have created an actual worthwhile product by OCRing the image and editing the electronic text to correct any errors. I returned my copy for a refund. Caveat emptor."},{"Title":"Algorithms for Computer Algebra","review":"I found this book very useful as a reference while writing a small computer algebra system. It's a definate must-have for all the hordes of people out there who are rewriting subsets of Maple, Mathematica, etc. The explanation of the theory is relatively clear and helpful so that a not-so-theory-inclined person (such as myself) can understand the material. The cost of such clarity is a loss of some conciseness so someone who lives and breathes abstract algebra may desire a more esoteric book (like Winkler's). The biggest flaw of the book are the poorly debugged algorithms. Almost every algorithm presented in the book has some sort of minor flaw with serious reprecussions on correctness. This results in much frustration if you're actually trying to implement the algorithms."},{"Title":"Algorithms for Computer Algebra","review":"We used this book in an advanced undergraduate/early graduate class in computer algebra. The book provides a concise and rigorous, but very readable introduction to computational algebra theory, with algorithms written in pseudo code.Assuming proficiency in programming, as further pre-requisite I would suggest an undergraduate course in abstract algebra (or equivalent mathematical maturity) for maximum benefit.An excellent collection of algorithms, proofs, and advanced introductory material, written in a (comparatively) breezy style."},{"Title":"Literature: An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry, and Drama, Compact Edition (4th Edition)","review":"Very educative, not difficult.

Well meaning relatives offer her foods she shouldn't eat, and others don't know that she has some 'nutritional issues,' like Celiac Disease. Our daughter has to know what she can and can't eat, as well as portion control. The DSNH not only has information for me as a parent, but it has worksheets and teaching activities for our daughter to help her learn healthy eating habits and good fitness activities. Did I say that it is a GREAT book? We copy off the worksheets and post them on the fridge, so our daughter can track what she eats during the day to make sure that she has 'hit' at the necessary food groups and water intake goals. She even has her fitness goals for the week.The book covers nutritional information and needs from birth through adulthood. Section three is the one that we are working on right now: Teaching Healthy Choices to Encourage Healthy Lifestyles. It has everything from menu planning, to cooking and fitness.

Her sister, Rachel wants nothing to do with dancing, but she does want Hilary to go to the Royal Ballet School to study proper ballet, as her family and old dance teacher wished for, even though Hilary doesn't want to. So everyone, including their mean and selfish Aunt Cora, believe that Rachel is jealous of Hilary. Meanwhile, Aunt Cora's talented, and conceited, daughter now has competition with Hilary.The book is full of the same charm as her others.

We were not disappointed. Noel Streatfeild is a wonderful author."},{"Title":"Dancing shoes","review":"There are some children's books that were enormously popular at one time, but seem uninspired and one-dimensional compared to much modern children's literature, with its poignant issues and complex characters. Then, there are some older books that possess all the innocence and charm of an earlier era of kid lit, without sacrificing relevance or entertainment value.\\"Dancing Shoes\\" (original title: \\"Wintle's Wonders\\") falls into the latter category. Rachel and Hilary are relatable and engaging characters, despite their flaws (Rachel is sullen and controlling, Hilary lazy). Other characters are created with less subtlety and depth - Cora and Dulcie have no redeeming features whatsoever - but sometimes it's fun to read a nice story in which the heroes and villains are clearly defined, and there is simple pleasure in the end when good comes out with the upper hand.This is a thoroughly predictable novel, but, unlike some tedious tales, is none the worse for turning out exactly the way you expect. Rather, watching the story unfold with quiet gentility is like floating with the current in a gentle stream, taking a ride through your old hometown, or seeing your favorite movie for the tenth time: you know exactly where you're going, you're perfectly comfortable with it, and half the fun is in getting there.This is not a novel about dancing; you don't have to know anything about dance in order to enjoy it, and those dance enthusiasts who pick it up expecting to see their love of dance reinforced and celebrated may find themselves disappointed, in that regard at least; Rachel detests dancing, and Hilary, though talented, has little passion for her art. What this is, is a novel about finding what you love and doing it, letting others be themselves, and releasing an old dream to make way for what the future may hold."},{"Title":"Dancing shoes","review":"Great book from a great series by a great author.

I never finished it then and now as I'm reading it to my 9 y.o. daughter I see why. It is mostly about Rachel hating dancing and the best dancers either being a horrid brat or a girl who just doesn't care. I think this book has turned my daughter more off to dancing than anything. I also find myself just hating Aunt Cora and wincing at everything she says. I only give this 2 stars because it is a compelling read. It is however NOT an inspiration to dance!!"},{"Title":"Dancing shoes","review":"Do you remember when the Meg Ryan character walked into TomHanks' FOX BOOKS store and the customer asked about the&quot;Shoes&quot; books, and a monologue about the wonders of Noel Streatfeild's &quot;Shoes&quot; books ensued, touching on Dancing Shoes, Ballet Shoes, and Skating Shoes, which is absolutely wonderful? That scene made me break down crying, because I had never heard anyone other than myself talk about these terrific books, and the fact that it is tragic that they are mostly out of print and hard to find. This book is a wonderful story of working hard for a goal, and accomplishing it, or at least getting on the road to achieving a reasonable, yet magical, goal.

Or that you did't fit in? Ever had great plans for another's future...that they didn't share? Dancing Shoes is a well-crafted classic, about three girls we can all relate to. Rachel hates dancing, and struggles to find herself in a dancing school. Her sister Hillary is all mirth, and no work. Dulce is their insufferable, spoiled cousin, who meets her deserved fate. An exasperated teacher, a homey nurse, and evil aunt, and a oblivious but gentle hearted uncle round out the cast. Superb all around, sensitively told.

Splendid for children and adults."},{"Title":"Dancing shoes","review":"I've always adored books set in England ... and it started with the Noel Streatfeild books that I devoured as a child. Of all of the Shoes books -- and believe me, twenty years ago I read every single one I could get my hands on -- this is still the best.The two heroines are so likable and yet so different from each other; Rachel is introspective and quiet, Hilary is vivacious and fun-loving. What this means is that every little girl reading it can identify with one or the other. Streatfeild is at her best when it comes the book's character development. Rachel's reaction to her mother's death, and her changing relationship with her sister, are very well-drawn and utterly convincing.Best of all, this book has Dulcie -- the character you love to hate. And every single person gets her comeuppance in the end; the reader's desire for poetic justice is fufilled in a most suprising but totally convincing way. It's a wonderfully satisfying read, and the kind of book that you can read again and again ... even as an adult."},{"Title":"Dancing shoes","review":"How can it be that a book about a dancing school in 1950s London would make such an impression on a klutzy American 12-year old in the late '70s and early '80s? A compelling story and appealing, cleancut prose have made &quot;Dancing Shoes&quot; a staple -- albeit dog-eared -- book in my library for more than 15 years.&quot;Dancing Shoes&quot; started my long &quot;pas de deux&quot; with Noel Streatfeild's &quot;Shoes&quot; series. Streatfeild describes the day-to-day lives of Rachel and Hilary -- two orphans who find unexpectedly themselves living in a stage-training school with their brusque, stage-mama Aunt Cora -- in such a way that the reader can feel the warmth of the footlights and the pinch of their tap shoes. The plight of untalented Rachel among the dancing troupe of Mrs. Wintle's Little Wonders was very true to life, and her triumph over her spoiled cousin at the end of the book gives hope to all little girls who aren't so light on their feet. This and other &quot;Shoes&quot; books will be passed on to my own daughters."},{"Title":"Dancing shoes","review":"I'm glad to see this book, which I loved as a child, still in print. Spoiled Dulcie, comedienne Hilary and sensitive Rachel are entertaining characters. Children will root for Rachel and cheer when Dulcie and Aunt Cora finally get their comeuppance. I picked this book up at a bookstore on a whim and reread it. I do have a few quibbles now that I didn't as a child. Children may be bothered by Uncle Tom's indifference. Uncle Tom is kind, but he is not a good parent. He ignores Dulcie's bad behavior and doesn't stand up for Rachel even though she is miserable. I wondered why he stays with Aunt Cora. Is the money that good? I wanted the adults' back story. It also bothered me that Hilary's adoption by Rachel's parents wasn't treated seriously. The characters talk about how she isn't Rachel's &quot;real sister&quot; and how Tom and Cora didn't have to take her in because she is adopted. Adopted children reading this book might be very bothered by that."},{"Title":"Dancing shoes","review":"Perhaps I have a bit of sentimental bias towards this book. I received it at age 5 to read-- my first-ever \\"chapter\\" book. It took me about six months the first time around, if I recall correctly. I'd just begun dance classes myself, and so the book gave me a sense of a connection to something that I enjoyed doing. Because it was about two young girls that were taken in by their aunt, I also connected it to adoption--something that also was extremely close to home for me, as I am an adopted child.Since that time (in 1980) I've nearly worn my copy out from reading it so many times-- even now, as an adult, I find it to be a fantastic read. I think that it might sound a bit dated at times, but no more so than any of the Beverly Cleary books that are also great for young readers, particularly little girls."},{"Title":"Dancing shoes","review":"I received this book when I was about 8 years old.

Though my copy is now dog eared and I practically know it off by heart, I read it about once ever four months.It is the involved and moving tale of Rachel and Hilary, both ten years old when the book begins. Hilary was adopted by Rachel's parents when they were both four, and has always felt part of the family. She is a promsing ballet dancer (her real mother being one) but is lazy, and doesn't take the work seriously. Rachel, who is serious in everything she does, watches all of Hilary's lessons and keeps her working hard. Their father, a famous film star, died when they were seven. When the book opens, their mother has just died too, leaving them orphans.They are taken to live with Rachel's aunt and uncle, Cora Wintle and Tom Lennox. Aunt Cora, or Mrs. Wintle as she is commonly referred to, runs a stage school for children called Wintle's Wonders. Throughout the book she is mean, oppressive, selfish and cold hearted torwards first Rachel, and then Hilary. Uncle Tom is an artist, and the opposite of Cora. He nurtures Rachel, who feels misunderstood and out of place in a dancing school, and tries his hardest to make things better. Their spoilt cousin Dulcie is a brilliant dancer, and thoroughly conceited. Pursey is the kindly and fat house keeper who becomes their mother figure.'Dancing Shoes' focuses on Rachel's trials and tribulations, mainly trials though, and how she reacts to the situations and characters around her. Everything about it will pull you in and make you feel like you're really living her life. Although at times it is heart breaking, it is suitable for children and adults of all ages. The ending is very fitting, even though it is somewhat bitter sweet. Please, do yourself a favour and buy this for yourself, your daughter, grand daughter, neice, cousin, sister... whatever.

In the prequel (Gamekeeper's Night Dog) Germany is given the designs for a T35, the most effective main battle tank in the real WW II. Unlike the real world Germany, the fictional Germany does not develop mobile war tactics on the battlefields of the Spanish Civil War. It conducts massive war games on a remote North Sea island, operating on a scale equal to the Spanish Civil War, but in secrecy. Therefore the fictional Germany springs a devastating blitzkrieg on the Western Allies that is more effective than [...] blitzkrieg. Why is the fictional Germany smarter than the real one? Answer: General Alfred Graf von Schlieffen. The real Schlieffen was an unparalled military genius. He designed Germany's plan for defeating France in WW I. But he died before the war and his plan was weakened and modified. There is a school of thought that the original Schieffen plan would have delivered victory to Germany. In the World War, the fictional Schlieffen's plan is allowed to come to fruition."},{"Title":"The World War (Gamekeeper Series, Book 2)","review":"To show how much I loved The World War by Dave Putnam, I was not bored as I usually am with long descriptions of military tactics and weaponry. I also hate spiders with a passion, yes I have a phobia and the spider on the cover of the book cover was turned face down when I wasn't reading it. Having said that, it is a great work of alternate history and continues the Gamekeeper Trilogy. Favorite characters like Fred Greystone, David Banner, and others return plus some interesting new ones. The greatest treat for me was the continuing saga of a man I consider the most outstanding leader in the 20th century, Winston Churchill. There are also nice segments on the aging Queen Victoria and many others. The World War begun in the first book is covered in detail, a combination of our two World Wars. There is a creation of a real life and death war game that is supposed to help the human race become less blood thirsty over all and to develop new technology well ahead of its time. Animals again play a major part in this second book. The book, like the first one, is not afraid to make religion and belief in God the focal point. The book plants the seeds for the third book in the series that sees the world faced with the greatest Godless threat of all time, communism. There is also a bow to how leftist Hollywood film companies try to influence elections. I only read other reviews after I have written mine so that I will not be influenced. I was concerned with some snobbery from a reviewer on the first book about the publisher \\"Bulldog Press\\". I will honestly say that threw me a bit myself until I remembered that thanks to the net and other factors, small publishers can now slug it out with the big ones. No longer does an author have to be concerned whether he or she will be loved by the New York Times. Thanks to Amazon, our own reviews carry at least as much weight (I'd like to think more) than reviews in the so called big press, \\"the old media\\". And David Putnam carries a lot of weight gaining equality with Eric Flint and again surpassing Harry Turtledove. As I said in my review of the first book, I wish that this series had been available when I was teaching full time, but after 40 years I am retired. I did use alternate history and government books in my classes and have even had some published myself."},{"Title":"The World War (Gamekeeper Series, Book 2)","review":"This is a great sequel to the excellent \\"Game Keeper's Night Dog\\", and the second in a \\"must read\\" trilogy for science fiction and alternate history enthusiasts. The author makes vivid and imaginative use of historical/industrial characters such as Winston Churchill, Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, the German hero-General Hindenburg, Rudolph Diesel, and Henry Ford - not to mention the emergence of the Zulu race as the world's preeminent aviators. Especially creative - building on the key role of the English Bulldog species of canines in \\"Gamekeepers\\" - is the evolution of intelligent birds, mammals, and anachronids and their mobillization as very new and different weapons of war. This volume concludes with an intriguing \\"new technology\\" battle, staged in the Hawaiian islands."},{"Title":"The World War (Gamekeeper Series, Book 2)","review":"This novel is an alternate history of the second World War, well the two world wars combined. On a purely physical level, the major alteration is the extensive use of trained animals in combat, which, for me, was the most appealing aspect of the novel. Ever since I read about the German World War II tactic of using dogs with land mines strapped to their backs to destroy tanks, I've wondered why Germany didn't upgrade their technology and have the dogs deposit their deadly cargo and live to fight another day, rather than make a suicide charge. Even in its primitive state, the actual tactic was devastatingly effective and had Russian tankers slaughtering dogs wholesale whenever they recaptured a town or village. It was about as effective as the suicide car bombings that occur every day in Iraq. To make the tactic work on a higher level, in The World War, an extensive panoply of new technology is created, which is developed in the first few chapters. Once the combat begins, dogs are outfitted with camouflaged bullet-proof spider-silk war harnesses, the canine mobile land mines (as they are called) are used in battalion-sized numbers and with an extensive operational procedure and doctrine that includes a devastating and total element of surprise. Would something like this have really worked? For me, it was believeable. Heck, that's what alternate histroy is all about, asking the question, What If?"},{"Title":"The World War (Gamekeeper Series, Book 2)","review":"I really enjoyed this work! This novel is an amazing alternate history read. It's much shorter, refined and readable than the author's first novel, The Gamekeeper's Night Dog, albeit the first was quite fascinating. The author's imaginative use of animals outfitted with state-of-the art military equipment and working as an intelligent force is intriguing. More thought-provoking is the analogy of Britain as the world power and its striking similarities with modern day America, including a domineering and war mongering government. I hope the author continues the series and forays into the realm of science fiction."},{"Title":"The World War (Gamekeeper Series, Book 2)","review":"The World War continues the plot line of the Gamekeeper's Night Dog, but in a more refined and credible manner. The characters are more complex and geopolitics becomes more convoluted, and hence more believable. The borderline megalomaniac... Queen Victoria... is one of these more fully fleshed out characters. She takes irreversible steps down a path to world domination that will either result in a one world government centered in London or it will wholly destroy Britain. I think the author is contrasting the inadvertent empire that America is stumbling into today to the conscious and deliberate global hegemony of his fictional Britain one hundred years ago. There is a message in this novel... any anglophone superpower seeking to rule the world had better crave power and be willing to grab it with both hands; either that or don't even try. I give The World War two thumbs up."},{"Title":"The World War (Gamekeeper Series, Book 2)","review":"Dave continues to stand toe-to-toe with Thomas Pynchon--the only writer today that is Dave's peer.

My daughter was about three at the time and I wanted to make sure she had an understanding of the &quot;miracle of childbirth&quot;. This book took away the pressure! Great photographs and a clear and factual explanation of how babies are conceived and develop. I loaned this book out to one of my friends and unfortuantley never got it back. My daughter is now 9 and will still mention how she loved that book and wishes she had it back! This is a must for anyone with a new baby on the way or to handle that tough question of, &quot;Where do babies come from?&quot;!"},{"Title":"How Were You Born","review":"This book is a fun, low-key, high-quality way to introduce kids to the miracles of development and birth. Mine (6 and 7) were less interested in the pictures of actual babies as they were in those of the developing fetuses, and their long looks over each page allowed plenty of time for my narration -- about how much each of them was wanted, about how amazing it is that a real baby can be so tiny, and so on.My daughter seemed a little uncomfortable with one of the pictures, which depicts a woman \\"giving birth\\" -- you do see the side of her hip exposed, in a fairly realistic position, but there's not much more skin visible here than you might see on a beach. I think overall, the pluses here -- especially allowing kids to see the developing fetus as an actual baby -- outweigh any possible drawbacks (the very slight nudity).As \\"facts of life\\" books go, this one is full of fascinating facts, doesn't dodge any tricky issues, and can help instill a much-needed sense of reverence around the whole process.NOTE: There is nothing in this book about how babies get made in the first place. If that's what you're looking for -- and in my case, it was, in part -- you will need other books to cover THAT information."},{"Title":"How Were You Born","review":"Every parent dreads that moment. You know the one I mean- that moment when your child begins to ask about S-E-X. This book is a wonderful aid to help you through it.Most experts suggest only giving as much information as a child is ready for, and answering the questions as they come up. This book is wonderful for the beginning stages of this process when your child wants to know where babies come from, but is neither ready for nor interested in the details of conception. This book has beautiful pictures of babies in utero in various stages of development and gently discusses the development of the fetus, the birth of the baby (in a non-graphic but honest way), and the excitement of welcoming a new life into the world.I bought this for my eight year old, but it is gentle and non-graphic enough that my 3 year old loves it, as well. In fact, I wish I'd had this book when I was pregnant with my younger child. This would be a wonderful book for expectant mothers to share with their older children as they prepare for a new sibling.There are other books out there that will answer more advanced questions in a more graphic way. This book is not going to answer everything, but it is the perfect book to use for beginning the journey of educating your children about reproduction, and it is written in such a way that parents can easily discuss their own beliefs with their children."},{"Title":"How Were You Born","review":"This book focuses mainly on fetal development and childbirth. My 5 year old daughter, who always wants to hear stories about her birth, loved it and kept saying &quot;Wow!&quot; and &quot;Awesome&quot; througout the book. It had beautiful pictures and lots of factual information. It was great!"},{"Title":"How Were You Born","review":"Joanna Cole has done so much for children's literature in her lifetime that it is difficult to speak of noteworthy non-fiction titles for kids without bringing up her name. She's the genius behind the simultaneously fun and factual, \\"Magic School Bus\\" series. She has tackled \\"issue\\" topics, such as children having to deal with more siblings. She's even collected jump rope rhymes, potty trained our youngsters, written comprehensive books full of recommended folktales, and much much more. One of her greatest accomplishments, however, was the creation of the go-to sex-ed book for tots, \\"How You Were Born\\". Though not a perfect source, the book is extraordinarily careful to avoid confusion or factual misinformation. For children too old for such beginning texts as \\"Where Willy Went\\" by Nicholas Allan or \\"Mommy Laid An Egg\\" by Babette Cole, \\"How You Were Born\\" is the most sophisticated and comprehensive of these three. It is also the most reliable.The book begins with a Note to Parents. In this note, Ms. Cole explains that while misunderstandings about birth and conception may seem charming in little children, it doesn't do them a heckuva lot of good in the long run. As an author, Cole urges parents to speak frankly with their children about where babies come from. In her most insightful sentence, Cole reminds parents that, \\"When parents establish this kind of open, caring relationship from an early age, children will have a reliable source of information and guidance to turn to as they grow\\". Be honest early on and reap the dividends when your children get hit by the puberty stick (and require \\"It's Perfectly Normal\\" by Robie H. Harris). Using photographs to convey real-life answers for children, Cole shows what it's like for babies in the womb. She then talks somewhat about the different physical make-up of men and women and mentions that when sperm and egg join together, they create a cell that becomes a baby. There is no discussion of the sexual act itself. We see cells divide, and a 5 week old baby in the process of growing. Moms get large and eventually birth takes place. Badda bing, badda boom.It's interesting to note that while Cole is explicit in explaining some things (she has a photograph of a woman giving birth, thereby leaving NO guessing on that matter) she never once talks about the sexual act itself. In the original 1984 version (but NOT the more recent reissue of the book) we see that men have penises and women have vaginas, but in all the talk of sperm joining with egg.... well, it's left just a touch shaky. When you consider that books like \\"Mommy Laid An Egg\\" have zippo qualms about explaining (nay, showing) the act, it's all the odder that Ms. Cole avoids talking about it.There are several different versions of \\"How You Were Born\\" that you should know about, prior to checking out this title. If you go to your local library to borrow it, you may find yourself with the original 1984 edition. While factually correct, parents may find it especially funny. There are a lot of moustaches, tube socks, and 80's fashions to wade through in this book (not to mention the pencil drawings of men and women circa 1952). If you go out and purchase the updated 1994 edition of \\"How You Were Born\\", you'll have far better photos, but some interesting changes. Gone are the dry pictures of vaginas and penises. The Note to Parents is still there, but it changes words, phrases, and sentence structures around for no particular reason. Instead of children now sometimes worrying that if the baby is in the \\"tummy\\" it will be showered with \\"chunks of pizza or hot coffee\\", now the child is worried that the baby will be showered with \\"chunks of pizza or hot soup\\". Apparently \\"coffee\\" was too violent an image to contend with in 1994. Odd. Other changes abound, but the essential structure of the book is the same and just as useful as it was back in the age of leg warmers and Mary Lou Retton.\\"How You Were Born\\" remains the go-to sex-ed guide for small children today. It's a pity that it remains so lacking in the sexual-act-department, but at least it's chock full of enough educational know-how and professional expertise to guarantee it a permanent spot in every family's home. A wonderful book that should not be relied on solely for this kind of information but rather incorporated with other books of its kind."},{"Title":"How Were You Born","review":"The book provides great pictures about how a fetus grows. There are multiple pictures of interracial couples. Unfortunately, the story line goes beyond the title and makes many assumptions about a family that make it exclusionary. The book was unreadable for our family. Our children are adopted. The book describes how your mommy and daddy prepared for your birth and shows a man and woman setting up a nursery. This was not true of our children's birth family. We do not speak negatively of the birth family but we also don't want to give an inaccurate description. The book is not supposed to be about the living situation of the parents, the makeup of the family, or the preparations they did/did not make. The book hammers hard on mommy AND daddy throughout the text. I think it is difficult for a book to say how YOU were born and provide much accurate information beyond simple biology. That's all I wanted. I was not expecting a fairytale about the family life of the couple that is only applicable to a traditional nuclear family. I loved the photos and the racial diversity in the book. I did not appreciate the narrow family definition and experience that is assumed in the text. For someone with a family that consists of one man and one woman who are both present and made excited preparations for the baby the book would be fine. I was looking for more of a how A baby is born book rather than how YOU were born."},{"Title":"How Were You Born","review":"I got this book when I was pregnant with my 3rd child.

I was not ready to tell my 5 yr old what his penis is for. I found this one and was relieved to find a book that doesnt go that into detail (the other had pictures of \\"the act\\"!!). I sat down with him and my 2 yr old daughter and ready through the book. They were very interested in this. They loved the pictures of the developing babies (and so did I), the text was easy to read, and easy to follow. It explained just what they needed to know at this stage.

Instead of hem-and-hawing about this question when my children ask this one day, I can bust out this book and make them learn something real instead of a metaphor about birds and bees."},{"Title":"How Were You Born","review":"Where do babies come from? One thing I've learned is that you don't need to answer the first time question with a huge, drawn out lecture on biology. That is too much and far more than most kids want/need to hear the first time the question is asked.At my house, the first 'how does the baby come out' question was easily answered with 'you push it out'.Followed by \\"How?\\" -- \\"With special muscles\\".Then, \\"How?\\"-- \\"Really hard\\".With my first kiddo that conversation happened over about 6 months. With my second--over about 5 minutes while standing in line at the grocery store, much to the amusement of the gentleman standing in line behind us.However, eventually you do need to give more information as they are appropriately curious and able to process the answers. To help with the answers, like most things in my life, that meant turning to books (though nowadays I suppose I could look for a good youtube video--or not).This book is absolutely wonderful--there is a nice forward for the parents to read, and then the rest of the book to read together. I would say this is especially nice for the 6-8 year olds. The 9s and 10s midght find the tone a little condescending if you are reading together, but it's fine to leave out for them to look at on their own too. The younger ones may or may not quite get it, but that is child dependent and I would only read it to them if they are actually asking. Just my opinion of course, but that is what this book seems most suited for.In any case, I found the level of description a perfect description of the facts, with appropriate illustrations so it's clear what's going on without being graphic enough to make anyone uncomfortable.Of course, the next talk will be to answer 'how did the egg and sperm get together'. That's another talk, and another book :).HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDJTG"},{"Title":"How Were You Born","review":"We bought this book for my 3 year old when he started asking questions how the new baby was going to be born. I was looking for something that had accurate information and not cutesy cartoons or misinformation (i.e. storks). This book has just the perfect amount of information. It is not overly graphic, but does include real pictures and accurate information.At 3, my son is drawn to books with photographs instead of illustrations, so this was an excellent option for him. This book doesn't cover the entire new baby topic. We had already purchased books about what a new baby is like, but he was most concerned with how exactly the baby is born. This book fit the bill for that.Most importantly, this book is not a replacement for talking to your child about sex and birth. We've used this book to supplement part of that conversation, but no book should be relied on as providing an entire picture/explanation. Cole's note to parents does a good job of reinforcing this. For example, the book does not mention or show c-sections, but Cole mentions the importance of talking to children about such births in her introduction to parents."},{"Title":"How Were You Born","review":"One of the best books on this subject I've seen.

Spillane's Mike Hammer is as brutal and uncompromising as they come. There's nothing weak about this book, and the conclusion is so suprising, so shocking, that it will leave you with a powerful, but guilty, sense of vindication."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"This was Spillane's first book - and what a book! Mike Hammer's war buddy is taunted and murdered and Mike vows to bring the killer to justice. He smashes his way to a conclusion you won't soon forget. After you read this one, try the next 6 - All Hammer stories with the exception of &quot;The Long Wait.&quot; At one time all of Spillane's first 7 books were listed in the all time top 10 best sellers. There's a reason for that - read them and find out."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"Make no bones about it: this is definitely one of the best detective novels ever written, but not only that. It is also a piece of art, beautifully told, with characters that are hard to forget, and scenes that must have made Norman Rockwell shudder with disgust. It is also, more by accident than purposely it seems, a description of the underbelly of American society after World War II, when U.S. power was at its peak and the American way of life seemed to leave nothing to be desired.Trying to find out who killed his best friend, Mike Hammer ruthlessly punches, kicks, and shoots himself through the mesh of thugs, pimps, racketeers, and femme fatales, that pave his way before he can finally nail down the murderer. His methods are brutal and totally inconsistent with even the most lenient interpretations of the law. Along the way, he meets a host of the most beautiful and attractive bombshells ever to grace the pages of a novel, not without getting a little closer to at least some of the most beguiling ones of these kittens. Despite his apparent disregard for rules, norms, and morals, deep down Hammer is a very decent and honorable man. Loyalty means everything to him; he treats doormen and elevator attendants with respect; and he even refuses to sleep with his soon-to-be wife before they officially seal their commitment. He even doesn't think anything of having a drink at the bar of a friend, who, incidentially, happens to be a black man.As far as violence goes, Hammer sure doesn't shy away from it. Neither does he seem to dislike it all that much. However, he never resorts to it without a purpose. It's a means to an end, namely, to make the murderer of his friend pay and to finally bring about justice. The latter would not be served if not for Hammer taking the law in his own hands. \\"No jury would ever convict you on that, would they? ... We won't have to worry about a smart lawyer cracking our chains of circumstance and making them look foolish to a jury ... No, I am the jury now, and the judge, and I have a promise to keep\\".The extent to which Spillane was despised by the 40s literary critics in particular and the then dominant voices of public opinion in general is not hard to imagine. I don't believe he would fare much better today; a statement like \\"you no longer had the social instinct of a woman - that of being dependent upon a man\\" would not go too well in today's politically overcorrect society. Well, I don't give a damn - to me Mike Hammer is an honest, straightforward, and down-to-earth character, just as I, The Jury is an unpretentious and sincere effort by its writer to make a buck. This, I guess, he did, and, incidentially, he created a great work of American fiction. You'r a good man, and I believe we all should have a whiskey or two to your health. Here's to you, Mickey.(I have come across the \\"Unofficial Mickey Spillane Mike Hammer Site\\" - it's the best web page on this topic and about the best site on the whole world wide web)."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"I'm not trying to be sexist, just realistic. I, the Jury, is outstanding reading. Spillane is in top form with this one, and the story is strong and riveting. But there is a good deal of sex and violence, and things were certainly a lot different when Mr. Spillane wrote this. Don't look for any politically correct jargon or attitudes, and don't hope for a happy ending, because you'll be disappointed on both counts. But if you want a good read, and you want something that is WAY different than any stories being published today, buy this book."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"\\"I, the Jury\\" is not really a mystery. It is a \\"vendetta Eastern\\" in the same pattern as the Clint Eastwood vendetta Westerns (\\"A Fistful of Dollars,\\" \\"A Few Dollars More,\\" \\"Hang 'em High,\\" etc.) In the opening pages of the book, Mike Hammer stands over the body of his slain comrade and swears terrible vengeance on the killer. Then he embarks upon a series of crimes which should have garnered him several life sentences. When the last house is burgled, the last head broken, and the last killing perpetrated, I was left wondering the same thing I wondered at the conclusion of the Dirty Harry movie \\"Magnum Force.\\" How's the \\"hero\\" gonna explain all this to the police?"},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"Filled with thrills and twists this is mickey spillane at his best. A great mystery story which can be read in one sitting either in bed or when travelling.I could give you details but then it wouldnt be a mystery would it."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"Mike Hammer has never been told so boldly, so brazenly as he was here by the master of the dime novel mystery, Mickey Spillane. This should be standard reading for any man's man as well as standard fair on any pure study of American literature. Mickey Spillane's prose ranks at the highest of its form, bar none, and there are very few novels that narrative points come down to the last sentence of the book.This is a must for any serious fan of mystery fiction, whether you prefer your private eyes hard-boiled or not, and this should be on any serious men's literature list.Trust me. &quot;It was easy.&quot;"},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"Mike Hammer is the classic hard-bitten private detective. He talks hard, he fights hard and when it comes to love he falls fast and hard. Nothing at all is held back in this highly charged murder case that cuts straight to Hammer's core.The tough, no-nonsense Hammer is faced with the cruel shooting murder of Jack Williams, a close friend, and takes it hard. In front of Pat Chambers, another good friend who just happens to be the Captain of Homicide, he vows that when he catches the murderer he would gladly shoot him in the gut, just like Williams had been. The case quickly becomes a race between Hammer and Chambers, as Hammer is determined to have his vengeance.This is hardboiled detective fiction as it should be. There are no qualms when it comes to violence, no regrets over shooting the bad guys, whisky is swallowed easily in one swallow and the dames are kept begging for more. We charge from suspect to suspect watching Hammer extract information under threat of violence, and following through on the threat whenever necessary. Moving at breakneck speed, the bodies pile up while Hammer finds himself falling in love. It makes for terrific reading for lovers of the hardboiled detective genre."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"This was better than I expected and is a thoroughly compelling read. It was every bit as lurid as advertised, but is generally a very close cousin to Raymond Chandler's Marlowe novels in character and tone, though the plotting is much less convoluted and we don't get quite as entangled with secondary characters or setting. Spillane emphasizes Mike Hammer's incredible toughness and verility on every page, with all the usual gumshoe vernacular, and as with the best detective novels, character counts more than crime. That's a polite way of saying I figured this one out pretty early, despite trying hard not to, and it didn't diminish the reading experience at all.Spillane has the last laugh on his critics- this is good stuff."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"Mike, slow down, buddy. You're going to kill someone. Again. Oh, you want to. I see. You want to plug somebody. You want to shoot them in the gut. You want them to die a slow death - squirming.

You're a tough cookie. You put the hard in hard-boiled. You shove your way around the city, tossing bad guys and girls in the gutter where they belong. And who knows more than you that there are plenty of them bums to go around. They're on every street corner, in every alley, under every rock.You use women, too, Mike. You play them like a musician playing the scales. Up and down. You bring them up, they fall for you, then you drop them down - hard. Sometimes you're soft, but most times you're rough, and they like it when you're rough - the rougher the better. But there is one dame who plucks your strings, Mr. Hammer - Velda, your secretary. You almost tossed her overboard in this one, Mike. I was surprised. But look who she was up against - Ms. Perfect - body and all.Yeah, you're crazy as a loon. You're wound up tighter than the rubber bands on the inside of a golf ball. But I feel safer when you're around, Mike. I sleep better, too, knowing there's one pug out there who's looking out for the little guy. You got class, buddy. It's not polished bright and shiny on the outside, like a knight in shining armor, it's deep inside where no one can see it. That's because if they saw how much you cared then they'd know something about you, and that would be a flaw, right, big guy?

This is the milieu anyone who has a vague inkling of MS's MH automatically conjures. & it's the setting where the world 1st meets private cop MH. There's the babe: Myrna, & MH's old army pal Jack Williams. The cops see a routine case. MH senses sadism & describes it to Pat Chambers, his cop buddy, & captain of the local precinct. It is only at the evidence of sadism that MH makes his famous vow: \`He won't sit on the chair. He won't hang. He will die exactly as you died, with a .45 slug in the gut, just a little below the belly button. No matter who it is, Jack, I'll get the one. Remember, no matter who it is, I promise.' Or this: \`You're a cop, Pat. You're tied down by rules and regulations. There's someone over you. I'm alone. I can slap someone in the puss and they can't do a damn thing. No one can kick me out of my job. Maybe there's nobody to put up a huge fuss if I get gunned down, but then I still have a private cop's license with the privilege to pack a rod, and they're afraid of me. I hate hard, Pat. When I latch on to the one behind this they're going to wish they hadn't started it. Some day, before long, I'm going to have my rod in my mitt and the killer in front of me. I'm going to watch the killer's face. I'm going to plunk one right in his gut, and when he's dying on the floor I may kick his teeth out.' This is where we get the 1st rift between the genre's formalities & MS's new take on things. As with many prior crime books this 1 has its own \`society party'. This is where MH scopes out a typical lineup of possible murderers: the sexpot Bellemy twins- Mary (who lacks the birthmark, but later gets nailed by MH) & Esther (the non-nympho)- rich playgirls with nothing to lose; the sobbing Myrna- a recovering smack addict; Charlotte Manning- the wealthy psychiatrist-cum-goddess-cum-fianc&eacute;e-cum-drug dealer-cum-killer; Hal Kines- a playboy college boy who turns out to be a plastic surgically altered pimp & drug dealer; & George Kalecki- a shady rich man with a dark past MH knows all too well.But, the inevitable get-together of all the chief suspects at another party does not result in the revelation of the suspect- although Mike hammers Mary Bellemy. Yes, there are classic elements in the book- the death of innocents (Jack Williams, Myrna, Bobo Hopper), gratuitous but entertaining brawling, MH seeing his fair share of gorgeous pussy, plot turns galore- the prime suspects (Kines & Kalecki) turn out to be red herrings, & MH's monomania for justice/vengeance. The clues slowly sort themselves out for MH. The book's denouement, now classic- & almost trite, after later imitations, had to have been a scorcher back in the day.This book lays the template: 1) nasty quotables, 2) MH's cat-n-mouse love for Velda, 3) his \`partnership' with Pat, 4) his overall character, 5) the sex & gore, & 6) the crescendos at novel's end- which reached its climax 2 books later. On a scale of 1-100 I will give MS's books 2 ratings- the 1st is for its excellence in the genre, & the 2nd is for its literary value- regardless of its genre.In genre I rate I, The Jury a 97 out of 100- it's just so classic & archetypal. Yes, some elements saw MH improve upon in the later books, but this was the great \`break' from those who came before. As pure literature I'd give it a good solid 88 out of 100. There are too many nods that tie it to the genre to rate it as highly as I do in-genre, but there are too many positives to not admit this is an excellent book- better than anything Dickens or Tolstoy ever penned.Now that I've limned the book's tale let me criticize it in a wider context. In many ways, much of what critics said about MS, MH, & this book was absolutely true. They just mistook those qualities- acts of violence, titillation, machismo, narrative rapidity, archetypes- for their negative counterparts: wanton violence, pornography, sexism, shallowness, & stereotypes. Part of the reason, I believe, that this error in judgment occurred was for the very reason that MS WAS SO GOOD at what he did. Were he not critics would not have bothered with it- but they kept coming back to pummel this book as if they really knew that it hit a primal nerve with an America that understood such entertainment (yes, art) at a fundamentally visceral level at odds with the gentlemanly art of dialectical criticism. It reminds 1 of the silly- & now obviously ridiculous- pummelings that Impressionist paintings 1st got- that is, the critics knew that the art they were weaned on was soon going to be obviated by this newer type of art that was at once \`more realistic' & more mythic."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"Mike Hammer was an alcoholic, a brutal fighter, a bully with a short temper, and he carried a loaded gun. He was also a racist, a sexist, a homophobe and thought his way was the only way. He was, in short, what inexperienced 16-year old boys wanted to be in 1950. Gorgeous women threw themselves at him, pleading for his--his whatever. He had plenty of money, although no one seemed to be paying him. His \\"heap\\" (automobile) looked shabby but it had a powerful, souped-up engine. What more could one ask?For one thing, reality. That was the missing ingredient. In this book, Hammer's best pal, an ex-cop, is murdered, and Hammer is devastated. So is the murdered pal's girlfriend, an ex-drug addict. Hammer spends a lot of time drinking, driving and drooling as he goes after the murder--but there is no mention of a funeral for the pal. Funerals are reality, and Mickey Spillane didn't bother with such trivialities. I give this as but one example.Still, there is a certain pleasure in reading Spillane, if only for his literary style. He didn't invent the staccato sentence sequences, but he certainly was master of them.\\"I, the Jury\\" followed the Dashiell Hammet books and others. Mike Hammer wasn't exactly an original, just an exaggeration of it. Unfortunately, one of Spillane's books is enough to satisfy my thirst for another 50 years or so."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"Truly, truly bad... If you want good noir, see, Hammett or Chandler (both pof the Macdonalds are great too). Spillane simply does not know how to write: the prose is awful, the murderer managed to be both obvious and utterly implausible, the main character is an egotistical brute with no redeeming values. Very unpleasant to read.If you must read Spillane, you might try his later work--its possible he learned to write in his later years..."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"ITJ is a product of its time but to be a noir classic this story has not aged so well. If you're willing to dismiss a short list of glaring imperfections, mike is still a fun read and surely one tough dude."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"\\"I, the Jury\\" is the first of several Mike Hammer (private investigator) mystery novels, and it happens to be my first Mickey Spillane novel. Based on all the hype I thought it would similar to Raymond Chandler novel, with his Philip Marlowe character. I discovered this to be largely untrue, which isn't entirely a bad thing.In \\"I, the Jury\\" we have a lovable cad of a private investigator looking for the killer of his best friend. But he seeks justice in a very crude way - revenge (ie, he's out for blood). Of course during the way he meets with some sexy \\"broads\\" (to use the vernacular of the times) who, of course, fall madly in love with him. So far this doesn't sound far off from a Raymond Chandler novel. However with Mickey Spillane the dialogue is less clever (yet easier to read), the prose is only fair, and the story could have been told better. In \\"I, the Jury\\" the rather terrific ending is very quickly brought to the surface is an an abrupt way. So Raymond Chandler seems to be the much better writer, capturing the essence of 1940s Los Angeles and the folks who inhabit skid row. Mickey Spillane's book is set in New York but it could have been Anywhere, USA, and I didn't exactly feel hurdled back in time. But I enjoyed \\"I, the Jury\\" overall and I will read others in the Mike Hammer series.Bottom line: a bit crude but very entertaining piece of private eye nonsense. In its own way it is deserving of its status as as classic."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"This Mike Hammer detective thriller was a best-seller hit in the 1950's, selling over a million and a half copies in the USA alone in that decade.It begins when Private Eye and ex G.I. Mike Hammer discovers that Jack Williams, a former WWII comrade who had literally given his right arm to save Mike's life, has been murdered. Williams had died with a dum-dum bullet through the lower body, apparently at the hands of a particularly sadistic killer.Mike is in a race with police detective Captain Pat Chambers to catch the killer: Pat wants to arrest and try the culprit, Hammer has promised that he will kill the murderer, whoever it is, in exactly the same way that Jack Williams was killed.(Now, I was under the impression that in law, shooting someone dead other than in self-defence is still murder even if the victim is also a murderer, but different rules seem to appliy in novels.)As Mike and Pat think they are closing in on the killer, they start to get shot at themselves - then more people are murdered.The story is quite exciting, and the shock ending when Mike Hammer finally confronts the killer is absolutely chilling.Quite nonsensical in places, but if you are into 40's & 50's style thrillers you will probably find this entertaining. Be warned however that the book packs a major sting in the tail."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"Spillane's first novel is unfortunately out of print and I hope this will encourage the publishers to reprint. It's a classic redoing of the hard-boiled tradition, taking the essentials of the plot of the Maltese Falcon, adding even more sex and violence, and casting its hero, Mike Hammer, as a returned veteran of WWII, disgusted with the world that he and his buddies had fought to preserve.

I remembered the final outcome,but in all those years,I had forgotten the rest of the story,the details and the super writing and storytelling skills of Spillane.I have gathered up most of his other novels with the intent of reading them when \\"I get around to it\\".The long career of Mickey Spillane came to an end with his passing on July 17,2006.Born in Brooklyn,N.Y. in 1918,he started writing in the early 40's when he developed the private detective,\\"Mike Danger\\",the prototype for Mike Hammer. Over the years, he wrote 24 novels.Several were made into movies; and Spillane acted in some of them and appeared on TV in series and commercials.He was the writer that became the undisputed master of Crime and Detective novels. In many ways he was similar to Erskine Caldwell who was also a prolific writer and their leadership created a whole new venue of literature,namely the low cost Paperbacks.Though most people don't realize it,these writers outsold even Hemmingway and Steinbeck,even in their day.Spillane considered himself a \\"writer\\" as opposed to an \\"authoer,\\" defining a writer as someone whose books sell.

No doubt about it ,his novels and the writer himself have weathered well and given millions a lot of exciting reading.In \\"I,The Jury\\" we get Mystery thrillers at their best.This was in the days before Political Correctness when the object was th hunt doen the bad guys n deal with them--no holds barred.If you want to read tough mystery novels,and haven't read Spillane,you will be in for a great surprise when you see how good crime novels can be.Thanks Mickey,you had a great run,and gave us a lot of super entertainment."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"&quot;I, The Jury (1947) was the beginning, the beginning of a round of thrillers by then unknown Mickey Spillane. Mike Hammer, one of thrillerdom's ace protagonists was introduced, and the world couldn't read enough of his adventures.Today Mickey Spillane is 85-years-old, and acclaimed around the globe for inventing the hard-hitting, hard-boiled protagonist who is a compelling mix of sex and sharp shooting. It's hard to believe this many years have gone by for the Brooklyn born Spillane. He's outlasted and out sold many of his contemporaries, and when last heard from was still hard at work.Perhaps those of us who love to read don't take time to thank the writers who have given us so many hours of pleasure. I certainly fall into that category, so a big hats off to Mickey Spillane and gratitude for the wealth of reading pleasure he's given so many."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"And for the better. Once you get past the casual racism, misogyny and homophobia, you've got a fine yarn, in Spillane's classic voice. The solution to the mystery becomes obvious toward the last third, but it's a fun read."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"Detective books written in the 1940's illuminate a completely different era. No technological gadgets, cell phones, etc. More explanations as to how the solution, clue, etc. adds to the solving of the crime."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"I would recommend this book to any reader, but mainly ones who like detective novels. The action was well written, not too little and not too much, just perfect. The characters were well described and I could really see the characters in my head. Mike hammer was awesome"},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"I first read &#34;I, The Jury&#34; when I was a kid and recently ordered this copy to reread it. If you have never read a Mike Hammer novel they are old fashioned and fun to read. Compared to a Robert B. Parker or Georges Simenon detective novel it is not nearly as well written,sophisticated or classy, but it is good and gritty private eye stuff. It really harkens back to the older style of detective you used to see in movies with Humphrey Bogart."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"I re-read this book for the first time since the 50's. It was a little like stepping into a time machine to read the book and re-live the setting and the manner of speaking that was the 50's. Today's writers would do well to take lessons from Mr. Spillane's works. He's a masterful story teller."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"\\"I,the Jury\\" is a must read for any mystery fan. The first 1947 Mickey Spillane novel introduces the most celebrated P.I. in mystery history, Mike Hammer. This is an action packed novel that shows, for the first time, a Private Investigator that takes things personally and deals out his own kind of justice. Powerful with a surprise ending."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"Tough hardboiled fun with Mickey Spillane's no-nonsense PI, Mike Hammer, in his debut adventure. A rollicking mystery and a colorful cast of characters keep the pages turning, but be aware that Hammer is not a PC guy, and reveals several opinions on gays and minorities that aren't likely to win him many friends in these more enlightened times. But if you can keep the era in which the book was written firmly in mind, this is an entertaining thriller."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"It is not easy to reconcile Mike Hammer into todays arch types of law and order, masculinity and conservatism. He carries around his private detective license and gun permit, flaunts traffic laws, and orders ordinary police patrolmen around. The debut novel unfolds like something Hunter S. Thompson would write, only with fewer words. It is hard to rationalize his progress through the case. Eventually he reaches the end of it."},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"Mickey Spillane and Raymond Chandler, on different coasts, saw the same hero. Western movies saw him in Shane, Alan Ladd's role, and in Cris, Yul Brynner's role. But before that there was Mike Hammer, tough, relentless, not (definitely not) PC, loyal and hard as nails.We don't really know where he comes from. He hasn't been to therapy. He doesn't play soft jazz in his apartment, and have a collection of paintings, crockery, special fry pans and the poems of Robert Frost and Maya Angelou. He drinks a lot. He has a friend on the cops and a sexy, very sexy secretary.It all starts with him. In his wake are Lehane, Crais, Lescroart, Parker, George, Margolin and the like.There's also a nice collection of Mike Hammer including \\"My Gun is Quick\\" and \\"Vengeance is Mine,\\" and you can now get several other novels together. Highly recommended. 5+ stars. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"I, the Jury","review":"Thie was the lead off novel that seemed to create a new genre of make-my-day type novels with hard boiled PI Mike Hammer (there was a TV series based on the character). It is worthwhile to go back to the series if you have not read the novels, or maybe to read them again to visit old favorites. The best-buy is probably to buy the sets unless you are a serious collector. The novels reflect a macho, male dominated society, where women were in subservient roles, e.g., Mike's secretary Velda."},{"Title":"After Ovid : New Metamorphoses","review":"A collection of stories that we grew up hearing, but with all new skin. These re-tellings give new blood to Ovid and infuse his timeless book with modern spirit. Give: Apollo and Daphne packs a punch with its Elivs-like god and neo-feminist victim. A bevy of talented writers prove that familiar plots do not have to retain their old luster but can be polished anew. After Ovid is a wonderful way to loose yourself in imagination as you see the familiar become at once perverse and natal and finally familiar again."},{"Title":"Dame Darcy's Meatcake Compilation","review":"For those of you that aren't familar with Dame Darcy or her Meatcake comics you are in for a treat. Granted there is a certain audience, her comics are a mixture of gothic horror, romance, intrigue, and novelty, so not everyone may appreciate this series. If you like yr comedy noir and can appreciate the idea of mermaids and siamese twins being &quot;normal&quot; girls this should be right up yr alley.This compliation covers Meatcakes #s 1-7. #0 is missing, but luckily Fantagraphics has reprinted it and it is widely avaiable. (Just go to damedarcy.com for more details.)The presentation of this edition is stunning, it is hardbound with creamy thick pages and excellent reproductions of her comics."},{"Title":"The Gay Genius : The Life and Times of Su Tungpo","review":"I stumbled across this in a used book store and picked it up on a whim having no idea what it was about. Glad I did; it opened up a whole new world! The writing style is just sublime after reading styles from modern authors for years. To find out about a whole style of life, a different way of thinking, a whole different way of being.... amazing. And the life of the man himself, yes I agree with the title. What work must have gone into this to find obscure and old writings on this person is beyond me.I am thankful to have read such a fine work and feel enriched for it."},{"Title":"The Gay Genius : The Life and Times of Su Tungpo","review":"This is a great book written in English by a great Chinese author, scholar, philosopher, linguist,...Lin Yutang (1895-1976), about the greatest Chinese poet, scholar, philosopher of all time - Su Tungpo (1037-1101). Lin states the history background in Su's days (Sung Dynasty) and the life and works of Su. Lin translated many of Su's poems in this book published in 1947, including, in my mind, THE most fabulous and, greatest poem (or \\"tse\\" in this particular form) of all Chinese literature - the \\"Mid-Autumn Moon\\", composed in 1076. Lin translated this poem not just by meaning but also in English rhythm. \\"How rare the moon, so round and clear! With cup in hand, I ask of the blue sky, .....\\" (page 175). Critics say that after this poem was written, all the other poems on the harvest moon could be well forgotten. Lin's translation is a piece of art. Lin portraits Su's study, talent, literature works, unswerving mind. Really worth of reading."},{"Title":"When You Ask Why","review":"You will not want to put this book down. There are a lot of books written that help us with grief. This book is a book we all can relate to in so many ways - whether you are facing grief or not. What I love most about this book is Daniel Johnson states that it is okay to ask \\"Why?\\" Life is hard. This book helps to make sense out of some of the difficulty."},{"Title":"When You Ask Why","review":"This is a small book that can be read quickly but the truth in it will last a life time. The author allows the reader the right to ask the \\"Why\\" question without his or her faith being threatened. He quotes many well known speakers and authors. He offers calming advice, loving acceptance and good suggestions for going on in life after great loss."},{"Title":"Bungalows (Updating Classic America)","review":"This book is richly illustrated with plenty of photographs of updated bungalows from several styles ranging from the simple Midwestern houses made to be affordable in their day, to modern, contemporary West Coast bungalows.Where I found the book somewhat lacking was in the area of detailing before and after transformations of existing bungalows. Given the title, I would've expected more information about specific remodeling and renovation projects, with plenty of photos detailing \\"before\\", \\"during\\" and \\"after\\" the remodeling phases. There's very, very little of that in this book. The majority of the photos and scant floorplans dwell primarily with the finished project, though there are a very few that indicate what the owner started with. If you're looking for project specific guidance for rennovating or building your bungalow, this may not be the best choice. Still, the finished photos and supplemental text are inspiring. I would recommend this book with caution, based on the idea that it should likely be only one of many books in a modest library on period architecture upfitting."},{"Title":"Bungalows (Updating Classic America)","review":"Had some good ideas.

Little to no information about transitioning an older Bungalow as I had understood the book would contain."},{"Title":"Bungalows (Updating Classic America)","review":"Why are the same photos and/or houses sprinkled throughout the book? Maybe they need a proof-viewer?"},{"Title":"Bungalows (Updating Classic America)","review":"The authors of this book do a very good job of highlighting the bungalow's unique traits and then showing inspirational bungalow renovations. Early pages give the requisite definitions of what makes a bungalow, but I was most impressed by the middle three chapters: \\"Remodeling Inside the Walls\\"; \\"Beyond the Walls\\"; and \\"Brand New Bungalows\\". It is here that the authors challenge you to update your bungalow without losing any of the home's original character (or build anew with the same overall goal of classic home character).As any bungalow fan knows, there are three definite \\"branches\\" to the bungalow tree: in the Eastern U.S. craftsman bungalows rule, in the Midwest you find prairie styles and simple Chicago bunghalows, and in the west you find mission styles and the Greene and Greene influenced California bungalows. Being from the Midwest, I found this book especially compelling because so many of the example houses illustrated in the book are from my part of the country. Thus if you are from the Midwest I recommend this book with 5 stars, otherwise I give it a 4.5.Updating Classic American Bungalows is a must read for anyone who owns, lives in, or loves the bungalow style of architecture.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Bungalows (Updating Classic America)","review":"I am building a new house and I'm looking at many books on Bungalows, Mission Style, and Arts and Crafts. This was one of my favorites because it related more to new construction. It has many pictures and lots of ideas. I'd love to have an old bungalow with all the beautiful woodwork, but I can't. This gave my ideas on how to incorporate the bungalow look into a new home."},{"Title":"Bungalows (Updating Classic America)","review":"This book focuses largely on the updating of bungalows through renovation (and even new construction), rather than restoration. While it's not as true to the period as books like Bungalow Bathrooms or Bungalow Kitchens, it is a useful reference to readers like us who are looking to balance a respect for vintage architecture with modern conveniences.The most interesting things we found in this book were definitions of the different kinds of bungalows. While the Chicago-Style Bungalow Initiative restricts their bungalow program to a fairly specific architectural style (the \\"Chicago-style\\"), this book points out the definition of a bungalow and reviews the different variations of bungalows that exist in many places."},{"Title":"Bungalows (Updating Classic America)","review":"I appreciated the photos of the exteriors but was disappointed to see how many of the interiors were gutted to beyond recognition of the bungalow style. I bought the book to see bungalow style, not poorly interpreted modern cutups."},{"Title":"Bungalows (Updating Classic America)","review":"This book is called UPDATING Bungalows! Amazon is a wonderful resource because you can browse pages before you buy. This book should not be a disappointment for those who are paying attention.I am now the proud owner of a 1922 California Bungalow. I have no illusions that this was the tract home of its day (I have found 4 others exactly like it in my neighborhood). This book embraces the ideals of the bungalow and the intent of the lifestyle completely. Not all of us can live in rarified homes in Pasadena or Chicago, and a strict period restoration with Stickley furnishings may not be practical for our lives in the 21st century. This book is about UPDATING what you have to balance the traditional Craftsman aesthetic with modern sensibilities.For those who are hard core Craftsman enthusiasts bent on a period correct restoration, this is not the book for you. If you live in the modern world but respect the ideals of the era, check this out. There are plenty of good ideas, and a few photos of loving restorations too."},{"Title":"Bungalows (Updating Classic America)","review":"The authors confess early on in this beautifully illustrated book that they are themselves bungalow-owners and -dwellers, which makes them automatically sympathetic to the situation of the novice who finds himself with a fixer-upper or a house that needs a new kitchen, more storage, or just more space. And they tell, in a very practical way, how to go about creating what you need. Quite apart from the many beautiful full-color photos, they offer plenty of really vital information. \\"With the right architect, a radical overhaul can be sensitively done...[integrating] many of the interior details that people love about their bungalows,\\" they say. \\"A potential side benefit of [renovating one's attic] is that [its slanted knee walls] may mean [it] isn't legally a room at all and therefore not taxed as a bedroom. Check to see if your local ordinance states that if more than a certain percentage of a room's walls are sloping, it is exempt from full taxation.\\" (This is something that would never have occurred to me!) \\"As real estate values escalate, you may find that the lot is more valuable than the house itself. That, in turn, can make it difficult to get a mortgage on a 900-sq.-ft. house.

I am also fellowship trained in Interventional Pain Management. I honestly believe I have come across quite a number of medical books in Medicine, PM&R;, EMG/NCS, Neurology and Pain Medicine during my medical training and practice. In my opionion, this is one of the most wonderful medical books that has ever been written.It is comprehensive, yet concise but most importantly, it is practical. What distinguishes this book from others is that the contents are organized and presented in the most logical order so that what you read make sense and therefore can be easily remembered. The authors did an absolutly superb job in introducing each concept step by step, each chapter building on one another, integrating what is important, practical and pertinent without overkill. I had never been able to read through any medical text book(close to 600 pages, 1st edition) from cover to cover except this one, which I did almost twice. I did it during my GYIII-GYIV Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation Residency because reading it was educational, joyful and rewarding. For a long time, I have wanted to write a few lines, introducing to collegues the wonderful learning experience I had reading this book as well as expressing gratitude to Drs. Preston and Shapiro for making it availabe during my residency training, which helped me trenmendously in studying EMG/NCS. It is extremely useful in helping me prepare the Board Certification Exam by the American Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine. I recommend this book to all PM&R; and Neurology residents as No. 1 text book in EMG/NCS. As a matter of fact, I even recommended this book to my anesthesiologist pain specialist who wants to know more about EMG/NCS.

My father left a book by John Newman, Sermons on Subjects of the Day. He wrote, \\"Let us consider a doctrine much debated and much resisted at this day,--the doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration.\\"My first comment, right off, is that the rite of Baptism regenerates no one. The Holy Spirit is the Agent of regeneration, as proclaimed by none other than the Lord Jesus Christ in John 3. It does not happen by some Roman Catholic ritual.Newman added, \\"Scripture tells us expressly that, \`except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.'\\"Correct, but the reference to \\"water\\" here is not something performed on an infant soon after birth. The Lord was referring to John the Baptist's preaching that people should repent and be baptized. Repentance should precede baptism, but Roman Catholics have reversed the order. They baptize the infant and then hope the child will eventually repent.Newman continued, \\"...and that God has saved us \`by the washing of regeneration.\\"Let's get the broader context. Paul's wrote to Titus (3:5-7): \\"He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.\\"The \\"washing of regeneration\\" is something that is done by the \\"Holy Spirit,\\" and no Roman Catholic priest is the Holy Spirit. In fact, the text makes it explicit that it is \\"not because of works done by us in righteousness.\\" A priest who baptizes an infant may think his action is an act of righteousness, but the text says not by such.Newman continued, \\"Baptism saves us.\\"Again, Newman took words out-of-context. Here is what Peter, perhaps the first pope in Newman's view, gave us in 1 Peter 3:18-22:For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.The outward rite of baptism performed on an infant is not what is in view here. First, Christ is the One who saves - not baptism. Noah's family, in the ark, were brought safely through water. It was not the flood that saved, but the ark. The Lord Jesus Christ is our Ark of safety today. Anyone in Him is safe. Baptism saves no one; Jesus is the only Savior. Infants do not have an \\"appeal to God for a good conscience\\" (faith). When a person trusts in Jesus, he/she should then be baptized. The Roman Catholic Church places baptism before faith, but that is the wrong order.Newman falsely affirmed, \\"No other means have been pointed out to us for attaining regeneration, or the new birth.\\"This is so blatantly false. The Apostle Paul told the Philippian jailer to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. A baby has no clue who Jesus is. The biblical order is faith then baptism; the Roman Catholic Church reverses the order.Newman continued in his foolishness, \\"...if a man is not born again in Baptism, it does not appear how he is to be born again.\\"But it does appear! A man is born again by the action of the Holy Spirit in his life. He must believe on the Lord Jesus Christ - entrusting himself to the saving mercies of Jesus alone. To trust in a rite is to reject Jesus as sole Savior.Newman continued his delusion, \\"That Baptism really does change a man's moral state as well as his state in God's sight.\\" Baptism changes nothing. The Holy Spirit opens a man's eyes to the only hope - Jesus Christ - and gives him new birth.Newman continued in his absurdity: \\"...two souls, one baptized and one not, are not in the same moral condition, but that the baptized, as having been regenerate, is inwardly either better or worse, or both at once,--in some things better, and in some things worse,--than the unbaptized.\\"Newman here was speaking poison. Rather than directing the attention of readers to the Lord Jesus Christ, he wanted people to have confidence in their Roman Catholic ritual. In short, the Roman Catholic Church saves. This is exactly what Satan wants. He wants us to take our eyes away from Jesus and toward some mere human ritual performed by some other intermediary. These words of Newman elevate the Roman Catholic priesthood (as in &lt;Do what we say, and we will get you into heaven>) rather than on Christ, the only and ultimate high priest of the entire universe."},{"Title":"Fun with Wizard of Oz Stencils (Dover Little Activity Books)","review":"I bought this book not too long ago after buying my first house and I must tell you, I love it!

It carries the fragrance of the inner sanctuary, being written by one who was obviously acquainted with the glories of God's presence in the secret place.This warm-hearted Scotsman covers the subject in eight excellent chapters, which not only provide wonderful examples of prayer, and moving incentives for prayer, but also helpful instructions regarding prayer. The first chapter deals with &quot;The Life of Prayer,&quot; and particularly the arduous nature of prayer. This will encourage the one who feels weary in well-doing. Don't give up! Chapter two, on &quot;The Equipment,&quot; deals with the necessity of a quiet place, a quiet time, and a quiet heart, with special instruction on how to cultivate the latter (a. &quot;recognize our acceptance before God through the dying of the Lord Jesus;&quot; b. &quot;confess and receive the enabling grace of the Divine Spirit;&quot; and c. &quot;in the beginning of our supplications to direct our hearts toward the Holy Scriptures.&quot;) This chapter has much with which to feed the soul. The third chapter covers &quot;The Direction of the Mind&quot; with three helpful directives for your concentration: I. realize the presence of God; II. be honest (and real) in your dealings with God; and III. come in faith. Chapters four through six deal with three aspects of our engagement with God: worship, confession, and requests. Each chapter is rich and eloquent. And Chapters 7-8 cover the rewards of prayer: &quot;The Hidden Riches of the Secret Place&quot; and &quot;The Open Recompense.&quot;I have read this twice now and it is still worthy of another thorough reading - in fact, I've placed it on my &quot;Master Book List&quot; - a short list of books which I would like to master in my life-time.

In a time of partisanship, Tagliabue embraces opposites. In a time of suspicion, Tagliabue accepts the other without making them over. New and Selected Poems includes more than half a century of poems, but I find the book speaks to our historical moment. For those who enjoy plenitude, I can recommend no more heartening way to move into the new year than to read--even read aloud--from this big book. It will make you want to reach out, to combat bitterness with wit, to love difference, to imagine, to fully live.Despite his ethics of inclusion, there is no homogenization of the reader; nor does Tagliabue make an issue of cross-cultural engagement. Rather, his poetics demonstrates how to move in a direction neither of global uniformity nor of radical fragmentation in a globalized democracy. As such this most prolific of American poets mirrors &quot;the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present&quot; and confirms Shelley's belief that &quot;poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the World.&quot;The verbal syncretism, oceanic rhythm that counters chronometric progression, freely flowing analogies, unpredictable prosodic doublings and embeddings serve to subvert the reader's expectation of univocal form, yet unravel a mutuality with all things, including the chaos needed in oneself to trigger recognitions, transformations, exchanges. The dialogical openness of Tagliabue's poems, old and new--and for longtime readers a special pleasure is to follow the changes through the decades--will make you hope for our escape from power, as Tagliabue's poems call for the reader to renounce monological boundaries for the lyric as genre.What a gift of hope on this New Year's Eve! Thank you, John Tagliabue, for showing us the way."},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: 1942-1997","review":"I came across the poet at a retreat center in '76.

Very worth while."},{"Title":"New and Selected Poems: 1942-1997","review":"John Tagliabue was a poet as completely alive to the beauty of the world as he was aware of its sorrows.

I have been using it for my studies and I enjoyed it so much that I had to have a second copy for school."},{"Title":"Concise Dictionary of Theology","review":"This dictionary has been the single most helpful work of reference that I have used in my 10 years of studying theology. O'Collins and Farrugia tend to emphasize terms that appear more often in constructive (or systematic) theology. You'll find, for example, all of the significant ancient heresies dealing with the Church's development of Christology or Trinitarian theology and ample discussion of more philosophical terms (e.g. \\"positivism,\\" \\"empiricism\\" \\"Aristotelianism,\\" \\"Averroism\\"). There are a number of entries for terms relating to biblical exegesis, Church history and institutions (e.g., \\"Crusades,\\" \\"Malibar Christians\\"), but an adequate treatment of these fields is really beyond the scope of any portable reference work. (FYI: For a fine 1-volume dictionary of technical terms for biblical exegesis, have a look at Richard N. Soulen and R. Kendall Soulen's \\"Handbook of Biblical Criticism, 3rd ed., Revised and Expanded\\"; for an adequate 1-volume work on Christian history, there is none better than F.L. Cross and E.A. Livingstone's \\"The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd ed. Revised and Expanded; this latter work has recently been published in a much cheaper, concise version, which is probably quite good, but I haven't perused it). In addition to these inevitable deficiencies, this dictionary would have been greatly enhanced if its authors had included bibliographic information with each entry. But in lieu of their accomplishment, this is a minor point. To my knowledge, there is no other work like this in print today, and if doing theology is your mainstay, it will certainly be one of the most used books on your shelf, regardless of your level of learning. I'll end this review with an anecdote from an introductory theology class that I taught 2 years ago, in which this dictionary was a required companion piece. After the first few weeks of class, I wondered whether students were using this dictionary and began to feel some regret for having compelled them to purchase it. Then at mid-term, I handed out an informal teaching evaluation and asked the students to rate each book they had been exposed to (4-5, I believe) from 1-10, according to how \\"helpful\\" the book had been. My undergraduate students consistently rated this book the highest. So in short, if you are thinking about buying this book, you probably should do so! (Note to professors in theology: You may want to get your hands on the out-of-print \\"Theological Dictionary\\" written by Karl Rahner and Herbert Vorgrimler for your shelves. While O'Collins and Farrugia's \\"Concise Dictionary\\" is better overall, many of the former work's entries provide complementary information)."},{"Title":"Concise Dictionary of Theology","review":"helps with the program I am enrolled in.

This book details the period from AD 193-244 and focuses mainly on the series of child-emperors who ruled during that time (Caracalla, Geta, Elagabalus, Alexander Severus, and Gordian III). Like that one it relies on overly simplistic characterizations and a basic narrative unencumbered by modern research or archaeology. Part of this is because it was printed in the 1960s. The other part is simply because Brauer is more interested in the story than the history. Despite an interest in Roman coins (I won't say numismatics since that implies far too in depth a study) Brauer uses nothing but literary sources to construct his account. Unlike his second book this is less of a problem due to the better sources for this period (Dio and Herodian both end by the first year of Gordian III) but it still means that he is very uncritical of what he uses. If you just want a popular history of the period these two books will serve you well. If you want these for anything approaching professional purposes then seek elsewhere."},{"Title":"And No Birds Sing: A True Ecological Thriller Set in a Tropical Paradise","review":"This account of efforts to understand and deal with threatened exotic-caused extinctions on Guam is a gem.

This deftness in weaving many individually fascinating threads recalled for me Neal Ascherson's astonishing &quot;Black Sea.&quot;The paperback's Index lists only passing references to DDT -- on pages 26, 27 and 72. Because the bad guy is not a chemical, not one of our products. No, he's one of us. And after the paucity and untimeliness of the legislative response to the Guamanian situation had sunk into my consciousness, it was ironic that in the end, an air force base on the island established the 50-acre &quot;environmental reclamation experiment&quot; Jaffe hopes could begin to turn it all around.

The author covers not only &quot;familiar&quot; - i.e., formal - kimono, but also work clothes, folk clothing, and the modest beauty of stripes and ikat. Illustrations throughout the book are well annotated and informative.My two favorite chapters are those on kimono in the Heian (9th-11th centuries) and Genroku (1688-1704) periods, with their wealth of history and beauty. The chapter on the Heian era covers, among other things, seasonal color combinations, with color depictions of how the layers would look. The Genroku chapter covers kosode, with commented (black and white) illustrations from pattern books of the time.For those interested in wearing modern kimono, the chapter &quot;The Structure of Kimono&quot; includes information on several different aspects of what a kimono, obi and their accessories can mean according to how they're worn. For instance, how the V-shape formed by the collar differs according to age, or what an obijime placed slightly lower than usual can signify. It also includes charts on kimono formality (a wonderful resource) and descriptions - as always, accompanied by illustrations - of the different kimono and obi types."},{"Title":"Kimono: Fashioning Culture","review":"The kimono is the national dress of Japan and is instantly recognisable as Japanese wherever you see it. However, the kimono that we see today is essentially the end of a long evolution of dress over a thousand years and what is worn now is essentially a fossilised costume.This book gives you an illuminating look at the history of the kimono in Japan - how even the word &quot;kimono&quot; didn't exist before last century, when the Japanese became aware that there were &quot;other&quot; forms of dress. We are also given insights into the dress of the lower class and rural people of Japan. They are often forgotten in kimono discussion, yet they developed a dress style that was both practical and indigenous, though it is dying in the modern age. There is even an extensive section devoted to the aristocratic 10th century kimono styles and colour combinations.Lastly this book gives you insight into how the modern kimono is worn. There is a wealth of meaning in dress design and how it is worn that mostly passes non-Japanese by and for a kimono to be worn with style requires a lot of social knowledge that not many other books will spell out for you like this.This book is highly recommended if you have an interest in Japanese costume, history or fabrics. It gives a fascinating account of how dress mirrors history and social changes. However, if you are looking for lots of colour photos of kimono and their designs this book will probably disappoint you as all the illustrations are in black and white."},{"Title":"Kimono: Fashioning Culture","review":"This is a very good guide to the history of the kimono and its importance in Japanese society. Perhaps its only fault is that it doesn't have a huge amount of pictures and those pictures that it does have are largely in black and white."},{"Title":"Kimono: Fashioning Culture","review":"This is an essential book, I think, for clothing designers, people who like Japanese style, and fabric makers -- as well as others.Dalby's knowledge of Japan and women's kimono fashion is based on personal knowledge in the culture, including a stint as an \\"American geisha\\" in Japan and all the kimono wearing that involved. She also did terrific book research.One of the intriguing parts of the book is the revelation of the fashion art of woodblock print (ukiyo-e) artists. The book becomes a double pleasure of fashion AND art.Her prose explains kimono to you with ease, and it reads like tips from a favorite friend. Even for a man who never expects to wear a yukata again, I enjoyed it tremendously."},{"Title":"Kimono: Fashioning Culture","review":"This book is a classic. It doesn't have many color pictures, but that doesn't seem to matter. The author discusses kimono in terms of how kimono are worn and what tiny differences in the details of wearing mean in social context. That's what I find fascinating. Of course she also covers the history of kimono. She includes many small black-and-white line illustrations that demonstrate her points very well."},{"Title":"Kimono: Fashioning Culture","review":"An outstanding book,excellent for reference and research.A very well detailed research on colors and seasons in the Heian Period,Designs, colors and symbols all had a particular reason for being used.You just did not use any color for any day of the year.Ms.Dalby did an exquisite job."},{"Title":"Kimono: Fashioning Culture","review":"Had my reservations at first (geisha??? covers with exotic Japanese women???) but Liza Dalby has come through. I kowtow to her and her anthropologist's analytical pursuit of the origins of kimono. This is a seriously good book. So good I went out and bought hardcover and paperback editions, because the hardcover edition has extra color pages explaining the Heian Era color schemes of dress. Dalby has included an incredible level of detail, so if you're obsessing about getting things right, you need this book. I've read other kimono books but this is the only one I know written in English *and* by a woman expert. Fashionistas, you need to read this. You will never ever wear your kimono - ahem, I mean \\"kosode\\" - \\"the wrong way\\" again."},{"Title":"Kimono: Fashioning Culture","review":"If you are planning to make an Heian era woman's costume (modern term is junihitoe) and already have the patterns for the robes and Heian era hakama (pants, essentially) this book is excellent for giving you all the popular color combinations for the robe layers."},{"Title":"Kimono: Fashioning Culture","review":"This book arrived as promised, the condition wasn't as good as I had hoped but it is acceptable."},{"Title":"Peru: Society and Nationhood in the Andes (Latin American Histories)","review":"For me as a reader, what makes a history book great is not the detail or amount of knowledge within, but the manner in which the author conveys that knowledge to the reader. Great history leaps off the page, and a great writer can make even the dullest subject fascinating. This is not quite the case with Peter Flindell Klaren's solid history of Peru entitled, Peru: Society and Nationhood in the Andes. Klaren, a professor of history and International Affairs at the George Washington University, creates a comprehensive historical, sociological, and economic history of this oft-troubled South American nation, ranging from the pre-Inca natives to the confused politics of the Fujimora era.Though incredibly well researched and detailed, the book is not one designed for light reading. Klaren writes like an academic working on a thesis in the library: churning, expelling fact after fact without pause and not bringing the life behind the stories to the surface. His use of terms and concepts relating to specific eras of Peruvian history are often discussed in context but not explained until pages later, creating confusion. Klaren's intent with this work was to research how economics and sociological issues helped create the troubled history of Peru. By focusing on this aspect, however, he bogs down in the economic numbers, citing statistic after statistic until it all blurs together.In fairness, Klaren notes that it is not possible to completely and elegantly distill 10,000 years of history from a country the size of Spain, England, and France combined, especially one in which academic research has been sorely lacking. Klaren does provide extremely helpful statistical tables and comprehensive source references at the end of the book, and it is quite clear the massive amount of research that went into the writing of this book. Also notable is his focus on the impact of the diversity of the Peruvian populace and how ethnic history shaped the political and social history of the country.If you are a student or someone with an interest in how economies and socio-politics creates history and can affect the development of small nations, then this is a very good book for you. This is also a wonderful reference source for those looking to write or explore in detail Peru's history. If you are looking for a light, fast moving history, you might be better suited elesewhere in the book aisle.A.G.

El prestigio de su autor -Peter F. Klar&eacute;n de la Universidad George Washington- y del sello editorial que la auspicia -Oxford University Press- son razones suficientes para prever la influencia que Peru: Society and Nationhood in the Andes habr&aacute; de tener en los medios peruanistas norteamericanos.Establecer un eje interpretativo con validez en el largo plazo es el mayor reto en un proyecto de esta naturaleza. Ni las &eacute;picas incaica o pizarrista ni menos a&uacute;n la lucha por la independencia funcionan m&aacute;s, advierte el autor, como los eventos fundacionales de una historia nacional. En la supervivencia misma de sus pobladores, en su voluntad e ingenio para levantarse de sucesivas devastaciones -de origen tanto humano como natural-, encuentra el profesor Klar&eacute;n la clave de la larga duraci&oacute;n peruana; una historia, seg&uacute;n &eacute;l, tan rica como dolorosa.Varios siglos de supervivencia comunitaria hicieron del Tawantinsuyo el m&aacute;s efectivo proyecto estatal en la historia de los Andes. Verdadero triunfo sobre la fragmentaci&oacute;n que de la geograf&iacute;a misma pareciera emanar. Su derrumbe, y la cat&aacute;strofe demogr&aacute;fica que prosigui&oacute; supondr&iacute;a para las sociedades andinas una perecedera desestructuraci&oacute;n.Con todo su poder&iacute;o, no obstante, el orden colonial no logra imponer por completo los criterios de casta y segregaci&oacute;n originalmente previstos. A ello, los futuros peruanos ofrecieron una terca resistencia, demostrando asimismo una distintiva capacidad para maximizar las oportunidades que las fisuras del poder colonial ofrec&iacute;an. A lo largo del XVIII, la supervivencia deviene rebeld&iacute;a.Frente a la conciencia criolla forjada en la capital virreinal surge, en la sierra sur, una visi&oacute;n alternativa: recuperar la memoria incaica en la perspectiva de un programa nacional. Como naci&oacute;n, el Per&uacute; terminar&aacute; construy&eacute;ndose a contramano de la historia representada por los rebeldes de 1780: lo criollo como negaci&oacute;n de lo andino.Tomando la iniciativa nuevamente, entre fines del XIX e inicios del XX, emprende la poblaci&oacute;n andina un nuevo ciclo de confrontaci&oacute;n: comunidades contra haciendas una vez m&aacute;s. En lo que queda del siglo la cuesti&oacute;n de la marginalidad ind&iacute;gena aparece como el gran tel&oacute;n de fondo de una historia cuyos cronistas oficiales insistieron en reducir a los avatares estatales y capitalinos: la historia de Lima como sustituto de la historia del Per&uacute;.Una verdadera revoluci&oacute;n historiogr&aacute;fica, en curso desde los a&ntilde;os 70, es lo que permite, subraya Klar&eacute;n, esta dr&aacute;stica ampliaci&oacute;n del marco hist&oacute;rico peruano. Una revoluci&oacute;n basada en los aportes convergentes de investigadores peruanos (Pease, Burga, Flores Galindo, Manrique, Bonilla, entre otros) y extranjeros (Stern, Spalding, Jacobsen, Gootemberg), cuya obra individual hace posible la s&iacute;ntesis interpretativa ahora intentada por Klar&eacute;n.Pero es la historia misma de las &uacute;ltimas d&eacute;cadas la que convalida el esquema interpretativo elegido por Klaren: la emergencia de una sociedad de masas que, del desborde popular (Matos Mar) al otro sendero (De Soto), y de la insurrecci&oacute;n senderista a la contra-isurrecci&oacute;n rondera, decretar&iacute;a la crisis final del pa&iacute;s imaginado por los criollos de inicios del XIX.La evoluci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica contempor&aacute;nea, desde esta perspectiva, aparece como una sucesi&oacute;n de intentos por revertir la desestructuraci&oacute;n y erigir andamiajes institucionales duraderos sobre las arenas movedizas de una historia irresuelta.Si hay una lecci&oacute;n importante a extraer de una historia construida as&iacute; es aquella relativa a las hondas ra&iacute;ces de nuestra fragmentaci&oacute;n, sustrato &uacute;ltimo de nuestra inveterada inestabilidad. Dictamen de la geograf&iacute;a y de la historia, que explica, en buena medida, nuestra tradici&oacute;n de caudillos, refundaciones sucesivas y precarios experimentos democr&aacute;ticos. Ni el pa&iacute;s enfermo o embrujado que se ha querido ver, tampoco el pa&iacute;s con futuro brillante per se. Una lecci&oacute;n de humildad m&aacute;s bien es la que esta lectura sugiere, la apreciaci&oacute;n de un derrotero que lejos de culminar en el pante&oacute;n de los h&eacute;roes encuentra en una milenaria vocaci&oacute;n de supervivencia su clave &uacute;ltima y su promesa. Un pa&iacute;s de sobrevivientes, en suma, a&uacute;n a la espera de una genuina reconciliaci&oacute;n."},{"Title":"Reading Series Fiction: From Arthur Ransome to Gene Kemp","review":"A readable and accessible analysis of a number of children's book series, this book focuses on British, rather than American authors. An extensive section is devoted to Arthur Ransome, but L. M. Boston, Susan Cooper, Enid Blyton, and Antonia Forest (among others) are also included. Watson's analysis of the literary qualities of these authors is enlightening and readers interested in British popular fiction for children should find much to savor here."},{"Title":"To Die for Germany: Heroes in the Nazi Pantheon","review":"Jay Baird reviews the nazi martyrs, such as Horst Wessel and Herbert Norkus, and uses them to explain how the concept of immolation and self sacrifice was so central to the Hitler era. Poets such as Gerhard Schumann are also treated, though there is little on art, sculpture and architecture. Nazi heroes themselves owed much to Germany's mythical past (the Teutonic forests and all) which was especially loved by Himmler who saw himself as a reincarnation of the medieval ruler Henry The Fowler. There is an insightful concluding chaper on the myth of death in the second world war. As the Reich crashed into ruins, Goebbels was still proudly glorifying self sacrifice in his movie epic Kolberg. In this way, nazism sought to equate noble death as the moral equivalent of victory. However, to what extent all this propaganda really influenced the man in the street would make another and equally interesting book."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"I thought this was a very insightful, intriguing, and all-out pretty good book. However, I think the author needs to learn something about women and their needs before he goes off on how we should basically worship men. He kept making reference to 'boosting their egos.' What about the women? We need ego-boosting every once in a while, too, you know!Also, he made it seem like women just plain talk too much. I do agree with that --to a certain extent. However, there also needs to be some agreement and LISTENING going on from the male's side of things. Some men are just so insensitive, they don't listen at all!Dr. Shedd did add some interesting stories during many of his letters, and most were helpful in either deciphering what he was meaning to say or just in getting a point across to the reader.Lastly, this book kind of warded me away from marriage . . . even more. It made it all seem so complicated (as I'm sure it probably is), but it scared me into thinking, 'I never want to get married! There's too much stuff to remember!' However, this book may be a bit old-fashioned in parts, but it does give good advice for marriage, and does, in fact, explain how to 'keep love in marriage.' The good part was that Dr. Shedd gave many helpful hints throughout the book. Now, the trick is to remember them all when --and if --I get married!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Wow! That was an awesome book!! I can hardly put it down after I start reading. There are so many statements in that book. In the book, he hit the most important points in marriage and how to keep it fresh. Even though it is a pretty old book, but a lot of his opinions can still apply in today's world. There are so many married couples in today's society forgot the basic skills to keep a interesting marriage. How to communicate, how to comproimse, how to think about others, and how love. I espically like the chapter &quot;Tell him he is wonderful&quot;. It tells that we should constantly tell our partner how wonderful he is and how much we appricate to have him by our side. We all humans and we like to know how much others feel about having us in their lives. To show apprication not only helps in married relationships but in friendships as well. Personally, I am an international student who studying overboared in the United States. I often receive letters from family and friends. I know I will be really moved if I got the same kind of letters from my family. Just like Houston Post said:&quot; Letters that any father would like to have written and any daughter would wish to have received.&quot;"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Letters to Karen provided an overall and highly informative guide on marriage. Charles Shedd is writing advice on every page of the book. He uses real life examples of good and wrong actions that happen during marriage. I enjoyed discovering how important the little things are in a marriage. As an example Mr. Shedd mentions how important it is for couples to still carry on with things like opening the car door for the lady and telling each other by words or action how important each person is. The author gives a grand performance as he tackles a wide range of topics some include sex, sexual differences, budgeting your money, good housekeeping and more. One area he talks about is moods, his advice to his daughter is to &quot;try your best not to go down into the swamps of despair when he goes down.&quot; Mr. Shedd uses a fabulous vocabulary throughout this book. There were a few parts I did not understand, but looking at the book as a whole it shall satisfy the seeker. I recommend this book to anyone, preferably a female as this deals with marriage from a womans point of view."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"This book is a great book for someone who truly wants to go at marriage the right way, but for those who aren't to serious about marriage they probably will not heed much of what is said in this book. I like the way Shedd sort of put the women in her place and the man in his place. Not that he said the women should be barefoot and pregnant and the kitchen, and the men should work all day, come home, eat, and go to bed. But how the women should do chores, cook, stroke the man's ego, etc. They are things a women knows she ought to do, but feel in this day and age they need to be more masculine. The &quot;Bridge of Communication&quot; chapter I believe was the best it made me open up more to people close around me. I've always been one to close up and to not let anybody know why I'm feeling the way I do. But when reading this chapter it was like a reality check. Communication plays 70% a role in every relatonship. It is such an important part of marriage. My whole life I've never really wanted to get married because I just figured they would all end up in divorce sooner or later. But after reading this book, it gives me some hope that there is some men out there that do believe like this book, and will stay married to one person HAPPILY there entire life."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"this book gives great advice to those who are engaged or wish to get married. this book is about a loving father that gives useful advice to his daughter who is about to get married. this book taught me about different problems that come up when in a relationship and how to deal with them. i think that karen is very fortunate to have such a loving father that is willing to give advice along with personal situations that he found himself in. karens father has a great relationship with his daughter because he tells her whatever is on his mind. when i become a parent i will do my best to have a good relationship with my children just as karen's father was to her. i would recommend this book because people can learn alot about marraige though the letters of karen's father."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Letters to Karen was a great book. I really enjoyed it. This book is about A daughter who askes her father for advice on love and marriage because she just got engaged. The father writes a series of letters with advice on relationships. You don't have to be married to read this book. It helps you understand the opposite sex more better. I am happy I read this bookk, it taught me a lot on relationships and how I should handle things. It also made me think about what kind of wife I should be to my husband. I loved the stories Dr. Shedd had to write about they were interesting and funny. This book has a lot of good pionts and examples. This is an excellent book I recommend it to anyone who plans on getting married or is married."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"This book is incredibly insightful, and was well worth my time. In the way it is written (the context of a father to his daughter) helps me to relate closely to his messages. Because I have not quite reached the age where I would be considering marriage, I apply these truths about males (the explanations for their actions, behaviors, and thoughts) to the guys in my life at this time: my brothers, my dad, etc. Because women obviously differ from men in many aspects, namely their thought process and interpretations of life, it is very useful to get a guy's personal perspective, which is a dominant strength of this book. I was impressed by the father's abilities to portray the picture of a righteous, God-honoring marriage in a way that makes it seem feasible for any who work at it. It was encouraging to read examples from his own marriage where he and his wife had overcome major obstacles and had worked through instances in which their personalities clashed drastically, which might have ended up in heartache, had they not sought God's counsel. The marital advice given is priceless, and I will definitely keep this book to look back on and refer to throughout my life."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Letters to Karen is a compilation of letters that a father wrote to his daughter who was about to be married. Shedd gives advice on how to make a marriage work, along with tips on how to be a pleasing wife. Some of the issues that he discusses are the importance of communication, chivalry, sex, spousal differences, and keeping God at the center of one's marriage. Shedd has counseled many couples in the past and draws his words of wisdom from his own personal experiences and from what he has learned from others. As a husband, he is able to tell his daughter what a man needs and desires from his wife. The book is an especially helpful source to anyone who is getting married or considering marriage in the future. However, I believe that this book will benefit any reader, whether single, engaged, married, etc. I found the chapters on communication to be the most applicable because communication is essential in any relationship. The book addresses many issues and areas of marriage and provides sound advice to the reader that will definitely allow for a happy and successful marriage that will last a lifetime. Some of the topics discussed were difficult for me to relate to, but that is most likely due to the fact that I am no where near ready to start considering marriage. The only negative comment that I have about this book is that it was a little slow-moving at times. Other than that, I found Letters to Karen to be informative and beneficial. I would definitely consider reading this book again when I am thinking about marriage."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"I gave &quot;Letters To Karen&quot; five stars because I found it to be full of interesting information. Even though the book was written in 1965 I did not find it to be as old fashioned as I thought it would be. Shedd gives good ideas on how to keep your marriage going smoothly. For instance: Shedd talked about giving your spouse some space when he or she needs it. I liked the chapter &quot;A Savory Smell From The Kitchen&quot; and how it talked about all the things you could do to make your meals more enjoyable. I thought it was clever how the list went from A-Z in ideas. There was a story that Shedd told in this book that was good if you are having a lot of troubles in your marriage. This couple was having surrmountable problems and were considering divorce when they got an idea. They wrote out all the things they did not like about each other, let the other person read the list, and then they burnt the bad lists. Then they made a list of all the good things they liked about each other, framed the lists, and hung them above their bed. That way they could look at those lists every day and remember the good things they liked about their spouse. I thought that was a wonderful idea. I also admired the way Shedd was able to openly and honestly talk about sex with Karen. I think some dads would have a hard time even thinking that one day their little girl will grow up, get married, and have sex. So, I appreciated his truthfulness. In one chapter it talks about how you should act like you were still courting in marriage. Shedd used the example of husbands opening the car door for their wife. Just little things like that to show you still care. I am very pleased I was able to read this book. I enjoyed it very much, especially because Shedd based a good marriage on having a firm relationship with God. With God anything's possible."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"I found this book's Chinese version in China.

It's never too late to read this book and practice it. ^_^"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Overall, the book was well written, well put together, and the chapters flow well together. The father was very knowledgeable and knew exactly what to say about a topic and when to say it. He had some interesting and funny stories to tell also, which were probably my favorite part of reading the book. He was probably a very good counselor, and after reading this book I probably would want to go to him with my marital problems. While I was reading it, I felt like I was learning a lot about something I have not really ever understood, the world of marriage. Obviously, being 17, I am not married and most likely will not be for a long time. But some people get married right out of college, and I feel it is important to be prepared for whatever comes your way, and this book does a good job of that. The reason only give this book a 3 after saying such good things about it, was that he repeated himself over and over. I also found him droning about something that happened to Karen in the past that seemed to have no relevance to me. Also, the chapters that were on sex were a little risqu&eacute;. Talking about chastity and the importance of sex in marriage and abstinence before marriage is one thing, but describing ways to have sex and talking about not being afraid made me a little uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Charlie Shedd's book Letter's to Karen is a very well written book. The insight's he gave on keeping a relationship strong were very good. I would highly recommend this book for any woman entering a relationship, especially one that could possibly lead to marriage. Throughout the book Charlie Shedd often refers to his personal experience in his own marriage or things that he has dealt with counseling other couples. The fact that Shedd has had so much experience helps to convince the reader that what he is saying is true. Another thing I like about Letters to Karen is that every time Shedd is bringing up a new point he will give an example of what will not work. And then he will tell a cute little story of what one wife does in her marriage to keep that problem from happening. Throughout the book there are certain points that Shedd continues to repeat, he does this on purpose and even tells the reader he only repeats these things because it is very important. Shedd has been happily married for a very long time. He know the things that can keep a marriage good, even in the rough times. His advice is realistic, any woman willing to try to keep her relationship alive and full of love could do the things that he mentions in this book."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"This is an old classic book of advice for a woman before marriage.

Why read books like this? It offers principles and perspective that will make your marriage and relationships better.

It is a book I will look to and read over and over again. Though I am not at an age to get married, this book helped me to know what I need and want in my future husband. This book will also help me in preparing to be the best wife I can be when I get married. Shedd gives very good advice which I can apply to my life today. I am so excited for the time when I get married because I now know more about marriage and I know that, though marriage is tough, God can make it the best marriage ever. A key ingredient in marriage, as Shedd writes, is putting God first. Another key to &quot;keeping love in marriage&quot; is putting the other person first. It is important to be the best servant I can be when I am married and reading this book has helped me realize this. Letters to Karen is an excellent book and I recommend it to anyone who ever plans on getting married. It is also helpful for boyfriend/girlfriend relationships and every day relationships as well. I am so glad I read this book because it has given me a whole new outlook on life, love and relationships."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"When entering a marriage relationship or a serious one that might evolve to that level I encourage people to read this book. This book provides helpful and useful adive in all areas of marriage to keep the love alive. This is a touching book from a concerned father with words of wisdom to his daughter. Mr. Shedd has done a wonderful job in capturing the essence of the relationship. Before I began reading this book I wondered how could one MAN know so much about marriage? I began reading with an extremely negative attitude but now that I have read it I see that Shedd has a knowledge of marriage that everyone should learn about. The fact that he is not basing this book solely off what he learned in school but rather from actual life accounts from his own marriage makes this book mean even more. This book discusses many important issues like sex, communication, emphasising on good things, differnces couples go through, and finances. The chapter on communication was most helpful and meaningful to me. Communication is an important aspect to making a marriage work. Although I have never been in a relationship that was as serious as a marriage or even close to, I know that communication can either make or break the relationship. Talking problems out and understanding where each other is coming from will do a world of good. One other part of this book that I found extremely interesting was the way Shedd explains the womans and the mans role in a relationship. Shows the woman her duties to her husband but still shows that it goes both ways. This is a great Christian guide for marriage and keeping God at the center. I would reccommend this book to anyone married or not."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"I'm 17 and I wanted to tell others about the book I read, Letter's to Karen. I'm so glad that I decided to buy this book instead of borrowing it. From the moment I opened the book, I was highlighting and writing notes throughout it; things that I especially wanted to remember and use. It has given me a challange, of the kind of wife I want to be for my future husband. As I read, I found myself agreeing with everything Charlie Shedd said. He has so much advice to give and all of it is so true. I did not think any of it was out of date even though it was written over 30 years ago. After watching my parent's marriage, I decided I wasn't going to make the same mistakes. I want God to be the center of my marriage. I know this will be a book I will refere to time and time again. I was telling my boyfriend about it, so he read it also. He was amazed at how right on it was on how guys think. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants a good marriage or wants to make theirs even better."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"The intentions of this book, to counsel and give advice on marriage, are wonderful. Many points are made in which I have agreed with. These points were written for the pastor's daughter of Charlie W. Shedd. There were many different good insights given throughout this entire book. He had many good stories and analogies that I am sure I will mostly likely deal with many conflicts in which this book confronts. And what a sweet idea to do for a daughter before she gets married! In marriage, this book would act as a great counselor. However, IN MARRIAGE. I strongly suggest this for being a book someone would want sitting on his or her bookshelf, especially if that person is married. Otherwise, I did find it somehow difficult reading being under the personal fact that I am not hoping to be married for quite sometime. On the bad side, being in a relationship while reading this book caused me to tend to want to put my boyfriend in the &quot;fianc&eacute;&quot; position, which I was really hoping not to do. So, I would suggest that this be read as a book for a couple who is soon to be married. All in all, it was a good book, but suggested for couples who are engaged (in my opinion)."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Letters to Karen.

I also have learned that as a woman of God I need to be a servant to my future husband and love him through every decision he makes no matter if I agree or disagree. I also learned a little bit more from the boys perspective and have become more understanding of them. I really like the fact that this story is about a father writing letters to his daughter. It's good for girls to get godly advice from the men in there lives. Especially there fathers. This book has changed my outlook on marriage. After reading it I am excited for the time in my life when I will experience marriage. That is, if God allows it, which I hope he does. It would be awesome to have the intimate love that comes from a marriage."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"I found that the book, Letters to Karen, was very helpful. It gave a perspective from the males point of view that might not have been known to women going into marriage otherwise. It also put men and women both in their place in a delicate way. This book shows how we are to go at marriage the right and Godly way. One key part of the book I thought was communication. Communication plays the role of 70% of a relationship making it very important to be able to do this in a relationship. This part, as well as the rest of the book, proved to be useful and practical. Another part that really stood out to me was the part that talked about chivalry. How it is still important to open doors and things of that sort after many years of marriage. Also, on the woman's behalf, to do special things for her spouse every once in a while. Letters to Karen also contained tips on how to be a pleasing wife and how we need to be submissive to our husbands. It also talked about numerous things from communication to spousal differences to sex to keeping God the focal point of your relationship. Because this book was written from a father to his daughter he was able to give all this beneficial advice from experience too. I enjoyed that the book included real life examples, it gives you a better idea of what to do should those identical problems arise. All in all it was an informaitve guide with a plephora of wisdom."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Are you in the beginning stages of getting married or even engaged? Well if so, this book might just be for you. Some who read &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; say it is a little too old fashioned for them, but call me old fashioned because I happen to like it. In his book, Dr. Charles Shedd explains to his daughter in letters before she is married tips and hints that will ensure her a successful marriage for the future. I don't believe Dr. Shedd's ideas are wrong, it's just that in many ways they have been forgotten. I enjoyed his book because in a world like today that has eliminated all moral standards, I was able to find encouragement and hope that someone still believes in the same beliefs as I do. I am grateful for that, and if you are searching for ways to better equip yourself for marriage, then buy this book right now and read it. It will present you with successful guidelines to help in your future marriage. I believe with the knowledge Dr. Shedd has shared with me through his book, that I will definitely be a better wife to my husband and I hope that you will too."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"&quot;Letters to Karen&quot; is a compilation of letters from a father, Charlie Shedd, to his engaged daughter Karen. Shedd wrote these letters to assist Karen in being the best wife she could be. Overall, the book was very informative and dealt with a variety of subjects from communication to housekeeping. Each letter is a subject in itself. Shedd does not just scratch the surface either, he digs down deep and offers the truth to a loving and successful marriage. The chapter I found to be the most helpful was entitled &quot;Eyeball-to-Eyeball&quot;. In this letter Shedd focuses on what he calls &quot;The seven official rules to a good, clean fight&quot;. The points he makes, such as lower voices instead of raising them and never quarrel in public, make so much sense and can really help when trouble arises. I am currently in a dating relationship and have actually been able to apply many of the concepts from this book. I can see the awesome affect this book could have in a marriage situation. The ideas presented by Shedd are not out of date even though he wrote this in 1965. They are coming from a happily married man who has had much experience in marriage counseling. I would recommend this book to any woman who is in a relationship or will be at some time in her life. But don't just read it... apply it."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"What a good book! I cannot say how much this book filled my spirit with God's love and direction. I am young, not even close to marriage, but reading this book helped me to understand relationships better so that I will be prepared when I meet that man God has saved for me. My father loves me very much, just as Charlie Shedd loves Karen, so when I read this book I felt as though my father was talking to me. Shedd is a wonderful author and knows very much about relationships and gives so much insight to those in a serious relationship for both man and woman. I especially liked the chapter &quot;Emphasis on the Good Things&quot;. It was so wonderful how the couple he spoke of were so radiantly in love after such a rocky start. Their list of virtues of each other made such a difference in the happiness of their marriage; it was so inspiring. Also, in the Chapter &quot;The 'H' Twins- Humility and Honesty&quot;, I found it very uplifting to read the phrase- &quot;Blessed are the couples who are humble and honest, for they will reach a higher love!&quot; Also in this chapter it speaks of two things that will not reach the household of humble and honest souls- gossip and nagging. I think it is very important in a marriage that these two things are kept out. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and will definetly read it again when I am egaged!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"I was really surprised in reading this book. You would think that a book on marriage written 35 years ago would not hold true in the nineties. But Dr. Shedd truly does understand marriage, and his advice does hold today as well as it did 35 years ago. In this time where &quot;love&quot; is lost pretty quickly in marriages, LETTERS TO KAREN helps provide easy-to-follow guidelines for keeping that love in marriage"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"My grandmother gave me this book around 1966, soon after I married. It provided basic advice about marriage that I took to heart, and the advice and the marriage are still working after 37 years.

There's another generation coming up that I need to loan this book to."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"This book was very informative and told a lot of truth. The way it is written allows you to feel as if you were really his daughter, and that he was the father/counselor you wish you had.

Over all this book was taken into great consideration for my future years."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Letters to Karen is a beautiful collection of letters from a father to his engaged daughter. Dr. Shedd gives some serious advice to his daughter but also lightens his letters with some comical advice. His words give wonderful insight into the mystery of marriage and how to deal with it all. This is an excellent book for anyone contemplating marriage. There is definitely some sound advice in here, much of it being based on the Word of God. Marriage can be a really scary time and I think it's awesome that this father cared enough for his daughter to start her off on the right foot. I truly enjoyed this book and am excited to read Dr. Shedd's other book, Letters to Philip. I recommend Letters to Karen for anyone who wants to know a little bit more about marriage, male or female. Personally, I will be reading this book again before I get married!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Letters to Karen was an incredibly insightful and adorable book. I loved the aspect of a father writing to his daughter to give her sound advice for marriage based upon the Word of God. His letters are often comical and other times very serious. Every engaged couple should read these books if they want to learn how to be better spouses for one another. I would definitely recommend this book to any girl or even any guy. Dr. Shedd is a wonderful man with extremely good advice for all those looking into marriage. I learned quite a bit on what it means to be a good wife and mother and just how hard and rewarding of a job it can be. God has definitely used Dr. Shedd to reach others on being a woman of God. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will definitely be reading it again before I get married!!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"&quot;Letters To Karen&quot; provided me with helpful information that I will definately use in the future! Charlie W. Shedd unlocks the mysteries of dating and marriage relationships, and gives never seen before insight that would dramatically improve the relationships and lives of many people!! This knowledge has transformed my presupposed ideas of the opposite sex, and refreshed my views of a great and working relationship. This book is a MUST READ for all those in romantic relationships, or those who plan to be in one. This will encourage every girl who reads it!!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Overall, I would rate Letters to Karen very high. I thought that it was packed full of good advice covering a variety of topics such as sexual relations, communications, and cooking. Every wife needs a few helpful hints. It definitely pushes the point that God needs to be the center of a relationship; then the inevitable trials will only strengthen one's marriage. I have to admit though that I am more traditional than the average. Many of the comments made could possibly be offensive to a feminist now days. The short letters made the book enjoyable and easier to read. Especially if someone was interested in a specific topic. I would recommend Letters to Karen to anyone getting married and plan to reread it later."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"I thought the book was great, five stars.I especially liked the fact that the father took time to give advice to his daughter about marriage. The book is full of parental affection and religious faith. I agree with Karen's father when he said,&quot;we should look inward at the right time and in the right way&quot;. The father brings up many good points about communication in marriage. He emphasizes the necessity of good communication between husbands and wives. A marriage can only become strong when two people learn to communicate about their problems. Another point he brought up is the importance of looking directly into another person's eyes when you speak to them. This can be difficult but it lets the other person know that you are really listening. Karen's father also emphasized the importance of being able to apologize to your spouse. Some people find it impossible to express their regrets but that is a requirement for a good marriage. In the early stages of courtship, people need to first learn to understand each other's prsonalities. They can start to do this by having fun and joking with each other. I thought the most important point of this entire book is the respect that Karen's father had for the sexual relationship between husbands and wives. He stated that SEX IS A SACRAMENT and helps us recall that in his perfectly marvelous way of doing things, the Creator included this wonder of wonders- &quot;male and female created he them.&quot; God deserves our praise for creating good things for us to enjoy, and among the best of his good things is sex. I recommend this book to anyone because it provides good insight into many of the issues of life that we all must face. Good advice is also provided regarding how to work through your problems when you get into trouble."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"I recommend Letters to Karen. It is an insightful book with good ideas for &quot;keeping love in marriage&quot;. The book is not only fact and opinion, but Shedd also includes little anecdotes and personal stories to bring his book to life. Shedd is a pastor and therefore writes from the Christian perspective. One of my favorite suggestions he made was having a prayer time with your spouse. He also suggested that when you have your prayer time, you should share your requests and then pray silently. At first, I did not understand why he felt that you should pray silently but he goes on to explain it, and his reasons sound very reasonable. I did not find Shedd's book to be filled with outlandish or impossible suggestions, but instead with applications that are more practical that one can use daily. This book is not only for the married woman, but also for the unmarried. Although, I am not married and have not been able to apply the suggestions that Shedd makes, I do plan to use his ideas in the future. By reading about trials that arise and ways to overcome those trials, one can see that marriage is not only a fun, lovey-dovey thing, but also something that requires selflessness, prayer, and commitment."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Letters to Karen was an excellent book. So many times we read books about how our relationships are supposed to be, and what is supposed to happen. Though these books may have very important points and opinions, they lack the personal touch and intimacy that Letters has. It was refreshing to see that even though Karen was all grown up and on her own, she still listen and considered every piece of advice that her dad had to give. There was something in her dad's voice, so caring and sympathetic. It was almost as if her dad was one of her best girl friends. More and more it is difficult for young adults to \\"not be wise in their own eyes.\\" Instead, we choose to seek advice from our friends, never stopping to think that we need to consult our God and our parents first. I found communication to be the central theme of this book. Letters helps set up guidelines when arguing, consoling, or just having a conversation. In addition, I liked how Shedd emphasized that the little things are just as important as the big things. Everyone is so caught up in getting things done, that we hardly ever take the time to make sure that we get it done right! Overall I thought that Letters to Karen was an excellent book to read for those involved in a relationship that could quite possibly take that next step to marriage."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"I read this book in the early 70s as a very young bride. It was good then and still hits the nail on the head.

How awesome is that?!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"I'm a religious pluralist, and even though this book was written by a Christian pastor, I found it (and still find it) extremely helpful in married life. It's inspirational, informative (esp. about men and how their minds work), and full of great advice.I own multiple copies of this book. Why? My father gave me this book when I left home at 18. I will do the same for each of my daughters. It might be the greatest advice my father ever gave me, and I want to pass that on to the next generation.The only people I think it might offend are narrow-minded feminists. People who don't want to recognize that men and women are not just anatomically different, but different in how their minds work, how they process information. If you're not able to see the DIFFERENCES between yourself and your spouse, then you definitely don't want this book."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Timeles truths for those preparing for marriage (be sure to read \\"Letters to Phillip\\" as well)."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Ever wish you knew what to say?

I am perticularly fond of this book because it stresses the significant rold God plays in relationships. Often times people tend to believe they can find a resolution by their own abilities.

Shed provided a lot of good, applicable advice for relationships. It was also very sweet to see how much the author cared for his daughter by teaching her about many aspects of marriage that everyday relationships cannot prepare you for. I thought the chapter, &quot;I'm Sorry, Honey&quot; is an especially good chapter. It is filled with many truths that some people would rather over look. One of those points was the fact that some people find it hard to express regret. If people were more open about the way they truly feel, they would probably be surprised to find that others are fairly understanding. My favorite quote from this book is in this chapter. It says, &quot;'Bigness may never begin unlessn it begins with me'&quot; (p.69). The one subject I did not agree with Shedd on is the role of a submissive woman in marriage. There should be a degree of submissive behavior. However, it seemed to me that the author thought the wife should baby her husband every time he broke a nail or swoon each time his ego needs some support. Spouses should make each other feel loved and cherished, but that just seems a little to fake for me. Another point I strongly agreed with Shedd on is the importance of prayer in marriage. God is the strongest foundation there can be for marriage. If there is no relationship with God, how can He help you? I thought it is really interesting how Shedd said he has never had a married individual or couple come to him for help if they have prayed together. If you have the strength of God's love you can overcome anything. Overall I think this is a great book for anyone who is open to some godly advice for a strong, loving marriage."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Letters to Karen is a caturing book that holds wonderful lessons for women to learn.

I read everything he writes!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"My Bible teacher gave us an assignment to read one of the books that he recommended for this quarter. I choose &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; because it looked like an easy book to read. It interested me that it was a collection of letters about a married life that a father wrote to his daughter. I was told that it might be too old and boring, but actually I found it very absorbing as I read it. The Dad in the letters talks to his daughter very respectably with deep thoughts. He talks about many different struggles incidental to a married couple and gives good examples based on his experiences. Each of chapters taught me some new lessons that I would have never even thought about if somebody did not tell me. Of course, I am not going to be married to someone right now, but those little tips were good to know because I probably will be married someday. I wish I could get some advice like them from my own Dad, but I am from a broken home, and I know that I probably will not. At least now I know where to find some guidance for marriage if I needed some. I think, if there is someone like me, it would be nice for them to read this book. I also want to encourage others who are not from a home like mine just because it might be helpful for them too!"},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"In the book, &quot;Letters to Karen,&quot; the author Charlie W. Shedd gave some basic guidelines for a sucessful marriage. The points in which he made were very good and did not appear to be unreasonable. There are many books which appear to be strick and unrealistic, their ideas for a sucessful mariage seem to be impossible to acheive, but &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; are not. For example, in the chapter &quot;Emphasis on Good Things,&quot; Shedd emhpasises how we should concentrate on the positive &quot;gradually cancling out the bad and raising up the good.&quot; One reason that I like the book &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; so much is because it was written from a christan's point of view. Charlie W. Shed is a pasture who has experience in the areas of marriage for he has helped counsel other married couples and also been himself, this book isn't written from an unexperienced person but a person who has been through many married situations and troubles of his own and of others. In &quot;Letters to Karen&quot; is written by the love of a father to his daughter, this gives it a very heart warming feeling.

I enjoyed reading this book because of all the words of wisdom Mr. Shedd explained from all of his personal stories. One of the most important point he brought up for Karen was that communication within marriage is extremly crucial. He emphasizes the necessity of good communication between husbands and wives at all times. Within good communication, also includes apologizing to your spouse. Some people find it impossible to express their regrets but it is a requirement for a good marriage. The fact that Karen's father took time to give real encouragement to her about marriage is an example of parental affection and religious faith. While reading the book, I could really tell that he loved Karen with all his heart and would do anything for her. A godly marriage will take time to perfect but it is possible. If one has the strength of God's love, you can overcome anything. Overall, this book will one day help me a better wife to my husband. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It's wonderful book to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Although this book may appear to be old-fashioned in many readers eyes, I believe it contains vauluable advice that can be applied in all relationships, not just husband and wife. The author was married for 27 years at the time these letters were written, so he knows what he is talking about. The main emphasis of the book is how to maintain peace and comfort within the relationship, even through hard times. The advice given is very practical. For example, one chapter is devoted to &quot;Tell Him He's Wonderful&quot;. It is simple yet so often neglected by married couples because wives assume their husbands can read their minds. Shedd also lays out guidelines for communication, such as don't use the terms &quot;always&quot; or &quot;never&quot; in arguements, make greetings pleasant instead of with the worst news from the day, and give each other space on bad days and try to figure out how to pull your spouse out of the bad mood rather than join him. I also agreed with Shedd in the chapters &quot;We Know in Part&quot; and &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot;. I like how he describes marriage as growing individually in unity, meaning to maintain your own identity and have things you like to do just for yourself, in order to make the time together more precious. The only sections I did not particularly care for was his advice on housekeeping and cooking and other household duties, because I think that those things are trivial and vary with circumsatnces and personalities. I would recommend this book to anyone who is about to be married or would like to in the future, as I believe there is something for everyone in this book. It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"I think this book is excellent, its a real encouagement and good help for a godly marriage. It gives real live examples of married couples and there struggles. I am only 18 years old and have no plans to get married any time soon but I sometimes worry about what problems I am going to face. In reading this book I have been encouraged and assured that in a marriage you can work things out. I also have learned that as a woman of God I need to be a servant to my future husband and love him through every decision he makes no matter if I agree or disagree. I also learned a little bit more from the boys perspective and have become more understanding of them. I really like the fact that this story is about a father writing letters to his daughter. It's good for girls to get godly advice from the men in there lives. Especially there fathers. This book has changed my outlook on marriage. After reading it I am excited for the time in my life when I will experience marriage. That is, if God allows it, which I hope he does. It would be awesome to have the intimate love that comes from a marriage."},{"Title":"Letters to Karen: On Keeping Love in Marriage","review":"Letters to Karen provided an overall and highly informative guide on marriage. Charles Shedd is writing advice on every page of the book. He uses real life examples of good and wrong actions that happen during marriage. I enjoyed discovering how important the little things are in a marriage. As an example Mr. Shedd mentions how important it is for couples to still carry on with things like opening the car door for the lady and telling each other by words or action how important each person is. The author gives a grand performance as he tackles a wide range of topics some include sex, sexual differences, budgeting your money, good housekeeping and more. One area he talks about is moods, his advice to his daughter is to &quot;try your best not to go down into the swamps of despair when he goes down.&quot; Mr. Shedd uses a fabulous vocabulary throughout this book. There were a few parts I did not understand, but looking at the book as a whole it shall satisfy the seeker. I recommend this book to anyone, preferably a female as this deals with marriage from a womans point of view."},{"Title":"Group Theory and Three-dimensional Manifolds (Mathematical Monograph, No. 4)","review":"Much of the effort in topology in the last 80 years has been in finding ways to use results in algebra to prove things in topology. Stallings was one of the first to show how topological theorems could be used to prove algebraic results. This book reports Stallings' view after more than a decade of reflection on the topic. As such, it's an elegantly clear presentation of the results, but lacks some of the excitement of the original discoveries in his earlier papers. An example appears on page 27, where he invokes the distinctly nonintuitive category theory result, the Adjoint Functor Theorem. When I asked him 30 years ago about its use, he said that an author had to do something to keep from getting bored. So don't get bogged down by the abstract stuff. If you want it, you can get it here, but if you don't, check out Stallings original papers or Massey's great Algebraic Topology book for more visceral presentations.As with anything Stallings has ever written, this gets five stars for content and clarity. The one caveat has nothing to do with Stallings, but more to do with buyers' gullibility or sellers' gall: the price. $200 (OK, 199.95!) is outrageous for a 33 year old 65 page paperback math book that sold for $4.95 when it was new (and for which I paid $3.)

Aside from the soldiers who fought in both armies, and the politicians who attempted to build their respective nations, the true meaning of the Civil War came from those on the home front. It was these \\"citizens,\\" of both the North and South, who through war-related literature such as books, newspapers, poems, magazines, and pamphlets, challenged the ideological pose of war. This \\"imagined war\\" was meant to bring inspiration or to put events or certain characters into context.Fahs focuses primarily on the contributions from female writers who composed numerous short stories, poetry, music, letters, and novels in the war. Literature from men is not excluded as the author brings in the influences of Walt Whitman, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and others who contributed mightily to the written aspects of the war. Few military and political materials are presented in this work, and the author generally excludes much of the religious substance found in antebellum literature. Though Fahs incorporates several avenues of African American writings, no publications devoted to emancipation are included in this book.The depictions of blacks during the war's first two years in the widely known Harpers Weekly and Frank Leslie's was meant as humor but portrayed as degrading. However, after Lincoln's Emancipation these images gave way to illustrations of black manhood and heroism, a point made clear in The Imagined Civil War as \\"tentative and halting.\\"(13) It emphasized that even though this war represented \\"black freedom,\\" blacks were still seen as the lesser race, and this further exemplifies the constant changes of the popular images of African Americans. Southern literature remained committed to portraying blacks as satisfied with slavery. This would turn later from a role of subordination to a celebration of Southern heritage that was clearly fictional from the beginning. Not surprisingly, Fahs fails to incorporate much literature written by blacks (especially from females), as not much material was printed during the war. As seen Margaret Creighton's Colors of Courage, remembrance of the soldiers who fought and died for \\"black freedom\\" took preference over these people of color in the memory of the war.Another recurring theme presented is the importance of gender in Civil War literature. Interestingly enough, northern depictions of a mother's emotional sacrifice as the same as men's heroism gave rise to women as \\"active heroines\\"-though gender differences still existed. Fahs does illustrate the South as less willing to incorporate women into its literature, because most there failed to see women outside of the home. These portrayals further demonstrate that during wartime women were generally perceived in a different light, but would soon fall back into their domesticated settings once the men returned home.Also, the changing face of nationalism in Civil War publications further illustrates continuous struggles, even today, of how much support existed for the war effort. Fahs sees a transformation of this phenomenon into one of diversity. Heroic white and black soldiers, women, and children gave way in the postwar years to just white men and Southern white women. This signified the social and cultural realities of war. An incorporation of religious literature would have further explained the nationalistic attitudes of these people.A glaring omission from this book is the contributions from individual soldiers. Because of their long and frequent stay in camps, these men yearned for literature to keep them occupied. Though Fahs does acknowledge a general feel for newspapers, more insight into particular soldiers' tastes would have explained why periodicals and magazines were a common audience on the war front. Also, but not surprisingly, the author does appear to have a gender bias because much of the literature given was written by women. Though a minor flaw, it would have been slightly better to incorporate more of men's contributions into the \\"imagined war.\\" Moreover, another minor flaw is the author's ability to over-explain her topics. The introduction of the book was so well written that one could have summarized the book's contents from that section alone. Additionally, the chapters were presented with numerous examples-possibly due to the high volume of material collected-that sort of dragged the reader throughout the book. Finally, even with these minor flaws, Fahs creates the first real collaboration of Civil War literature that will add considerable knowledge to Civil War historians."},{"Title":"Soap Recipes: Seventy Tried-And-True Ways to Make Modern Soap With Herbs, Beeswax and Vegetable Oils","review":"This book contains excellent soapmaking instructions, more recipes than any other book published, and it's all done in an entertaining and amusing style.

One of the things I love about it are the recipes are SIMPLE YET CREATIVE and the recipes are for making SMALL batches, which is great for someone just starting out. Rather than messing up a 10 pound batch, you're messing up a 2 pound batch....if you mess up :) . I know I did the first time! But not with this book...the recipes are easy to follow and helps you get to know the basics of soap making.This is a LITTLE book though....and is currently going for a lot of money USED. It was worth the $30 I paid for it, but I would recommend holding off if you see it for a lot more ($50 is a little ridiculous for such a small book...the sellers are obviously out to make a quick buck).However, in the very short time I've owned this book, its become a treasure.

Small recipes mean that a beginner's mistakes won't cost a large volume of expensive oils and won't take a lot of special equipment. When you want larger batches just double or triple the recipes.Recipes are included for any type of oils imaginable and instructions are kept to the basics. I don't worry about matching the recommended temperatures--that gets pretty exacting. The soaps turn out fine even if you ignore the exact temperature readings and just use a general range for temps. The recipes are well calculated and the instructions are clear.Also, when I bought the book 15 years ago there was an insert with instructions for making the soap in a blender. It is quick and effective, but you are limited to the 1 lb. batch. I now use a stick blender and can whip up double and triple recipes quickly.After trying literally dozens of soap recipes from books and websites my three favorites still come from this book. The books by Susan M. Cavitch give you much more technical information, but I think they can also overwhelm a beginner.

It's still the one I refer to the most. Ms. White starts by saying,\\"Let's make soap!\\" Then she describes the process in simple language. The steps are clear and uncomplicated, and one can envision successfully making soap. The first recipe I made was \\"Beeswax Castile.\\" It was a complete success, and everything happened just as the book said. I was hooked.Each recipe in the book makes a 1-pound batch. There are so many recipes that you can find one for any sort of fat you want to use. If you have tallow or olive oil on hand, that will work fine. If you want to spend money on palm or wheat germ oil, that's fine too.I have lots of soap books now. Some dampen the enthusiasm by going on and on about safety procedures, which is not necessary before making a 1-pound batch. Most recipes here use about 2.5 ounces of lye, which is nothing to get worked up over. Now that I make 10 pounds at a time, I am much more careful.

Unlike many other Bonsai books, this book shows you through many examples methods of achieving excellent results from this \`art'. The photographs are simply amazing and I have never seen so many in a Bonsai book before. There are close on approaching 450 in this volume and while there is a lot of text, the text is easy to read and follow. In fact, I found myself sitting down and reading what I thought was a reference book. The quality of the writing is almost novel in its structure and very riveting. If you want to know how to make Bonsai then this is, without any doubt, the book for you. As you develop your Bonsai skills, you go to some of the slightly more advanced sections such as taking a cascade style, where the Bonsai foliage is cascading down over the pot and below the table and turning it upside down to make a wonderful informal upright tree shape. You really have to see this to appreciate it. The core of this book is its excellent series of step-by-step photographs covering all the techniques such as potting, pruning and root pruning, subjects that usually scare the pants of many a beginner. Scattered throughout the book are many wonderful examples of Bonsai from Craig Coussins own collection and prize specimens from a number of other Bonsai collections.Craig Coussins shows you in a clear and concise way all the techniques that fill you with confidence to try these techniques for yourselves.

I have been keeping Bonsai for two years now and this was exactly the kind of book I was looking for-a book to take me from the elements to intermediate. I have seen this excellent teacher twice now and I have been inmpressed with his teaching abilities. This is clear in his writing. Succinct, to the point and no faffle! This beautifully illustrated book must obviously make one or two other Bonsai writers very jealous."},{"Title":"Bonsai for Beginners","review":"I found this book to be somewhat disappointing at best. The positive reviews that other people wrote were misleading. This book should certainly not receive 5 out of 5 stars! I myself am a beginner to bonsai, and found this book to be quite unacceptable in terms of actually instructing the beginner. In fact, after purchasing this book I was immediately inclined to go purchase another book that had more explicit instructions for different bonsai.First off, this book contained detailed information on only a few species of trees. In general, the information presented is put out in such away that it implies all deciduous trees and all coniferous trees should be treated the same way. It doesn't even mention tropical trees, which is what I have found beginners should really be focusing on in terms of learning the basic skills required to care for a tree with a dormancy period.Second, this book contains information that is in no way aimed towards a beginner in bonsai. The different case studies in this book include planting established bonsai in forest-like groups, performing extremely severe pruning on established trees, grafting, etc. None if this stuff is at all basic, and therefore should not be included in a book that is sopposedly geared towards beginnersFinally, this book contains information that is very poorly presented. There are certain sections of parts of the book which don't even explain what they are talking about. Coussins will explain basic procedures to complicated processes of which the reasoning for performing the procedure is not even explained. Basically, I don't even know what he is doing and why; he will explain the process, briefly, despite this. Additionally, he does not even discuss the immersion method of watering, which is the most convenient method of watering indoor plants. This is indicative of his complete lack of thouroughness on writing about bonsai.This book does contain some great pictures, and SOME basic procedures to basic principles. However, Coussins leaves out a great deal of necessary information, and includes information that is in no way necessary; i found a good deal of this book to be completely useless to me as a beginner in bonsai. I could not recommend this book to anyone who is beginning bonsai."},{"Title":"Bonsai for Beginners","review":"This book is excellent when it comes to giving beginners to Intermediate growers information on basic techniques. I am a Bonsai grower of nearly ten years and I wanted to review this book after reading some of the other reviews. Its clear that Craig Coussins has worked to keep such information at the introduction level and he succeeds extremely well. His section on watering, for example, does not cover bad, old fashioned techniques such as full pot immersion, which, on most trees, disturb the soil and cause damage to the fine feeder roots that need to develop in a Bonsai. He discusses proper soil requirements for most types of Bonsai. And their various needs. In a simple way and not a complicated way, unless you find such things complicated of course. He uses clear and well-tried techniques to explain the best way forward. He can not cover all species in such a book of course, after all who can, but he goes a long way towards this by explaining the general techniques for most popular species in many climates. His understanding of techniques can be applied to both indoor and outdoor trees and he discusses that in some detail. His second book, Totally Bonsai is very much a beginner's book and works well, in addition to Bonsai for Beginners which is designed to take the beginner from start to intermediate standard. Apart from being a reference book it is also a very will planned book and easy to follow and easy to read. I can not wait for his next book, Bonsai School, that he mentions on his web site."},{"Title":"The Leader's Journey Accepting the Call to Personal and Congregational Transformation","review":"I was honored to do some editing work on this book. The book is primarily an application of Bowen family systems theory to the Christian life. Its target audience is Christian leaders in that the anecdotal evidence is drawn from leaders' lives and the results are applied to congregational settings.One important message for leaders is that the important elements of Bowen family systems theory --seeing systems instead of merely looking for simple cause and effect, identifying one's own habitual responses to anxiety and conflict, disciplining one's self to be a present, calm, loving influence in the midst of conflict, etc.-- are essential components of the leaders toolkit. I believe that done properly, as acts of surrendering control to Christ and choosing to love others unconditionally, the material in this book comprises some new spiritual disciplines.I believe that this book is important for several reasons:* It is one of the most articulate, secular or Christian, explanations of Bowen family systems theory* It explains the theory in the context of Scripture and Christ; frankly, it is only in Christ that we can have the hope of truly being free to love and free from the influence of our anxious world* It recognizes that all the church growth how-to books in the world are worthless if the leader lives life reacting to others and being an anxious presence in the life of the church* It calls the leader to take responsibility for his/her own behavior, recognizing that learning to love others will result in them learning to love, tooLeader, is their a cold war of silence going on between you and one or more of your immediate family or between you and one or more of your church leaders or parishioners? Are you engaged in a power struggle with somebody else in your family or church? You need to read this book. It will help you to take responsibility for your part and to develop a capacity for choosing to love others even in the midst of conflict.While the target audience is Christian leaders, this book will benefit anyone, particularly any Christian. For we all lead in some way, whether that is just in a family setting or some responsibility in our jobs. And we all our leaders regardless of position if we will obey Jesus' instructions to lead by serving."},{"Title":"The Leader's Journey Accepting the Call to Personal and Congregational Transformation","review":"I wish I had a nickel for all the &quot;ah-ha&quot; moments I had while reading &quot;The Leader's Journey.&quot;Using simple terms and real-life stories, the authors describe the (often overlooked) connection between our personal lives and our role as leaders in a congregation. At a time when we are too often tempted to go through life on auto-pilot (doing things the way they've always been done, acting according to everyone else's expectations, staying trapped in handed-down family patterns), this book comes to us with a message of freedom: By God's grace, you can define who you are and choose to live (and lead) from that place of authenticity.This book invited me to see common patterns in my behavior (at home, at work, at church), and then it outlined for me the skills I need to respond in new ways. With each new page, I found myself saying, &quot;that makes so much sense!&quot; The authors apply tried-and-true realities of family life to everyday church situations. And in the end, we are reminded that we cannot expect to change another person (or a family, or a church) until we do the hard work of changing ourselves.I have already purchased several copies of this book to send to friends in Christian leadership throughout the country. It is an absolute 'must' for men and women in ministry. And strongly recommended for lay church leaders. Read it slowly (don't miss out on the excellent questions at the end of each chapter!) and allow God to work through the pages as you read."},{"Title":"The Leader's Journey Accepting the Call to Personal and Congregational Transformation","review":"This book is really amazing. If I had to pick one thing that I learned from this book (there are too many to count), I would say it was understanding the concept of anxiety.

I am not going to tell you that you'll see immediate results because I believe that just does not happen. What I will tell you is after the first time you use AB ASSAULT you will know that you worked your core muscles!! It felt great! What is annoying about this dvd is Brooke Burke. You do hear her whining in the background and putting her weights aside whenever she gets a chance. I found that to be the worst part of the workout, but if you can ignore her and focus on Gunnar and what he's doing, you'll get a great workout and you WILL see results....I promise. Just don't expect them overnight. I honestly started seeing my clothes fit better after a month of working out every day. Good Luck! :)"},{"Title":"GUNNAR CORE SECRETS AB ASSAULT DVD","review":"I love this workout DVD. It paired with the Bun Battles really gives you a good workout with quick results.

Although his often-biting tone can get somewhat tiresome, the book nevertheless has some very amusing stories - a couple of them downright hilarious. Although everybody will find aspects of the book worthwhile, anglers (especially flyfisherfolk) will see aspects of themselves reflected here, and laugh heartily"},{"Title":"Sex, Death and Fly-fishing","review":"Prurient readers titillated by the title will be disappointed. The only references to sex and death in this book have to do with the behavior of bugs - mayflies that is.Here's an example. \\"A mayfly spinner lies on the surface of the stream in what fishermen call the \`spent' position. To picture it accurately remember that the insect has just had the first and only orgasm of its life and is now, in the natural course of things, dying from it. His body lies flush with the water, wings spread, legs out flat, tails splayed wistfully. Usually he's limp. If he struggles at all, he does it feebly at best. There's probably a silly look on his face, although it's hard to tell with insects\\".So accept it. What this book really is about is fly fishing, and the sex and death are there just to hook you. But can this kind of stuff also reel you in? You'll find yourself wading through material such as the following: \\"I tied on a #14 Michigan Chocolate spinner, a fly that A.K. had turned me onto years before. This thing has fine split tails of pale dun hackle fibers, spent hen hackle wings of the same color, and a thinly dubbed, dark brown body...\\".You would think that this kind of gobbledygook would be accessible and interesting to hard core fisherpeople only, but it's not the case. I've never fly fished, and I was captivated by it.I think the author puts it well: \\"I don't know exactly what fly fishing teaches us, but I think it's something we need to know\\"."},{"Title":"Sex, Death and Fly-fishing","review":"The book is a collection of essays written more about fly-fishing than sex. The writing is crisp and avoids any notion of being \\"flowery.\\" Gierach is at his best when things go bad - real bad. In the context of fishing that is. The worst fishing conditions bring out his laser-focused wit in Sex, Death, and Fly-Fishing. And nobody or nothing is off-limits. He'll take a swing at \\"selective\\" trout and those \\"tweed-coat\\" types along with anyone else who happens to be near where he's fishing. A good example which had me laughing was \\"The Drought Years.\\"But it's not all laughs. Gierach has the unusual talent of sneaking in very lucid observations. Just when you think he's going to continue on his comedic-roll... Bang, he hits you with a simple truth of the matter. A truth you probably knew, but never saw put in words so simply and clearly.Gierach can even render the philosophical without sounding philosophical. Again, he finds a way to express a concept like an \\"ecosystem\\" in terms I think we can all understand:\\"A good ecologist can dovetail into dovetail until the whole thing stretches out of sight. We call it an ecosystem now; earlier Americans called it the Sacred Circle. Either way it can make your little head swim with a vision of a thing of great size and strength that still depends on the underpinning of its smallest members.\\"Makes sense... So, maybe it is about the birds and bees afterall."},{"Title":"Sex, Death and Fly-fishing","review":"After reading this book I want to go fishing.The author does a good job of describing the special joys of this passtime.

So I bought the book, and am so glad I did.Now I am a Montana, California, Washington and Idaho as well as New Zealand trout seeker so reading (this is where the sex comes in) of the northern Colorado Red Quill spinner and its short life span and how the fish love this bugaboo was truly fascinating. Since I had or have never given much though to the life cycles of various water bugs, flies I have seen dancing on the river tops as I have been fly fishing.Chapter 13 titled RIVERS page 166 is utterly wonderful to read since I love small towns in remote areas near pristine rivers that are trout havens. So reading about similar areas like Frying Pan: Basalt, Colorado, the South Platte in Colorado, the Gunnison in Colorado, Roaring fork of the Colorado, the Green River in Utah, Bitterroot in Montana (which I know well), as well as the Yellowstone made me feel as if I were there. I could almost hear the water, the slight breeze and warmth of the sun as well as the sound of the inevitable fly that buzzed nearby. And at 11pm at night it would snap me from the pages and remind me that 'no' you cant go fish until morning.What held my attention and makes this book a favorite read and a must for my bedside table is the states of Montana, Wyoming and Colorado written about so well. Guess having been to each state so often it is like a mini visit each time I re-read the book.Make me want to grab Bill and suggest we move back to Montana where he as born and raised and where my Moms family roots go back to the early 1800's."},{"Title":"Sex, Death and Fly-fishing","review":"I found this book to be less than exciting.

It makes a strong contribution to sales effectiveness for sales reps and sales managers who are involved in complex sales in major accounts. It is especially valuable for companies that sell innovative solutions.Because of its focus on selling innovative solutions, the book cites examples that tend to be skewed toward sales of technical solutions and especially of information technology. But the book also carries useful advice for selling less innovative products and services.Of course selling isn't dead, literally. But it's changing in major ways, the authors say. Sales teams are underperforming because they are ineffective. The cost of sales people has risen much higher than their productivity. If selling isn't exactly dead, it's broken. The authors say the main reason is that sellers are generally unable to cope with the quickening pace of innovation.\\"Sales teams rarely falter when selling commodities because buyers see commodities as safe, comfortable, existing applications,\\" they say. \\"However, once a company's core business has matured and the market for those commoditized offerings has become saturated, organizations must turn to innovation for growth and survival. Unfortunately, there is powerful evidence that the transition of sales teams from selling commodities to selling innovative new platforms is difficult and fraught with failure. The real challenge in selling is selling innovation.\\"The authors' answer, in part, is to develop sales people into \\"business people who sell.\\"The authors rightly give credit to Neil Rackham for his prior contributions in \\"SPIN Selling,\\" \\"Major Account Sales Strategy\\" and other ground-breaking work. They then build beyond Rackham's work to distinguish between appropriate selling behavior for what they call \\"continuous\\" and \\"discontinuous\\" products.Continuous products are already well known in their marketplace. Some level of demand already exists for them. Many customers are familiar with such products and are likely to know when they need them. They may already have set a budget and established a selection process to acquire them.Discontinuous products, on the other hand, did not previously exist in their target market. They are so new that no budgets are set for them and decision processes are not in place to evaluate them. Most prospects have no idea they need them. Such products represent the greatest selling challenge and also the greatest profit opportunity. They are highly differentiated. Because they are not subject to direct competition, they command premium prices. The challenge for the seller is to help people recognize that they need them enough to outweigh the cost and perceived risks of buying them.For sales of discontinuous solutions, the authors propose that sellers use a structured questioning process the authors call FOCAS. The acronym, like Rackham's SPIN, stands for different kinds of questions: Fact Questions, Objective Questions, Concern Questions, Anchor Questions and Solution Questions. The purpose of these questions is to help the prospect recognize his or her latent needs. Having done so, s/he can overcome innate resistance to change and aversion to risk. Only then is a sale possible.For sales of continuous products, the authors propose a significantly different sales behavior. It is more oriented toward helping buyers choose which of several alternate products they prefer in a category they already know and understand.As good as the book is, it could be better in some areas. The authors refer to empirical research they say they've done, but they provide no details on methodology or results. The book contains a few copy-editing errors and oversights. It seems to take more time than may be necessary to describe the differences between continuous and discontinuous sales. The book also seems to spend excessive energy in explaining the need to sell each type of solution differently. The authors describe FOCAS questions very briefly, and they provide no advice on how to develop or refine them. Nor do they give enough guidance on how to use FOCAS questions in everyday selling situations.Even so, the book is well worth reading multiple times.This field is full of books that are little more than thinly disguised, high-priced sales-promotion vehicles whose primary objective is to build the authors' consulting business. While it's clear the authors would also be happy to provide their consulting and training services, this volume is a quality stand-alone effort from a quality publisher (John Wiley). It does not invite you to visit the authors' web site to learn how much you can pay for the really useful stuff they've maddeningly withheld from the book you bought for $30.00.With dedication and imagination, you can begin right away applying the principles they teach. When you overlay the ideas in \\"Selling is Dead\\" onto the step-by-step question-generation process in Rackham's \\"SPIN Selling Field Guide,\\" you can start improving your sales effectiveness almost immediately."},{"Title":"Selling is Dead: Moving Beyond Traditional Sales Roles and Practices to Revitalize Growth","review":"This is THE best book I've ever read (and I have shelves full of them) on the sales process as it applies to products and services which fall outside of being mission critical to the buying organization.If a company has to have some form of what you sell even though they don't have to have your's this book would be of some value. If your offering falls in to the elective category - people like it, think it would helpful, has a wow factor - by which I mean it is a nice to have but the buying organization doesn't absolutely have to have it in some form to continue doing business this is a must have book.The writing style is a bit stiff to the point of being slightly academic at points but this is a reflection of the process which has yielded their step by step methodology. If you've been in elective style sales such as much of the software world you will find that this book helps you think more systematically.I have found help in making this my primary sales process resource and in making the \\"Advanced Selling\\" podcast my primary personal motivation resource.If you are a student of sales you will welcome this addition to your library."},{"Title":"Selling is Dead: Moving Beyond Traditional Sales Roles and Practices to Revitalize Growth","review":"In today's corporate world, the performance of a company's sales team can determine if they will sink or swim. The sales team is responsible for seeking out opportunities from current customers and creating opportunities from potential customers. In the new book \\"Selling is dead\\" by Marc Miller and Jason Sinkovitz, the Ohio-based authors explain the importance of hiring the right salesperson, recognizing the type of demand that is needed, and monitoring the progression of each sales stage.\\"Selling is dead\\" introduces a new way of approaching potential customers based on four types of demand: new application demand, aggregate demand, continuous improvement demand, and economy demand because the authors believe that customer decision-making changes from one demand to another. According to this book, an informed salesperson should be able to recognize the demand type and respond accordingly.This book is at its brilliant best when it explains the Buyer Psychological Model, the importance of creating demand, and how to overcome traditional objections such as a potential client's budget constraints. It also serves as a wake-up call for sales managers who employ mediocre salespeople who are ineffective at creating demand or selling to prospects who are satisfied with existing products or services.However, there are a few problems with this book that may cause its words to fall on deaf ears. The first is that it reads like a dissertation and contains complicated language (i.e. the cadence of commoditization) that may cause the average salesperson without a college degree to run for cover. Next, the book is written from a very strategic point of view and lacks more needed tactical instructions. Finally, the book is written with a slant towards IT firms and may turn off those who are not in technology fields. In other words, it's great for IT sales managers but maybe not for other sales professionals.\\"Selling is dead\\" has the potential to be a groundbreaking book. The authors understand the psychology of supply and demand, the pressures of a sales manager, and the need to move salespeople from inertia. But the success of this book will be determined by the buying public's willingness to make a major paradigm shift in the sales process and the hiring process and a clear understanding in the psychology of how purchasing decisions are made. This book makes an interesting and informative read but it will be even more interesting to see if salespeople worldwide accept or reject it."},{"Title":"Selling is Dead: Moving Beyond Traditional Sales Roles and Practices to Revitalize Growth","review":"I have read dozens of \\"sales\\" books in the past 10 years. Normally I would skip over a book like this but the title caught my eye so I dove in. After reading the first few chapters, I quickly realized Miller's book was different. There are real strategies and tools in Miller's words.The idea of separating key accounts from everyday sales is not a new idea but a very important strategy for all businesses. A lot of people and books talk about strategies for this but few give you specific and effective tools to do it. The key strategy set forth in the book is backed by research and case studies giving validation to the concept. But more importantly, I found this book to be very focused on how to use the research and case studies to develop sales strategies AND salespeople.I would recommend this book to those who truly want to develop their own skills or their team's skills. This book is a solid read and well worth the time!"},{"Title":"Selling is Dead: Moving Beyond Traditional Sales Roles and Practices to Revitalize Growth","review":"This book reiterates what I've long thought - that selling, at least in the traditional (pushy, gimmicky) sense, is completely outmoded for today's much more complicated exchanges between buyers and sellers. The title caught my eye and I found that Selling is Dead addressed the issue of growing complexity (especially when dealing with innovative sales offerings) in a useful and very applicable way.The authors not only explain the theory behind the work, but also provide plenty of case studies to illustrate, and different questioning strategies for the different types of sales offerings.For anyone who A) realizes that selling is dead and wants to take advantage of a better way to exchange offerings or who B) doesn't realize that selling is dead and can't understand why the old tricks aren't working. Great read, and enjoy the humor between the theory!"},{"Title":"Selling is Dead: Moving Beyond Traditional Sales Roles and Practices to Revitalize Growth","review":"'Selling is Dead' offers insightful & provocative perspectives for sales organizations to capitalize on large selling opportunities. It offers readers a disciplined framework in selling. There are two key points of the framework that I cannot agree more: 1)To plan sales activities from prospects' point of view & decision making process, and 2)To develop sales people into 'business people who sell'. These two points may seem to be common sense, but I find many sales organizations overlook them or may find them challenging to be executed successfully; Miller concisely illustrated practical steps (along with some good case studies) to make them happen. Taking Rackham's 'SPIN' process to a new level, Miller elaborated a new systematic questioning process called 'FOCAS' (Fact, Objective, Concern, Anchor, Solution), which I also find to be pragmatic for enterprise-level sales situation."},{"Title":"Selling is Dead: Moving Beyond Traditional Sales Roles and Practices to Revitalize Growth","review":"This book discusses corporate selling and \\"tangible applications\\", but I work in wealth management/financial planning, and the concepts that the book discusses can be applied for individual sales as well.

While Miller certainly wants sell training services many of the new ideas in this book are strategic in nature and apply to any sales approach. The home run concept from my perspective is the idea that sales people have to become part of the over all value proposition and the company needs to put in processes that help their channels achieve this objective. While the book is an interesting read, it is a little on the academic side in parts, but the time spent understanding the nuances of the new concepts and ideas is well worth it."},{"Title":"Selling is Dead: Moving Beyond Traditional Sales Roles and Practices to Revitalize Growth","review":"I am not one to write a review, but I thought that I had to after reading this book.

Poor Arabella is doomed to be ridiculous! Her world of romance never was and never will be. But although she makes the most absurd mistakes, she is intelligent and strangely wise much of the time: she ignores fashion, she believes in complete honesty and fidelity, she rejects all accomodations to practical, but base, worldly wisdom. She constructs a world of her own in which women, who in the real world were quite helpless and treated as chattel, hold real power.It is perhaps unfortunate that Lennox was a bit too much under the influence of Samuel Richardson and Samuel Johnson, both great writers but quite conservative in their views about women and their place in society (firmly under the power of men). The ending of the novel seems rushed and sad. Poor Arabella, so delightfully original throughout most of the novel, is &quot;reformed&quot;--as one of my friends said after reading it, and so &quot;she becomes completely ordinary.&quot; If it weren't for the ending, the book would get five stars."},{"Title":"The Female Quixote, Or, the Adventures of Arabella (Worlds Classics)","review":"I bought the copy of this book that was being sold by Amazon and was published by General Books.

It made it a struggle to read. For example: page 86 \\"liNI) of the second book\\" or on page 69 \\"Ac-corJirgly\\". Those are just two of the hundreds of errors.

There are many typographical errors - anything Dipthongs come out in weird characters, and there are several mispellings (and this beyond the non-standardized pronunciations; at various points the characters' names are misspelled).The entire edition looks as though it has been merely cut and pasted from one of the many free online texts onto MSWord, without much of a proofreading. You may as well do the same and avoid paying the 10 bucks + shipping."},{"Title":"The Female Quixote, Or, the Adventures of Arabella (Worlds Classics)","review":"Written just over a 100 years after the publication of Cervantes' DON QUIXOTE, Charlotte Lennox's THE FEMALE QUIXOTE is interesting for several reasons, not the least of which being that it's a strong, intelligent narrative written BY an 18th century woman ABOUT an 18th century woman. Writing in a wry, humorous tone, Lennox penned a definitive anti-romance, deftly skewering most, if not all, of the pillars of that genre, and seemingly with great delight, never once leaving a doubt as to where she stood on such matters. Lennox intended to pen a delightful little didactic tale centering around the foolishness inherent in lettings one's imagination get the better of oneself, and in this she succeeded admirably. And yet, like the proverbial house, a narrative divided cannot stand, and to be sure, Lennox is working at cross-purposes in her novel. To the more cursory reader, she seems only to be writing a sort of \`Dame Quixote;' skewing the mores of Cervantes' earlier novel towards a more female audience, but still drawing the same conclusions as he did about the absurdities inherent in their characters. A deeper reading, however, fleshes out instances within the narrative where Lennox seems to be actually SUPPORTIVE of her main character's quixotry. While on one hand, Lennox seems to be supporting the male patriarchal status quo by bending her Arabella (the female quixote of the title) to the dictates of society and behavior, on the other hand she seems quietly supportive of the power held by the fictitious princesses of Arabella's fancy, and thus Arabella herself. While Lennox's adherence to the former is obvious, and is the tack that she ultimately chooses to emphasize, her support of the latter is more difficult to root out, yet utterly unavoidable in any serious discussion of the work.THE FEMALE QUIXOTE is not a story in celebration of some new dawn of the strong, intelligent woman. It is not a piece of nascent feminism in the style of a Jane Austen or a Charlotte Bronte, both of whom would pen their own takes on the female condition in the century following Lennox's. No, ultimately Lennox conforms THE FEMALE QUIXOTE to expected 18th century sociological mores, just as she conforms her character to those same mores when, at the hasty conclusion, she has Arabella drop her vision of reality and exchange it for the more socially acceptable value system shared by most characters in the novel. This conclusion is a particularly disappointing development because after pages upon pages of pitch-perfect, minute excoriation of popular romances, Lennox deflates her heroine in one chapter, and then hastily, and almost wholly without the wit which made the preceding chapters so interesting, gives her main characters an artless \`happily-ever-after' and simply ends the novel. In her eleventh hour capitulation, Lennox turns her narrative upon itself, weakening its integrity to the point that when she finally gets to Arabella's moment of truth at the conclusion of the novel, she can do nothing but end it straight away before it collapses on itself, writing without any of the flair that characterized the rest of the story. Though Lennox' didactic debt is repaid in full by such an ending, it leaves her narrative in want and the more observant reader skeptical. It is sad to note that in a novel that started off so promisingly, Lennox ends up cheating not only her character and audience, but also any greater purpose the work could have had."},{"Title":"The Female Quixote, Or, the Adventures of Arabella (Worlds Classics)","review":"Alright, let's get it straight, this is an 18th century novel, not 17th, and while it is tedious at times, for the most part it's very charming and often made me laugh.I understand that the ending is the &quot;triumph of rationalism over idealism and romanticism,&quot; but frankly, I was a little disappointed at the abruptness of it. But who am I to criticize? This is an early novel, and the form hadn't quite been perfected yet, so there are a few loose ends and a large digression in book 6, which was the style of the time.I recommend reading this with Rasselas, in which Johnson claims the realistic novel is as dangerous to youth as Lennox says of the romance in The Female Quixote."},{"Title":"The Female Quixote, Or, the Adventures of Arabella (Worlds Classics)","review":"I loved reading this book. The heroine needed a butt whupping, really, that's what it boils down to. She had everything and was letting it go for her 2000 year old romance book collection. Finally, a Countess (who then had to bow out) and also a Reverend Doctor gave her a talking to and told her no more jumping into the river just because a man a mile away was riding a horse toward her! After that incident she had to finally see sense and apparently her eyes were also opened to the noble young man who was in love with her the whole time and took a whole lot of abuse from her. The ending was a bit abrupt but the flow and the feel of the story were way ahead of Jane Austen and Ann Radcliffe. And Lennox had subtle and imaginative incidents of bitchery and cunning worked into the story too. And a sword fight. Hooray for Charlotte Lennox, so sorry that she died without a penny, but her Arabella will live in infamy (the Female Coyote)."},{"Title":"The Female Quixote, Or, the Adventures of Arabella (Worlds Classics)","review":"I laughed so hard at one point I was almost crying.If you enjoy comedy derived from misunderstandings, and enjoy books from this time period, this one wont let you down."},{"Title":"The Female Quixote, Or, the Adventures of Arabella (Worlds Classics)","review":"I certainly have no reason to question the importance of \\"The Female Quixote\\" as a milestone in the development of the English novel, in particular the branch that led to the works of Jane Austen. The Oxford \\"World's Classics\\" edition that I read had an excellent introduction that covered major points regarding its significance, as well as background on Lennox. So the work is without doubt important. The question remains, is it something I would recommend reading for pleasure?This novel is in essence a one-joke story, a form that sometimes works (the obvious example being Cervantes' original) and usually doesn't. Here, where Arabella's wild assumptions generally lead to rather low-key consequences, the form is not without some amusement, but generally falls well short of hilarity. The French romances that are the targets of lampooning are deservedly quite obscure now, at least in English, so it is essential to have an edition like the Oxford one that supplies copious notes. In fact, I think they may overdo this a bit, but better too much than too little. The structure of the novel also has what can fairly be regarded as defects, such as its abrupt ending. (I won't go into further detail about this, as I'd just be rehashing points raised in previous reviews.) So I'm glad I read this novel, but it isn't something I'm tempted to ever read again.Personally, I'm no fan of recent trends toward absolute fidelity to the original editions in modern versions. I can live with editions of Austen that preserve her misspellings (although after a while I'm afraid I'm going to start writing \\"neice\\"). However, all the capitalized nouns, as if this were German, and proper names in italics in the Oxford \\"Female Quixote\\" became somewhat distracting."},{"Title":"The Female Quixote, Or, the Adventures of Arabella (Worlds Classics)","review":"Although usually a fan of 18th Century literature, I found this book extremely tedious to read. The plot is thin, and situations repetitious. The foolish obsession of the heroine with romantic literature is overdone, and her suitor's devotion to her difficult to fathom as Arabella is vain, selfish, and unreasonable. Not a book I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"The Female Quixote, Or, the Adventures of Arabella (Worlds Classics)","review":"Okay, so this story is'nt really very easy to read. Its from the 17th Century, but I did enjoy it. And part of the reason I'm writing this review, is because the reviewers on Amazon(for the most part), are missing the point of The Female Quixote. Its kind of ironic that Charlotte Lennox was crowned the first American Novelist, when she only lived in America for about 6yrs... Talk about depserate I guess. But not only are the Amazon reviewers missing the novels point, but also the person whom introduces the book in this edition.I don't mean to give away the ending, but I studied this in my American Lit. Class at college for like 2weeks. It seems that by this ending we get a few things pointed out:When Arabella is being talked to by the Doctor, he is giving her reasonable reasons as to why she is wrong. The others just told herit was silly, and in a way reinforcing her beliefs. But this Doctor is showing her why what she believes can't be true. And not only that, but by this ending we see that the females in these times had two options: 1. Be what we see as a Coquette, in Miss Glanville, excepting, unhappy marriage for money, and what society hands them, also is the case with Miss Groves, she has been impregnated twice, and in no inconvience to the man she hopes to marry, which will probrably be an unhappy one as well. She has chosen to rebel against society, and she is forced to live life in hiding. Why? Because doing anything besides doing what you are told to do, and marrying well, is considered abnormal.Then on the other hand in Arabella's case, by the end of the book she has to options. 1. Admit one is wrong and go into Holy Matrimony with Mr. Glanville or 2. Continue on with her dillusions and most likely end up in a looney bin. Not much of a choice eh? So in a way, the ending and the book as a whole is showing us the choices that these woman had back then. We should be infinitely thankful. Because most woman back then, could not do much.Someone said that this book was horrible because of the ending, and that it was nothing compared to the novels written a century later by Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte. But believe that Charlotte Lennox probably inspired women to think of what their choices our and maybe try to change the way life was for them. Maybe she even inspired Bronte and Austen. Who knows? I love both Austen and Bronte, but I think that definitely Lennox was an important author as well. Credit should be given to where and whom it is do.So I *hope* that unlike these other readers, you can gain some insight into the world the 17th century women through this book.My hats off to Mrs. Lennox :DGod Bless &amp; *Enjoy* ~Amy"},{"Title":"Hong Kong Airbase Murders","review":"Trans-Pacific Airways has developed an emergency fuel formula which can provide clipper ships with a greatly increased flying range up to 6000 miles. The formula, however, has not yet been perfected.When the operations manager of Trans-Pacific commits suicide, he leaves a note. It mentions the secret formula and its amazing possibilities. The suicide note is published in a newspaper giving the secret formula wide publicity. Trans-Pacific is an American airline and the United States War and Navy Departments do not want the secret to fall into unfriendly hands.Captain Hugh North from G-2, Department of Army Intelligence, is sent to Hongkong to keep the formula away from any potential enemies in a future war. He quickly learns that there are several operatives seeking the formula. There is also a rival airline, Air Oriental, which is planning a Pacific route and will want to have the advantages of the new fuel. Air Oriental is registered as a Chinese corporation but uses German pilots and equipment.Sam Patterson, the chief engineering officer of Trans-Pacific, is murdered. The company's safe is broken into and the formula is stolen. North believes that the murder of Patterson and the theft of the formula are connected. The murder scene reveals several clues including the victim's double-breasted coat which was buttoned on the wrong side and a glass water pitcher containing a woman's flesh-tinted stocking. The leading suspects are Patterson's former and current girl friends. Also under suspicion are the new operations manager of Trans-Pacific and the Macao manager of Air Oriental. In addition, North must consider Mr. Tashima, previously a lieutenant in the Japanese Navy but now in the postal service and Alexis Lebov, a professed White Russian who is thought to actually be working for the NKVD. Louis Martin and his wife are imposters who may really be representing French interests.Hugh North has his work cut out for him in this case at a time when tensions are heating up before World War II in both Europe and the Far East. Germany in particular is singled out as a threat.North is aided in his investigations by Sir George Amberson and Inspector Yu Shih of the Royal Victoria Police."},{"Title":"South From Barbary: Along the Slave Routes of the Libyan Sahara","review":"This book is an account of the author's remarkable two month-long trek, via camel, across the old slave routes of the Sahara. The problem is that the very vastness of the desert, which makes it romantic, arduous, and forbidding, also makes it difficult to translate into prose. As a result there is a certain sameness to the ramshackle procession of now dilapidated desert towns though which the Marozzi and his companion travel - the dramatic highpoints, like the hovels, are few and far between, such as when one of the camels falls into a trench and nearly dies. With little social interest material to work with, Marozzi contrasts his own experiences with the diaries and travelogues of mostly 19th century explorers and abolitionists. The result is interesting, but more understated and less obviously accessible than say the books of Redmond O'Hanlon. Nevertheless, it is quite a tale, and it is apparent that with the dying out of the camel culture embodied by one of their guides, the 76 year old Tubbu nomad, Mohammed Othman, the depiction of an experience that will soon be impossible to relive, if it is even now."},{"Title":"South From Barbary: Along the Slave Routes of the Libyan Sahara","review":"South from BarbaryThink of a caravan of five camels joined for some distance by an unusual dog. Two novice travellers and a succession of travel guides . The journey of the caravan - 1,150 miles in the Sahara. In the day, the caravan moves in the searing heat from one dune to another. There are no landmarks and no place to hide from the sun. At nightfall, the caravan bivoaucs in the desolate sea of sand. The only pit stops for the caravan are the oasis towns which fall in their route. The last pit stop and the destination are 600 miles apart.South of Barbary is a travelogue of this unusual journey. Mr Marozzi, the author and his friend Ned decided to travel from Ghadames to the remote oasis of Kufra in the Libyan Sahara. It is unusual because camels are not used for travel in the area. The only guide they can get for the last bit of journey is a 76 year old man (Surprising to hear when one is brought up on \\" camel is the ship of the desert\\" etc.)This endeavor is a \\"brave\\" attempt. The author and his friend Ned are novices in this kind of travel, they have no idea as to how to buy a camel, what desert travel requires, they do not have sufficient information and maps to help them navigate the vast expanse of sea, modern techniques like GPS do not provide much help. They have to rely on guides who are willing to cover only a part of the distance.Rather than being a bland travelogue on the experiences in the sea of sand and the stops in the oasis this book has much more on offer. It brings out the sad story of the slave trade which flourished in this area. We get to know of the brutality and the scale of human suffering.The author also draws on the rich travel accounts of the previous travellers. One can sense the call of the desert which most of them felt. \\"...The desert is terrible and merciless, but to the desert who have known it once must return...\\" ( as quoted in the book from The Lost Oases by A.H. Bey)The desert also captivates the author with its strange beauty.\\"...Sometimes, standing on the crest of one of these giant dunes, our spirits soared in contemplation of the wild rippling beauty that stretched all around, as far as the eye can see. Nothing could touch these matchless wastes. It was exhilarating to be so removed from any signs of life, and feel a liberating solitude, deep in this terrible expanse. The stillness was compelling. The only thing that stirred was the wind. It hissed across the summits of the rollercoaster dunes, showering us with grainy missiles, cascading dark veils of sand that disappeared as fast as they arose, and swept imperiously across the wide slopes, repainting the dunes a new sheen of gold that lasted only until the next encroaching blast of air. Wind alone had shaped this dreadful expanse, gouging out strange and beautiful patterns of sand. With a sense of wonderment, we drifted through this hypnotic landscape...\\"There are many likeable aspects of this book.- It is informative. One gets to know of the history of this region of the cities in Libya and their interesting customs. This part of the world has had an eventful history from Roman times. We get glimpses of it from the moment the author lands in Tripoli (three \`polis' to the Romans). We get to know about the the Garamantes, Touareg, Tubbu peoples and the Sanusi's. Also of the Roman times and later the Italian campaign.- The five camels bought by the author and his friend named as - the Gobber, Bobbles, the big White, Lebead and Asfar emerge as lively characters. The most lovable being Gobber.- An added drama to the journey is the author and his friend travelling without their passport. They have a constant run in with the law and order authorities every time they come close to civilisation. They also face hotel arrest at their destination.- A good look at the life in the modern oasis towns. How far removed are these oasis from the school book impressions of a small water pond, a few palm trees and camels.The author writes with humour and empathy. What we eventually get is an engaging account of a travel in the desert with flashback of times gone by.Wished the author provided a map of the route , even a hand drawn one would have been useful.It is good that the author did not consider this journey as \\"crazy\\" as the locals did. We therefore have a wonderful book in our hand. Would recommend it to those who love travelogues or would like to know more about the people who lived in the great desert of Sahara."},{"Title":"South From Barbary: Along the Slave Routes of the Libyan Sahara","review":"Justin Marozzi's introduction is undoubtedly the best introduction of any book I have ever read.

It isn't a pretentious pot smoke haze kind of deep nor is it the superficial understanding of the essentials of Religion 101. This is a completely different kind of deep.The book brings together three essays of Corbin's translated from French.1) Cyclical Time in Mazdaism and Ismailism - from the Eranos conference in 19512) Divine Epiphany and Spiritual Birth in Ismailian Gnosis - from the Eranos conference in 19543) From the Gnosis of Antiquity to Ismaili Gnosis - from a conference in Rome in 1956Mr. Corbin discusses the Ismaili ideas of cyclical time, yes. The Ismailis are often associated with the Alamut Assassins of lore but they are so much more than that. He also digs into the ideas of the Qiyamat (the Resurrection) and the beliefs held by the Shi'ites of the Imam-of-one's-own-being and a whole host of other ideas that fall loosely under the banner of the Ismailis.The essence of the book is a dissection of 'gnosticism' and its trajectory from Zoroastrianism/Mazdaism through Greek philosophy in its intercourse with Avicenna in the Islamic world through its eventual and perhaps ultimate manifestation in Shi'ism. It's something of an alternative view to an Incarnationist Christology, an attempt to recover something 'lost' by the worldview of this Christianity of the Councils.The bonus is that you will learn more about all those variant beliefs to be found within Christianity, Jewish and Islamic history and the deeper elements of Zoroastrians, Gnostics, the Ebionites, the Manichaens, the Sabeans and other divergent groups and groups within groups that you may never have even heard of.And these are all interwoven into one grand synthesis that is mind blowing. It's not an easy read. I've read through this twice and am now trying to digest it a third time. It's still dizzying.Yet the work is worth it. There are moments of lucidity that make the journey valuable. This is not for mainstream Christians, Muslims or any others who cling solely to the exoteric traditions. If you are happy there, stay there. This is for those who find something amiss in simple religion and dare to go beyond (or within). But be warned, it's not for the fainthearted.To my knowledge, this is the only work of its kind in English, at least of this depth and magnitude. If you really wish for a deeper view of the spiritual universe, all of Corbin's books come recommended."},{"Title":"Cyclical Time & Ismaili Gnosis (Islamic Texts and Contexts)","review":"This is an astonishing book on gnosticism as it evolved from its origins to its flowering in Ismaili doctrine.

It is a gentle reminder of what we know but may have forgotten and a gentle nudge to get us back on track, operating from our core identity, the I AM presence.In the chapter on Peace, she writes &quot;True peace is not deserved nor attained. It is.&quot; Also, &quot;You do not have to look for peace. It is always with you as My life.&quot; Then later she states that &quot;Carry this consciousness into the battlefield and there will be no battlefield.&quot; &quot;Once you become conscious of the peace I AM, nothing can disturb you nor take the peace from you&quot;As inspiring as it is practical, I have had this book at my bedside for 2 years and still find its call to the spiritual life moves me to stretch beyond my daily routines to a larger understanding of higher consciousness in my daily life."},{"Title":"The GodSelf: Revelation for the New Millennium","review":"The GodSelf book is a true friend and counselor to me.

Absolutely fascinating and VERY Enjoyable."},{"Title":"Usurper's Crown:A Novel Of Isavalta","review":"The Usurper's Crown is the second novel written in the Isavalta series, following A Sorcerer's Treason, but is the first in internal order. In the previous volume, Bridget Lederle is a lighthouse keeper on Sand Island on the shore of Lake Superior in 1899. Her father and her love-child have died, she has never know her mother, and she is estranged from her aunt. Moreover, she has been accused of her infant daughter's death and shunned by most of the town of Bayfield. Then she rescues a stranger from drowning and he convinces her to return to Isavalta with him.In this novel, Ingrid Loftfield follows her sister Grace to a meeting with a drowned man's ghost on the shores of Sand Island in 1872. When Ingrid separates the ghost from Grace, she is saved from the ghost's wrath only by Avan, a foreigner living on the island as a fisherman. They return Grace to the family home, facing hostility from Ingrid's father, mother and brother, but later find a way to meet and exchange stories. Avan is really Avanasy Finorasyn Gorianaiavin, a sorcerer and former tutor of Medeon, a powerful sorceress and the High Princess of Isavalta. Medeon had fallen in love with Prince Kacha of Hastinapura and had become betrothed to him. However, Avanasy had found evidence of falsehood in Kacha and warned Medeon, but she believed Kacha, banished Avanasy and married Kacha. Now he is in exile, but still can perform sorcery with great effort and subsequent extreme weariness, so he struggles to weave a net to overcome the ghost and thus free Grace from its power.Meanwhile, in Isavalta, Medeon's parents, the Emperor and his consort, have died of a mysterious illness and she has become Empress, with Kacha as her consort. While looking for a cure for his withered hand, Medeon has accidentally discovered Kacha's treachery and then she looks for allies to escape him, among whom are Peshek, Captain of the Imperial House Guards, Bakhar, Keeper of the Imperial Godhouse, and Iakush, Lord Sorcerer of Isavalta. Medeon manages to flee to Hung Tse, but Kacha detects Iskush's duplicity and kills him, yet Iskush uses his own death to bring warning to Avanasy.When Avanasy prepares to leave for Isavalta, Ingrid insists on accompanying him. On the voyage there, she finds that the touch of the ghost has allowed her to see into the spirit world and to separate her spirit from her body. She is drawn away from the boat through the Land of Death and Spirit. She encounters the Vixen along the path, but is allowed to continue to the house of Baba Yaga, where she and Avanasy's spirit confront the witch and refuse the demand to assist in the recovery of something stolen.When Kacha discovers that Medeon has fled, he announces that she is pregnant and in confinement, for it is very difficult for a sorceress to bear a child. He has replaced all Medeon's loyal maids in waiting and Chekhania, the first among these ladies, is his minion, scripting notes in Medeon's hand to authorize his actions. Kacha is fairly well pleased that Medeon has fled, but still has the army search for a mad woman who believes she is the empress.This novel is the backstory for A Sorcerer's Treason. Bridget is Ingrid's daughter by Avanasy and so has great powers. Another novel, The Firebird's Vengeance, is planned to complete the trilogy. One would presume that it will be a sequel to this novel.This series takes place along the shores of Lake Superior within our timeline, but also in a mythical world wherein the analogs of Russia, China, and India content for supremacy through force of arms and magic. With both Isavalta and Hastinapura taking arms against Hung Tse, the Nine Elders summon one of the four great protectors, the Firebird.Recommended for Zettel fans and anyone who enjoys tales of exotic cultures, political intrigue, and unusual magic."},{"Title":"Usurper's Crown:A Novel Of Isavalta","review":"I must say, that I at first was disappointed, when I learned that this book was a prequel to &quot;A Sorcerer's Treason&quot;. Now though I would not have missed it. It is true that you know how things between Avanasy, Ingrid and Medeoan will end, but still this time you get the details and get to know the characters on their own accord.So I ended up liking the book, it's well written, and I think &quot;The land of death and spirit&quot; are a very interesting mythology.But I do hope that the last book in the series takes us back to Bridget."},{"Title":"Usurper's Crown:A Novel Of Isavalta","review":"The second book in Sara Zettle's Isavaltan trilogy is unusual in that it pre-dates the first book. Although that seems strange at first, it actually works really well.This time the story revolves around Bridget Lederle's parents, again the story moves between Earth and Isavalta, a land of magic and intrigue. To get there Ingrid Loftfield must follow the sorcerer Avanasy across the land of Death and Spirit.This is a highly enjoyable read that is skilfully written. Sara Zettle is proving as competent a writer of fantasy as she is of sci-fi."},{"Title":"Usurper's Crown:A Novel Of Isavalta","review":"\\"The Usurper's Crown\\" tells the story of Ingrid and Avanasy, who are Bridget's parents, and of Medeaon's past. Many of the criticisms I had for \\"A Sorcerer's Treason\\" are still valid for this novel, so I will not repeat them here. But once again, despite those flaws, the novel was still an enjoyable read.I actually found it very interesting getting to know the full details behind the characters we were only briefly introduced to in \\"Treason\\". It's one thing to know that Bridget's mother died in childbirth, and that her father gave his life to seal the firebird, but it's another thing to read the tale in its entirety. Readers got to know those heroes that sacrificed their lives for Isavalta. We see how the love formed between Ingrid and Avanasy; we get to know first-hand the kind of man Everett Lederle was; we learn the reasons behind Grace's estranged relationship with her niece; we meet Peshek in his youth. And the part I found the most interesting was reading of Medeaon's broken history.In \\"Treason\\", Medeaon is a hard, vengeful woman who has succumbed to madness. But in \\"Crown\\", we see her as a young woman who is afraid of her destiny and beset by treachery. She genuinely loved her husband Kacha and was irrevocably broken by his deceit. Reading about her struggles, her strength, and her intelligence as she tries to regain her kingdom makes her eventual downfall all the more poignant. Readers finally understand why those who remained loyal to Medeaon even throughout \\"Treason\\" did so -- despite her flaws, she was a hero in her own time.One additional issue I had with this book was that Ingrid's role was never really elaborated on. She fell in love with Avanasy and returned with him to Isavalta, which was apparently what one of the spirit powers wanted. But it was never explained why Ingrid was so special to this power. In a sense, she really didn't do anything, but it was repeatedly insisted upon that she was needed. She was a good character in her own right, but fell flat as a heroine. At least with Bridget we understood where her power came from; not so with Ingrid.Again, many parts could have been better, but it was still a good read."},{"Title":"Usurper's Crown:A Novel Of Isavalta","review":"When it is discovered that the princess and heir of Isavalta is a sorceress, the emperor and empress ask the powerful sorcerer Avanasy to teach her how to use her powers. Over the years the two become friends until a political marriage is arranged to Kacha, the nephew of the king of Hastinapura. The princess falls in love with him, but Avanasy warns her that he is treacherous and not to be trusted. His charge turns on him sending him into exile.When the two are wed, she doesn't realize that Kacha is taking over her duties and replacing her loyal supporters with his own people. Only when it is almost too late does she see Kacha for what he is and flees the kingdom, ordering a loyal retainer to find Avanasy and bring him to her at a place she designates. When Avanasy hears her summons, he is posing as a fisherman on Sand Island in Wisconsin. He stands ready to return to his homeland to help the empress defeat her enemies but he brings with him Ingrid Loftfield, the woman he loves, the wife who will sacrifice much to give her husband what he desires.This novel takes place twenty years before the events in A SORCERER'S TREASON and it is just as good as its sequel. Readers watch the empress grow wiser and stronger, willing to admit she is wrong and take steps to rectify the problems her emotional blindness brought about. Avanasy is a true hero torn between duty and love while the mere mortal Ingrid contains more inner strength than the two sorceresses do. THE USURPER'S CROWN is an enchanting reading experience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Road Work","review":"Bowden has cut up previous work for bait and packaged it as a book.

I read it with my 4th grade boy and we both enjoyed it! Don't judge the book by its cover if you have boys."},{"Title":"Strawberry Girl","review":"I loved Lois Lenski's historical books as a preteen, and must've read just about all of them. I even read the very thick 'Ocean Mary,' to the astonishment of some of my classmates. 'Strawberry Girl' was the first of her books I remember reading, in the fourth grade, and I got so obsessed with it I must've read it like 20 times in a row!I appreciate that it shows the realities of life in early 20th century Florida (when the state was very backwoods and full of swamps), and the difficulties of farming the land, but this is not one of those books that held up well for me upon revisiting it as an adult. I'm wondering what I ever saw it in all those years ago, though I'm still glad Lois Lenski's books helped to nurture my love of historical fiction. Though the main characters are Birdie, Shoestring, and their parents, Birdie and Shoestring have an awful lot of siblings to keep track of, siblings who don't really contribute anything to the story. If you're going to have a large family in your book, you should at least feature each member instead of using them as window dressing!I like how there are lots of details of pioneer life in Florida and how people in general lived back then, but those details can kind of slow the story down. At the same time, an awful lot of drama happens, and the storyline often feels rushed. It would be nice to have a break between dramatic incidents and fights between the families! And I quickly became annoyed at the Cracker vernacular. I know that that's how they talked, but it was just annoying to constantly have to read dialogue in accents and with bad grammar and regional phrases. At least it wasn't as teeth-gratingly annoying as the vernacular used in 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.'The last few chapters in particular felt very rushed, leading to an unrealistic, ridiculous deus ex machina ending that didn't fit at all with the earlier parts of the book or the reprehensible Pa Slater's character. Why depict life in this harsh environment so realistically and then tie everything up with neat hospital corners? We're supposed to believe the class warfare between the squatting Slaters and the somewhat more moneyed Boyers would be resolved as easily and peacefully as that?I understand that it originally served to introduce American children to how people in other areas lived, and I'm always glad to see a book where children are depicted in an age-realistic way for their era, but I just feel that this book hasn't aged very well. Hopefully, I'll find that some of Lois Lenski's other books have held up well over time."},{"Title":"Strawberry Girl","review":"Rereading a childhood favorite is a dangerous endeavor. However, last year rereading Reddy Fox went well, so when the ebook version of this Lois Lenski classic showed up on Netgalley, I just had to try it out. I can see why I enjoyed it as a child, but I can't really imagine adding it to the collection if I was a public librarian or, in the realm of more possibility, giving it to my nephew.This is part of a series that Lenski wrote and illustrated in the 1940s about children living in different regions of America. The thought process was that kids saw children around the world in literature but not the vastly different ways of growing up all over America. A good idea, for sure. I can totally see why these books, written in painstaking vernacular to boot, were popular back then. They just didn't age as well as they could have. Or, at least, this one didn't.Although it's not an unenjoyable read and the details of life in rural Florida in the 1940s are painstakingly accurate, it just simply hasn't aged as well as other classics. It is still well-written, researched, and illustrated, however. I'd recommend it to adults with an interest in the history of American children's literature."},{"Title":"Strawberry Girl","review":"I read this with my fourth grade students.

A few things I don'tl ike about the story is when the animals in the story get killed because of the neighbors rage. It's a good book because it serves a good lesson. There's some parts that were exciting and parts that made other people mad. Another part I don't like is when Gus and Joe do something to the teacehr.

With work and neighborly effort, Birdie's family finally makes the strawberry crop into profits and settles things with the neighbors. The book contains descriptions of poor choices between the neighbors and the parents, as well as the strong dialect of the day.InStrawberry Girl 60th Anniversary Edition (Trophy Newbery), Lois Lensky painted a detailed picture of the lives of Floridians in the middle 1900's. It is astonishing to realize that not so many years ago, people were still speaking so poorly and education level so low in so many areas of the United States. While the story accurately depicts the time, the dialect may cause many younger readers to stumble loosing much of the story. This is an excellent read-aloud and better for later elementary due to the feud and the dialect. The e-book contains an illustrated biography of Lenski and presents an old classic in a different format.Received Galley from NetGalley.com"},{"Title":"Strawberry Girl","review":"It's about a young girl named Birdie.

Little do they know how much they'll have to overcome before they're enjoying fruit, however. In addition to droughts, heat, and extreme cold spells, they quickly learn that their neighbors, the Slaters, are less than welcoming. The Slaters allow their cattle to roam free, jeopardizing the young strawberry plants. Mr. Slater is just looking to pick a fight, and a big one, too. The Boyers may be in actual danger. Meanwhile, Bertie Boyer (\\"strawberry girl\\"), befriends Shoestring Slater, a rough-around-the-edges boy with a sad upbringing.

Picking up this story, I was fairly certain that this tale would be a cutesy little number about a girl who picks strawberries for fun. On the cover, after all, you see a little blond barefooted child clutching a cache of yummy red fruit as she walks along in her sunbonnet. I was anticipating Strawberry Shortcake. What I got was \\"Tobacco Road\\" for kids. An oddly shocking delight.Lenski prefaces this book with an explanation of Florida \\"Crackers\\". Personally, I've never heard this term used as anything but a base insult. Lenski, however, seems to think that the phrase is deserving of pride. Concentrating on the hardworking rural natives of Florida, she gives a little background on the history of these people in an effort to, \\"present vivid, sympathetic pictures of the real life of different Americans, against authentic backgrounds of diverse localities\\". In this case, Lenski interviewed \\"Crackers\\" on her own time and used their stories (watered down, as was appropriate) to write this book. The result is a seething concoction of barely contained violence and danger, centered on the lives of two very different Florida Cracker families.The Boyers have just moved into the old Roddenberry house, and they've got big plans. Originally from Marion County, Carolina, the family attempts to settle into their new life and make friends with their neighbors. Unfortunately, those neighbors include Sam Slater. A nasty man with a penchant for drunkenness, Sam's just the kind of guy who doesn't mind causing his fellow man a bit of trouble once in a while. When the wild hogs and cows of the Slaters start eating the Boyer family's crops, tensions begin to rise between the two households. The Boyers are good hardworking people with pride and bright ideas. The Slaters could be categorized as white trash, never lifting a finger to feed their own animals and jealously coveting those nice things their neighbors have. Our hero of the story, Birdie Boyer, has her own problems dealing with Shoestring Slater, a boy roughly her age who's just as likely to brag or throw a snake on a girl's hat as he is help keep his father's pigs out of trouble or lament his own lack of education.Lenski does an interesting thing with the beginning of this book. She begins it through the point of view of seven-year-old Essie Slater, leading you to believe that she herself will be the heroine of this tale. As you slowly come to the realization that her father is not the usual wise/good/loving pop found in most 1945 children's books, the text suddenly switches to the point of view of Birdie Boyer and Essie is never heard from again. Lenski's characters aren't as cardboard cut-outish as they first appear either. At the start, the Boyers seem good and the Slaters bad. Then odd occurrences make you begin to doubt this assumption. Mr. Boyer, in an attempt to teach Shoestring Slater a lesson, whips the boy harshly in front of his mother and sisters (who, understandably, are frightened and furious by this violence). Mr. Boyer is also prone to killing his neighbor's pigs if they get in his way, even sometimes cutting off their ears as a sign. He won't even create a path for Slater's cattle herd to reach the nearest water source, instead fencing up the area and getting mad when it's cut down. The Slaters also win your affection at odd moments. Birdie is quick to blame Shoestring for anything he does wrong, but the boy is a good egg in a bad situation. He has to juggle his family's expectations while figuring out for himself what the right and wrong actions he should take really are.A lot of this book is enjoyable partly because it goes the \\"Little House On the Prairie\\" route and explains the day-to-day goings on of the Boyers' lives in interesting ways. In what other children's book will you learn exactly how to grind sugar cane and pull it for fun afterwards? Or the ins and outs of raising strawberries in naturally sandy soil? What other book explains the intricacies of Florida weather in the spring and summer? Or tells you how to create roses out of paraffin? Part of the charm of \\"Strawberry Girl\\" is in describing how the old Florida pioneers did it. Less impressive are Lenski's pictures. It was with a heavy heart that I discovered that Lenski considered herself an artist first and a novelist second. That's too bad because the illustrations in this tale are particularly poor. I just couldn't like 'em and I suspect they'll easily deter many a prospective boy reader with their girlyness.For a surprisingly dour and sharpely written novel about roughing it, definitely try \\"Strawberry Girl\\". You might find that the ending suffers from being a little too pat (there's a happy finish there that jars with the realism of the rest of the text) but all in all it's still a very interesting read. For a good Florida based kid's book, both this and Carl Hiaasen's, \\"Hoot\\" are excellent choices. A sobering but enjoyable tale."},{"Title":"Strawberry Girl","review":"Strawberry Girl seems innocent enough on the surface -- a book about a little girl and her family moving to a new house, planting new crops, and their hardships. However, the book has a strong overtone of fighting and feuding. The neighbors argue through the entire book. This book reminds me of \\"The Hatfields &amp; the McCoys\\" for kids. The neighbors are constantly trying to \\"seek revenge\\" and \\"get even\\" with each other. Maybe I am just conservative, but I thought the book crossed the line a little for young children when the neighbors started killing one another's animals to seek revenge. I know this book was written in the 1940's and won the prestigious Newbery Medal, but not all books are timeless... some of them show their age and I think Strawberry Girl definitely shows its age with a plot that some parents and teachers might find questionable. There is a good \\"moral lesson\\" during the last two chapters, but still you will have to explain to your children why the neighbors killed one another's animals and why it is not right to do so and to seek revenge.Another questionable act in the book is the drunkenness of the neighbor. He throws all of the families money away on alcohol and gambling. He loses his temper with his wife and his children, and he shoots the heads off of chickens one by one with a shotgun when he is drunk. Again, this one might be hard to swallow (no pun intended) with 3rd graders. The two older boys of this drunken man beat up the schoolteacher so badly that school has to be cancelled for weeks.Another aspect of Strawberry Girl that makes it questionable is the language Lenski uses throughout the book. She uses an extreme southern (almost hillbilly-type) accent with each character in the book. After awhile it becomes tedious and difficult to read. I think it would be all right for 5th graders and advanced 4th graders. However, as a teacher of 3rd grade, I would have to say that most 8 and 9 year olds would find the language too difficult. It is challenging enough for readers this age to get through chapter books and to encounter so many new vocabulary words, but to have to deal with \\"I takened lessons way back in Caroliny when I was a young un and I ain't forgot yet. Hit makes me plumb happy to put my fingers on an organ again\\", may be just a little much for a 3rd grader.My advice is to use this book as a read-aloud. You can read it to your children or your students. This will allow you to pronounce all of the southern dialog and you can explain as you go that there are better ways to solve differences then killing the neighbor's animals and so forth."},{"Title":"Strawberry Girl","review":"I read \\"Strawberry Girl\\" when I was in 2nd grade and found it to be both compelling and disturbing. All of the characters, from the main protagonist, Birdie Sawyer, to the minor characters, exhibited complex emotions and thoughts, which I related to. For instance, Shoestring Slater's ambiguous existence: he felt extreme loyalty to his family and his father, even as he was filled with shame and embarrassment about his father's behavior. Birdie tended to be, at turns, resentful towards and understanding of the Slater's. When her strawberry plants were initially trampled by the Slater's cows, she was enraged and very judgmental. A short time later, when she realized that Shoestring, his mother and sisters had to return all of their new purchases because Mr. Slater squandered away the money he'd earned from selling an animal, she was extremely saddened and felt tremendous sympathy for the family.Why is Strawberry Girl so readable? It's a simple story of the belief in hard work, the idea that all actions have consequences, and that all of us possess a degree of good and evil traits. At the story's turning point, Sam Slater finds God (with the help of the gluttonous preacher) stops drinking alcohol and is saved, thereby positively changing the lives of his entire family. It's a story of hope- even in harsh realities; sometimes people are rewarded, despite exhibiting a lack of hard work or honesty. Amidst all of this turmoil, both families were still able to behave \\"neighborly\\" towards one another. Did the families exhibit forgiveness and acceptance, or hypocrisy? That's for the reader to decide. Nonetheless, Lois Lensky offered up a picture of pioneer life in our nation that was uniquely brutal in its honesty and also comfortingly familiar.This book is one of the few early childhood books I never forgot. In recent times, the category of 'children's books' has gone from being beneficial to being insulting. With the \\"dumbing down\\" of language and plot and the popularity of abridged versions of classic stories, the average child is being cheated out of a strong literary foundation. A story that challenges our children will only motivate thoughtful reflection, spark imagination, improve vocabulary and best of all, inculcate a love of reading that will help in every major area of their lives."},{"Title":"Strawberry Girl","review":"Strawberry Girl is a great book written and illustrated by Lois Lenski. I think that, because every time I started to read it, I couldn't stop reading! Although there are some parts that has violence,it was still very good. I really recommend this book to children ten and up, due to the violence. Strawberry Girl takes oplace in Florida in about the 1900's. It is about a seven member family, and the neighbors. After about a month of settling, the trouble starts, the neighbors get mad, because Birdies dad puts some fences around the fields so that way, Slater's cattle doesn't go into the property. The vegetation, strawberry fields, and cattle are growing very well, Mr. Slater also gets mad, and jealous. Birdie was very helpful in every way, from watering the strawberry fields, to caring for her small sibilings. I like the end a lot, because both families become very good friends. Also people started to call Birdie, Strawberry Girl, because of selling, watering, and arranging the strawberry fields. The rest of the fun is for me to know and for you to find out!"},{"Title":"Strawberry Girl","review":"I liked this Newbery-Award winning book because it's creative and has old-Fashion English. I think Birdie is a neat character becuase she has breath taking adventures like when there is a forest fire and her sister is in her fort inside a tree. Also, I think it is sort of weird how people acted back then, it's just like now - people drink and bad things happen. If I lived in Birdie's time I think I would have a hard time because back then everyone had a hard time getting and earning money. In this book it is exactly the same. All together I think this book is really good and I would recommend it to people who like to read suspenseful books and who like to read about older times"},{"Title":"Strawberry Girl","review":"When I was a child, Lois Lenski was one of my favorite authors. I read Strawberry Girl when I was around 7, and I loved it. I think it introduced me to a rural poverty that was otherwise out of my experience, and left me with a sense of empathy for people whose lives were very different from my own. Nearly 40 years later, I still remember it."},{"Title":"Strawberry Girl","review":"This is a wonderful tale of life in rural Florida in the 1940s. It is the story of \\"Birdie\\" and her family after they move to a new home and start a farm.The book gives a very interesting historical perspective. The plot is riveting and held my children's attention. I also found it entertaining, which is a plus.Another reviewer mentioned the dialect used in the book - it does take some getting used to [even for myself, a born and bred southern gal :) ]. It is very distinctive of that time period and that particular locale, but once you get used to it, the book becomes much easier to read. The dialect is only used in the dialog, so the rest of the book is written in \\"plain english\\".Parents should be aware however that there are scenes in this book that may be upsetting to younger or more sensitive older children. Birdie's neighbors \\"feud\\" with them from the moment they move in, and the father of the neighbor family is a mean drunk who does not take care of his family. He does some horrible things [and Birdie's father does some less than wise things as well]. In one scene, the family's mule is poisoned by the neighbor man. In another scene, he tries to burn their house down. There is also a scene where a boy tries to feed a live rabbit to a rattle snake [the rabbit is rescued in the end] - this could also upset the animal lovers in your home.Why do I still recommend this book? Because it is an outstanding moral tale - all the bad things are clearly bad. The bad behaviors are clearly bad and they have very real [and realistic] consequences for everyone involved in this story. My kids [who have, thankfully, never been exposed to drunkenness] learned clearly WHY alcohol, when abused, is such a terrible thing. I think it is a lesson they will carry with them for life - this book led to my children having very clear and interesting discussions amongst themselves about drinking and drug abuse and why being a drunk is such a terrible thing. It gave them great clarity.In the end, this is a moral tale and a tale of redemption - something the world needs more of in my opinion. Reading this book together was a great experience for my children [and me!]."},{"Title":"Strawberry Girl","review":"I love this book very much although they use broken English like ain't,biggety,iffen and many other things.

Sam Slater,the father of 6 children always gets drunk and is always angry.When Mrs Slater and her children come to Birdie's house for the first time,she thinks Birdie's family is superior to theirs. Birdie is planting strawberries and Mrs. Slater tells the Boyers that the strawberries will die but the Boyers do not listen. Meanwhile,Birdie Boyer gets to know Shoestring,Essie and Zephy. One day, Mr. Boyer,Birdie's dad fences up his land as he doesn't want the Slater's hogs to come into his compound and eat the strawberries. But once,the hogs did come in. Mr. Boyer was so angry that he cut off one of the hog's ears as a warning.Many other squabbles happen to the Boyers and the Slater. Birdie gets to know Shoestring a lot. They try to make their families peaceable but to no avail. One of the incidents was grass fire. Sam Slater purposely set fire to the grass in order to burn the house down. Birdie asked for their help but Sam Slater,Gus and Joe did not budge. Gus and Joe are Sam's children. Mrs. Slater announced that she will help but the husband ordered her to stay in the house.

Many were too dramatic for my purpose and had to be softened; some had to be altered to fit into my plot.\\"As others have observed, this book features wanton & cruel treatment of animals. It also features arson, which threatens children's lives. Drunken fathers threaten spouses, offspring, neighbors, children, and animals.The dialect is very difficult to read (and read aloud) - complete with grammatical errors too numerous for a reader to correct.Finally, there's a strong religious overtone that some may find objectionable.This is not _Little House In The Prairie_ set in Florida.

However, I haven't been terribly successful in passing on love of particular books. Strawberry Girl, along with Lois Lenski's other books about girls from various parts of the US, is one of those I loved but could never convince my older daughter to read. When NetGalley offered this one, I jumped at the chance to re-live part of my childhood (though I must admit that my library has a large, though old set of Lenski's books).Strawberry Girl is set in the early 1900's in Florida when it was still a rural swamp. The main conflict is between a new family in town, a family that puts up fences and gardens and engages in agriculture as business, and a family that has been in town for a long time, or more precisely, the alcoholic father of that family, who is used to allowing his cattle and pigs to graze free and resents the fences the new people erect. This book, along with the others in the series, spotlights the differences in people's lives in various parts of the country prior to the homogenization wrought by television and big box retailers. Birdie and her family are \\"Crackers\\" and we learn the origin of the term. She attends a one-room school and goes barefoot most of the time. The dialogue in the book shows her dialect. They farm strawberries and oranges and drink milk from their own cow. Girls wear dresses made from flour sacks and get hats at the milliner.Any book that can still be found in libraries this many years after it was published has to appeal to someone besides just me, and it certainly appeals to me. It is a children's book--a quick Google search shows grade levels between 3 and 6. I give it an A."},{"Title":"Strawberry Girl","review":"Strawberry Girl by Lois LenskiBrief summary and Review:Birdie Boyer and her family just moved into a small town in Florida. The strawberry farming family was greeted by the Slaters, a backwoods family whose business is raising cattle on the open range. A family feud arises between the Slaters and the Boyers that involves the whole town. The Slaters, mostly Mr. Sam Slater and his two oldest boys Gus and Joe, made it their mission to torment the Boyers. They even went as far as attempting to burn the Boyers' home down and cutting the fences they worked so hard to put up. Along with the Slaters trying to run the family out of town, the Boyers faced other hardships such as a storm blowing the roof off their chicken house and the smoldering heat of the Florida summer. Even after all the trouble the Slaters put them through, the Boyers still lent a helping hand to the Slaters when Mrs. Slater grew deathly ill after Mr. Slater disappeared for weeks with his two oldest sons. When Mr. Slater finally returned, he found the Boyers in his home caring for his sick wife. Because of the Boyers' kindness, Mr. Slater changed his angry, hurtful ways. This story is wonderful in showing how the morals and values of some families are most often different from other families. It also teaches a lot on the ways of life in Florida during the early 1900s. The story inspires its readers to treat others with kindness no matter how the world is treating you because life is more rewarding when it is lived that way. Third or fourth graders will take great interest in the story.

This author deliberately chose various rural areas of the country in which to live, get to know the people about whom she was writing, make accurate sketches of the objects she found there, and perform detailed research of recent past events. Featuring the dirt poor \\"Crackers\\" STRAWBERRY GIRL introduces mainstream American kids to such issues as: the struggle for economic survival, the Importance of being a good neighbor;and the rural controversy of Fences versus Open Range.Many sections of nothern Florida were just emerging from frontier status; it was an era when illiterate and embittered mencallously made their own law by indulging in a rampage of selfish spite and anti social behavior. Trouble between the newcomers from Caroliny and the embedded Slaters brews into a life-threatening feud. The kind Boyer family moves into an old house in the piney woods; Birdie's generous parents show courtesy, hospitality and charity to all, as they try to grow strawberries and make a decent home for their children and an honest living from the untamed land and forest. But the Slaters have earned a reputation for lawlessness; Pa encourages his older sons to be vicious and ultimately vows to drive out the newcomers--one way or another! We pity poor, boastful Shoestring--a youth caught between opposing life styles. Birdie wants to be his friend, but she she often winds up hating him.This story is written in local dialect, but readers will quickly get the hang of the slang. Ms Lenski's B/W illustrations enhance our understanding of the primitive conditions under which her characters operate. Since parents should model family values and peaceful methods of conflict resolution, Pa Slater's brood proves how white trash self perpetuates. Will anything ever cause a change of heart in that scumbag father/miserable husband? Will the country ever be rid of his menace and legacy of revenge? Based on many actual incidents, STRAWBERRY GIRL reads easily and will capture the interest of most elementary children. An excellent springboard for classroom discussion about the dilemma of solving personal problems when there is no legal recourse."},{"Title":"Strawberry Girl","review":"Have you ever wondered what is was like to grow up in the early 1900's?

A hardscrabble life complete with rattlesnakes and alligators and swamps. Yet there was also a beauty to this life, of neighbors helping each other, even when they have little for themselves.

He uses a handful of travellers / observers moving relative to each other at subluminal speeds sending light pulses to each other. Unfortunately his derivation would just as well work and 'prove' time dilation if subsonic travelers were sending sound signals to each other.Time dilation at one milionth of the speed of light? That would regarded ludicrous even by the most fervent believer in Einsteins 2nd postulate for Special Relativity (SR).The author just takes the 2nd postulate for granted without even saying so, much less any justification for that counterintuitive assumption.The book, like unfortunately many others about SR or GR, requires this leap of faith on the part of the reader, although very well hidden in this case. Not that he intends to deceive, the author apparently never questioned his own leap of faith. In other words, he does not apply the 'common sense' that the title promises."},{"Title":"Relativity and common sense,: A new approach to Einstein (Science study series)","review":"For an introduction to special relativity from the K-calculus standpoint, this book has no peer. The K-calculus approach is, arguably, the soundest approach for conceptual clarity all the way to the composition of velocities and twin paradoxes. You won't feel you are being snowed by math tricks. In paperback, this book is high value for the money. Don't look for recent stuff like superluminal physics or details on relativity experiments."},{"Title":"Relativity and common sense,: A new approach to Einstein (Science study series)","review":"After several chapters reviewing concepts, many of which are quite irrelevant to the subsequent discussion, Bondi gives one of the most original derivation of Special Relativity that I have ever seen.Unfortunately, Bondi does make some serious mistakes. For example, he conflates &quot;time&quot; and &quot;elapsed time&quot;, which is analogous to conflating &quot;position&quot; and &quot;distance&quot;. Second, by claiming that the laws of physics only apply to inertial reference frames, I think the author impedes the understanding of general relativity.The author does deserve credit for using the correct formula for time dilation, not the naive gamma factor."},{"Title":"Relativity and common sense,: A new approach to Einstein (Science study series)","review":"Although this book doesn't dive deep intothe equations for Einstein's Theory of Relativity,it is an *excellent* book to learn the ideasbehind it. Relativity is a complex idea andthis book will explain well to anybody who takesthe time to read it and think about things."},{"Title":"Relativity and common sense,: A new approach to Einstein (Science study series)","review":"One must give Hermann Bondi credit for his unique presentation of the concepts from Einstein's Theory of Relativity. To well-educated (at least in physics and mathematics) readers who are familiar with Einstein's Theory, Bondi's approach is insightful. However, for those looking for an alternative way to understand the Theory, prepare to be disappointed by Bondi's presentation. The book continuously uses mathematical jargon which is of course unstandable to those familiar with university mathematics, but that is not at all familiar to everyday folk (example: describing the origin of a graph as the point where the coordinate values &quot;vanish&quot; would confuse those who don't realize that &quot;vanishing&quot; is somewhat of a math slang for the values equaling zero.) At times Bondi trivializes sequential math steps in order to simplify his presentation, but then offers every detail in describing the order of events he offers for his characters; in effect, he loses touch with less familiar readers and creates a loathesome Abbott-and-Costello-type dialogue for familiar readers. For the typical reader that wants a general familiarity with Relativity, I would recommend Einstein's own offering for such readers, RELATIVITY: THE SPECIAL AND GENERAL THEORY."},{"Title":"Relativity and common sense,: A new approach to Einstein (Science study series)","review":"I have read several relativity-for-the-layman books, including Einstein's own work, and this one got the points across to me the best. After digesting this book I could convincingly explain the time dialation (and coriolis effect) on a cocktail napkin.

In my case, Bondi spoke my language."},{"Title":"Relativity and common sense,: A new approach to Einstein (Science study series)","review":"Previous reviewers who rated this book less than four stars have simply misunderstood the purpose of this book. It uses a novel approach to present the special theory of relativity to an audience of non-physicists who are not afraid of a few - very few - equations, as in the proverbial \\"educated high school graduate.\\" Hence Bondi uses numerical examples to avoid many equations. The book is not meant to be a college textbook or complete treatise on relativity!Bondi's approach makes relativity seem almost obvious. The earlier chapters, which some felt were irrelevant, are designed to contrast sound with light, which may be more familiar, or at least less surprising. There is a lot of physics in this bookSome may be misled by a statement in John Durston's preface: \\"Professor Bondi derives Relativity from Newtonian ideas.\\" One cannot derive relativity from Newtonian mechanics. But Newtonian concepts can be used to advantage.My only caveat is that there are several unfortunate typos, especially Eq. (20) on page 123."},{"Title":"Relativity and common sense,: A new approach to Einstein (Science study series)","review":"This is an old book that I bought used. I'm not that impressed with its contents. It is difficult to read."},{"Title":"Relativity and common sense,: A new approach to Einstein (Science study series)","review":"There's no doubting Bondi's credentials or the potentiality of his thesis on the common-sense derivation of special relativity from Newtonian physics, but Bondi fails on two basic fronts:1) The bulk of his presentation relies on a cumbersome supposition (graphical and otherwise) involving several characters moving through space and time to prove that time is a route-dependent quantity. If the reader wants to truly understand Bondi's theory, he or she should plan to sit down with a chalk board or a paper and pen in order to keep the character's names and their travels straight.2) The basis for the presentation is so tedious that eventually one reaches the point of sensory overload and, as a result, ends up accepting the conceptual foundation of Bondi's theory as is -- which is no different than taking Einstein's special theory of relativity at face value. In other words, for this reader, Bondi fails to convincingly derive special relativity from Newtonian physics."},{"Title":"Relativity and common sense,: A new approach to Einstein (Science study series)","review":"This is one of the first books which use common sense approach to the understanding of special theory of relativity using illustrations, drawings and diagrams. At one time this theory was considered mysterious, which is in fact obvious and clear-cut extension of ordinary ideas to the realm of high velocities. The author first presents Newtonian ideas followed by the concept and characteristic effects of special relativity in a non mathematical language. Then he introduces Lorentz Transformation (LT) in chapter 10, which involves systems of coordinates moving relative to each other and then uses LT to establish the basics of the theory. Readers with very limited mathematical background should have no trouble in understanding the elementary aspects of the relativity. This is a cute little book (177 pages, size 7.92'' x 5.36\\"), which is classified into three parts. The first part introduces the classical mechanics; concepts of force, momentum, angular momentum, velocity of light and uniqueness of light. The second part deals with the peculiarities of high speeds, relationship of inertial (uniformly moving, constant velocity) and moving observers and the need for theory of relativity to understand high speed situation and a brief introduction to Lorentz Transformation. The final part discusses the consequences of traveling faster than light, acceleration (non-inertial motion) and high velocities on mass. Chapters 8 and 9 are crucial to the common sense approach to the understanding of relativity. The reader may need time and patience to read these two chapters to understand relativity. Chapter 11 discusses some interesting consequences of special relativity; for travels faster than light there is no link between cause and effect, in other words that effect could precede cause. This book is very affordable and useful; I encourage the reader to consider adding this book to his/her personal library."},{"Title":"Relativity and common sense,: A new approach to Einstein (Science study series)","review":"The basic theme of this book about relativity and common sense is so far stretched that one could call this a con job. Like the editor must have warned Bondi to stay away from equations so as not to turn off the average potential reader thumbing the pages, but we have pages and pages of mental figuring with three characters with individual names to boot.Where he is really caught is in a diagram that is supposed to indicate the obviousness of a 30 degree rotation around the origin. Here 1/2 and the square root of 3 divided by 2 manage to show up, with absolutely no explanation at all. Apparaently he was afraid to say sin(30) = 1/2. Thus somebody who really did not know that would have absolutely no clue about how this self-evident diagram really worked!Thus, as I say, it is con job. A preposterous attempt to link relativity and common sense, like everybody should think in microseconds of light, not feet. (Just try to explain to some youngster how a 8.5 x 11 inch paper is in fractions of a microsecond.) Anything else to Bondi being &quot;degenerate&quot; thinking. I guess he manged to fool even himself.Yet, he does have his own way of looking at it, so if the subject of relativity usually results in drawing a blank sooner or later, well, this approach has a certain merit as a novel way of approaching the subject. It is possible to learn something from him."},{"Title":"Eddie's Garden and How to Make Things Grow","review":"Sarah Garland is a great author of children's books in the UK, and this is a great book for children.

However for those of us born in the 20's it reminds us of the things that were going on as we were growing up and becoming adults. It is a worthwhile read"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The book is a political history of the Third Reich; it's very light on legal, social, economic and military aspects. It could equally be titled as a biography of Adolf Hitler since almost all of the book revolves around this central person. Few other people are covered in as much depth as their importance would warrant - with exceptions of course. Franz Halder and some high placed plotters against Hitler are given good coverage.It's very long but although it could benefit from further editing, it's very readable. Shirer has a flowing style and is not at all dry. It's certainly not an academic text. It's full of the author's opinions, many of them superfluous and fatuous (do we really need half a page to tell us the Nazi leaders didn't look like the conquerors of Europe while dressed in shabby clothes in the dock at Nuremburg?).Shirer is scathing of just about everybody involved, even such people as Birger Dahlerus who did everything he possibly could to avoid a war despite his very limited means. Shirer seems to throw around words like stupid, naive, dim-witted and cowardly quite lightly considering he's often describing highly intelligent people who worked their way to the top of their societies and had to wrestle with difficult ethical and practical decisions (for example those who risked plunging their country into civil war and exposing it to foreign occupation by assassinating Hitler).As a political history written for non specialist readers, it's fascinating, packed full of the well documented detail necessary to get a good understanding of how things happened and why.Much of the analysis is unconvincing. Shirer subscribes to the theory is that Nazism was a more progression growing out of German culture and philosophy prior even to the First World War rather than a response to the difficulties faced by the German nation (such as the prospect of Communist revolution) during the Weimar period. As such, he brushes over such important influences as the starvation caused by the British naval blockade of the First World War - and the huge impact this had on the German psyche (not to mention military strategy).Also notable is that the 1998 Arrow paperback copy is of poor printing and binding quality; many pages were misprinted due to being bent prior to printing; and many pages have fallen out despite gentle handling during the first reading.In summary, although the book is hardly balanced and overly long it's a reasonable non specialist political and diplomatic history of the Third Reich."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"First, the \\"supposed order\\" claim, in which it is argued that because no written order was ever given that such an order never occured, is an easily refutable claim (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examination_of_Holocaust_denial#Evidence_for_Hitler.27s_complicity_in_the_Holocaust). Second, this book is not about the atrocities of Stalin, it is about those of Hitler, and it is not fair to deride it because of this. Third, why is the supposed \\"decline and dissapearance of the white race\\" such a threat, if it is actually more than a myth? And why are \\"diversity and multiculturalism\\" so horrid to you? Why is it so terrible that other cultures than the dominant one be given time to show what their beliefs, values, and historical perspectives are?

Overall it was a colossal undertaking by the author however it is not without its faults. It certainly lacks historical objectivity occasionally, as it never covers colonial atrocities and exploitation committed by the United Kingdom or France. Also it improperly refers to German guns with American titles. For example instead of correctly calling the German sub-machine gun an MP40, he will call them \\"Tommy Guns.\\" Hitler shot himself on April 30, 1945 with a PPK not a \\"revolver\\" as the author erroneously writes, and the Germans used primarily (but not exclusively) the P08 Lugar and the Walther P38 as side arms, not \\"revolvers.\\" I do not mean to niggle over minor details but these are the things that drive historians insane. Nonetheless for a thumbnail sketch of the events, again for the novice, it serves a purpose."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The book was in excellent condition, and the delivery was faster than promised. I was very satisfied.Thanks for the fine service.Mike Derum"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The edition that I own of William Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich advertises that the book is one that \\"shocked the conscience of the world.\\" I saw this mainly as an indication of what the book must have meant to a public that might not have been as familiar with the crimes of the Nazis and, well, accustomed as we are today to frequent and thoughtless analogies; from goofy Mel Brooks Hitler parodies to the Soup Nazi, as a society we seem to have digested this period of human history as just that, a period of history, distant and with little relevance.I think we may be doing a disservice to ourselves. I don't mean to say that this terrible period should not be the subject of humor and satire -- it must! -- but having now completed Shirer's enormous book, I am beginning to think that we are forgetting too much.It's easy to say that, for example, the tea-baggers calling Obama Hitler and comparing the health care bill to the Final Solution are out-of-bounds, an example of overheated rhetoric. But in a way, saying that these kinds of comparisons \\"go too far\\" really doesn't go nearly far enough. And it may upset some of the more bloodthirsty liberals as well to hear that, yes, even doing a Bush or Cheney-to-Hitler comparison is way, way off base.Let's not even deal with the Obama/health care comparisons; they make no sense in the least. But the Bush/Cheney comparisons usually stem from the idea that the Bush team was imperialistic, hungry for the resources of other nations, and mainly heartless about who it hurt in its quest for power. Fine. All of that was true of Hitler. But it's also true of just about every other imperial power in human history. You can't be imperial unless you build an empire. You can't build an empire unless you take someone else's territory. You usually can't do that without committing -- or at least sincerely threatening -- unthinkable violence.But we use Hitler and Nazism as the standard of human evil for good reason. The Holocaust might be the most evil, horrific event of our species' history even if had been merely a mass extermination -- but it was not the first nor the last genocide, not the first or last slaughter of millions, that humans have known. The Holocaust was that plus, if it can be imagined, several additional levels of cruelty; the starvation, the slavery under unimaginable conditions, the insane medical experiments, the sadism of the Nazi captors, and the raw industrialism of the killing -- rounding up the populations of already-rotted-out villages and systematically executing whole neighborhoods and families at once, forcing the soon-to-be dead to jump into pits filled with their dead neighbors and relatives before they themselves were murdered.And when all was lost for the Third Reich, it was not enough to lose the war. Had Hitler had his way in his final days and hours, the entirety of Germany would have crumbled with him, as he ordered every aspect of German life -- stores, waterworks, utilities, factories -- destroyed so there would be nothing left for the Allies to take. As horrifically as he had treated his enemies, he was about to let the same happen to his own \\"superior\\" people for no other reason than pride.Perhaps it's not worth trying to figure out whether anyone in human history was \\"worse.\\" I'm no historian by any means. There are probably men and systems that were more evil but had less opportunity to do such harm (I don't put it past the likes of Al Qaeda or the regime in North Korea to behave so madly and cruelly given the means to do so), and those who may have done more damage and caused more suffering, but are not remembered in the same way. But trivializing the terror that was Nazism in our daily parlance, to use the imagery as something applicable to our current politics is to forget. It's to forget the tens of millions who not only died because of Hitler and his henchmen, but to forget the deep, unspeakable suffering of all those who found themselves beneath the Nazi boot.And it is to forget what it is that brought Nazism to the forefront of German life. It is instructive that Hitler never succeeded in some violent takeover of Germany, despite attempts to do so. In the end, Hitler achieved power through \\"official\\" channels, bit by bit gaining the approval and acquiescence of the government and institutions, and bit by bit exploiting a frustrated and angry populace by stoking its rage, its fears, and its pride. Shirer himself, in a 1990 edition of his 1960 book, wondered whether a then-newly-reunified Germany might be ripe for another similar episode. 20 years later, his fears have not come true. Not there, anyway.But he was right to be watchful. To trivialize the Third Reich today is to lose sight of how it could happen again, not in the Obama-is-Hitler sense, but in the sense of a charismatic person or persons taking advantage of a weakened and frightened public and a spineless government, and doing things in their name that they did not think human beings were capable of. It can happen again, but if we don't learn the right lessons from history, we'll miss it. And it will be too late.All that said, do your brain a favor and take the big chunk of time you'll need to read Shirer's book. Learn something, why don't you."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is journalistically interesting, and that describes both its strengths and its weaknesses. This is not history - it is journalism. There's a difference. Shirer was a journalist and this book is a compendium of his impressions while working in Berlin during the 1930s. Like much journalism, it manages to be entertaining, but is essentially shallow. For depth, I would suggest Hitler's 30 Days to Power by Henry Ashby Turner, or Hubris, by Ian Kershaw. For the casual reader, this may be sufficient, but it is a light read."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Overall, this is an excellent, highly-interesting account of Hitler's Germany, from the early days of the nazi party in the 1920s to the holocaust inflicted upon Germany by the anglo-american and russian forces. I do not mention the Jewish holocaust inflicted by the Germans because Shirer himself doesn't really mention them.And that, I must say, is one of the big problems of this otherwise splendid read. Several aspects of Nazi history are given huge spans of pages and examined in minute detail -- such as the July 20 plot against Hitler, and the wheelings and dealings at Munich in 1938, and yet one of the biggest reasons for the NSDAP's existence -- the eradication of jewish people and their nearly succeeding in achieving this goal, is hardly mentioned.Also, even though this book is hardly ever boring, provided you read it a chapter here, a chapter there (because if you try to read it straight through it will get tedious), the author's continuous, heavy-handed opinions on the facts (are they really all facts?) come off as being rather unprofessional. For example, Shirer blithely dismisses Joseph Goebbels as a \\"stupid man\\" (see the chapters on the July 20 plot). While I recognize in full the evil of the nazi propoganda minister's character, to write him off as a moron is irresponsible. We all know Dr. Moriarty is evil. We all know Dr. Goebbels is evil. But to dismiss either the fictional Sherlock Holmes villain or Dr. Goebbels as an imbecile demonstrates a lack of research at worst, or at the very least a lack of historical objectivity.Even if a person dislikes another person, one must \\"know his man\\" if he is to deal with him. We all know Hitler made a lot of mistakes and committed many crimes. But Shirer here goes out of his way to constantly refer to Hitler as a clown. Evil? Yes. Flawed? Yes. Criminal? Oh yes. Moron? Yes and no.It is Shirer's refusal to examine objectively how Hitler repeatedly outbluffed and outsmarted the world (as in NO, he's not a moron) in addition to examining how Hitler foolishly declared war on the world's biggest power's and was in possession of a lot of discredited racial/political/religious theories (and now hitler enters moron territory).Shirer's refusal to examine with a historian's eye the strenghts of the third reich's villains makes him come off as trying a little too hard to emphasize to the reader that he hates the nazis.Relax, Shirer, no one's going to call you a hitler-lover if you don't call him a fool every two pages, or if you refer to Ribbentrop (the same Ribbentrop who had Molotov crawling in 1939) as a blithering idiot of a wine salesman every time he's looked up from the index at the back of the book.No one's going to blame you -- who had the gall to socialize with the nazis for decades -- for allowing hitler to remain in power, though you constantly defame nazi generals who couldn't bring themselves to murder their commander in chief in wartime.Oddly enough, this book spends exorbitant page space in which the \\"German character\\" is given a thorough schellacking, as though it is intrinsic for German people to want war and to hate the French and to be a vigorous, jealous, bellicose people -- which Shirer implies makes their actions almost understandable if not forgivable, and yet Shirer doesn't seem to examine the tenuous sense of duty and order -- however perverted and exploited -- that prevented German generals from assassinating Hitler.For someone who spent so much time hobknobbing with nazi bigwigs (why didn't YOU murder hitler, herr shirer?) Shirer ought to have known the absolute sense of terror pervading over the German people lest they say the wrong word or make a wrong move. Everyone knew that it would be a Gestapo cellar for them and a firing squad for every member of their family and friends.Would you commit murder, no matter how justified, if you knew your wife, children, relatives, and friends would be hunted down and tortured for your act? Maybe you would, for the good of humanity, or maybe you wouldn't. It's a huge decision and Shirer ought to have explored more the German psyche as to why they could not successfully kill Hitler with conditions prevaling in Germany.Shirer seems to want to reader to think the generals loved hitler while the third reich succeeded and stuck with him until the end because at the core they believed everything he believed. He wasn't there, and he isn't inside their heads, so he should just state the facts and leave his opinions for himself."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is one of the most dog-eared books in a small collection of books devoted to the WWI time period in history because it has been read and re-read many times.William L. Shirer captures the times in a way only one who lived through them can possibly do. It struck me as odd at first how interesting reading about history can be, when one already knows the outcome of the story. But there are lessons to be learned from repeated readings and Shirer does a great job making sure that the reader does not put the book down for long. The footnotes are well done and provide an even greater in-depth look into the events that were unfolding on the pages before you. Shirer is careful to avoid opinionated writing and sticks to the facts as they are known to him like a Captain sticks to his plotted course. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The book tells everything about Nazi Germany.We can learnhow those mad men tried and finally started the war.The booktakes special attention to the political environment and background, where the most fateful decisions are always made, and ordinary people never know nothing about."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"THE GOOD: This entire book is awesome - a must have for any history/WW2 buff, or anyone who is just a fan of great literature. Shirer writes the war in an informative and entertaining way which captivated me and kept me turning pages (ignoring that there were like 10,000 pages to turn!) I absolutely loved this book and have reread it until the pages fell out. This is the definitive book on WW2 from beginning to end.THE BAD: Nothing about this book is bad.THE UGLY: Absolutely nothing.Ubermonkey says that there are tons of books which cover the WW2 era. But without a doubt, none of them cover it like this."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"As a history major I've read a fair number of WWII books, from terribly specific ones like \\"The Psychopathic God\\"- a psychological study of Hitler, to memoirs (like Churchill's) to comprehensive survey texts. None that I have read is remotely as thorough as the Rise and Fall. I started it once as a high-school kid, but found the size a bit daunting. Now that I don't hang out at the mall as much, I've had time to start it again and finally finish it. If you want to know about the war, at least in the European Theater, I doubt you can do better. The author was there, and saw things up close, and while clearly had no use for the Nazi party, he was able to write with a clinical and truly journalistic eye so that the story unfolds under its own power instead of being directed. The book begins with Hitler as a youth, with the bitterness of Versailles and reparations, and ends at Nuremburg, with the final justice. There isn't much that isn't covered in between- putsches, battles, economies, treasons, assassination attempts, diplomacy, ad infinitum, and it is all written well enough to keep a reader's attention. Again, it is a big, big book, and there is probably not much point in tackling it unless you have an interest in ww2 history, but if you do and haven't read this book then your ww2 education is still a bit incomplete."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is an excellent book on the history of Nazi Germany and is full of valuable information. At nearly 1200 pages long i didn't think i would be able to finish it but i couldn't put it down! Even though it is history, it reads kind of like a novel with new plots unfolding and new characters being introduced. It deals alot with diplomacy and the inner workings of the Third Reich so you won't find alot of detailed information on the campaigns of World War II.The story of the German resistance in this book i found to be the most fascinating since the author spread it out throughout the entire book. It started right before Munich as an effort to prevent Hitler from dragging Germany into a war they knew it could not win. And then for the next six years numerous plots against Hitler were hatched only to be aborted at the last minute. Finally on July 20, 1944 they carried it out with a German officer involved in the plot hiding a bomb in his briefcase at the Fuhrer's headquarters in East Prussia. The plot failed and Nazis murderous repraisals against the conspirators are then described.Some people are critical of the author for being too \\"biased\\" an example of this is him always describing Goering as the \\"fat Reich marshal.\\" But can you really blame a guy who witnessed the rise of this truly evil regime? William Shirer admits this himself in the epilogue of the book. Get this book whether you are a beginner or an expert in Third Reich history you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Although we covered Hitler and Nazi Germany in high school history, William Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich provides the details that were lacking from those lectures.- Hitler was a genius at reading situations, people, and motivations, and in manipulating his enemies into a corner. I knew that he was a master orator and a skilled propagandist, but I didn't realize how well he was able to outmaneuver professional diplomats.- The English and French could have stopped Hitler during the Sudetenland incidents (but instead abdicated their responsibilities with Chamberlain's Munich capitulation), and prior to and again during the invasion of Poland (by proactively allying with Russia, and by invading Germany while his army was busy in Poland). At the time of the Sudetenland adventure, the army staff was ready to rebel if France and England had forced Hitler to declare war to get his way.- The defeat of the French was due to a daring tactical use of a new weapon (concentrated tank formations) and a feint of the failed von Schlieffen plan.- An error in judgment allowed the English to escape at Dunkirk. Another error in navigation allowed the RAF to recover from its initial disadvantage.- There was a conspiracy among some high ranking officers to get rid of Hitler throughout the war, but they didn't follow through until the war was nearly over. Shame and ruin came to Germany because nobody had the greatness, courage, or tactical ability to stand up to the increasingly megalomaniacal sheissekopf.For me, the price was well worth the description of the diplomatic intrigue that led to the war. Shirer dedicates nearly half of the book to diplomacy and international issues from the Reichstag fire to the invasion of France. Using primary materials such as diaries, captured German documents, and Nuremberg testimony, Shirer weaves the story of the maneuvering that allowed Hitler to capture Austria and Czechoslovakia without firing a shot; to capture Poland without being attacked by France England, or Russia; and Norway, Holland, Luxembourg, Belgium, and France with minimal loss of life and materiel.On the negative side, Shirer allows his personal opinions to color the narrative far too often. Goering is always described as fat, Ribbentrop is always described as vain, etc. Roehm and several other Nazis are described as homosexual in such a way as to imply that \\"perversions\\" like Nazism and homosexuality [Shirer's characterization, not mine] are necessarily linked. Fortunately, he puts those issues aside when he gets to the meat of the story. Also, I agree with another reviewer that the book could have used a few maps to remind the reader of the location of certain key cities and/or defensive positions described in the narration.On balance, the book is as good as could be expected given the scope of the task. Shirer was a journalist, not a historian, so he approaches the events leading to the war from that perspective, while his history of the Nazi movement prior to Hitler's appointment as Chancellor leaves much to be desired. For example, he doesn't seem to notice how often key figures shift alliances between the \\"mortal enemy\\" Communist party and the Nazi party. His firsthand observation probably influenced his choice of key events to describe, whereas a historian coming along afterward, with no personal experience to bias his selection of events, might have chosen differently. For example, Kristallnacht, the 1936 Olympics, and the Spanish Civil War are all glossed over. Still, the book covers most of the key points; any more depth or breadth would require the book to be longer than its nearly 1200 pages."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer's book is the definitive text on Nazi Germany, and shall be forever more. Anyone who has read it will be awash in the tyrannical obsessions that made 1933-1945 in Europe a true living nightmare. Although it is obviously long, with more subtitles, annotations, and footnotes than one is generally accustomed to, these are essentially to the very nature of the complex subject material. Without peer, its comprehensive study of the years leading up to WWII are both gripping and frightening. Yes, most aspects of the Holocaust (Shoah) are given short shrift, but Shirer never pretended to be a definitive expert on the subject, and other texts define the atrocities much better. What really seperates this book from all the others of its genre are the use of captured Nazi documents. Recently, I saw a 2002 documentary called \\"Blind Spot\\", about Hitler's personal secretary, Traudl Junge, who recounted the last days in the bunker under the Chancellary in Berlin. Most of the commentary she recounted were nearly composed verbatim in this book, written over 40 years ago. If one wants to learn history, and not subjectivism, then this is the account to have in your library."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I found Shirer's book very entertaining to read as i did his Berlin Diaries, but not too useful as a historical source. After all, Shirer was a journalist by trade rather than a historian. It tells a pretty good story (with some exaggerations here and there) and is a great who-is-who book of the Nazi era too. If you are interested in the history of this period it is a good introduction, but do consider looking at other sources before you make up your mind about some of the topics."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I have just finished reading this book. The historical facts are fascinating. Mr. Shirer lays out everything in chronological order with a great detail of facts and background. My only criticism is that he imparts too much of his personal opinion into the book. No doubt that Mr. Shirer must have seen, first hand, and uncovered in his research very horrifying material. However had he just presented the facts, every reader would have come to the same conclusions which he wanted us to come to. If an author does his homework well, the reader doesn't need to be guided by personal opinion to come to the same conclusions as those of the author. I would have come to this on my own. With such horrifying facts, how could the reader reach another conclusion anyway. In keeping his personal feelings and opinions out, this would also have shortened the 1600 pages of this book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Shirer's account is one of a journalist, not a historian. His facts are researched and exhaustive, but he brings no intelligent analysis to the tale. It is a book written with emotion, with prejudice.It is an invaluable work that no student of the Great War must leave unread. But it must be tempered with more balanced works such as Alan Bullock's Hitler: A study in Tyranny and AJP Taylor's Origins of the Second World War. If you're going to read only one book about WWII, Shirer's shouldn't be it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"In reading this book, I found the research into history past and present Germany to be fascinating. Going back to the 18th century was vital for us to understand how Germany came to the thinking it did in the 20th century. Mr. Shirer must have spent numerous hours in painstaking research and eyewitnessing accounts. This book is truly an eye opener for the next generation. However, this book is not without flaws. First, the footnotes are too long, and at times become pages instead of footnotes. Secondly, he imparts to his readers too much of his personal opinions and views. A good author would not spend so much time on this. When an author does his homework as throughly as Mr. Shirer did, and presents the facts, and just the facts without his opinions, the reader is going to come to the same conclusion as the author intended without his guidance by embedding into almost every page his personal view. The horrors committed evoke an opinion from each reader without being guided into the author's opinion. These opinions of the author, if removed, may have shortened the book by a few hundred pages."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is magnificent,it tells about the life of Hitler from the day he was born to his teenage childhood up to his rise to poqwer,Shirer has capture the real drama of the most famous leader during the WW II.He describe the way how Hitler reract after the fall of France up to the height of the campaign at the war in Srtalingrad up to the last days of Hitler."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Almost 1500 pages. If you start on this book, it is so compelling and well written that you will read it to the end. William Shirer writes with authority having been a Berlin correspondent through much of the events set forth in the book. He personally knew many of the people set forth in the narrative (example when Shirer was on the reviewing stand with several high-ranking Nazi officials) and based on his personal knowledge does not cut any of them any slack. (Ribbentrop especially seems to draw Shirer's ire). If you have any interest at all in the Third Reich, this is the book to read. I think the biggest compliment is that, at 1500 pages, you will read all of it!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Despite the exhuberance of the other reviews, I suggest potential readers think twice before reading this particular work. Shirer's arguments are outdated on certain subjects and the book really drags in some places. There are several other histories of the Third Reich that tell the story more effectively and in less time. That said, I enjoyed Shirer's book and his coverage of the major battles (especially Stalingrad) is dramatic. Those willing to invest the time to read it (1400 pages! ) will be better for it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Although I respect this book immensely, I have doubts about just how much the author's prejudices play into it. That is often the case, but I think it is always good to remind people that bias can occur even in great histories.For example, Shirer's references to homosexuals is always homosexual perverts. When homosexual generals disagree it is characterized as \\"the usual petty bickerring common to these kinds of men.\\" Just a few pages later when the \\"straight\\" generals are fighting and disagreeing and trying to out do each other -- it's characteriezed as simple disagreement. There really was no reason for these jibes. They didn't add to the history.If Shirer can let his personal bias in in one area, how much of his history is equally colored by it?Some of the lessons to be learned from WWII and the Reich are centered around hatred, predjudice, bullying, people feeling that they are a master race better than their fellow humans. I wonder if this great author missed some of these major lessons even though he wrote the finest chronicle of the war written to date."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I've been meaning to read this for years (and years). - Not totally easy to read, but VERY interesting and relates to present-day events easily. Buy it (or check it out of the library), read it, and TELL YOUR FRIENDS."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"\\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" is one of my all time favorites. It is not just history but it feels more like a thriller revealing the plots as you read it on. The most remarkable fact is that it is based wholly on facts. Hats off to William.L.Shirer for preparing a book like this. Imagine how he would have consolidated all the facts. The book has quite a good no. of pages(more than 1100). It takes some time to finish it but still it is worth the time spent on it. If any one is interested in the history of Germany under Nazi rule and the insides and outs of the role of Germany in the Second World War then this is the right book. Moreover it also covers enough details of the character and life of Adolf Hitler. Overall one will not regret spending time on this book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I listened to this book through audible and thoroughly enjoyed it.We get an deep insight into Hitler's character and his philosophy.Main thing I got out of this book was-1. Hitler was a conniving character.2. West was filled with appeasers and had no stomach to stand up to Hitler.3. Hitler was a gambler in the battlefront and most of German successes was because of luck\\\\posturing.4. Hitler's luck ran out in Russia where he expected Russians to lay down and surrender but Stalin had other plans.5. Even until the last minute before becoming the chancellor Hitler could muster only 40% of German vote. Only when he took over power he went on a rampage of all established parties and starting getting 99% votes.Overall a very good book and gives an overview of the political side of the WW2."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is recommended for anybody who wants to read the inside story of the rise and fall of Hitler and Nazi Germany. Although World War Two itself is covered extensively on television and in books, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich covers everything that happened during \\"the rise.\\" Fascinating look at how Europe, and particularly Germany functioned before and during WW2."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"If your looking for a book full of history and a book that goes in depth of the subject this book is for you. It's a long book and it is worth reading for history sake but not one I'd be willing to read again. I found the history about the Nazis interesting and this book tells you how it started and how it ended. There is a lot of information I don't think the average person would even know in this book and I found I learned a lot from reading it. If it were not so long I'd probably read it again. Worth the time and money just not one I'd read again."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is a book for readers who like non-fiction and history. It is one of the best books I have ever read, certainly in my top ten. It is not a normal historical document produced by uninvolved historians. Rather, it is the experiences of the author who lived it combined with his post-war research. This is a properly biased historical document. Mr. Shirer writes it from the perspective of the good guys to detail the vast immorality and criminality of Hitler and Germany. This is a must read for those interested in international relations. The book defines and gives context to the term appeasement so that when politicians apply it to trivial things, they reveal they are shameless manipulators willing to misuse history for political gain.One reviewer complained this book is too long and doesn't contain maps. I disagree. When you have a great book, long is good. This book is primarily about politics, domination, and death, not geography. Maps are readily available if you desire one. I believe the original editions had maps on the inside of the covers, but I am not sure. I might also add the book does not contain any videos, but I did not miss them either."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Massive volume, with extensive research done on Nazi Germany, from Hitler's birth to his rise to power as Chancellor of Germany and dictator. Some chapters are quite disturbing and send chills down your spine. I found myself drawing parallel's to the tyranny that is developing in my country. Does the TSA ring a bell (may I see your papers please?). The author writes a stunning narrative. This book, along with Albert Speers memoirs will complete the journey into evil world of Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"i am still amazed at what the germans were able tto do in four short years.

Clean, good condition for a 1960 publication. I wanted to replace my original copy which I gave to my son when I moved. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"As is well known and noted by other reviewers, Shirer's \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" is widely considered the seminal work on the period, at least in the English speaking world. Most of my friends who were at least somewhat historically aware were familiar with the book, and regarded it well. As others have noted, the book is very well written. A journalist by profession, Shirer writes in an engaging style that holds the reader's interest through complex courses of events and makes what one expects to be a massive literary undertaking to be quite accessible.The book is also very well researched. In his foreward, Shirer notes the illustrative stat that the captured Nazi documents weighed a total of about 500 tons (!). Based on the proliferation of original quotes and annotations, it seems clear that Shirer has researched these as extensively as most authors could. He lays out events in great and careful detail, and for the discerning reader interested in a great level of detail, this is of great value. Despite the detail though, I felt that Shirer's perspective of the larger picture, of long-range trends, causes and effects, and the kinds of analysis that make history so fascinating was somewhat deficient. Perhaps it's because he's not a professional historian, or perhaps it's because, as others have noted, he's writing with an agenda and uses facts as weapons, but I found this to be a minor deficiency in the writing, though it is easy to overlook since his style is so readable.Another common complaint is Shirer's clear anti-Nazi bias. Of course it's foregiveable, since it would be very difficult for any person, especially one who lived under them, to not hate the Nazis, but as the prerogative of a historian is to assume the mantle of objectivity, I find the criticism somewhat valid.As the title of the review suggests, I found the book too heavily focused on the military picture, and I felt it paid to little attention to other aspects of the Third Reich. He describes most of the personnel changes in the German general staff, in addition to standing orders and other minor events, in great detail. This may be because he is fixated on downplaying the German resistance movement. In any case, I found that much of this was unnecessary and felt that more detail on some of aspects of the Third Reich which the author treats more lightly would have been more valuable. Examples of such topics include foreign relations with the US, the middle eastern countries and Switzerland, as well as trade policy and the Japanese alliance. While many of these topics may not be pivotal, I feel they should have been covered in what is supposed to be a comprehensive work.Finally, Shirer's discussion of life in the Third Reich is very informative and valuable, especially since most of it is from a first person perspective. He discusses culture and the arts, popular sentiment, militarism, etc. I wish there had been more of it, but what there was was good.I recommend this book as a good introduction to the period, and an in-depth exposition on the military events."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is a must read for those interested in Hitler and The Third Reich. Mr. Shirer was witness to this tragedy in history and writes about it with great insight and knowledge. Great book, highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The book itself arrived right on time and looks and feels just like brand new. Very pleased! Not a blemish, nor any sign of use, nor wear. Couldn't be happier! As to the contents, just getting started, but am already dazzled with the research and study that must have gone into the volume. It is a big book with small print, so my progress is slow. Only manage about 4-6 pages a night with my sight problems, but will get to the end one of these days. The time and study it takes to build such character around each individual amazes me that the book ever got finished. Stay tuned, I'm only getting started. ~B~"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The previous reviews say what needs to be said. Amazingly, this work has been and is being read by many family members and friends of all ages and who have varying interests and backgrounds. A twenty something female family member is reading it for the second time! Very well researched and well crafted. I learned a great deal and am still ruminating over much of it. This remains one of the most compelling and interesting books I have ever read. It sucked me in and I could just not stop. An essential read for all."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The definitive work on the political rise of the Nazi regime in Germany by Shirer. William Shirer presents a fully documented masterful work on the ruination of a great civilization. A detailed description of the total destruction of Germany by Hitler and the Nazi Regime that covers the range of social, institutional, and cultural changes that destroyed a people of great intellect and accomplishments. One wonders how the German people could have allowed this to happen to them. The conduct of the Wehrmacht High Command is shown as cowardly and shameful and a betrayal of their duties to the German people by blindly following the Maniac Hitler."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is my second time reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. The first time I did was during high school, and when I finished the book, it was a monumental achievement, considering the number of pages and the intricateness of the politics involved. It took me a couple of weeks to complete the book largely because I was fascinated with subject proposed by the author. Obviously, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich served as a historical lesson of how World War II came and the coming of Nazi Germany. Prior to reading the book, I had very little knowledge about it, and when I finished the book, I learned so much and did not want to read any more of this subject. Mainly, it is because of the disgust I have with the Nazis rolling out the murderous machine and the obedience of the German people, allowing it to happen. Ten years later, I decided to give The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich another go just for the sake of remembering the information again. This time, it took me a few months because the information, especially the politics within the politics, is extremely bogged down. It doesn't mean that The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a worthless read; it is really a masterpiece of a historical construction. I had a hard time motivating myself to keep going through nearly 1,500 pages, so I took lengthy breaks between reads and had better things to do. I noticed a few things this time around. One, William Shirer tends to select and deselect topics of interest to elaborate in details that go for pages. Two, he doesn't pay much of attention to the battles of Europe, frequently giving terse details to them. Three, he lays personal opinions of the key figures involved. In this one, I personally don't care because it is his book and he was there. But I rather Shirer to refrain himself from calling Hitler a \\"genius\\" which he was not. In fact, he was a big-time loser who believed in his ego, leading to death and destruction at all costs. I saw Michael Jordan to play, but he is not what I call a \\"genius.\\" The word is applicable to somebody who does something that is beyond the natural ability which nobody has ever done. Leonhard Euler and Michelangelo fit that description. Hitler's accomplishments are no different from different rulers of various centuries; it's the same old story: rise to power, rule by ruthless means, and fall before death with no standing monuments. Anyway, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a great book, and I've enjoyed the lesson tremendously. And I will never, in earnest, care to embark for further information because it's too ghastly and disturbing."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I've always been fascinated by WWII and in particular by the Nazis and Hitler and usually read or watch anything I come across on these subjects immediately. Oddly this book sat on my shelf for about 5 years before I finally dove into it (and it's quite a plunge). It took me about 3 months to get through it, not because it was boring (anything but) or even because of it's length but because I found myself re-reading whole sections as I learned details of events I'd never known before. This is certainly one of the best books I've ever read.I recommend having access to a map of Europe and SW Asia while you read."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William L. Shirer's novel is so well written that I cannot put it into the right words. I want to say that it felt like I was there, his descriptions of people and places were very, very heavy. That is the least of my concerns because this is a novel that goes so much farther into the history of Nazi Germany than perhaps any other I have ever read.Shirer's book starts with exhaustive research that takes you into the childhood of Adolf Hitler. While known the world over as a monster, it was still important for me to see what this man's days were like before his deadly actions. Srategies, Socialism, tactics, politics, betrayal and so many other things are brought out and although some historical figureheads better versed on the subject than me may know some of this, I found a lot of it to be somewhat of a lost history that tends to take a back seat to WWII in general."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is an incredibly detailed account of the rise and fall of Nazi Germany. I can't put it down and it's give me a whole new perspective. I knew, of course, of the savagery and brutality of this regime. I didn't know how the Nazi's tricked, murdered and lied their way to power or how the French and British could easily, and should, have stomped on Hitler before he started the war. It's also very depressing but it needs reading."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I re-read this recently on a whim. \\"Rise and Fall\\" has always been a classic and still ranks as one of the best histories of of the Third Reich that I have seen. Well documented from historical records as well as the author's own personal experience from being inside the Reich. Despite the tremendous amount of information, Shirer keeps the story moving and avoids allow the book to devolve into a military history of WW2. The perfect starting point for any study of the subject."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"On the very eve of the birth of the Third Reich a feverish tension gripped Berlin . . . Wow! what a great first sentence! Having read this book almost thirty years ago, it still remains the best and most complete history of the Third Reich I have read. Shires purpose is not merely to describe the events that led up to the founding of the Reich and its eventual destruction; but to discover and document the intrigues, treachery, motives and aberrations that precipitated its rise and fall.I will let others review the history and critique Shire on his research, I would like to comment on the beauty of his prose as he describes what must be the most hellish and destructive state that has existed. Historians have the tendency to be dull, they get so caught up in explaining facts and documenting the movement of armies across strange and foreign landscapes, that the reader tends to get lost in a maze of statistics, foreign names, and seemingly insignificant details. Shire avoids this common pitfall. For instance, after quoting from a German generals diary which described Hitlers intentions in occupied Poland, Shire describes the Nazi intentions in vivid prose. . . Nazi terror. . . forerunner to dark and terrible deeds. . . Nazi barbarism reached an incredible depth. Although Shire, in the introduction of this book made the assertion of strict objectivity, he did not let his objectivity hide the awfulness of Nazi atrocities.Although well written, it is not an easy book to read. Its sheer length of over 1100 pages may be daunting to the faint of heart; yet, if you are not familiar with the Third Reich and want to have an understanding of the people whom were instrumental in its raise and fall, no other book will give you better oversight and understanding of it than The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Very few books in the last 20 years have done what he has done. William Shirer explains from the beginnings of Hitler's youth to the end of the Reich as well as the legacy. He explains how it happened, and why. This is historical journalism at its best."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I rate this book in my all time top 10. It is very well written, goes into fascinating detail without getting bogged down and above all you get the feel of the eye witness account especially during Hitler's rise to power. For example Shirer was present during Chamberlain's visit in 1938 and again at the surrender of France in the Ardennes in 1940. He describes Hitler's demeanour on the latter occasion as he passed him on the way to the railway carriage to accept the surrender. This level of detail and insight elevates the book beyond just another historical work and gives it an authenticity, which is just brilliant. It's a long book, it took me the best part of 5 months but it was time very well spent."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer's book has been an incredibly well-sold book for many years now, largely due to the fact that he was a reporter in Germany for an American news agency during the years that Hitler and his political party grew from being a rabble-rousing minority party to the only one. He provides details about all aspects of the Nazi rise, and implementation of their beliefs and dogmas upon the people. The sheer size of the book, coupled with its small text, can be daunting for some readers at first, but the book's well-written and organized effort make it very compelling and authoritative so many years after its first publication. We used this book in my International Baccalaureate class, and only in specified selections, but the book was so well-written and compelling that most of the students went back and read what they didn't have to afterwards. This book would serve anyone well seeking information on how Nazism took hold, how it ruled its people, and what caused its inevitable problems. Shirer's unusually lucky access to all that happened as a witness makes this a fantastic resource."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The definitive record of Nazi Germany. A must read for any one interested in understanding Nazi Germany and the devastating impact of their rule on the peoples of Europe. I recommend it to any one who wants to understand what happens when a people look to the government to provide every need and to all who want to see how slippery the slope of governmental control really is."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is an absolutely must read book! William Shirer takes us on a journey that not only covers the 3rd Reich but also provides us with insights into how and why Hitler came to power. The events that led to the formation of the 3rd Reich are still relevant and should stand as a warning to all of us over 70 years later."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"A vital account of Germany's descent into hell. This book should be required reading for all of mankind. It is that important. Because we need to know the depth of mankind's barbarity. It happened from 1933-1945 in Germany."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is a masterpiece and a must be reading for every one who whish to understand what it takes for a country to become crasy. What you learn is that it is all chemistry. You bring the right components and if the temperature is right, why, it may all happened again. With despair and poverty as the key ingredients in the mixture. Reading that book will leave the reader quite disgusted for it would have been easy to stop Hitler so many time and instead, France and England, the power that be at the time, opened him the way to become the greatest poker player of all time. You will love Churchill, though."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I was a child during WWII and remember much about it, only from 1942 until the end. I recently read a book that took place during the time of the beginning of the Hitler days but it only gave me an appetite for more knowledge. The best reviews were William Shirer, author historian. It was well documented and gave me more knowledge than I sometimes wanted to know but I give it an A+ you just have to stay with it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"A Classic book. A must read.I have read it many years ago & it is still a very important book. A very important reminder of a very dark the human evel."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Having struggled with digesting the ramblings of Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf, William L. Shirer's history of Adolf Hitler's life & times is a welcome antidote. Though a vast tome of information and facts, it is an easy but absorbing read, an insight into the mind of one of the most reviled but fascinating characters of the 20th century. Despite the dictator's life being well-documented in books and on film, the book reads like an adventure story yet it provides context, both political and personal, historical and chronological as it charts each stage leading to the summit of his career and his eventual downfall. An easy read on a complex subject.James R. Vance"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"An enlightening revelation of the insanity of the Nazi party. The amount of research to obtain the depth of information is staggering. Written in a style that is easy to understand, During the reading of this book I have taken time to digest the subject matter, the effects and horror of war, and appreciate the freedom of the country I am blessed to live in."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I've wanted to read this book since I was a young man, but did not have a change. When I had a chance, I was turned away by the thickness and the weight of the book. With the Kindle eBook at a bargain price, I read the book recently and felt ecstatic. The book itself is well-known without needing further comments. I just want to say how happy I am now that I can enjoy the book with my light-weight Kindle eBook."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is a monumental work in the field of historical journalism. Mr. Shirer graduated from college and took a cattle transport to Europe to spend the summer sight-seeing. Fifteen years later, he was chased out by the Gestapo who were planning to nab him on a trumped up charge of espionage. In between those two moments he witnessed first hand the fall of the old European states France and England, and the emergence of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich.Shirer taps into the Hegelian historical model of the superman, or the individual, who through the force of his own personality and will, shape the course of world history for better or worse. Indeed the mid-twentieth century was perhaps the crowning moment of such a feature in world history, with such dynamic and driven personalities such as Hitler, Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill testing their abilities to lead their nations against each other. And the vacuum of such leaddership in France highlights the Hegelian model as France disappears from the stage in the first months of the war and does not return.This is not a book about World War II, however. It is a book about the Third Reich. The only details of the war in the pacific that emerge in the book are those relevant to events in the European theater. The book also focuses on the years leading up to World War II, rather than the events of the war itself. Shirer illustrates a pattern of behavior within the inner circle of the Third Reich and shows how that pattern was responsible for both the rapid rise of Nazi Germany and its downfall. It is a pattern of grim determination, ruthless paranoia, historical distortion and shrewd exploitation of the media to always blame its victims for the wars they start.Once the pattern is adequately defined and illustrated, however, the book seems to run out of steam towards the end. Tis could be due to the fact that Shirer was forced to leave Germany before the entry of America into the war, but I believe it has more to do with the relentless momentum of events created by Hitler and his inner circle which began to collapse all around them, and the puerile desperation of their final end game decisions which only hastened their demise rather than reclaim the momentum. In effect, the rooster they had created had come back home to roost, and they were caught in a web of their own making.I believe this is one of the landmark historical works of the twentieth century, alongside Shelby Foote's \\"Civil War,\\" and Oswald Spengler's \\"Decline and Fall of the West.\\" That said, the book does have its flaws. Shirer seems to have an affinity for Homeric motifs, such as \\"Goering the corpulent Reichs Marshal,\\" \\"Himmler, the mild-mannered chicken farmer,\\" and so on. It is not clear why Shirer uses this device over and over again. Perhaps it ihe wished to remind us of Goering's greed and Himmler deceptive self-effacing nature while he plots your downfall. And it fails to address the real tragedy--the wreckage of those great European states that had dominated world history for over two centuries. Britain alone would emerge from the ashes but its empire of the Sun would be no more within a generation after the war. Britain no longer had the resources or the wherewithal to maintain its hold on it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I just finished this 1500 page masterpiece and was amazed at how good it was. It was a historical work so well written and original in its research that I was sad to turn the last page but grateful to Shirer for the incredible work he'd done.Shirer was a CBS news reporter in Berlin during the pre-war years during Hitler's meteoric rise and covered the appeasement of Nazi Germany by the Western democracies, revealing thru his research that the Nazis were fully aware that if they were called to task at any time they would have been roundly defeated militarily and finished politically. This was evident from the internal papers Shirer was given access to after the war.Shirer uncovered many other previously undiscovered facts about Nazi political interference in the Wehrmacht High Command that ensured Nazi defeat, such as Goering & Hitler's decision to \\"terror\\" bomb London in retaliation for a small British bombing raid on Berlin, which turned out to be a disasterous decision on Hitler's part, because the strategic bombing of England's manufacturing had nearly destroyed Britain's radar defenses and defense manufacturing capacity at the time of Hitler's decision to abandon strategic bombing for \\"terror\\" bombing.This was a great book and if you are put off by the sheer volume of the book, don't be. It's a great read and if you have an interest an WWII, this is one book you simply must read."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I haven't completed this book, yet. However, it is a frightening prophecy of what could happen again and again. Our civilization is still capable of the evil that was perpetrated by the Nazi demons. We have not yet risen above the callousness, cold-heartedness, and demoniacal attitudes that were the hallmark of the Nazi party. Every day, evil men murder hundreds and thousands of innocent people, merely because of race and/or religious convictions. When will we learn from history?"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"If you want one incredibly well written book that will tell you everything you need to know about Nazi Germany than this is the book for you. I've read several others on this subject and nothing comes close. Don't let the large size fool you because it's so well written the chapters just fly by. This is the definative book on the Third Reich."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is the most comprehensive book written on the subject of Hitler and the Third Reich that I know. All aspects are thoroughly researched and covered from the origins to the demise of Nazi Germany. In my opinion, it is the definitive work regarding this dark period."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is so grand in scope and so packed with facts that it hard to believe that it is only 1200 pages! As an advid World War two amateur enthusiast, I have a new appreciation of how Hitler came to power, and How the stars aligned to make this madman as influencial in the vast brainwashing of the german people as he was. He took a demoralized, defeated people and controled them with the promise that he would make them strong again and bring them out of the ashes of WW I. This book from beging to end is crucial to the fundamental understanding of how political mistakes on this level must NOT be allowed to repeat themselves. Very Long But after a while it feels like you are reading a novel."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"It is very surprising that the author has made so large a book so interesting to read.It shows the HUGE ability of the author to actually understand and overcome a reader's hesitancy to read large books.I place this next to Churchill's Story of the Second World War."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The only time in my life I ever wrote a fan letter to an author was when I read \\"Rise and Fall Of The Third Reich\\" many years ago and received a very gracious thank you from Mr. Shirer.I recently re-read the book and it still is one of the finest and best-written histories of a very difficult time in the world.Mr. Shirer combines the details of the era with a style of prose that sometimes is lacking in books written today. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is a real reading project. My unabridged hard cover volume feels like the Manhattan phone directory, making it unwieldy to sit in bed and read. I had to buy a book stand to hold it on my lap desk!Once the ergonomic problems were overcome it is, of course, a most worthy read.Rather than recounting the details of the many battles of WWII (for example, the entire D-Day invasion is dispensed with in just a few pages), Shirer's book is instead focused on the mad genius and sheer will of Adolf Hitler and the fascinating story of his rise from poverty and obscurity to a position of absolute power. The book exhaustively details the political and diplomatic machinations that propelled Hitler and Germany into - and out of - WWII. Many pages are filled with footnotes (at a much smaller font size!) that give further detail about a subject in the main text. This virtually doubles the actual number of pages of reading material - it took me a solid three weeks of reading 1-2 hours a day to get through it.Coupled with this is a keen insight into the German mindset, both from a mythological and historical standpoint, with a particular emphasis on the sense of injustice and deep anger the German people felt following their defeat in WWI and the Treaty of Versailles. All of this is vital to understanding how Hitler - who by all accounts was a hypnotic orator - was able to manipulate those around him and, ultimately, the German people.Shirer has a unique perspective on the matter, having been both an eyewitness to many of the key events plus having had access to mountains of captured Nazi documents. He was also able to gain information directly from many of the principal figures involved. This allowed him to demolish the many self-serving recollections by various Nazi figures, and also to ferret out the inconsistencies and bona-fide errors found in many previously published works - even a few by Churchill himself.The countless numbers of diplomats, generals, world leaders, obscure figures, Nazi thugs and unfortunate victims are woven together to produce an historical reference without parallel.This is essential reading. It is the cornerstone of knowledge for any serious student of WWII and the horror of Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"If you can only stand to read one book on Nazi Germany this is the one to pick. This book was written in 1960 and is still superior to any other book on Nazi Germany in print.It explains, without any psychobable or political correctness what Nazism was, why it was so attractive to the German people and how Adolf Hitler almost got away with conquering the world."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is over 1000 pages and it is brimming with facts about Nazi Germany in particular and World War II in general. The author, William Shirer, does an excellent job of maintaining the reader's interest throughout this voluminous book. Chronicling Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist Party from the very early days to the end, he provides profound insight into a phenomenon which has left a deep and indelible mark upon modern history. Shirer resided in Germany during the years preceding World War II and he personally witnessed many of the events that he writes about in the book. Although more information has become available from East German archives and other sources since this book was published , The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich remains the most comprehensive and informative book on the history of Germany under Hitler."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Let me tell you firstly, this book was a summer assignment for me to get into AP History at my school. I picked this book for I was looking for a World War II novel to read. I was not prepared for what I was about to read. This book is filled to the brim with facts and good facts they are. Shirer makes this book flow with easy and grace, which I would not think possible. This book takes you through the whole war(from the German view) and before and after. I found the infomation on Hitler's rise to be quite interesting. From the streets of Vienna to the Beer Hall to the Chancellory and so on. Very interesting and good read. I must now say that I may read this again in the future, but is ain't going to be for any class, just enjoyment of history!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"It is hard to adequately review a book that is almost 1,150 pages in length without missing at least some detail that is critical to the assessment. That being said here's my review:This book was written in 1960 and draws most of it's substance from a list of sources which Shirer describes in the Foreword. These include many of the remaining OKW and Nazi HQ documents which the Allies confiscated in the capture of Germany. Additional sources include first hand accounts by those surviving Germany generals who escaped the death penalty at Nuremburg. It does not, however, contain the more recent military history that was released with the fall of the Soviet Union.Rise and Fall was a mammoth undertaking for it's time both in scope and in size. It's greatest strength lies in it's ability to describe, in detail, the many major events of the war from the rise of the National Socialist party under Hitler and Rhoen to the Russian counteroffensive into Berlin. It's main focus is on the political history of both the Nazi party and Nazi Germany itself; the main players are the leaders of the great powers at the time: Neville Chamberlain, Molotov and Stalin, Churchill, Roosevelt; the leaders of the Nazi party: Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, Himmler; and the leaders of the Germany army: Jodl, Keitel, Rommel and others.Most of this book concerns what lead to World War II and how those events are what led to September 1, 1939. The actual events of the war take up only a small portion of this book as they serve as a backdrop and catalyst for the political maneuverings of all the above mentioned individuals. Throughout the book the main emphasis remains Adolf Hitler: his rise to power, his anti-Semitism, his ruminations in Mein Kaumf and his megalomania.I highly recommend this as a good \\"starter\\" book for World War II. All of the main characters are intimately described, all of the major events are very thoroughly detailed, and the book covers the entire war. Finally, the book is written in a dramatic fashion which makes it a great page turner and helps get you through the sheer size of a book which will need atleast 2 months to really read."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I will spare everyone a stupid review by trying to make myself sound like a wannabe book critic and instead I'll get straight to the point. This book is great from the first page to the last. I didn't have much knowledge of the Third Reich before reading this book but this book easily changed that. No, it doesn't go in depth into the war but this book ISN'T based soley on the war, but on the Third Reich itself! The last 300 pages or so are incredible, mainly when it talks about the final attempt to kill Hitler and what happens to the plotters afterwards when the attempt fails! My advice is even if you aren't interested in reading about Hitler and the Third Reich, start reading it and you WILL be!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I have looked at this book on my shelf for over 35 years. It is so massive at 1,150 pages - I think it could stop a bullet - that it has intimidated me. So, in a moment between jobs, I took it on: it sets, in a word, THE STANDARD for all subsequent histories of one of the darkest chapters of the 20C. This is brilliant and will survive as a classic of the genre of first-rate history as written by a reporter who was there.The first 1/4 of the book is about the rise of Hitler. He was a bum and dreamer in Austria, had a galvinising experience as a corporal in WWI, and linked himself to bizarre and parochial right-wing nationist groups in the 1920s, which were terrible years of crisis in greater Germany. Shirer brilliantly delineates the stages of this, as Hitler stepped to the stage of an obsure Bavarian group of about 30 fanatics, to become the indisputed leader of Germany by 1933. This was a work, in a peculiar period that was not as cosmopolitan as today, that was political genius. Shirer demonstrates, without depth-psychology vocabulary, how Hitler felt what his generation suffered deeply and then articulated it in a political format. This is truly brialliant scholarship and, at times, great writing.The next quarter of the book is devoted to diplomatic history, from the audacious triumphs of Hitler (Munich, etc.). While it loses its psychological acuity, the international context - and what a dictator could at the time accomplish in it - comes to the fore. It is an entirely different set of circumstances from today that involved Mussolini, the weakness of Chamberlin's England, and the neutral US. While there is much about the character of the actors, such as Germany's foreign minister Ribbentrop, who is characterised too frequently as an arrogant mediocity. This is where Hitler gains parts of Poland, the Sudeten, and Austria bloodlessly.Then comes the last half of the book. This makes for dreary reading in two ways. First, with the Blitzkrieg and the industry to support it, Hitler is momentarily triumphant. He takes France and Norway and the low countries with extraodinary speed, shocking a world mired in economic depression. This new war tactic involved tanks, airplanes that dominated the airspace to cut supply lines and communications, and quick movement of troops by rail or truck as they overwhelmed their confused adversaries by encirclement. As a fully developed system, it was a totally new form of warfare, and it took the great power France by surprise.Second, once Germany attacked the USSR, the war became one of attrition, a more traditional form along the lines of WWI. The USA entered and the vast resoures of the USSR created the traditional nightmare for Germany of a two-front war. It became a question of resources then, and Germany was essentially lost. The unbelievably vast machinery then set itself in motion to smash Nazi Germany, and it was then, as de Gaulle said, only a matter of time.So the last 1/3 of the book is about Nazi Germainy's mistakes and collapse. It is dreary reading, and has an inevitability about it that makes for boring reading. This was a slog and I have had enough of German history for at least two years!Shirer also covers what happended in Germany and then in the occupied countries. It was ugly and so well known that I will not go into it here except to say that modern Germany is no longer so parochial and this kind of thing can never happen again.Shirer is not perfect. His work is bound to its time, the 40-60s. He calls the SA, for example, \\"homosexual perverts\\". This is a traditional view of the times, but it dates the book. Nonetheless, this work sets the standard for all follolwing scholarship, and that makes it a classic. His writing style is clear and very personal.All is all, warmly recommended as a great work of scholarship, with many personal asides that add character and honesty t the work. This is a truly great book and the masterpeice of a lifetime."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book was phenomenal. A bit long, but an interesting read with tons of background throughout. Really enjoyed it even though it took a while to get in to the more &#34;exciting&#34; portions. The lead up is important, though, since as is often pointed out &#34;everything Hitler did was legal at the time.&#34;"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Rise and Fall is not just a book about Nazi Germany and World War II. It is the book.The author used to be an American correspondent in Germany in the 1930s. After the war, he obtained access to secret German documents. Using said documents, he was able to write this account of the rise and fall of Hitler and Nazism.Rise and Fall is more than fifty years old and a lot of research has been done since there. Historians might cast doubt or question a detail here and a detail there, but there is no doubt that the book's narrative is overall truthful and accurate. Anyone who is interested in a serious study of that time period must absolutely read this book. Unlike many historians, the author, an old school journalist, does not engage in hypothesizing and debating, but simply describes what was happening behind the scenes at that time. If he says that X had happened, it is because he has documents that plainly state that X had indeed happened.The book is mainly about Hitler and the Nazis, which in many ways was one and the same. It starts with Hitler's origins, before he was even born, and moves on to his early life, rise to power, and then WW II. The section about Hitler's early life is short, but interesting. Hitler was a complete nobody before 1920, so there is precious little information about his youth. The fact that Hitler himself took pains to erase and lie about that period of his life does not help either.The lion's share of the book is about 1920s and 1930s. It covers Hitler stumbling on the Nazi party (he was not its founder) and leading it from an association of a few dozen people into a political powerhouse. The book then follows with Nazis overtaking Germany and the buildup to WW II.The section on WW II is quite long as well, but in my opinion not as quite interesting. It talks mostly about military operations, which are a matter of public record. This is in opposition to the 1920/1930s section, which focuses on the secret dealings that went on behind the scenes. But rest assured, no part of the book is boring. Even those who are familiar with that time period can find lots of new interesting things to learn about."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"great read, very informative, and makes you feel like this happened yesterday.i highly recommend this to anyone. cant wait for the coloring book to come out....weeeeeeeeeeeeee"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYShirer digs deep, going back to the 1800s to provide insight into Germnany's conditions and Hitler's lineage.

Although reading past this book would be a great investment in time and energy - one should at least start here (regarding a real study of history). The history channel can only go so far in presenting facts about Hitler and the Nazis, however; the devil is in the details, and Shirer's book is full of them. If one weren't to read this book and merely gather information of the subject from television, then that person would have to be considered ignorant on the subject. Other good recommendations: John Toland's Adolph Hitler (2 volumes); Gordon Craig's Germany 1866--1945; William Shirer's The Nightmare Years."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I was a neophyte in book publishing in 1960 when this book came out. Shirer was one of \\"Murrow's Boys\\" broadcasting the WWII from Vienna and Berlin. The size of the book put me off then. Finally I got around to reading in June-July 2012. IT IS DAZZLING! Horrifying. Brilliant. The extra filip: Shirer was on the scene. He knew the bastards. He spoke German. Heard Hitler live numerous times. Covered the Nuremberg trials. Mined all the secret Nazi documents and diaries of the perpetrators. Hitler was a mesmerizing nutcase and you get to to see the guy up close and personal. The book is filled with revelations. For example, Hitler delayed Barbarossa (the invasion of Russia) for three weeks while he dealt with Romania. This delay cost Germany the War, because that critical 3 weeks was when the Russian winter closed it. This book is delicious. Brilliant. Infinitely satisfying. See how the master dictator did it (and how he screwed up). Absolutely relevant today in the era of Saddam Hussein, the Assads (p&egrave;re et fils), Kadafi et. al. Buy it and savor it!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Almost since its initial publication in 1959, William Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich has been regarded as a classic text in the canon of historical narratives documenting Germany under Nazi rule. I've never been an aficionado of this material, but I became interested in the history of mid 20th century Germany following a trip to Berlin and reading Richard Bessel's \\"Germany 1945: From War to Peace\\" and Erik Larson's \\"In the Garden of Beasts.\\" Shirer's enormous tome was something that I had wanted to attempt since then but I found its length a bit daunting. While it certainly does require dedicated reading time (and lots of it), it is undeniably a complete, thorough and highly readable history, worthy of the critical praise it has garnered over the decades.Shirer offers a unique perspective among historians of this era since he witnessed many of the events surrounding the rise of the Nazis while serving as a foreign correspondent for CBS radio. The eyewitness aspect of his account, coupled with the fact that it was written relatively soon after the events of World War II lend it a powerful sense of reality in that many histories, often written long after the events being chronicled, may feel \\"diluted\\" or slightly fictionalized. Shirer's effort feels very \\"of the moment,\\" when the horrors of World War II and its aftermath were still fresh in the global consciousness.I've often been baffled over how an advanced western culture like that of 20th century Germany could have ever descended into fascism and totalitarian rule. Shirer's narrative suggests several primary factors: (1) the extremely punitive reparations imposed on Germany by the allies following World War I; (2) the economic deprivations of the 1920s and 30s (often tied to those reparations); (3) the fact that Germans had never known true democracy made them somewhat predisposed to leadership from the top, down; (4) the inherent weakness and ineffectiveness of the Weimar Republic; and (5) the political craftiness of Adolph Hitler who, despite being the embodiment of human evil and megalomania, was a gifted politician who knew precisely how to outmaneuver his opponents at every turn. Momentous points in history often turn on such confluences of unique conditions.Shirer covers all of these conditions in detail such that the reader has a very clear sense of the atmosphere of Germany and the mind of the German people during Hitler's rise from obscurity, to prominence and ultimately, to complete dominance. Hitler's political maneuverings during the 1920s and early 1930s make for fascinating reading as Shirer documents all the points at which history could have easily taken a different path but did not.Of course, most will be familiar with the major events of World War II but Shirer devotes many pages to the politics leading up to Hitler's initial conquests. He relies on reams of documents made available through capture at the War's conclusion to trace the discussions, negotiations and demands made between the German state and its weaker neighbors, all of whom would eventually come to be controlled by the Nazi party. These communications offer a true insight not only into the minds of the Nazis but also of their enablers like Neville Chamberlain and his feckless administration. Fresh from the horrors of the first World War, Europe's leaders were prepared to do almost anything to avoid a second massive conflict. They never imagined that their efforts to avoid it would actually set its stage.There were times when I felt that Shirer provided almost too many direct quotations from official governmental communiques and diplomatic documents, to the point where they became somewhat repetitive. It's my only real criticism of the book and the only reason that I deducted one star from my rating.So much of the book is dedicated to the politics of Nazi germany and its interactions with other governments that it almost seemed like a straight-ahead military and political history. I wondered: where is the coverage of Nazi atrocities? I needn't have wondered. They're covered in full detail towards the end of the book. Every time one is tempted to think that they cannot be further shocked by the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis, there's always more. The capacity to be shocked where these men were concerned seems to know no limits. Shirer does his duty to remind anyone who reads his book of precisely how evil human beings can be when under the thrall of a immoral leadership.At the end, I was thankful to reach the conclusion of \\"Rise and Fall.\\" Not because it's not a well-written history, but because the horrors and national insanity that it documents become difficult to bear after a while. I felt relieved that I had the freedom to simply walk away from this history without ever having had to live through any part of it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"As someone who lived during the period described by Mr. Shirer I have found this history to be the most accurate and detailed description of the start of the Third Reich. How Hitler and his henchmen, all cruel and evil men, used everything from cajoling to murder and horrible atrocities to gain and keep power. Shirer also shows the reader how power, and the desire for power, lead to the corruption and limitless ambition that caused the ultimate fall of the Third Reich. I am anxious for Amazon to make this book available again as my copy is worn out and falling apart and I want a new one. Please hurry."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"An excellent price for this huge paper back! I have read the first book and find it very enlightening. Hitler is described as an orator, a propagandist, and an organizer. Maybe a bit too much like someone in today's world?

It arrived well within the timeline promised in good condition. Thanks, guys.David W. McPeak"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I listened to this book on audio, all 56 hours of it, and I found it rivetting from start to finish. Shirer's interest is clearly political, rather than military, and this is reflected in the balance of the book, which goes into mind-boggling detail about the early political history of the Nazi party in the early 1930s, while moving at an increasingy rapid pace through the massive subject of the second world war in its last third. As a result there were certainly times in the early parts of the book when I found myself saying to myself, \\"Come on Shirer, let's get on with it!\\" - but at the same time being unwilling to miss anything of this spellbinding listening experience. Meanwhile in the later stages I was thinking, \\"Hey, just slow down a bit!\\"Shirer was of course a working journalist in Germany throughout much of the period covered - presumably up to the time at which the USA entered the war. Perhaps it's understandable that his interest centres on the period when he was present and actively involved in the unfolding of history, and wanes a little after his enforced departure. More than anything, it is the knowledge (he refers to this frequently in the text) - that Shirer was himself present in the audience to listen to many of Hitler's speeches, and walked the streets of Berlin drinking in the public mood, which particularly brought the book to life for me.Some of Shirer's attitudes - for example towards homosexuality - may strike the modern reader as a little bit 'quaint', but probably simply reflect the period in the 1950s when he was writing. The Nazi's interactions with the Christian Church tend to be a bit glossed over - more detail on this would have been welcome.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and more importantly found myself educated by it and provoked to thought and reflection not only about the past, but also about the present and future. I recommend it strongly."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"If there was on book to read on Nazi Germany it would be William L. Shirer's, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\\" not only did he see the rise of Adolf Hitler first hand in Germany, he was one of the only historians to gain accsess to the mountains of captured documents.

Mr Shirer is arguably the most qualified person to write this book, chronicling the entire history of the Third Reich. Starting with Hitler's rise to power, Shirer goes into incredible detail as to the circumstances leading to World War II (particularly under \\"Book 3: The Road to War\\"); this is due to his accessing secret Nazi documents discovered after the war. I have yet to read Shirer's complementary piece \\"The Rise and Fall of Adolph Hitler\\" nor John Toland's book on the same subject (both of which I have heard are great historical accounts in their own right), but they are on my \\"To Do\\" list!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is the complete history of Hitlers Germany from beginning to end.

I definately recommend it. It should be on everyones bookshelf.Historically accurate."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The research that pulled this book together was presented in a concise chronological sequence that many things I did not understand about Hitler's Germany now make sense.Even the movie Valkyrie and the chapters about Valkyrie in the book coincided. The book was more in depth. When I hit this part of the book I could not put it down until the end.Another movie that readers of this book might find interesting is titled \\"Downfall.\\" It is a German movie with English subtitles that shows the last few days of Hitler in The Bunker. Here again the movie and the book both coincide and it is dramatic.Hitler was a \\"nut\\" with a force of conviction that held the whole house of cards together by sheer willpower."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"There are few threads of thought to consider in this book. First there is a prevailing theme throughout the book represented by the German word lebensraum, meaning \\"more land.\\" For the people of neighboring lands an onslaught of terror was felt. Hitler's original goal was always to conquer Russia and the Slavs as he despised Communism and the Jews that were driving the Russian state of mind as he believed it to be. This belief took root in him as a vagabond in Austria where he felt oppressed by Jewish merchants and businessmen. Secondly and ironically he always looked to the East and waged war with the West, presumably out of some poorly thought out strategy. While he held a vengeance towards France, he was willing to leave England and the West alone. Albeit his actions of bombing London for months on end contradicted even that of his many shallow convictions. Third was a theme that became a consistent irony was one where on the eve of every onslaught upon a neighboring country, leaders held out hope that \\"it would not happen\\". One could make an argument in defense of Poland and perhaps even France individually, but collectively the world leaders could not gain consensus on eminent threats or preventive action. They had to wait until the fox was in the hen house. Fourth, I am left aghast at Neville Chamberlain as he sold out the Austrians and the Czechs, but more so, the world leaders who through silence allowed this to happen. After closing the last page in this book I stand even more firmly in my view that this world of \`East' or \`West' ideologies owes a world of tribute and gratitude to Sir Winston Churchill. Finally, though the book incriminates Hitler, it is also about German people with Hitler as their representative and scapegoat of the servant German mind. They had eleven hundred years of practice through the first and second Reich's, and shallow convictions seemed to loom just below the surface of the German people of this time as well.to view my complete review please reference keword cigarroomofbooks"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"read this book when it was first published. After all these years it is even more meaningful and incisive."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"When you come to think of it, William L. Shirer was a CBS correspondent who was at the right place at the right time. He kept a diary of the happenings in Germany during the time of the formation of the Nazi government. He saw the political maneuvers of the Nazi Party in gaining power in German Politics. The audacity of the Party gaining control of a Democratic Government without a majority. The effect of a weak centralized government under President von Hindenburg leads to Nazism.Shirer witnessed the formation of a totalitarian government. He saw the tightening of all cultural activities and the progressive pogroms against the Jews.Shirer details all the scheming of the taking over of the Rhineland, Sudetenland and Austria. His plan to enter into war with Poland under false pretenses finally has England and France entering into the great conflict. Shirer was there recording all that had happened.This book was first published 14 years after the end of the Second World War. This exhaustive study was based on Shirer's observations, which in itself are classic. He was there. He saw it first hand!! Richard Evans study seems to be a definitive study in the English language of this German time period. But remember, Evans has over 50 years of added data to analyze and report on.This is a long read, but read it if you want to know about the great tragedy of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The book is taken from research and the experiences of William Shirer as a correspondant in Germany. I found it to be just about right in detail and in covering the subject of the book. I strongly recommend it to anyone woh wants to get a feel for Nazi Germany and how Hitler came to power."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is one of a few I am reading about World War Two. Shirer's very readable volume about Hitler and Nazi Germany traces the roots of the regime up to its death. Shirer aside from extensive access to documents from the regime, recalls his own experiences living in Nazi Germany, knew several of the key players and witnessed several of the historic events detailed in the book. Thus, in some ways Shirer is a primary source. He details the influences and ideas that went into Hitler's mad plan for world dominantion. Surprisingly he detailed nearly every step of his plans in Mein Kampf years before he was able to put them into action. Hitler was a gambler and more to chance and the inattention of many good people he was able to grab nearly absolute power and most of Europe. There were numerous times where his own people, the military and other countries could have put a stop to Hitler but choose to appease him instead thus demonstrating the dangers of using this strategy in international policy. The content of the book is packed with information yet written so that you will be driven to read to the next chapter. The narrative of the book ends when theThird Reich does but when appropriate Shirer in footnotes details the various fates of notable persons. He provides a vivid picture of life under Nazism, the military triumphs, the desperate gambles and the blundering mistakes that shaped events of the war. I'd highly recommend this volume to anyone wishing to understand World War II."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is filled with information from start to finish. It's an amazing history and as far as I know the book you should read on the \\"Third Reich\\" if you only read one. It's a huge book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is truly an incredible work of history -- almost journalism, seeing that Shirer was actually present during most of the build-up of the Nazi state. His combination of documented scholarship and personal insight produce an extremely accessible while still very detailed account of what happened and, more importantly, why the events occurred the way they did as a result of the individual and state-level beliefs and motivations.That said, however, the book has one critical flaw, in that it fails to offer a reasonable answer to the most fundamental and desperately important question: how did so many people (the German public) allow such abominable atrocities to occur in their name? Shirer's answer basically comes down to bloodlust and a will to dominate being fundamental to the German national character. This is simply unacceptable, a complete cop-out on the very question that he is probably solely positioned to fully answer. There is *no such thing* as 'national character'; cultural differences to be sure, but no people are fundamentally so different from the rest of us that they take wholesale slaughter and oppression as a natural way of life.Perhaps there is no rational answer, and I can't hold Shirer responsible for finding one. But to blame the nature of the German is akin to the bigotry that brought the Nazis to power. I think the question of how Naziism gained so much support while being so extremely evil must be visited and re-visited until we recognize how to stop it. Common decency is the last hope of mankind, and we now know an entire nation can abandon it. Bush's 'Americans aren't like that' arguments aside, we need to make sure we know how to prevent it happening to us."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Nazi Germany fell so swiftly in the spring of 1945, the Third Reich had to surrender the minutely detailed records of the regime before those documents could be destroyed. This capture involved most of the archives of the German government and all its branches including Heinrich Himmler's secret police. Never before has such a vast treasure fallen into the hands of historians. Particularly interesting were the records of the &quot;Fuehrer Conferences&quot; on the daily military situation, the Nazi warlord's table talk with his party cronies, and his deliberate deceptions (international, national, and personal), all of which prove that he and his followers were criminals. How these criminals got to power and how they stayed there was no accident. It involved the social psychology of our species, the tendency of all of us to follow the herd even when the herd is going over a cliff. The lessons are clear and the truth of George Washington's advice is even clearer: &quot;Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.&quot; Yes, society is controlled violence. The reason we sleep well at night, one of the reasons anyway, is that the cops have guns. This book proves that what counts is who does the controlling. Who do you want? George Washington or George III? FDR or Joe Stalin? Harry Truman or Hitler? As for me, give me our bumbling politicians every time. They mean well and they won't foul up the universe. So please make it your new year's resolution to read Shirer's definitive work on Nazi Germany, a book that tells one of the most spectacular stories ever, a masterful vivid account of depressing and grim political, social, economic, and military violence. Once you start its 1500+ pages you will have trouble putting it down. And when you do put it down, you will pick it up again just as soon as you can."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is, to me, the best &#34;biography&#34; of the Third Reich that exists. This author himself is a primary source, because he witnessed much of the rise, actually living and working as a correspondent in Germany. Even so, his historiography is so good, He backs up every nuance of a &#34;fact&#34; with ample data and citations.We need to understand that nations--including ours--can be destroyed by the negligence, the lazy irresponsibility, of the &#34;adult voting&#34; public. People in a democracy need to at least try to educate themselves on what is REALLY going on in their state houses, and around the world, particularly before just lazily sending their children off to die in wars they really don't understand (2003 comes to mind...). Germany of the 1930s shows this in Shirer's works, particularly when emotions (fear and phoney patriotism) are used to simply, easily rile up the public. Racial issues seem to always play a role, then and now.We need to learn from books such as this what we quite evidently didn't learn from the Vietnam War, where I for one, as a young, idealistic American Airman, almost lost my life for nothing but the ugly stupidity of rich politicians in Washington who were wagging the dog."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I can see why some readers love this important book. It is a great report of a terrible time. Schirer did a wonderful job of mining primary sources to write the first draft of the history of WWII.As a book, however, it is not very exciting. The most interesting things are in the endnotes at the end of each chapter. The narrative itself kind of slogs along and suffocates the reader with endless detail.Reading the book and its descriptions is little like watching Mad Men on TV. The book is something of a cold war period piece. Schirer describes the Nazi leaders as \\"homosexual degenerates\\" as if that description will help us understand why they did what they did. He finds it preposterous that Japan would be a defender of \\"Western\\" civilization (the italics are his); and he continually comes back to the idea that the power of Hitler was connected to Germany's loss of its historic Christian character.Unlike the detailed descriptions of Hitler's miscalculations and fall, apart from the continual reminders that Hitler's rise and Germany's loss of its Christian character are somehow connected, we get little detail of the conditions that led to Hitler's rise and consolidation of power. A better title might be the Fall of the Third Reich because we learn very little about the rise.In the end, I would recommend reading the book, but like the invasion of Russia, it is a long slog. And that slog is made worse by the horrid Kindle version. If authors, publishers and Amazon want to charge for ebooks prices that are comparable to those they charge for print, they should at least proof read them before inflicting their computer generated output on the unsuspecting public."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Despite the \\"flaws\\" noted by others, I find the Kindle version a highly valued resource. You can search the entire book in nanoseconds, make notes and bookmark pages for later review. While maybe not as perfect as the print version, I find these electronic benefits more than worth the cost."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I picked this up on a friend's bookshelf and can't seem to put it down. Hitler's story is fascinating and terrifying. It demonstrates how someone with the type of ruthlessness that will stop at nothing can usurp ultimate power. We in America seem to have had a taste of fascism recently. Everyone should read this book and remind themselves that it can happen again.If you let a country or a people get too disenfranchised the seeds are sown for disaster. This author seems to have really done his homework. This is an important historical document."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Excelent book, very well written. The book is HUGE, with more than one thousand pages (!), but it is no boring at all. It is very complete, covering all the facts from the years before the WWII start, until some years after its ending. It puts you in each important fact place and time, explaining the real situation that leads to each movement. The chapters are well splited, that means you won't loose the main idea, eve if you read a chapter per month (for example). It is very reach in details, tolding even about the personal life aspects of each main piece who somehow had an important impact on the greatest war ever. The author did a exemplary research and every information is based on historical researches, on wich he indicates mostly the sources of it. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer provides an excellent first hand account of how the Nazi Regime came into power and then tracks its spectacular decline. Using his position as a journalist in Germany he explores many facets of the regime from the military to the social structures. The book is very well written and don't be deterred by its length. This is a great book to start off with if you want to learn about Nazi Germany. I found it quick to read and an essential collection to my library on the history of Nazi Germany. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I consider this the greatest history book ever written. Not just because I am Jewish. It reads like the greatest novel ever. It is surreal and more bizzare than Vonnegut or Orwell yet the events are painfully true. We watch as a seemingly highly evolved country turns itself over to the worst criminals and misfits that the world has ever known and becomes the greatest killing machine civilation has ever known. It is exciting to read as the noose tighens around the Nazi regime - you just can't wait till they are crushed into submission. I have read almost all of Shirer's books but this is the bible. I have read it three times and will surely read it again. We should never forget this part of human history - lest we relive it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Albert Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich's 1100 pages remain to this day one of the best single volume histories of Nazi Germany. The Author, who worked in journalism in Germany during the 1930's personally recorded much of what he writes but also used copious research to create a book that is both academic and journalistic. While this book is an investment of time I believe it will be well enjoyed by the reader and also provides a great resource for further reading through a fantastic bibliography. If you are looking for a book that focuses on World war two this book really might not be for you. This book is definitely more political than military but with the vast selections of combat histories and memoirs a book that solidly describes the politics that caused the Hitler's Rise to power and the political climate that caused and lasted through WWII is an important resource. The book differs vastly from other histories of this time period as it really attempts to explain the issues at several levels by describing life for the ordinary German and political Climates in England, France and other countries. This may be its best feature.Being a journalist, Shirer focuses on events more than character. While he does use character portraits to some extent in describing Ernst Roehm, Goering and of course Hitler, this book really is about dates actions and events. This does not detract as these are important to understanding history on the whole. If you are looking for a great foundation to an understanding of the third reich this is a great start"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Although this book may be a classic it is not at all high school reading. It is required reading for my Honors World History class and many honors students are failing to understand this book and are in turn failing the class. Its too long and Shirer rambles on about stupid things. I think it would be better written if he got to the point and didnt beat around the bush."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Shirer's definitive work on the history of the Third Reich is still as relevant to the subject today as it was when it was published back in the 1960s.The book was unique at the time (and quite possibly is still) because there was no precedent for a government such as the Third Reich being so utterly defeated that all their dirty secrets were laid bare. Government documents, memos, notes, even the diaries of some of the German leaders were opened up to the world when the Reich fell. Shirer used those sources as well as his own experiences as a journalist in Nazi Germany and conversations with living members of the former Reich to put together this book.Shirer's defiance of convention at the time in writing a history so soon after the actual events initially brought criticism of his work. The unique circumstances of the fall of Nazi Germany demanded such a history though and time has shown his book to be one of the most important works ever created on Nazi Germany.Shirer's opinion of the events of the time may not ring true for all readers, but he doesn't portray his own opinion as historical fact instead letting his sources speak to that point. Because of his position as a foreign journalist in Nazi Germany before, during and after the war Shirer's opinion of events and the people he met (including some of the most important figures in the Nazi government) is at least as valuable as the facts he presents and deserving of inclusion in this book.A must read for anyone interested in Nazi Germany and World War II."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I was in junior high. Since then I've reread it at least three times. It never ages. There is always something I didn't understand clarified. The author tackles a difficult, at the time, subject with an eye for his audience. I still have the Bantam copy I read in '65 and a newer version with larger print as concession to my eyes."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Without a doubt, this has to be one of the most important history books ever written! Let's look at why...1)The author: His credentials to write this book are unbeatable. He lived among the Nazis as a correspondent from their birth till half way through the war. Because of this he got to see and hear all the key players and personally meet many of them. This gave him great insight into Germany and germans during the growth of the Nazi virus. Couple this with the fact that he was an action journalist, and was therefore an extremely gifted writer, and his credentials are truly unbeatable.2)Subject: Although this subject is well covered, it has not been covered before or since this writing as thoroughly as in this book. Shirer had access to ALL of the Nazi papers, including diariers, memos and minutes, and you therefore get an insiders view on what was going on inside the top secret meetings of the Nazi leaders. Here, exposed for all to see, are the diablolical reasonings for everything they did or tried to do. Here spelled out step by step is the entire history from the youth of Hitler to the death by strangalation by the russian and allied armies. It has sections on the history of Germany back to Martin Luther, when the mindset of the german people was developed that would allow for a tyrant like Hitler. Sections of the book also give an insider's view into the combat decisions, Concentration camps, basic principles of Nazism, and the normal German's pied piper attitude. It cover's EVERYTHING!3)Lessons: It is possible to draw lessons from this well of historical knowledge that will blow you away. It has been said that when we stop learning from history we are bound to repeat it and this book clearly portrays the evil that has already occurred and is possible if we don't watch world affairs closely. The U.S. may get derided for meddling in others' affairs, but this book shows the danger that is possible if we don't! We also need to learn not to nourish the seeds of racism as Hitler did in his youth that led to the eventualy death of 40 million people. So many great things can be learned from this book...Overall: It is simply a great book. One of the best I have ever read! It never bogs down...I finished it in a month, all 1500 pages.In conclusion: If you havn't read this book you absolutely must!!! You will not regret it!!!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I read this years ago in college and I thought I'd never read it again since it is so huge. About five years ago I picked it up at a bookstore in Louisville and took it on three trips to Europe. When I got my Kindle Fire for Christmas, there was no question what book I was going to download first, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. Anything you want to know about the rise and fall of Adolf Hitler, you can find here. This is, undoubtedly the best work on the subject period. All other books pale in comparison. If you don't read any other book connected to World War II, this is the one to get. Forget the others. I HIGHLY recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is the best book I have ever read on World War II Germany that I have ever read - I've read a few. It is written from a unique perspective. The author was a journalist in Germany at the time Hitler came to power. He stayed in Europe and reported on the war up close and personal. His insight is amazing. He was certainly a brilliant man, very observant. This book really puts the pieces together. World War II did not happen in a vacuum nor did the rise of Hitler to power. Anyone interested in Hitler and/or World War II should read this book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is hard to beat when it comes to detailing the causes of WWII, particularly in the European theater. I have read many different books on WWII history and thought that I had a pretty good grasp of what happened, when it happened, how it happened and the eventual results, but upon reading this book, I realized that there were much that I did not read about. Shirer filled in many of the gaps in my knowledge of this crucial period in history.Considering the amount of names, dates and details that Shirer put in the book, he has managed to write a large work that rates very high on readability. At no point in the book did it get dry (at least for me). He has managed to weave together his voluminous research into captured German papers as well as interviews and correspondence with those involved into a very coherent, &quot;story-telling&quot; way.The reason I didn't rate this book the full 5 stars is because Shirer, as a journalist and not a military historian per se, couldn't resist injecting his strong personal biases and prejudices throughout the entire book. I understand that a certain amount of personal bias is sometimes inevitable in a work written by a journalist, but when those same views get repeated over and over again, it just becomes plain annoying.The first glaring bias that gnawed on my nerves was Shirer's repeated attack on some of Hitler's henchmen because they happened to be homosexual. He was trying to make a point that Hitler employed some of the worst scums of the earth during his early rise to power. I would fully agree with the fact that these men were scums because they were also murderers, thieves.... but homosexual? To place someone's sexual orientation (and we're not talking about pedophilia here) on the list of the world's biggest crimes shows Shirer's worst inconsistencies - you simply can condemn Hitler for being the worst bigot in the world and yet demonstrate such glaring bigotry yourself.His personal attacks also get very tiring after a while. True, Goering was one of the most despicable characters to come out of the Nazi era, but when an author of a supposed work of history chooses to refer to him time and time again as &quot;the FAT Field Marshal&quot; or &quot;the CORPULENT Field Marshal&quot;, it kind of takes a lot away from the reader's sense of the author's objectivity. Moreover, the fact that Goering wasn't a thin man doesn't have anything to do with the events of that period. For that matter, Churchhill was no model of fitness either, but the author doesn't point that out at all.Sometimes, Shirer lets his personal biases contribute to silly inconsistencies. One moment, he'd be talking about &quot;typical German clumsiness&quot;, and a few chapters later, while talking about another event, he would write about &quot;typical German orderliness&quot;. Which one is it? Were the Germans slobs or perfectionists? Maybe he just shouldn't have made generalizations so freely like that throughout the entire book. Tell us the events that happened and let us make up our own minds. In similar ways, Shirer also seems to be torn between deciding whether Hitler was a genius, or a bumbling maniac. His views on that differ from chapter to chapter.It may seem like I've written more about the book's weak points than its strong ones. The thing is, the book is invaluable as far as WWII history works are concerned. I'm just trying to emphasize that although you won't be disappointed with the mountain of details offered by it, it is also extremely important to know that this book must be read with an open mind, knowing that the author has liberally injected many of his personal biases into the narrative. At no point should it be considered strictly a work of history (in the vein of Stephen Ambrose's &quot;D-DAY&quot; etc. for example). Shirer gives you history the way HE wants you to see it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer was well qualified to write this all-to-necessary book. As a war correspondent, he lived in Nazi Germany, covering the darkest chapter in human history thoroughly and objectively as possible. This 50-year old classic is a story that tragically is not told very factually anymore.This book should be read to counterbalance all the misinformation that now envelops the Third Reich. While the politically correct spin often claims that Christianity is responsible for massacre of the Jews-the National Holocaust Museum in Washington DC is founded on such fatuity--this book details Hitler's hatred and oppression of Catholics and Protestants. He imprisoned thousands of priests, nuns, and ministers in Germany and warned that he would exterminate all clerics in Poland who failed to preach his message. Shortly after seizing power he ordered all churches to replace the crucifix with a swastika and to substitute Mein Kampf for the Bible-not exactly what the radical liberal left likes to teach about this evil dictator, who in reality despised Christianity as much as he abhorred Judaism. Pope Pius who today is regularly singled out as being insensitive to nazi atrocities is evidenced to have been one of the few vociferous voices who repeatedly denounced nazism from its earliest days.Another current myth debunked is the nazis' systematic annihilation of homosexuals. The book documents that many of the founders of nazism were in fact homosexuals themselves. When innocent homosexuals were brutally murdered it was during Hitler's purges of party members who had aroused his suspicions. Often these targeted gay advisers were caught in the company of innocent young men who were killed along with their nazi lovers. Even Hitler's questionable sexual preference is alluded to in this voluminous narrative.The most shocking aspect of the book is its portrayal of Hitler's incredible ability to manipulate. He did not gain his power by force or treachery-rather he was one of the most skillful politicians in history. When he gave a speech, he could feel the German people's pain. He promised a brighter future for the all the citizens, and skillfully avoided discussing his fanatical plans in his campaign stemwinders. As a politician he accomplished a great deal. He gave Germany a booming economy, low unemployment rates, and his approval ratings were high right up until the end. Obviously, he failed in providing moral leadership, but The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich does a remarkable job of detailing how the one of the most evil people in history was able to assume and maintain so much power for so long. It should serve as a warning for all generations to come.At 1500+ pages, it is an endeavor, but it's a story that must be told and more importantly it must be ACCURATELY told. Far too many innocent lives were wiped out by the depravity of nazism to let the story be doctored to suit the purposes of special interest groups. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is that rare work that truly dissects a historical period in a very readable fashion."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"As many others have said, the book is excellent, but the copy editing is terrible.Far too many typos, and the footnote system is abysmal.Hopefully, they will update a corrected copy, with footnotes inserted into the text body.If they do, I will update my star rating."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This colosus of a book will tell you most of what you need to know about the 3rd Reich's inner workings. I say most in that this book focuses on the top dogs in Nazi Germany - for example Eichmann is only mentioned a couple of time, as is Mengele. In addition, not all the facts had come to light when the book was written, a fact that Shirer readily admits. However, the advantage of having this book written so soon after the facts means that many of the participants (those that weren't executed after the Nurnberg trials) were still alive and knew the author personally (or at least by reputation) due to his coverage of German affairs for the US media. He used this contact on several occasions to flesh out the official documents.Because of the fact that the author was a correspondent, the &quot;Rise&quot; part of the Nazi party is a far more personal and interesting read. It is liberally sprinkled with personal observations and commentary. After the American journalists were expelled from Germany, the book is not quite as interesting, but still a page turner.The highlights for me were the comparative critisisms, e.g. comparing Guderian's claims (in his autobiography) with the information taken from OKW or other people's diaries. A lot of the Axis leaders tried to downplay their roles in books after the war (another prime example is Speer); the book points out the lies and half-truths.In addition to the value of the book for giving a full and coherent picture of the workings of the Third Reich, I've found it to be an invaluable reference tool. I come back to this book again and again to look up information when reading other history books, when something pertaining to the era is mentioned in the media, etc. It is well indexed and sources are explicitly defined. Essential for the armchair historian as well as those more professional ones."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This monumental volume - 1300 pages - is one serious piece of history. The author has lived in Germany under the Third Reich, as a journalist, and this is a massive plus for such a book, as the author can add his personal experience of the events and of some of the people involved.Most of the book is based on astronomic quantities of secret papers captured at the end of the war. Thus, the narrative of this book is peppered with direct quotes from all these sources: telegrams, letters, diary entries, transcribed phone discussions, etc.If you wonder what the book is like in general, I will say this: the first parts deal with Hitler, the situation after WW1, and the likes. Then, once the Nazis are in power, you get an extremely thorough and detailed narrative of the events. That's the bulk of the book. It may repel some people, understandably, but that's a great way to get to know what really went down and how it went down. But be warned, this isn't the tale of horror you might have been interested in reading.You'll very rarely read about the Jews, for instance. Chapter 27, \\"The New Order\\" is the only part where the death camps and scientific experiences are dealt with at any length; the rest of the book, as said before, is really about political history. That means you will read about foreign ministers, diplomacies, Mussolini and Ciano's diary, the communication between various governments, etc. So if the gruesome is all you're interested in, read chapter 27 in a library, but don't buy the book, you'd be disappointed.It took me a very long time to read this brick! But I don't regret it at all. It gave me a much deeper understanding of WW2. I also appreciate the author's more involved tone than a regular historian would have used. Shirer does not hesitate to call Goering \\"fat\\" or \\"obese\\" when Goering was indeed fat and obese. Himmler is depicted as an ex-chicken farmer, and most Nazis as thugs.Recommended to anyone into WW2 and Nazism, and who wants a really thorough history of Nazism. Again, I stress that this book is 95% political history, with events, and not ideology (not much)."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I promised myself that I would get around to reading this book &quot;someday&quot; when I was twenty--now I'm nearly forty and feel badly that I waited so long! This is a great book; not so much for its literary prose or intellectual bearing--but for the honest, straightforward way in which William Shirer tells the story quite literally of the rise and fall of the Third Reich. Shirer was a newspaper man and broadcaster working in Germany and he saw the early rise of the Nazi party first-hand; although the book is long (1100+ pages in hardback), it reads like a giant newspaper story--as if each paragraph was written &quot;top down&quot; and cut at exactly the right point to keep you on the edge of your seat. Shirer has a curious habit of footnoting almost every fact--and his notes are at least as fine a read as his text. Although he freely admits his predjudices in the foreward (and only a robot would not have them)--he does a fine job of sticking to the job of factual story telling. From the standpoint of someone living in a western democracy in 1998, it's almost impossible to fathom the breadth and depth of the terrible deeds accomplished by Hitler's Third Reich--and how he was able to remain in power. Shirer really focuses the perspective here. Do yourself a favor--don't try to speak intelligently on the Third Reich at some cocktail party without having first read this book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This was loaned to me by a friend, so I can't say that I paid for it, but if I had I would be upset. I read this for a class in high school and was blown away by the detail and yet how intimate it was. This is one of the best histories ever done in my book.The transfer rates as one of the worst, however. Wrong words (see other reviews to get a better understanding of what this means), choppy chapters, and the like. This begs for someone to come along a proof read this one."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Hard to put down. Very good, but two major weaknesses: in Shirer's intense hatred for the Nazis he makes them too clownish to have been able to accomplish what they did. Easy to understand, but better if we came to share his feelings through a more dispassionate presentation of facts - they're more than sufficient. And even near 1200 pages it needs a few more - he sometimes leaves out background that would explain how important situations came to be, especially military and industrial ones. One day Hitler takes a wild gamble against vastly superior French forces by reoccupying the Rhineland; a few months later he has the most powerful military machine in Europe making mincemeat out of Poland overnight. We know the factories were humming in violation of Versailles, but what was produced when and in what numbers isn't much explained, nor how the army was grown so rapidly. And one day there are no German troops in Italy, then suddenly they're spread around the peninsula. How they got there and when, where, how many, what types of divisions - are hardly explained. (There are better explanations of these things when Germany confronts Russia in the East and the Allies in the West.)Shirer also doesn't explain much about German developments of new military tactics and technologies, which were crucial to the Third Reich's rapid conquest of Europe (and to modern warfare generally) - these just appear with invasions and battles. Granted this is a history of the Reich, not a military history per se, but the Reich's history is as much military as anything else (though Shirer does shed interesting light on Germany's recovery from the Depression under the Nazis).Both problems are probably partly due to the book's being written so soon after the events; Shirer seems to assume his reader is an informed person who lived during the war. Valuable as it is, the book's a reminder of why historians are skeptical of writing recent history. But it's still a classic and a page-turner at that. Also Shirer, besides having been a journalist in Germany from before Hitler's rise until 1940 (or '41?), did an enormous amount of research using a wealth of primary sources. This direct experience and considerable research probably make the book a must-read, but one to be supplemented."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I was always puzzled how such a patently evil group of characters could rise to power in a cultured, accomplished nation like Germany. I've read other books such as Churchill's brilliant \\"The Gathering Storm\\" (Vol I in his personal history of the war), Hitler's Willing Executioners, and so on. Shirer's book fills in an important gap as he was present as a reporter as Hitler rose to power, and highly focussed on the events of the day, and was therefore close to the machinations of the German political system. His detailed and often personal commentary on leading characters provides the reader with some sense of what it would have been like to watch what was going on as a member of the German general public. The book is extremely well documented and he frequently notes if supporting documents for events exist. There are also excellent asides about various things, such as the possible reason why Hitler used the term Fuehrer (although it just means leader, it was also used in a boys club he enjoyed as a youth).Some people object to Shirer's descriptions of Goering's girth (whereas he didn't disparage Churchill's size) or Himmler's appearance, for example, as being unprofessional for a would-be historian. But as journalism it seems acceptable, and few would fault him for making personal remarks about these evil characters, who he often encountered in his work and despised, and indeed it added colour to the book for me. These remarks are valid descriptions, as well, and moreover frequently lend insight. Goering, in particular, had degenerated into a gluttonous character in all matters, whether that be food, jewellery, art, or clothes (there is a description by Ciano of \\"bloated, overbearing\\" [Ciano's words] Goering's boorish discussion of his jewellery over dinner, and his ridiculous furs, which remind Ciano of what a \\"high class prostitute wears to the opera\\"). There is also good reason for highlighting their physical shortcomings, sexual orientation, and perversions: the Nazis pursued eugenics and held themselves up as the master race, and often condemned others for things they hated in themselves. This is critical: As comes through strongly on every page, a preponderance of senior Nazis were arrogant, unabashed hypocrites, and were misfits of German society until they gained power via the Nazi movement.The dominant insight I got from this book was that the Nazis were pathological liars and criminals, through and through. In the language of the day, to quote Roosevelt's frequent description of Hitler (which we discover angered Hitler), they were gangsters, though of course saying that is doing a disservice to gangsters given the magnitude of the crimes. I came away from this book feeling that to comprehend their actions better I would have to know more about the psychology of the criminal mind, and of antisocial/sociopathic/psychopathic personality disorders. I am grateful to Shirer for this work."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I have wanted to read this book for what literally amounts to 50 years and finally decided to treat myself to the 50th Anniversary edition as a Christmas present. As expected, the book is a riveting account of a very dark period of world history, expertly written by William L. Shirer. Unfortunately, due to a printing error, my particular volume did not include pages 837 through 868, 30 critical pages chronicling the beginning of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. I have contacted Amazon and they are going to send a replacement but I only hope the error was caught by the publisher and the replacement does not have the same missing pages. I also hope no one else has encountered this disappointing dilemma. I am certain that if it was a complete volume, I would be rating book with 5 Stars."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"'The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich' may be one of the most important non-fiction books ever written. Read on to find out why.William Shirer has done the world a great service in creating this monumental work. Anyone who may continue to wonder at the presence of evil in the world would do well to read Shirer's book. The author expertly describes how evil manifested itself to produce one of history's greatest villians, Adolph Hitler. Shirer traces how Hitler became the Hitler we know today and how his twisted ideas led converts, demanded allegiance, and terrorized millions. Nearly the entire work is taken from journals, diaries, and eye-witness accounts of those who experienced the years leading to Nazi Germany and beyond. (Shirer himself was an eye-witness to many of the events recorded in the work.) This is a completely readable, comprehensive look at one of history's darkest hours.The first thing readers will encounter is the immense size of the book, nearly 1200 pages of text. Please do not be intimidated by the number of pages. They are well worth your time. Not a word is wasted. Take it in small bites.As I read the book, I kept thinking over and over of the parallels with our current situation against terrorism, and I wondered, \\"Have we really learned anything?\\" In the late 1930's, anyone who had read Hitler's \\"Mein Kampf\\" would have known exactly what the dictator planned to do to the world. He spelled it out. Either no one read it (which is doubtful), or no one took him seriously. Bin Laden also told this country what his plans were before Sept. 11. Clearly. We didn't listen then either. Of course, that's not the only parallel. There are more, and as each presents itself, the more relevant this book becomes to us today. Reading the book, you will learn that Hitler did a multitude of things expertly, but was not thorough in many of his plans. The terrorists are extremely thorough. Hitler many times did not look far enough ahead (especially with respect to Russia). The terrorists obviously plan months and years in advance. Many of Hitler's henchmen were incompetent in many areas, military and economic. It doesn't appear that incompetence is a major terrorist problem. They know what they're doing. When the time came, the United States was prepared for the Nazis of the Third Reich. May we be even more prepared for the evils that we face today. Don't fall into the trap of thinking 'The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich' is a crusty old history book that belongs on a shelf in a library. Read it now and look around you. I think you'll see that Shirer's work is frighteningly relevant."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I've wanted to read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich for fifty years and Kindle made it possible without lugging around a 10-pound book.Though some of the language and social references are dated (Shirer frequently refers to \\"homosexual perverts\\"), there's no doubt that this is powerful and compelling history, giving the most complete look at the Nazi gangster state and the way many millions of people simply let an evil genius take over their lives while millions of others gave their lives. Learning what might have been--that the German Army's general staff ALMOST overthrew Hitler before the Nazis swallowed up Czechoslovakia--is enough to break your heart. It's a cautionary tale about the rise of fanaticism for today's world, too. For the work Shirer did, five stars isn't enough.Unfortunately, the Kindle formatting leaves much to be desired. Some excerpts Shirer quotes from other texts are indented to easily signify what's going on. Most others are not, forcing some rereading to get the context right. Paragraph indentation is tiny (one character), making reading harder than it needs to be. And the \\"native\\" problem with Kindle of not being able to go back to reference something you've already read (which is important in a book as dense with facts as this one) makes this a struggle sometimes. Sure, you could bookmark, but there's no way to know when you read something the first time that you'll want to refer back to it tomorrow night. I consciously traded the ten pounds for this problem, but sometimes I wish I hadn't.Finally, this isn't escapist literature. You have to concentrate. But it's more than worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I am a detail person, and so this book really hit the spot for me.I would listen on a hike, I would listen on a bike.I could listen in my car, I could listen in a bar.OK, I never actually listened in a bar, but I did listen pretty much anywhere and everywhere because of how much this book kept my attention, despite being over 50 hours long. The only drawback to this book is that my audible credits built up for a couple of months while I listened. William Shirer combines amazing depths of study and research with his personal knowledge and eyewitness accounts to make sense of the Third Reich and give understanding to the dynamics of it's rise and fall.Despite it's length, this book is extremely well organized and easy to follow, while at the same time the true story of Nazi Germany is woven in a way that maintains your interest from beginning to end. I have never been a history buff, but since reading this book, I am ready to learn more."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I've purchased this 1960 edition of the book. It has two maps of Europe on the inner parts of the cover: one showing the German Empire (when Hitler had conquered almost every corner of the continent) and the other map showing the paths followed by other armies to regain the control of it. This edition is really old and pages were a little yellow (as I purchased an used book), but it was in a very good condition.As many others said, this book is a masterpiece of history. The author had access to many sources of information, in addition he lived in Germany during the first year of the conflict and has many historical background and knowledge about the Germans, the way that they lived and what was like to live in Germany before the Nazi party gained the control of the people, the army and the people living there.I'm just a casual reader, and this book seems giant for me because there are around 1200 pages of text, each one well documented and with many references. I love to read historical books, and this one is the perfect description of what really happened during the war. I think of it as an encyclopedia because events are cronologically sorted and presented in a simple way, as if they were happening again.Finally, when I read this book I imagine the complete situations as described, and in a couple of pages I'm transported completely to a different country. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer developed an amazingly detailed job with his \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\". It does not only tell us about Adolf Hitler's throne of tyranny, but also about Nazism environment in terms of philosophy, ideology, doctrine, and methods. Based on original documents, this book is extensive due to the amount of detail that was put into it, and it makes this book a piece of art for studying and historical purposes. As well as Allan Bullock's \\"Adolf Hitler: A Study in Tyranny\\", the story told takes the reader to the actual locations in which events took place, gets to know the people who were involved in this reign of madness, and tries to identify the reasons that led the world to it's darkest era in the XXth century. Very recommendable work."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Although this book is one and a half thousand pages long, it still can be described as a general overview of the most fateful time in human history. This book is well written, informative, and easy to understand; however, it is not very objective. The author clearly has a bitter anti-German bias, which sometimes results in utter sarcasm. Although he sights his sources with amazing detail, he often puts a negative spin on many Germans, particularly the Generals of World War II, making them look like bumbling cowards. Still, anyone who reads this book will not regret the experience, and will become a better person for the knowledge which they have gained."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Despite its length and density (the author devotes almost 200 pages just to the month before the Germans invaded Poland), this is a fascinating book. Well written and still up-to-date, though from today's perspective it contains the occassionally &quot;politically incorrect&quot; phrase, such as when Shirer refers to the &quot;perverts and queers&quot; that populated Hitler's inner circle and the Nazi party. Nevertheless, this is wonderful history and required reading for anyone interested in the World War II era--a time still resonating and still influential on the world today."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer is the &quot;poster-boy&quot; for his age of reporting. He delivers hard facts and keeps the atmosphere of the time period in perspective. That's what makes his book &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,&quot; a page turner. Eventhough some Germans have described Shirer's book as being one-sided, he allows us to view the world through his journalistic ventures into Nazi Germany and to political strategy in Churchill's England."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a very informative and reliable account of the Nazi regime and the rule of Adolf Hitler. The book is very interesting, but it is also very long and detailed. One could read it several times and still gain new information each time read. In order to understand and gain the most from the book it helps to have some prior knowledge of German history during this time period, however, Shirer does a good job of giving the necessary background information, so one can appreciate why events unfolded as they did. This makes for a most interesting reading experience. In sum the book was not only informative, but also it made me appreciate the many facets of life during the Nazi Era."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book gives us a great insight into the working of the Nazi government, the personalities in it and its dealings with other countries. It is extremely detailed and leaves out nothing."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is a \\"must read\\" for any one. I just finished listening the audio book and I am still reflecting on it. However, I can already report that it shook my worldview.Also note, the audible edition is very good."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I bought this book when it first was published, because Shirer was a highly regarded journalist/expert on Germany before and during WWII. I had such a high opinion of the book after reading it then that I bought it in the Kindle version when I saw it on the Amazon list. My Kindle says it was published in 2011, but I first read it in the 1950's or 60's. It was a thick, heavy book but easy to read and very factual.This book gives the best description I have seen of the development of Hitler's mind and the formation of his twisted ideas and the ingredients of his rise to power. It removes him from a slightly comic--and very deadly--tyrant to an almost inevitable product of the period between the wars. This book will not tell you everything about WWII, but, in my opinion, you cannot fully understand the war without reading it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"One cannot claim to understand the terror of Nazism until they have read this book. Shirer does a magnificent job of examining the rise of Hitler, arguably one of the most evil men who ever lived. He was so astute in gathering like minded evil men to his inner circle while convincing the German people to accept him as their leader--while the rest of Europe and the US failed to recognize the magnitude of the threat until it was too late. This book comes as close to answering both the \\"how\\" and \\"why\\" questions of the rise of Nazism. The author keeps us in constant suspense as the Brown Shirts rise and fall, the SS comes to prominence, and Hitler comes to power supported by a disgracefully servile military leadership. The political and diplomatic treachery that follows is mind boggling. It is shameful to note that the German people supported Hitler all the way, even to the end! A very worthwhile reading effort!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The Long Night is a very powerful nonfiction book. The plot concerns Hitler's rise to power and the destruction that ensued after. Shirer, the main character, was the only reporter who reported every brutal event. He was one of the few not to fall for Nazi propaganda while still remaining (for a little while) in Germany and among the soldiers and Nazi elite. The author has the ability to make the events appear as if they are occurring right when the reader is reading about them. The atmosphere and permeating fear and horror is tangible, as is the desperation.Shirer is an admirable character to read about. He reported his findings accurately, much to the chagrin and impending threats by the Nazi party. He advocated early warnings about the true intentions of the Nazi party and he stayed for as long as possible in the heart of the chaos. The reader will grow close to Shirer while reading this novel and share his hopelessness and need for the truth to be known. Shirer and the reader both will feel increasingly disparaging towards powerful leaders and the people who should have listened and taken into consideration Shirer's reports. A history buff and the average nonfiction reader will devour this nonfiction book.*Complimentary copy received for this review, does not affect my opinion in any way*"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This superbly readable account is one of the great works of history. Journalist William L Shirer (1904-1993) touches nearly all bases, including politics, Gestapo terror, diplomacy, economics, propaganda, war, etc. The author begins by examining the obscure Nazi party in the early 1920's, then desribes its rising influence with the onset of the Great depression. Soon Hitler and the Nazi's were able to grab total control over Germany (and destroy the Weimar Republic) by a combination of politics, Gestapo arrests, and murder. Readers see how re-armament reduced joblessness, the improved economy leading many ordinary Germans to view Hitler's odious regime as national saviors. Then, of course, we read about the devastating war that Hitler launched in 1939, leading to the deaths of tens of millions, plus the holocaust against the Jew and Gypsies (plus other undesireables). Finally, the pages end with the utter destruction of Nazi Germany as the Allies closed in from all sides.William L. Shirer was a correspondent in Nazi Germany from 1934-1940, and he used hundreds of captured Nazi government documents to write these stellar pages. The result is a partly eye-witness, partly historical, thoroughly superb volume. Not that it's flawless; Shirer name-calls top Nazi thugs he knew and detested, and his coverage ranges from excellent (politics, diplomacy) to merely adequate (military history, the holocaust). Still, this superb best-seller captured a national book award, and is so readable in its 1,000+ pages that it has sold well over 20 million copies.This book made professional historians jealous and led many others to believe that Shirer was Jewish (actually, he was a Protestant Christian). Even many that typically avoid books of history have read this engrossing volume from end to end. You should too."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Please IGNORE all of the 1 and 2 star reviews here. I have read them and they are completely inaccurate! This book is well worth the read. It flows smoothly and effortlessly while keeping your attention. It is difficult to put down!

BUY it and ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Even though this book was written quite some time ago (1960's) it is still highly readable and an excellent overview of the Nazi regime. Shirer is an excellent writer and brings to life the origins of the Nazi movement, the war and the various German generals. Though you may have learned much from the endless media exposure to Hitler and the Third Reich, this book really is a scholarly overview written in layman's terms that will provide with interesting insights into Germany and the war. There are a few areas where the expressions are dated, but overall this book really holds up and despite its length (over 1100 pages) is a pretty quick read for such a long book. It really makes me want to learn more!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Though it took me just about as many years to finish this massive tome as it took for the actual Nazi regime to play out, I would still rank this as one of my favorite history books.

I doubt there will ever be as definitive a work on the whole Nazi regime as what is presented here."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I bought a used copy of this book over a decade ago, and kept in in my library as a \\"to be read\\" selection for a future date.

Don't be intimidated! If you are interested in reading a one volume history of Nazi Germany, start here. Much of this book reads like a series of journalist pieces of a quality you might find in the New Yorker or The Atlantic.Some criticisms: 1) this edition of the book, at least, lacks helpful maps and pictures of key figures (a shot of the dock at Nuermberg would have been nice), 2) Shirer's story is best during the \\"rise\\" years, when he was present in Germany as a journalist, and his telling of the story loses some of its color in the \\"fall\\" years (though it is never colorless), and 3) Shirer's book was finished in the 1960s, and so lacks the benefit of some more recent scholarship.None of this is to say that this is not a fascinating read and worth the investment of time. Don't be intimidated! Just pick it up and get started, you'll be drawn in too."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I prefer non-fiction books and can't imagine how I missed ths one for so many years. My mother-in-law was a member of the Hitler Youth and I've always wanted her to explain to me how the whole nazi thing happened. But she doesn't like to talk about it. And I honestly never understood how the average Wilhelm in the street didn't take action; didn't speak out. Shirer's book explained it well. They were terrified and worn out with being terrified. I'm very glad I read this book as it's helped my insight. What it also did was make me very uncomfortable with actions my current governement is pursuing now. Often the hairs on the back of my neck went up when I read how easily and subtly facism took hold of a whole country. A long read but well worth it!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The fact that at the very start of the book Shirer makes it clear that his target while writing this book is to be as objective as possible clearly highlights his maturity not onl as a journalist but also as a successful history writer. Through out the whole book Shirer makes sure that arguments are based on quotations and other sources of evidence of which there was no shortage as he had complete access to all the caputred German documents. He also acknowledges that there might be certain prejudices of his involved in the book in the way he interpreted facts. This incident too clearly highlights the fact that he took extreme care of the objectivity of his work. There are not many places in the book where one can see the author's interpretation somewhat independent because Shirer has based the vast majority of his argument on evidence. This is the most impressive characteristic of the book.However, I felt while reading the book that the author in some cases placed too much emphasis on events on the sideline although related to Nazi Germany but perhaps it was not necessary to put so much details in narrating those events. For example, the tremendous amounts of detail given to the planning of invasion of Poland and the details given about German treatment of Czekoslovakia and Austria sometimes drag down the narrative somewhat.Overall, it is a classic work on Nazi Germany and some of the evidence and quotations presented in the narative from the top Nazi officials in staggering. Sure enough, Shirer had a big advantage of being stationed in Berlin until 1940 later moving to Paris so he could examine the scene much closer than any other historian writing an account later would. However, it must be said that the placing of facts within the narrative and the expression in the book is extremely impressive. I would recommend anyone buying this book to buy 'This is Berlin' by the same author. It is not a book but a series of reports made by Shirer from Berlin for CBS and NBC in New York."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I read it somewhere as a teenager. It is long but interesting. The writer is a journalist. He has opinions, but I thought the book was a good one. It does what the title says generally. It chronicles the rise and fall of the third reich.I felt like the book sets the flavor or tone that is necessary when learning about such a thing. I also suggest Inside the Third Reich by Albert Speer and Order of the Death's head, which is about the rise of the SD and SS. Between the three of them I feel like I have more knowledge than most about Nazi Germany. I would guess so would anyone that read these three books.This book is long. I read all three books over the course of maybe five years. I was in no hurry. Each of these books leaves a lasting impression to say the least.I would argue that a focus on power is the right way to go. There are plenty of mindless racists around. Hitler and his peers were able to sieze power and nearly take over the world. There are many reasons to be informed about these people and people like them. Thank you for your time and enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I am not a big historian or student of any means, but just a regular dude who knows how to read. :-) I mention this because some historical books tend to be so out of order and full of dates that skip back in forth through the years that you can't remember what happened the last time you read about that year. However, for those of you who have an interest in the Hitler- Nazi years but do not want to get a boring history book than this is the book to get. This book just flows very easily and you will not find yourself lost after every other page. It is very entertaining and in an easy to follow cronological order so that you might actually remember some of the dates. A great read; full of important and useful knowledge. Some people say that Shirer is biased! Biased against or for who? To me, he just seems to be telling a story as he sees it backed by plenty of documentation and even first hand knowledge. I don't see the &quot;bias&quot; point of view. Anyway, a great book for all who can read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Shirer compares to Gibbon in the process of detailing of an empire. Gibbon drew on historical research to write about Rome. Shirer was there on the spot to write about Nazi Germany. This history details why Germany was susceptible to the rise of the nazis, and their subsequent rise to power, their trampling of all opposition, and the inevitable road to war. A fantastic read for someone who wants to know why the second world war happened."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"A full, in-depth examination of the historically-stunning existence of the Third Reich. This book gives a tremendously-detailed and well-annotated insight into Hitler, his psyche and rise to power. If you want to know as much as possible about this topic, read this book. If you are looking for more of a summary, pass it by. I believe this book would be fully appreciated by those who have an understanding of Machiavellianism and an interest in the sordid world of calculating human behavior and politics. The book does not go into great detail on the specific military campaigns. It is more about the way the Nazis operated and is a must-read for anyone who is a student of 20th-century history. Basically, I wish all adults would read this book to realize the dangers of hate that can repeat themselves."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Put this book in a different environment and give the characters different names and it would be one of the greatest gangster books ever written.

It is written masterly and interestingly. Shirer dips into every fact that he knew and expands on it. It recounts every bit of information from the childhood to the death of the infamous Adolf Hitler. I am 14 years old, and I loved to book so adults should love it even more. I would also suggest Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler to learn about Hitler's logic."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer's book \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" is the best book that has ever been written about Nazi Germany. Shirer meticulously researched his account. Its not short, and someone who doesn't want to take the time to get a thorough account should settle for something else.Shirer covers the rise of Naziis and explains the conditions that brought them to power. The post-war chaos from World War I had an awful effect on Germany. Although, Shirer disputes some things that are commonly spouted. For instance, he disputes that the boundaries given to Germany by the treaty of Versailles (following WWI) were inadequate. He also disputes that the entire treaty was as unfair as many Germans claimed it to be.That a rag-tag group like the Naziis could become a major political party and eventually win control of the German government is testimony to the despair that can be created by an economic depression, human stupidity/gullibility, and the effect propaganda can have. One must assign a good part of the blame for the rise of Hitler to the German upper classes and the German professional classes. Most of these people did not initially support Hitler, but they went along and did nothing to stop him.Some of the chapters in the book really stand out. The chapter on the \\"Battle of Britain\\" is fascinating reading. Its amazing how England--greatly outnumbered-- was able to hold its own against Germany for over a year before other countries joined them in the struggle. The chapter on the invasion of Russia is interesting reading as well. That Russia managed to hang on after such a massive assault is a miracle. The chapter on the death camps called the \\"New Order\\" is a detailed and sickening account of Nazi atrocities against Jews, gypsies, and people of slavic ancestry. If you read it, have a strong stomach.Shirer's book is a one volume way to educate yourself about most of World War II. Anyone interested in this subject simply cannot pass it up."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The must-have book for the European Theatre.

Granted, much has been scrutinized about the Third Reich in multiple media, whether in films, documentaries, dossiers, first hand material or novels. Yet, Mr. Shirer remains, after 40 years, one of the top authorities on what took place in Germany between 1933 and 1945.This work has become a default must-read for 20th century history scholars, high school European history students and novice World War II snoops. If it may lack in articulateness and style, it compensates in its breadth and balance of facts. A &quot;fait accompli&quot; for any research-obsessed historian."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I am not a big historian or student of any means, but just a regular dude who knows how to read. :-) I mention this because some historical books tend to be so out of order and full of dates that skip back in forth through the years that you can't remember what happened the last time you read about that year.

Just at the Black Book of Communism illustrated Marx's Communist Manifesto, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich documents fascism in action. This book is a chilling read. I could not finish the chapter about the human experimentation that was conducted in concentration camps. This book shows in vivid detail the dangers of concentrating all governmental power into the hands of a single man. No single man is more worthy of the hell he now resides in than Adolf Hitler."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Although contemporary histories may have revised the story first told here, few have ever told it better than Shirer, who was a correspondent in Nazi Germany until 1941. The writing is tremendous and the narrative flows very smoothly. The only element of the book that has not aged well is Shirer's credulous acceptance of some of Hitler's farfetched &quot;table-talk&quot; strategizing, which were not so much his plans for world conquest as running off at the mouth."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Being a WW2 buff, I have many, many books on Hitler, the Naziesand the Third Reich.

We shall see."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is certainly no light read. It is almost 1300 pages in length and no one would describe the subject matter as light reading. However, it is a fascinating in depth account of the brutal anc calculating decisions that led to the rise of the Nazi regime and the overreach, backbiting, and poor decisions that ultimately led to its downfall. William Shirer has been criticized for his theories on what led the German people to accept such a regime, but I am not an expert worthy of commenting on that. I'll just say that I find those portions of the book less interesting than the behind the scenes account of the political maneuvering anyway, so I wasn't at all put off by it. My only criticism is that the terror wrought on the Jewish population seemed to be given less attention than it may have deserved. However, there are plenty of other accounts that are focused solely on the Holocaust itself, so this book fills another role."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I'm only maybe 1/2 way thru this book , but I had to stop & write a review !

It's definitely not for the novice, if you just recently got to reading about WW2, go ahead & familiarize yourself with D-Day,The Fall OF Stalingrad, & other battles. And THEN read THIS book, but IF you can get it NOW...Buy IT & put it back for a spell. Ever wonder how Russia aligned herself with Hitler & why ? You know Russia hated Germany, no? How did Germany pull off the [Supposed] Poland Incident, ? How did Hitler Actually RISE To Power, break treaty after treaty & Get Away with It Etc. You got'ta read this book, it'll floor you with the information Mr. Shirer brings out, & the easy reading style. At times I was almost laughing at some of the stunts pulled [ or tried ] by various Powers, Britian, France, Germany, Poland etc., talk about diplomacy, !!! Ha ! He takes you step by step through all the shenanagans, backstabbing , double crosses, political ploys, murders,deceits,etc. Mr. Shirer draws you deeper & deeper into the web until you can hardly wait to get to the next page ! I'm totally amazed at HOW HE EVER managed to put all this info into an easy read & sooo informative & totally interesting format. If you're into WW2 this book is a MUST READ !

Its mammoth size is a little daunting but it is highly readable. Shirer gives you all the facts without being heavy handed or boring. He also provides a relatively unique view of the inner workings of the regime being an American working inside and around Nazi Germany. One can tell that the experience affected him deeply which gives his prose a more genuine feel but never clouds his vision. A great place to learn about this horrible institution."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book gives an in depth study of the rise to power of the Third Reich and their fall into history. It only took me a few months when I was in high school to go through it; and now that I am older I find it quite a good book to refer back to when I need to point out facts in an argument."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I usually have little patience with tomes this voluminous. However, this book was an extremely interesting read. I finished it in less than a week.Although extremely informative, sections of this book are clouded by Shirer's personal opinions. He dismisses several top Nazis as buffoons which seems somewhat unbelievable."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Having read and re-read this book, I often wonder how it is possible that Germany was let off the hook so easily despite the incredible moral and physical damage which it inflicted upon human civilization. Shirer makes it abundantly clear to all that this sorry history should never, ever be forgotten, nor repeated. This book is about why so many Americans died in Europe at that time, and why Americans should feel the values behind our constitution, our democracy and our ideals of social justice."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book provides a fascinating look at the terrible war of attrition waged by Hitler and his horrific Third Reich against the very core of Western civilization and culture. It is both historically precise and masterfully written, a true historical classic. As the saying goes, &quot;Those who do not learn from the past are bound to repeat it.&quot; We should all remember and learn from this tragic period of human history so that we might not have to pay the teriible price that was charged to our progenitors.

I've read an amzing amount of books on the subject, yet I've never encountered one as good as The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich.Shirer is not too harsh on the German people, like many Jewish and obviously influenced writers have been.

Otherwise there might have been some hope for him."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read on this subject. The minute by minute account of the events and happenings, from the ascendance of Hitler to power, to his defeat, keeps one totally gripped.

It is full of facts and details but unlike many books about this subject, it never gets dull or boring"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This should be the one. William Shirer's comprehensive treatment of the curious rise and horrific fall of the Nazis in post-Weimar Germany is the benchmark volume to measure all other treatments of the era by. There are so many monographs on Nazi Germany that one reels before the list looming in a relevant bibliography. Save yourself the trouble; this book gives one exactly the kind of complete immersion in and coverage of the realities of the era that too many of the other books lack. Shirer, an American journalist stationed in Berlin as a newspaper (and later radio) correspondant during the rise of the National Socialists, was there, on the ground and at the scene witnessing many of the events he describes in such detail. He has, of course, written extensively on these experiences, both herein and elsewhere in books like 'The Nightmare Years' and 'Berlin Diary'. But this book has to be considered his masterpiece, and is worth the time, trouble and price for this hefty best-selling volume. After all, it has never been out of print in the forty years since its original publication in the early 1960s. I promise that if you read this, you'll never think of World War Two in the same way..."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is a marvelous portrayal of an \\"evil empire\\" and its rise and fall. The author is clearly influenced by his participation as a witness to many of the events he portrays, and he captures them in moving detail.The serious flaw in this book is the extremely poor editing by the publisher. It is replete with typographical and other errors for which there is no excuse. This book is a classic and deserves better presentation for readability. I bought the e-book version because the library copy was so heavy that I couldn't carry it around or hold it for reading. The convenience of the electronic version clearly was a factor in my purchase."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I read the original edition in 1962 when I was in High School (we were allowed to read anything we wanted to in study hall except comic books as long as our grades were good).However, the Kindle edition, which appears under the entry for the 50th anniversary edition, is in fact the 1961 edition, and lacks the Rosenbaum introduction, which I was specifically looking forward to reading.This is a great work of history. I just wish the new edition were available for Kindle."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I read this years ago (at least 30) and never thought I would find it on Kindle. I was pleasantly surprised when it popped up on my recommendations list. This work is a classic written by someone who was an eyewitness to one of the most tragic events to occur in human history. It is brilliantly and expertly written by Shirer. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is an excellent text that I recommend to anyone who has a love of history. It is a definite must read to see what contributed to the misery and travesty that was WW2. I am downloading to my Kindle for future re-reads."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is essential to mankind. Along with several other books that cover the holocaust, this book will be read by future generations to remind them of how some of the worst criminals in history came to rule a continent.Why you should read this book:Like I mentioned in the title of this review, it is essential to mankind. This is the foremost history of the Third Reich from a perspective inside the Third reich. The perspective of the events is at times cold, but its was written with the greatest attempts at objectivity. The reader is not automatically forced to make moral judgements by the author; Shirer gives the reader the cold facts and the reader can feel the sorrow of Germany and the world at the evil that thrived on the ignorance and naivete of pre-war policy makers. At times it can be dry and long-winded, but for the most part this book was hard to put down (I read the unabridged version in under 2 weeks). The reader will not be disappointed in this book. Shirer painstakingly studied thousands of captured Nazi documents, memorandums, orders and news releases to come up with this detailed history.What you should expect to see in this book:This book chronicles the life of Hitler from his ancestors to his final hours in the Berlin Chancellory bunker. The main players throughout the Nazi party are given detailed historys alongside Hitler's. Most importantly this book shows the failures of the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations and the Weimar Republic and shows how an Austrian tramp rose to the Dictator of Europe. Mussolini and Italy's dealings with the Third Reich is also given a lot of attention. The details of the diplomatic dealings with the Allies in Munich and the events that led up to the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939 are thoroughly described (I counted approixmately 100 pages on the events that led up to that invasion). The accounts of the holocaust are well detailed, but are not definitive. Shirer describes the holocaust some, but the reader might desire more.What you should not expect to see in this book:There are no maps to speak of in this book. I would suggest that you have a few historical maps on WWII when you read this because the action can become fast paced and it might be a little hard to understand without a thorough knowledge of the geography of Europe. This book is not a military history, so don't expect it to go into detail about the weapons or other aspects of the military. I think only about 20 pages talked about Hitler's invasion of Poland, and that was mostly about his dealings with Stalin in carving Poland up. If you are looking for a military history of WWII, I would suggest Chester Wilmot's _The Struggle for Europe_ (which starts during the Battle of Britain), or Liddel Hart's _History of the Second World War_. In addition, this is not a history of the holocaust. Shirer gives an account of it, but it is by no means comprehensive of definitive. Lastly, this book was written before 1960, and a lot of new information, especially from the former Soviet Union has been uncovered which will be able to shed more light on the Eastern front."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"It would be nearly impossible to overstate the importance of this book. It is, I believe, more pivotal in shaping the American popular understanding of Nazi Germany than any other book ever published. As such, it has helped shape everything from representations of Nazis and their victims in motion pictures to media protrayals of accused war criminals living in the United States.As a work history, this book is also extremely impressive. Shirer makes extensive and critical use of a plethora of primary sources, including captured German documents and testimony from the Nuremburg trials, and this gives his account considerable credibility. His writing style is engrossing, making the length of the book seem less gargantuan than it is. I doubt that I would be able to identify a more comprehensive or readable single-volume history of Nazi Germany.It should be understood, however, that Shirer does not really intend for this book to be merely a history of Nazi Germany. It is a morality tale. Shirer is aghast at the destruction and barbarity that Nazi Germany wrought in the world, and this book reads like an indictment of everybody everwhere who had a hand in allowing the barbarity to occur. Nobody can escape responsibility, not common Germans who brought Hitler to power, not the German generals who were unwilling or unable to control Hitler, not the German businessmen who profited through Hitler's various barbarities, not the Anglo-French architects of appeasement, and most of all not the Nazis themselves.Of course, Shirer's sense of moral outrage sometimes causes some unfortunate lapses. It is rare that Shirer does not call Goering fat when Goering pops up in the narrative. Similarly, he invariably uses &quot;fatuous&quot; to describe Ribbentrop and reminds us on numerous occasions that Rosenberg was a &quot;dolt.&quot; I have no idea what Goering's girth has to do with anything, and Shirer never really gives us a real idea of why he thinks that Ribbentrop was fatuous or Rosenberg was any stupider than any other member of the Nazi elite. Gratuitous pejoratives are distracting and unfair.And then there's the matter of Ernst Roehm, Hitler's chief of the SA. Roehm and the rest of the members of the SA were a bunch of terrorist thugs who got votes for the Nazis by intimidating the opposition, but to Shirer, this thuggery is eclipsed by the fact that Roehm and some other of the SA leaders were or were thought to be gay (which Shirer consistently refers to as a &quot;perversion&quot;). To say the least, the credibility of Shirer's moral outrage at the racist and anti-semitic doctrine of the Nazi party is undermined by his bald homophobia.More than that, Shirer makes no real attempt to understand why the British and the French behaved as they did in appeasing Hitler. He ascribes it to some sort of moral failing, and while this may be the case, it is only part of the story. France and Great Britain were bankrupted by the Depression. They couldn't really afford to rearm, and they were desparate to avoid a war at least partly out of a misplaced fiscal restraint. This fact does not obscure the reality that the appeasement policy was short-sighted and stupid, but at least it makes the whole thing more comprehensible. Likewise, Shirer doesn't really understand that Germany's rearmament was paid for with checks that the Reich couldn't cash without plunder. By 1939, the German economy was a house of cards that was about to collapse without a capital infusion. Unfortunately, one wouldn't know that from reading Shirer.Finally, the emphasis that Shirer puts on different periods of the Third Reich is disproportionate. The war years, especially from 1943 to 1945, are sped through with very little detail about anything except the various plots against Hitler. It's almost as if Shirer ran out of gas after 800 pages or so. It is admirable that Shirer does not get bogged down the military details of the war, but at the same time, I would think that the war years deserve more than 25 or 30% of the book.By all means, read this book, especially if you have only cursory familiarity with Nazi Germany. It is generally well-written, accessible, and reasonably comprehensive. Just beware of the problems with it as you are reading."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is a brilliant book - tremendously well researched, incredibly well written, and packed full of unparalleled insights. It is highly recommended for anyone interested in Adolph Hitler, the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany, and the Third Reich at war.Written soon after the end of the Second World War and first published in 1959, William L. Shirer's \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" remains the monumental history of Adolph Hitler and the Germany he created.The author, William L. Shirer, served as a newspaper correspondent and CBS radio reporter in Europe and Nazi Germany during the war and witnessed first-hand many of the events that led to the beginning of the Second World War in Europe. More importantly, Shirer, the correspondent turned historian, was among the first individuals to avail himself of the confidential archives of the Third Reich and all its branches seized and held by the U.S. government after the war in Alexandria, Virginia.These documents included the official diaries of the German Armed Forces High Command, the German Navy High Command, the Chief of the German General Staff (General Franz Halder), and those of the Minister of Propaganda (Dr. Joseph Goebbels). Shirer also made good use of the stenographic records of Hitler's conferences on the daily military situation, as seen and discussed at the Fuehrer's headquarters, and the texts of the Nazi leader's table talk.The result is an extremely well documented and detailed history of every aspect of Hitler's Germany. Shirer makes it clear early in his book that although he detested Adolph Hitler and the Nazis, he sought to write an objective history of events. Certainly his observations on the leader of the Third Reich are of special interest to readers and historians alike. Shirer calls Hitler: \\"The man with the Charlie Chaplin mustache, who had been a down-and-out tramp in Vienna in his youth, an unknown soldier of World War I, a derelict in Munich in the first grim postwar days, the somewhat comical leader of the Beer Hall Putsch, this spellbinder who was not even German but Austrian...\\"Writing about the rise of the Third Reich, Shirer shows conclusively that many of Hitler's beliefs as well as the basic tenets of the Nazi Party, including its' highly centralized, authoritarian and violently anti-Semitic nature, were deeply embedded in German history. It is for this reason that most of the German population and military so willingly followed their Fuehrer into another destructive two-front world war and continued to believe in him and victory until the very end.There is very little about the German leader and the Third Reich that is not in this book. Shirer was able to detect early on, for example, the Nazi program to murder its own citizens, who were mentally retarded or otherwise physically incapacitated, and the resistance by the German population and the Catholic Church to that program. He also shows that, contrary to the view still held by some historians to this day, the vast bulk of Hitler's generals fully supported the German leader and his Nazi party. At the same time, Shirer was among the first historians who attempted to record the civilian and military resistance to the Fuehrer.All of this makes Shirer's \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" wonderful and compelling reading. It remains the monumental history of Hitler's Germany and one of the most important historial works of our time."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer, a journalist/broadcaster stationed in Berlin in the 1930s and 40s, had a unique opportunity to witness Adolph Hitler's rise to power. Few can say they attended Nazi rallies or stood behind Hitler as he delivered some of his famous speeches. Shirer, the consummate narrator, delivers his experiences to the rest of the world in this book, first published in 1960. It covers Hitler's young life and many experiences that probably helped form his anti-semitism. It is fascinating to see how many of these major characters of the last century came together at first in small restaurants and bars, and later in stadiums before hundreds of thousands of Germans.This book remains one of the great docu-historical writings of the twentieth century. Part history and part opinion, it is quite stunning in scope and character. True, Shirer does occasionally transcend his role as journalist, delivering intense personal opinions on characters from Ribbontrop to Goering to Goebbels. Some have faulted him for this, but I liked it. Who else would be in a better position to deliver such information? If Shirer has spent the time with these people-if he knows enough of them, then by all means, he should expound in this manner.This is a very long book. At 1200-some pages, It was daunting and enjoyable at the same time. While some details blurred over time, the amount of information erred on the safe side-better too much than too little. While this is a valid criticism, it has no bearing on my feelings regarding the book when all is said and done. This is masterful history mixed with first hand drama and (despite what some have said) intense documentation.Essential and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Probably more English-language readers have learned about Nazi Germany from The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich than any other book. That William Shirer's mammoth study is still in print, still widely read and still cited as a basic text by historians and researchers, is a testament to its importance and staying-power in shaping popular perception of Adolf Hitler, Germany, National Socialism and World War II. For many readers, this is the Ur-text of Nazi history. This is very problematic however, as Rise and Fall, while very readable, is incomplete and outdated in analyzing Nazi Germany.Certainly, even the most skeptical reader must laud Shirer's efforts. An American journalist who spent the early years of Hitler's reign in Berlin, Shirer brings a formidable mixture of first-hand experience and exhaustive research of German archival material and primary sources. His personal encounters with Hitler (witnessing several of his Reichstag speeches, say) give the material an added edge and authority that latter-day historians lack. Additionally, Shirer is a formidable writer, and the book is extremely readable despite its flaws and near-1500 page length. His depictions of the inner-workings of the Nazi regimes, and his blow-to-blow accounts of Hitler's rise to power, WWII and Nazi atrocities are gripping and admirably thorough. There's not too much to quibble with here; it's elsewhere that we run into difficulties.Shirer provides a blunt, straightforward picture of Nazi Germany that easily squares with the layman's understanding of the subject. In Shirer's eyes, Hitler was an evil genius who came on the political scene with a clear program for European hegemony (if not world domination) and extermination of the Jews. He embraces the \\"Sonderweg\\" theory that Germany is particularly susceptible to domination by repressive, nationalist dictators, and depicts the German citizenry as a more-or-less willing accomplice in Hitler's atrocities. The author's palpable hatred for his subjects bleeds through every page: Ernst Rohm is a pervert, Herman Goering fat, Joachim Von Ribbentrop a moron and so forth. Less enlightening is when he extends this attitude to other figures, as when he brands the anti-Hitler resistance as either irrelevant or merely self-serving opportunists.The fact is, despite their popular endurance, few reputable historians still hold these opinions, at least without serious reservations. The Sonderweg theory isn't unique to Shirer, but it displays a remarkable ignorance of German history, disregarding the country's strong history of liberalism, Otto Von Bismarck's modernizing policies as Chancellor and, perhaps most importantly, Germany's remarkable tolerance towards Jews before 1914. Wilhelmine Germany's bellicose imperialism was certainly troubling and unduly provocative, but can't really be seen as a direct precursor to Hitler. Historians still debate how much of the Holocaust and Nazi foreign policy was mapped out in advance, but few (except maybe Daniel Jonah Goldhagen) would agree with the simplistic conclusion that Hitler never deviated from Mein Kampf. How much Hitler was an \\"evil genius\\" - a phrase Shirer employs multiple times - rather than a crafty opportunist blessed with uncanny luck is very much open to debate. And so on. A knowledgable reader can't take much of Shirer's reasoning seriously, but unfortunately many lay readers will.Of course, some of this can be excused: the book was written in 1960, after all, and a great deal of documentation has become available since Shirer's day. However, sloppy reasoning, limited historical understanding and the author's own biases are harder to excuse, as they obfuscate the true lessons to be mined from his subject. More recent writers like Joachim Fest, Ian Kershaw and Richard J. Evans provide a more nuanced version of Nazism, placing Hitler and Co. in a proper context without diminishing their evil. The Third Reich and the Second World War were not simple morality plays as Shirer would have us believe; history is never as simple as that.For all its flaws as a historical work, Rise and Fall is undeniably a fascinating read. Its sheer visceral power can't be denied and most readers will learn a lot. It's a fine introduction to Nazi Germany, but anyone seriously interested in the subject should follow up with more scholarly works."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"My parents bought this book when it first came out, about 1960, and I struggled to read it cover to cover and eventually finished it. I was eight years old. This may seem amazing to some of the high school students who have reviewed this book as &quot;boring&quot;, but it amazed and frightened me. What kept me reading was the vividly portrayed methodical and unfolding horror in Europe that I had known nothing about (what eight year old does?) I'm sure that I missed a lot on my first reading, but I remember that first reading vividly even today. The reason this book is a &quot;must read&quot; is that today's tyrants, today's wars and today's massacres follow much the same script. I believe that most tyrants are often also fanatic students of history for &quot;how to&quot; guides to achieving their aims. Those they would enslave should be equally diligent. The book is sometimes disparaged for its long quotes of previously secret Nazi letters, memoranda and cables, but it is precisely that detail that stays with you for life. You will never read a bland government white paper again without scanning it for the incredible couched in passive, obfuscatory language.I have read a great deal more history since then, and have read many books on military tactics and strategy from ancient times to the present, but I have never read a better portrait of a world gone crazy. Military strategists can only tell you how. This book tells you why by someone who was there when it happened.Obviously there have been further revelations since this book was published in 1960 based on declassified and more recently translated documents, but this book stands the test of time in that such revelations supplement but do not undermine its veracity."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"In the nearly four decades that has passed since the first printing of this book, nobody has written a better researched, more accurate volume on Nazi Germany than William L. Shirer. He holds our hand throughout the book, showing us how Hitler &quot;rationally&quot; developed his warped and horrific political philosophy. He allows the story of Nazi atrocities to be told by the Nazis themselves...through chilling memos and the almost fanatical documenting of orders that even the most tedious bureaucrat participated in.Holocaust deniers often claim that the allies exaggerated the effort Nazi Germany undertook to exterminate Jews, Slavs and other &quot;undesirables&quot;. Shirer's book shows that the Allies didn't need to...the Nazis documented it for themselves. Current volumes on Nazi Germany try to re-write history based on faulty memories and &quot;mysterious new evidence&quot; that comes out of now ultra-capitalist Russia. Most of them are either a money grab, or written for some insidious ulterior motive. None of them capture the authenticity and the horror of this champion of histories."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is the perfect introduction to Nazi Germany for those who, like me, are just beginning to study this disturbing and fascinating period of history. There are a number of things which I think make this the perfect introduction.First, Shirer was a journalist and an excellent writer. This is diplomatic history at it's best. Shirer does an excellent job of both presenting the big picture in terms of the overall narrative of events as well as the fascinating details which make a history like this truly engaging. This is easily one of the most readable and enjoyable history books I have ever read.Second, Shirer was actually present at many of the major events that he narrates. He was present in Vienna on the night of the Anschluss of Austria, he was present at the French surrender at Compiegne, and he was present during many of Hitler's speeches. He was in Berlin just before the outbreak of war and is able to describe the mood, and the tension, of that city and its inhabitants on the eve of war. This adds a vividness to Shirer's account which is unique.Third, despite what some negative reviewer's have claimed Shirer's scholarship was excellent. I have no doubt that scholarship on Nazi Germany has progressed a great deal since this book was published, and it will no doubt be possible to find errors here and there, as well as questionable interpretations. But one should always remember that fifty years from now people will be saying the same thing about the books that are being published today. Does that mean they should not be read? Of course not. The fact is Shirer quotes extensively from captured foreign documents, Nazi diaries and letters, speeches, as well as testimony from the Nuremberg trials. It would be hard, I think, to find a single unsubstantiated claim in the whole book. Shirer was not just a journalist writing down his personal reflections, he did his research, and it shows.I agree with some of the reviewers who have said this should not be the only book you read on Nazi Germany. But it would be impossible, in my opinion, to find a better place to start."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer's book is truly a must-read for anyone interested in exploring the subject of World War II in depth. He writes as a journalist, as many other reviews have pointed out. But he has an historian's desire to do more than report. He searches for the social causes and effects of the rise and fall of Nazism in Germany.Since his book was written, there have been many excellent histories of Hitler and the Third Reich. However, few have captured the immediacy of the period in the way that Shirer has. Some books have corrected some factual slips that Shirer made, and others have focused on issues that Shirer didn't. Even so, this is a great starting point for understanding the Third Reich. Sixty years later, the book is still a fascinating read!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"\\"By a hypnotism that defies explanation--at least by a non-German--Hitler held the allegiance and trust of this remarkable people to the last. It was inevitable that they would follow him blindly, like dumb cattle but also with a touching faith and even an enthusiasm that raised them above the animal herd, over the precipice to the destruction of the nation.\\"This remarkable book is based principally on the captured German documents, the interrogations and testimony at the Nuremberg trials of German military officers and civilian officials, the diaries and memoirs which some of them have left, and on Shirer's experience in the Third Reich. Shirer became one of the most respected journalists in wartime Europe.The book is exhaustive and detailed with extensive notes and bibliography. A bit of patience is needed to get through the dialect, often quoting Mein Kampf. Shirer brings forth wonderful descriptions of the people who played a role in those troubled times. The individual battles are not detailed, so one will need to refer to other sources for a more detailed look at these battles and horrors that ensued. This is an important book for those interested in Germany and life in the Third Reich at this time.The Reich rises with a quick run through of Hitler's youth and the German history, then the politics and Hitler's megalomania that led to national socialism and the rise to dictatorship. The Treaty of Versais and the fall of the mark lead to Germany's economic fall, allowing for the people to welcome in a dictatorship, a new messiah by deceit. The military buildup could now begin. The coups to overthrow Hitler and the Nazis had already failed and will continue to fail throughout the war. For the officers it was either death by Hitler or death by fighting. The massacres of the Russians began soon after the invasion of the East. The French and other countries were also caught up in the massacre, and William gives us the eyewitness reports. The \\"Jewish cleansing\\" started soon after the nazis took over their first countries. The Nazis kept developing more and more efficient means of extermination and experimentation. There is an exhaustive lead up to the start of W.W.II, the invasion of Poland. There was freighting information discovered on what would have been in store for Britain if invaded, not to mention the world and the slaughter of Russia. The Nazi's pinnacle arrives at about 2/3 of the way through the book where the fall begins with the Allied advance.It took military action eventually to stop Hitler's \\"New world order\\", not the people. The lack of doing anything to stop Hitler from walking into the Rhineland should not be forgotten. Does not the blame fall partly on the people, Chamberlain, and the military generals? Maybe if more would have read Mein Kampf, and not disregarded it's contents millions would not have lost their lives. The Nazi propaganda took over the press, and soon indoctrinated the German people. There were many opportunities to stop Hitler by France and Britain early on. Have we not learned anything from the past? Is there not a parallel in our country?\\"The Germans imposed the Nazi tyranny on themselves.\\"Hegel was one of the many influences on Hitler and Marx. Hegel and Marxism is still very much alive today in humanism, nationalism, \\"supreme state\\", racism, and mysticism."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book was one of the first histories of the Nazi era that I acquired for my library. Shirer had the unique perspective of actually being an American journalist for CBS in Berlin for many of the Hitler years. His journalistic aptitude shows itself greatly in the writing of this most important book. The book reads like a LONG newspaper article. Facts are presented and then there are extensive footnotes and references at the bottom of most of the pages for those who would like to follow up. Also, there is a wonderful index at the end of the book for those (like me!) who just want to read certain passages. Being that the length of the thing is 1500+ pages, sometimes, it is necessary to use the index!This book is an excellent resource for someone who is just starting to learn about Nazi Germany. Shirer does an excellent job of presenting the history up to point where he did his writing. Unfortunately, his history has become somewhat dated since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 (and the Soviet Union in 1991) has allowed the secret KGB archives concerning WWII to be opened. The availablity of this new source of information may make some of Shirer's conclusions about the end of the war invalid. Therefore, I highly recommend that one also read the Ian Kershaw biographies on Hitler which were published in the late 1990's/early 2000's (Hitler: Hubris and Hitler: Nemesis). These new biographies incorporate the newest information which has been released from the KGB within their pages.Otherwise, Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is an excellent history and an instant classic of this most important era of the 20th Century. This book should be used as a companion to Hitler's Mein Kampf, as it will help the reader of that book to understand some of the things that Hitler talks about. However, one can read this book on its own...but you will find yourself intrigued and wanting to read more! This period of history is most fascinating, and Mr. Shirer's work makes it all the more so!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I feel unworthy writing a review of this work, but I was so impressed with it that I feel moved to do so. I had been putting off reading this book for years, simply due to its volume--over 1100 tightly packed pages. But believe me, anyone who wants to understand how WW2 came to be, and what the Nazis were all about, should read this one.William Shirer was a journalist in Europe during most of the Third Reich's duration, and his first-hand experience with the major figures of the era give this book a wonderful, authentic feel. This is not a dull work of scholarship (as I had feared!) It is a priceless well-written and thorough history of the Third Reich. Shirer himself notes that perhaps a better history could be written 50-100 years following the war, with the benefit of detached perspective. However, this book proves that the opposite is also true--had Shirer not written this book we might never have had the opportunity to read a thorough work on this topic by one who observed much of the actual events and who saw and met many of the key figures of the Third Reich.Neville Chamberlain springs to life as one of the most craven politicians ever. Other figures of the time are vividly portrayed. After completing this book I felt that I had a much better understanding as to why the sellout at Munich, and World War II in general, have had such a profound effect upon the politics of the modern era--not merely because of the horrific death and destruction that the war entailed, but because of the tragically bad decisions that resulted in the war itself.Anyone who wants to understand the European portion of WW2 should read this book. And a great read it is."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I first read this in the 9th grade, a long time ago,and have checked into it often since then. Looking back,the history of Hitler's ideas are clearly explained,and anti-semitism in Europe had a long,sordid history way before anyone had heard of Hitler. His rise to power,ideas,and plans are shown to have been clear very early on with MEIN KAMPF, a book not read or taken seriously by enough people. I thought the blackmailing of Generals Blomberg and Fritsch in 1937 was a highlight,since that episode has often been overlooked elsewhere. The planning for the attack on Poland (9/1/39) is well done,as is the British and French response. The actions of the &quot;Supreme Warlord&quot; throughout the war are so well described that it's easy now (without looking at the book)to remember Mr. Shirer's account.And the horrors of the death camps are made as clear as can be. My only perhaps negative remembrance,after having read many volumes on this subject, seems to be that Mr. Shirer did not adequately explain the appeal of this ex-corporal on a great,modern nation. He does not really explain the complexity of the Fuehrer, a many faceted individual, not just the carpet-eating, raving, single-testicled person of myth. No one gets to such a position in the world,starting out from nowhere, without a dynamic side. In short, it seems Hitler's personal magnetism,even charm,his photographic memory, his seeming amazing ability to make the right decisions, even after looking into the abyss, made him a fascinating figure for many,who followed him to the bitter end. It seems that Mr. Shirer only paints the monster and not the whole man, and perhaps that does not really explain all the horrors that rest on the shoulders of this person and his lieutenants,and followers."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Nobody can be more qualified than William Shirer to writea book on Nazi Germany, having not only seen the reich fromthe inside but having assimilated most of the siezeddocumentation at Nurnberg.He gives a very good idea of what political and social reasonsled to the situation where a megalomaniac could take overthe country with the full backing of its people. The variousplots and plans made months or even a year before they wereput into operation are very well detailed.On the cons side, however, Shirer cribs a lot about whatcould have been done if the British or the American governmentswere more on the alert and had not followed a policyof appeasement of Hitler. This is justified to an extentbut a little into the book it comes in the way of theflow of narration.Overall it is an amazing book and a must read for anyhistory lover. Those who do not learn from history arecondemned to repeat it and what better way to learn fromhistory than read about how political games were played inthe past and how it lead to a holocaust.As a supplement to having read this book a couple of yearsback I visited the Dachau concentration camp near Munichand it hit me full force especially in the context of thisbook."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"An encyclopedic yet immensely readable account of the spectacular rise to power of Adolf Hitler &amp; the German Nazi party &amp; their subsequent downfall.Shirer's account has the freshness &amp; verve that only the best journalism can provide .He traces the rise of fascism in post WW-1 Germany against the backdrop of the latent authoritarianism inherent in the Teutonic makeup____Fichte,Hegal,Wagner &amp; Neitzshe____which in turn may have its roots in the Reformation of Martin Luther.Hitler's rise from a penniless,homeless vagrant in fin-de-siecle Vienna to his stint as a low level soldier in WW-1 is ably narrated .The birth of the Nazi party in the early 1920's ,the Munich beer hall putsch and the undeniable role of the great depression(&amp; the ensuing inflation/unemployment) in catapulting Hitler to power is mentioned in detail .

The terrible story of how a group of madmen brought sorrow to the planet is brought vividly to life in this classic history. It is a titanic work on a titanic subject.The author, Bill Shirer, took some risks. He interposed his own judgements and feelings with the facts which he sets down. Seeing as how Shirer saw the Nazi regime with his own eyes, and his revulsion is based on his own experience, and almost all of his readers will share that revulsion, the risk pays off. Few historians could take a risk like this, or should. Because of what Shirer (and the world) saw and suffered, he did right.Do not rely solely upon this book to learn about the Holocaust. The section of this book which retells the story of this ultimate crime is based on German documents and testimony gathered immediately after the war (and before almost all of the surviving perpetrators decided to collectively shut up). As a result, the section uniformly treats the Jewish and other prey of the killing system as passive victims. A balanced view is required, to say the least, and I am sure that most readers with a strong enough stomach to tackle this book will go on to read the testimonies of survivors and get closer to a real view of this almost unbelieveable story. However, the German sources quoted here at great length are useful should there be anyone reading this book who is so unfortunate as to believe that the Holocaust never happened. It did, and you can read about it here, in the words and documents of the men with blood on their hands.Once again, this is a true, scary, unforgettable classic of the art of historical journalism."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The characterization of the German Resistance to Hitler in Shirer's book is embarrassingly uninformed, sticking to the myth that it was little more than a military plot devised by ambitious officers who simply objected to Hitler's military strategy.Anyone interested in the true story and/or in the non-military participants in the Resistance -- completely ignored by Shirer and other Anglo-American historians -- should read Peter Hoffmann's \\"The History of the German Resistance, 1933-1945.\\"[...]"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book serves as an unreliable source, and was obviously written by a journalist, not a historian. Reading this book, one can tell it was &quot;slapped&quot; together in order to generate a profit. Surely, most of the references and notes in the book were not fully reviewed in archival format. This book glorifies Hitler's rise to power as a &quot;fly by night&quot; phenomenon, and insists that German nature is to blame for the rise of the NSDAP (Nazis). It forces upon you, the idea that all Germans are bad natured. For a better account, and more comprehensive account of this period, I reccomend &quot;Nazi Germany,&quot; by Klaus Fischer. Fischer's book is well document, and very accurate. Fischer gives a comprehensive review of all the social and economic reasons that contributed to the rise of this politial monster. Fischer's work is also derived from some of the best writings and archival research."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book would have received 0 star from me had it not for the mounmental effort, and result, of the auther's research.

My dad grew up in Nazi Germany. We were not the best of friends. Yet, this was a very fascinating book to me! I bought it because I figured that Hitler was a foreurunner of the Antichrist of the Bible and maybe this book would give me insight into his character. And it did. Yet I found some strange humor in it as well.Both my dad and one of my German professors had used the expression \\"he ought to be shot!\\" before as a reference to the frequent use of firing squads in the Third Reich. There is some of that gallows humor in there. Like a description of the quaiity built crematoriums for the death camps-made with the finsest of materials and German craftsmanship! My dad always was big on German craftsmanship and efficiency. I even found myself joking with my therapist about how cool it would be to become a dictator like Hitler where I could put all my enemies into concentarion camps, have them executed and have it filmed as the master had done!I seemed to know more from that book about Hitler that my dad did. I discovered Hitler was a failed artist. My dad had tought he was a house painter. As my dad had terminal cancer and we visited once a month with him, we could talk about how he was living in Romania when Hitler invaded Russia and when they were repulsed that he and my aunt Margit had been evacuated out of Romania by Hitler. My dad was pretty tight-lipped about his childhood; yet this book actually gave us something to talk about befeore he died. What did we have in common? Quantum Theory? NOt! Bible Prophecy? NOt! We could discuss old \\"Uncle Adolph\\" as he had once called him!So, I did see a twisted sort of humor to it. Just like on a News Radio Station from the Eastern US I had heard about a man who had a custom license plate in Virginia that said ZYKLON B on it. And how the state of Virginia had the plate revoked when they found out what it was. In Shirer's book, I discovered that ZYKLON B was the chemical that IG Farben had produced which Hitler used to carry out the \\"Final Solution\\" of the Jewish problem.This book is jam packed with all kinds of trivia and interesting details. Just like I said, my dad grew up in Hitler Third Reich and did not know some ot these things!There is an interesting lesson in this book in the life of Hitler. Hitler went to Vienna to study to be a painter. They rejected his application. So, he blamed this on the Jews and made it his ambition to erradicate them from the face of the earth-The Final Solution. Or in more modern times, I had seen on TV how the woman who had prayer banned from the public schools hadd been discriminated against in church; so she did not want to make her kids have to pray in school!

Democratic city-states existed 2000 years ago in India.Jew bashing is not an invention of the Nazi Junta, but has been festering in Germany since the Days of Martin Luther whose teachings, whinny remonstrations will chill the blood of many and HE is considered the father of Protestantism.Now I know why the Bengali Leader Netaji took the help of Nazis to get rid of the British Menace. I wish Germans had dropped an atomic bomb on London. Or the US on some German cities!I am no way disputing the fact that many Indians toed the British line and helped them in many a scandalous endeavor where they often surpassed their masters in subjugating and exploiting their own brethren.The writer has very little to say about his own doings and thoughts during the whole period - saving it for better sales of his other book, I guess!Message to The Old Book Worm: Can you dispute any of the facts presented above? You are just a stupid Nazi, licking your dead-white skin like a street dog!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Wonderful book describing how Hitler persecuted and killed Christians--both Catholic and protestant--and how the Pope strongly condemned Hitler and Nazism.Hitler's goal was to establish a statist cult based on barbaric paganism. He loathed Christianity, and admired the violent aspects of Islam and the Japanese-style emperor worship.Atheist/Humanist/Socialist/Darwinists such as Hitler, Mao, Lenin, Stalin, Pol Pot, and others killed more people during the past 100 years than all of the so-called \\"religious war\\" in all of the previous centuries combined."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"It is a very sad thing to see that this ancient, very shalow and badly researched book of Shirer is still considered by many as a source of reliable information about the Third Reich and Nazi Germany. It tells mainly about the level of knowledge about the subject at hand of the people who think that. Shirer's book has but one thing to its credit: it's very well written. A long, charming, feather-weight journalistic report. As a boy, I have read it with fascination. It's a marvelous thing to read when you're 11 years old. It's like the light classical music records you hear when you make your first steps into hearing classical music. But things change and people grow up and just like listening to Peter and the Wolf or the Toy Symphony so with the Rise and Fall. Past a certain age and level of knowledge it is pathetic to consider it a worthy reading material.

I would recommend this book to anyone looking for information on that period in history."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Shirer's rise and fall of the third riech has to be #1 on the list of dramatized biased sensationalist works of the third reich.In it he claims it is partly based on his account of the Third Riech based on having drinks with some of the high command, including Hitler,(who some say didn't drink but I think he did have German beer but not to excess). The only thing I think this book got right was probably that it was the first complete chronology of events and their dates. Beyond that it is needlessly written in a way that gives the reader the obvious impression that Shirer hated Hitler and wants the reader to have the same sentiments. It is another one of those books that says on every page \\"Hitler is a bad guy and you should all hate him just like I do, because I am a good guy so I hate Hitler too, you see that dont you?\\"Shirer gives his theory that Hitler became an antisemite very early in his childhood,(which contradicts Hitler's own account of his childhood in Mein Kampf and other sources too). He describes Hitler's down and out day's as a young man as being a derelict because he lived in flop houses. This is also documented in Toland's book. His art work is also insulted by Shirer, while others prominent in the art world praise his work(which we should not forget was self taught because he never had any formal training). I guess the journalist can't figure out weather he'd rather be a historian or art critic. Shirer's rise and fall of the Third Riech is ok if you want events and their dates in chronological order, but it is otherwise very one sided, and worst of all incredibly inaccurate.It is said to be the best historical account on the Third Reich by some(although their are plenty of movies these days that make fantastic claims about how good they are and turn out to be terrible). It sounds more like a sales pitch to me. I would recommend reading several other books in this area and do not assume this one is going to educate you on all of the facts without painting them the color the author wants."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Shirer's, \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" is the definitive history of that regime. He takes the reader from Hitler's early years as a waif in Vienna, to his service in the trenches of France in WWI, to the beginnings of the Nazi movement in post WWI Germany, through his ultimate rise to power, and finally to his downfall. Shirer was a journalist who witnessed firsthand the events he describes and had unrestricted access to volumes of Nazi government documents. He produced the most complete work ever written on the subject of Nazi Germany. His work is as important today as it was when it was first published.Hitler and his entourage produced a blueprint for dictators that is still being followed. The plan is simple: seize power by any means necessary, then use state assets to effectively control the population. In Germany, the Hitler Youth replaced hearth and home. Schools taught only the Nazi philosophy. The media broadcast the \\"Party\\" line exclusively. Churches? \\"They will preach what we want them to preach,\\" stated Hitler. Bound by these constraints an entire generation did the bidding of their Nazi masters without question. It can happen again, anywhere, including the U.S.A. It's a warning worth heeding. Adolph Hitler is alive and well today!Hitler alive? Yes! He showed up as Josef Stalin in the U.S.S.R., and again as Mao Tse Tung and his \\"Cultural Revolution\\" in China. He appeared as Idi Amin in Uganda, thoughtfully providing his executioners with an unlimited supply of marijuana after dispatching their victims with iron bars. He turned up again as Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, his \\"Concentration Camps\\" now being called, \\"New Economic Zones\\" and \\"Reeducation Centers,\\" and subsequently as Pol Pot in the \\"Killing Fields\\" of Cambodia. He surfaced in the Mid-East as Saddam and his acid baths in Iraq and appears regularly as Hezbollah/ Hammas suicide bombers in Israel. Air travelers constantly fear he will reappear as an Al Quida terrorist working for Osama bin Laden. And let us not forget, almost 50 million people have died in abortion clinics here in the U.S., far more than died at Auschwitz, Treblinka etc. The dictators named simply follow Adolph's plan. And like the democracies of the Nazi Era, we stand idly by while they conduct their nefarious activities. We have no right to criticize the British, the French or even the Germans. We are as guilty as they!Edmund Burk said, \\"The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\\" Shirer has shown the world how dictators operate. Armed with this knowledge, we should be able to prevent despots from rising to power. Clearly, this we have not done. The Allies did nothing until it was almost too late. Armed with Shirer's work and the bitter experience of history, hopefully, we will not continue to be guilty of the same."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I want to preface this review by stating that I am only 640 pages into this mammoth volume on the Rise and the fall of the Third Reich. I am just getting into the meat of World War II, but have read enough to give a fair review, and will up date when I finish the book.This book is awesome in its in depth look at the rise of Hitler's fanatical Third Reich. It provides great background information on Hitler, his early years, the establishment of the Nazi party, and the road to war once Hitler had his full diabolical plan in place. One of the many interesting subplots so far I've learned about is how immensely out numbered the Germans were in 1939 by the French military forces...yet they did not attack, and did nothing, allowing Germany to build up its military even more for its own future offensive against the French in France. Hitler was very beneficial to this cowardly act of the French government and military. Hitler's fanatical personality is also well chronicled throughout so far and it's amazing how so many fell for his \\"charm.\\"Great book, would definitely recommend it for all."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This in-depth, well-written and meticulously researched work remains the benchmark on this topic. Shirer was an eyewitness to many of the events he described. One of the things I liked about this history is how Shirer spent time examining the political and diplomatic events, along with success and foibles, on both sides.You would have a very difficult time finding a better researched and written book that examines in detail one of the most horrific periods in the world. I can't recommend this book enough. Definitely a must read not only for fans of history but for everyone so that these events will never be repeated in the future."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Simply enjoyed.

I think that for me at least it filled in all the voids where a high school and college didn't cover. It my take one a while to read but the knowlage that one learns from this book if irreplaceable .

You will read an excerpt of almost every major correspondence between both great leaders (famous and infamous) and their ambassadors.In my own personal opinion I found that this book unknowingly throws the appeasement theory right out the window (the author is a big fan of appeasement) and shows that Britain, France and the United States were all playing cards at the same table as Adolph Hitler himself...and possibly still are. But that is my opinon.If you are noromally not interested in historical documentary, the part about Hitler changing the Bible's pages to the pages of Mein Kampf seem that they should be most engaging to almost any reader of any faith. We see how important money and desparation become as factors in making deciscions in times when our livelihood is tested. The author also illustrates how times of strife can be easily empower darker forces to control large groups of people through simple repititious hoax. The German economy was just beginning to recover, but it was simply not fast enough for the uneasy and outright angry mob of working class citizens of the time, who believed every bit of propaganda the German gov't staged in order to keep them angry."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"THIS BOOK HAS GOT ALL THE IMPORTANT INFO., IF YOU WANT JUST ONE BOOK ABOUT THIS SUBJECT THEN GET THIS ONE!, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer provides a detailed book sure to fill the needs of any historian or person that is interested in this period of time.

There are are no cross references to this masterpiece. Deem it a classic!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"It was with much hesitation that I began reading this book several years ago. I had been forewarned that it was well written, but that it alone was responsible for creating much of the historical myth surronding Hitler's Germany and the rise of National Socialism. Many critical points and assumptions in Shrier's book have been questioned and re-evaluated. If their was any single flaw concerning this book it would be that it attempts to report the facts, but on occasion delivers myth. The notion of black-shirted &quot;boogie men&quot; saw it's embryonic formation with Shirer's work. Their are many other authors, such as David Irving who have strived to report and record the truth as it happened. Irving, unlike Shirer, manages to give us a pragmatic, sobering analysis of Hitler and his Party, and the war years, without the exssesive speculation and drama...which leads me to my last point; Shirer's book is well written and is a pleasure to read and I suppose that is it's main appeal. You can tell Shrirer strived for sense of continuity and rhthym throught the chapters. It almost reads like a piece of fiction. Unfortunately, Shrirer sacrificed objectivity and good old fashioned research in the process."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Shirer's book is an engrossing history of the Second World War with exceptional coverage of the political and diplomatic events that shaped the war. It is Shirer's focus on the conduct of nations and their diplomatic machinations that distinguishes this history from the crowd of World War 2 books and makes this a must read. The flaw is Shirer's racism regarding the German people and his failure to recognize that the evil of The Third Rich was a universal human condition. The lessons of world history, of which the Third Reich is a incomparable example, is that the centralization of power and the subjugation of the individual to the state is a universal recipe for the eventual abuse and degradation of the individual. In Shirer's 1990 \\"Afterword\\" he still insist in asking, \\"Have the Germans Changed?\\" and \\"Is there a solution to the German problem?\\" Shirer's racism will appear throughout the book, and while that clearly detracts from the objectiveness of the narrative, the book remains a must read."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Shirer's book has enjoyed a wide popularity and as the other reviews in this section attest, it continues to find an enthusiastic audience. As a well documented eye witness account, it has merit. As a serious attempt at providing a useful history of the Third Reich it has many flaws. The book is poorly written notwithstanding comments to the contrary. It is full of incorrect grammar not least of which is an eccentric misuse of puncutation that persistently obfuscates the author's meaning. Shirer is overly concerned with pendantic details related to translation issues, which have no usefulness to the general reader. The book lacks balance. The event of paramount significance for the Nazis was, of course, the holocaust. Shirer deals with the holocaust in a scant few pages, while following that with a long discourse on the failed attempt to kill Hitler in July 1944. On balance the holocaust far outweighs the significance of the failed and futile effort to rid the world of Hitler through assassination, which would simply have made him a martyr to his followers. Shirer's view of the Nazi leaders is quite clouded. Perhaps this is an unfair crticism for someone who lived in Germany and saw it first hand, but his antipathy really clouds his judgement. His disparagement of the capabilities of Joseph Goerbels, for example, are laughable. For any history to have usefulness, it must appeal to it's intended audience. On that level, The Rise and Fall...is a brilliant success. To be truly useful, however, it must help the reader to understand the what, why and how of events. Shirer did not understand what he witnessed. The readers of his book, who rely only on this resource for their understanding, will remain as confused and puzzeled as Shirer himself."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"With many pointing out the parallels between the Bush administration and fascism, I decided it was time to read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. The book was surpringingly readable. The story was presented in such a way that it was possible to keep track or the many players.Perhaps the most painful part of the book was the confiscation of Germany's neighbors prior to the war, knowing that Hitler had laid out his plan in Mein Kampf and was sticking to the script. Hadn't anyone in Foreign Office read Mein Kampf? I can understand the fear of another war following the slaughters in WWI, but Hitler's game plan should not have been a mystery at the time. For this reason, every American should be familiar with The Project for the New American Century."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"A definitively balanced account of WWII in Europe has not yet been written. Are we to believe that all Germans of this era were sociopaths, or that 6,000 Jews were gassed daily at Auschwitz, requiring over 340 tons of human remains to be cremated and disposed of per day? As you read this book keep in mind that the evidence and motivations on all sides are just beginning to crystalize in the historical record. Many aspects of this epic history were not ready to be accurately told at its 1959 publishing, as Mr. Shirer appears to have been content to let the propagandists fill-in many of the blanks."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Although certainly full of detail, this epic account of the Third Reich is often tedious and uninteresting."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is a detailed history of the Nazification of Germany during the 1920s and 30s.

Tons, literally, of documents have become available, thousands of specialist studies of various aspects of the Third Reich and the war have been written, as well as deep biographies of all the major actors. William Shirer simply did not have this information available to him. Just as one example, Shire recognized that Albert Speer was more intelligent and honest that any of the other men around Hitler, but there was no way Shire could know much about what difference this made to Hitler and the German war effort. Shirer was a journalist, not a historian. And he wrote more on the basis of what he saw that what he researched. That was about all he could do at the time.His book \\"Berlin Diaries\\" may have lasting value since he wrote it as things happened in Berlin until he had to leave. So it gives insight into how things looked to people as events occurred, which is usually very different from the dispassionate 20-20 hindsight of history."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"It is a pity this book isn't required reading for all Americans; George Bush. Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, Donald Rumsfeld, and Condoleeza Rice would have NEVER come within a million miles of the Oval Office.And there would have been NO GOP after Watergate; that would have been the end. Instead, the GOP morphed into the AmeriNazi Christianist Party, with Reagan playing a senile Hindenburg to Poppy Bush behind the scenes and a budding Karl Rove chomping at the bit to become his nation's Goebbels. Indeed. Only the scapgoat targets change; not the tactics. Yesterday the Jews, today all of Islam who will rise up to the last man, woman, and child to fight the new Nazi scourge to the death to the point of genocide, and all \\"those who are not with us, are with the terrorists.\\" See you in the Haliburton camps.No matter though; what this book teaches is that Nazi Amerika will soon go the way of all Nazi Empires.

Instead of that if attention was devoted to the other associated events..this book would have been more readable!..any way good book untill middil.."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"As a journalist stationed in Germany prior to U.S. entry into WWII, Shirer had the unique opportunity to interview many of the country's military and civilian leaders before and following the war. That, plus access to Nazi secret archives, gave the author an insider's perspective on the chilling events that led to Germany's ultimate destruction. Hitler may have built the autobahns, but the evil nature of his mind is clear when he repeatedly assures leaders of other countries that they have nothing to fear from Germany while simultaneously ordering his generals to prepare attack plans. One must re-read this book occasionally, lest one forget how egomaniacs worm their way into political power, here and abroad."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is not your average bedtime read. It will take many sessions to wade through its eleven hundred plus pages, but is well worth the effort to understand the forces that led to World War II and the reslting balance of power that lasted for nearly fifty years.The hour by hour account of events leading up the the final declaration of war gives a fascinating insight into the fevered and devious mind of Hitler. The lily-livered behaviour of Chamberlain blandly \\"giving away\\" Czechoslovakia, again in a blow-by blow account rings down the ages as an all-time act of high-handed self-interest and sheer stupidity on the part of Neville Chamberlain.If Shirer is perceptive then also he is fair-minded and gives credit where it is due. References and footnotes are complete, almost to the point of tediousness, but will be a rich source for students and historians. Of interest to the everyday reader is the familiarity with historic figures and events from someone who was there observing throughout.A star is sacrificed for some rather odd digitalizing for the Kindle -- a random sprinkling of commas and capitals and no page numbering.

Shirer. Amazing how Hitler, through observation, manipulating, conniving, deceiving, broken promises, was able to build Germany to the power it became.

Due to the capturing of the Nazi files the context is rich in detail and personal accounts which are chilling. 800 pages never flew by so quickly and so readably."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Since this book is so well known i will keep this short. If you are a reader of history; if you are interested in how a society can fall off of a cliff; if you are interested in a cult of personality; if you are interested in learning and knowing about the single most influential event in modern history then this is for you.If you are mostly interested in military strategy, battles and field maneuvers then this book may leave you wanting; but just a little.Yes at times the book is too long (for me too much time spent on failed assasination attempts on Hitler) and yes at times Mr. Shirer conjectures his own thoughts on what may have been but, all things considered, this is as good as it gets in terms of the history of Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"History does repeat itself!

I don't think it really gives the germans enough credit for how close they really were to beating the soviets.

Fascinating book about the most wonderful country on Earth during it's darkest period of history."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is the first history of WWII book that I've read so I can't really compare it to anything. One of the first things about this book, as the title suggests it only focuses on the Third Reich. Other countries are introduced only as the pertain to Nazi Germany (so for example stuff like the bombing of Hiroshima are completely absent), so I'll have to get a more complete WWII book after this. At 1200 pages though, I'm not sure it would be worthwhile to expand the scope of this book.The book itself it is excellent. Shirer is a journalist and not a historian, I've seen some complaints from historians about some of his conclusions, but he was a journalist living in Germany during the Third Reich so you gain some personal insight and he also writes very well and is entertaining (something you might not get with a true historian). Shirer covers from Hitler's birth (born Adolf Schicklgruber), childhood, to his rise to power. One thing which was surprising to me is just how much aggression Hitler got away with before the Allies finally declared war.As I read this, I sort of had mixed feelings about Hitler. On one hand he was a great orator, was able to unite a nation and have them follow his plans. Germany seemed powerful easily conquering nation after nation. Part of me kind of respected them and their might, although Hitler got a little overconfident which finally lead to his and his nation's downfall. On the other hand, one looks and sees Hitler as a maniacal dictator, the Nazi terrorized anyone who stood in their way, but those things were nothing compared to his final solution. Millions of innocent people were systematically murdered and in the end The Third Reich goes down as having preformed some of the worst atrocities mankind has known. When I think for a second on those facts, any respect I barely started to have for Hitler is quickly lost and in the end, Hitler is mostly remembered as one of the most vile people to have ever lived."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"If you ever wanted to know how National Socialism came to power this is the book. It covered areas that are not common knowledge particularly the interaction between Hitler and Foreign leaders in the years leading up to World War II.It will leave you wondering what would the world have been like if Hitler had not opened the Eastern Front with a war with Russia, or if Britain and France had moved against Germany in 1937 or 1938. Would it have been Europe controlled by Germany and Russia with Britain and the US neutralized and at the mercy of Germany, Russia, Italy and Japan or could early action have cut off the rise of the Third Reich.This is a must read for anyone interested in WW II history."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I think this should be recommended reading in secondary education. It gives a startling view into how easy it was for Hitler to hijack Germany in the 1930's."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book arrived in good shape (it is used). I am reading it nowand after 200 hundred pages I cannot put it down."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is an amazing book. For someone who only knew at a cursory level of the events of WWII I had always wanted to know more. This book follows Hitler and his Generals and field marshals and his life closely and explains it all clearly also citing actual documentation along the way. It's not too over stuffed with statistics or heavy data, its simply a clear concise and easy to read journey from start to finish of the third reich. There are many situations where eye witnesses describe exactly the situation, such as when the Army staff attempted to murder hitler. (** I agree with one critic that the Kindle version has some misgivings with the references slightly confusing at the end of chapters, but the book is so good I was happy to put up with that. Overall it would be better to read the hard copy version - which you then have to lug around with you !!)"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is very long, but it is very good. If you want to know almost everything about Germany in Hitler's lifetime; this is the source. Just be prepared for a very long read."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The storytelling of this book is simply amazing. Anyone with a taste for accuracy in details will fall in love with this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book needs no review really as it has already been done in the hundreds. It was written in the 1950's and is known to millions. I was born not long after the end of the war but never really understood or knew the truth about Hitler, his philosophy, why he did what he did or why the war was started. For those of us with parents who lived during the war, we may not have known anything because our parents couldn't bear to talk about it. So here is this book with everything you need and want to know. I read Shirer's 'Berlin Diary' which is riveting, so this was an obvious read. The book was known to me of course, but I had always felt it would not be to my taste and be dry and boring. Not so. Buy it if you want the down and dirty, if you want to know what made Hitler click, if you want to understand. If I had the energy, I'd read it all again. Shirer was a wonderful writer and lives it all for you. A GREAT read."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Everyone should read the Rise and fall of the third Reich. The 1200 pp were perhaps too detailed however accurately took the reader through 1936-1945. It is a lesson of how efficient a dictator can be contrasted to a naieve and complacent democracy. An evil leader can find sufficient evil followers to eliminate the opposition having no moral conscience as to how it is done. It is also a picture of the power of speech. Hitler had no accomplishment in life however he could excite a mass audience with speech. Mob rule quickly becomes a powerful tool. The book is important alerting us to evil people using propaganda methods to remove freedom. Germany was suffering from the results of World War One and quickly caved in to promises even while watching millions being slain, mostly Jews. Lynn in Jacksonvile OR"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This should be required reading for everybody. It's a chilling reminder of what will happen when people don't stand up for others against tyranny: eventually that tyrant will turn on you. Reading the book, you feel what the author felt while experiencing WWII first hand, then researching the secret NAZI documents for a decade. You start wary, then outraged, then unbelieving, then I hit a point where things just seemed so ridiculous that they were sardonically funny, then incrediably sad and tired. You pity the German people for having been duped by a sweet voiced liar. You pity Chamberlain for being so naive while wanting such a noble goal. You pity the small states around Germany capitulating (sometimes after bravely fighting) to a vastly superior force. You even pity the ineffectual Italian forces under the Duce. And most of all you pity the horrors that the people who lived under Hitler's reign experienced. A short passage of NAZI documents that coolly describe how little Jewish childrens' grandparents tried to soothe the kids before they all faced execution was something that people shouldn't be allowed to forget."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is a must read for anyone living on the planet earth. An incredibly well researched and well written documentation of one the most compelling chapters in world history. Don't believe in monsters? You will after reading this book.

Read this book....it will take a while, but well worth it!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Some what terse in details near the end of the book. specifically regarding the russian armies in approaching Berlin. On another note some detail lacking on the Italy campaign and German army in the budapest sector."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is a \\"must read\\" for any person interested in understanding how the German people fell for what became to be the worst criminal in the history of the world and also is a lesson on how politics can ruin a nation."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This was one of the first books I ever really read about Nazi Germany and is still my favorite. Shrirer has a way of captivating the reader with the facts and detailed story line. Although it was written before the Berlin Wall fell and therefore doesnt have completely rounded off ideas I would still say that it is 97-99% accurate in its details and explanations.Shrirer traces Hitler from childhood throughout his adolesence and then through to his death with vivid accounts from his closest friends. All of his triumphs and mistakes. Tracking back somewhat into the origin of the nazi doctrine through philosophers and professors Shrirer gives a decent picture of how the National Socialist doctrines came about. There is one chapter dealing with the \\"Final Solution\\" and I wish he would have done more with that, but it was still satisfying.This history, written by a man who experienced it first hand, is excelently written and an amazing read. I have read many other Nazi and WWII books and this is still easily my favorite. A recomended read for anyone.One caution I give is that Shrirer has a very profound and broad vocabulary; you may, at times, need a dictionary.Pick it up and read it, its great."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"It is indeed the most splendid work of history of our time! A highly recomended masterpieces!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Schirer's exhaustive chronicle of Nazism rarely strays from the evil cabal of men who created, imposed and perished under it. Hitler, Goebells, Goering, Himmler, Papen, and countless others are described in great detail. Schirer relies on his personal recollections when he lived in Nazi Germany along with captured Nazi archives he sifted through after World War II to tell his story. His personal biases for democracy, individual freedom, and equality are clear throughout the book (especially when recounting the horrors of the Holocaust) and he does not apologize for them.RISE and FALL reminds us to stand guard against people who would take away democracy, individual freedom and equality if given the opportunity."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Remembrance of the past helps us to understand the future. - William L. Shirer, May 1990.A democratic government is formed after suffering defeat in a long and costly war against the western nations of the world. Soon the country begins to experience the collapse of its new government amid economic uncertainty, currency devaluation, mistrust of the banking system, food shortages, and difficulty in maintaining ruling coalitions within its government. Germany and it's Weimar Republic experienced all of the above after World War I and before Hilter and his Nazi cronies came into power. But is history repeating itself with the democratic efforts of modern day Russia? Understanding this period of history and why the Weimar Republic failed may be the key to avoiding a repeat of history with the Russian democratic efforts or any other nation that pursues democratic reform after a long history of oppression.William Shirer, a journalist by trade, presents the history of the Nazification of Germany and its subsequent destruction in the who, what, when, where, why and how format of a true reporter. Relying on the tremendous store of Nazi documents recovered by the allied liberators of Europe, Shirer recreates the \\"GENISIS\\" of Hitler and the Nazi's rise to power. Their subsequent corruption and ultimate destruction of Germany's great institutions, including the education system, the medical and scientific community, the arts, and finally its vaunted military tradition, should have been a warning to the world. Instead, in the \\"NAME OF PEACE IN OUR TIME\\" the world stood by and watched until it was to late to stop the madness.I recommend that this book be used as the basis of any study on the history of WWII. Especially for those who wish to understand how this could happen to such a great nation and how we can prevent this from ever happening again."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The Rise and Fall of the third Reich was one of the best books I have EVER read. It has much research information, and gives details never known to us before. I feel that the best section of the book was THE NEW ORDER.Shirer is a genius of his writings. Though it was horrific, it was a realization of the sufferance that happened during WWII. It also provays Russia's strong part in the war. All the dates and places of the war are in the book. To the greatest account, the book describes the war.If you want to know anything about WWII, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is the book to read!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Shirer's Rise &amp; Fall has been a classic for over 37 years, I finally read it during the last two months. I found it be extremely well documented, with facts, footnotes. Surprisingly, despite it's length, it is a book which keeps the reader involved, brings this horrific period to life. I would recommend to any person interested in world history as a must read."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I will be the first to admit that modern German history and WW2 in particular have always been a topic to avoid. I belong to the generation that grew up with &quot;Hogan's Heroes&quot; on one side and a profound cognizance of the holocaust on the other making objectivity toward the subject elusive at best. Shirer delivers the facts with about as much objectivity as possible (especially for an eye-witness of much that went on). The strange personalities behind the Reich, the socio-economic envrionment that made it possible and, of course, the evil paradoxical mastermind at the center of the Reich...it's all here laid out in a lucid narrative that is really hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I have read this book at least three times and find each read as fascinating as the first time I picked it up. His detailed story of the Nazis from their humble beginninigs in Munich to the terrible conclusion in 1945 is gripping reading. Simply one of the best books I have ever read"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Easily the best historical work I have read on either World War I or World War II. The sheer amount of information Shirer waded through and placed in his book shows a massive amount of research and investigation was involved. Not only is there an abundance of information, but it is extremely well-written, as Shirer has a great way with words. If you want a book about the Second World War and that period, this has to be your first choice."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is one of the best histories I have ever read (I have read many.) To describe this book as boring beggars the imagination. Maybe if you are used to reading \\"graphic novels\\" ...Shirer was there, he witnessed the Nazi regime and WWII as a journalist on the spot in Europe, mostly in Berlin before the outbreak of the war. He had a priveleged position (in this, he is much like Churchill, when Churchill wrote his monumental history of the war -- another must-read.) Shirer was also a journalist who learned his craft when good writing was valued. He is an excellent writer, this story flows.I was intimidated by the length of the book -- for many years. Once I picked it up, I could not put it down. What a spell-binding story of a pivotal time/event in world history.I see some one picking nits such as the type of gun Hitler used to shoot himself: \\"Hitler shot himself on April 30, 1945 with a PPK not a \\"revolver\\" as the author erroneously writes, and the Germans used primarily (but not exclusively) the P08 Lugar and the Walther P38 as side arms, not \\"revolvers.\\" I do not mean to niggle over minor details but these are the things that drive historians insane.\\" You are. Niggling over unimportant very minor details. If that sort of thing drives you insane, get a grip. If the choice of suicide weapon (hmmmmm ... 9mm? 44-mag? 12-ga pump-action? what'll 'er be this fine morning?) had ANY bearing on the historical impact of the event (Hitler dead by his own hand) or was a mistake of some weight (say, he threw himself out of a window vs. shot himself with a pistol ...) I might bite. But forget it. The fact that the complaints about this book fall to this level should indicate the book's quality to you. (Do you really care about the name and family history of the foreman of the factory that made the carpets that the \\"tapis-fresser\\" enjoyed chewing? Think anyone would publish the book about it?)Historical objectivity? That-there's one of them oxymorons folks. At least Shirer was an eye-witness to most of the events recorded. At least he tells you straight-up when he's expressing his opinions ... All histories are written from a particular viewpoint. Pretending to be objective doesn't make you so. \\"[I]t is not without its faults\\" No kidding? I guess if your standard is perfection you had better throw out all history books.I have read most of Shirer's books on this period: Berlin Diary, The Nightmare Years, Midcentury Journey. They are also good and provide some additional context. But this book stands alone.Want a good history read? Want a good look at the Nazi regime, what brought them to power in a liberal democracy of well-educated people, and the reality of life under the regime? Here's your book. Superb, a must-read.At the very least, please read the chapter titled, \\"Inside the New Order,\\" which discusses the horrid, brutal realities of the Nazi regime and its system. Amazing.(If I were king, I would require this book for all 12th grade students as a prerequisite for graduation from high school. Democracy can provide fertile ground for evil. Beware!)I also highly recommend \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners,\\" by D. J. Goldhagen and \\"Berlin Journal\\" by R. Darnton, in addition to Churchill's history of WWII. (Anything by Churchill, for that matter.)"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Anyone who aims to cover the history of WWII in Europe thoroughly will necessarily read this book. Its greatest weakness - that it \\"was published relatively soon after WWII, by a journalist not a government minister, academic, or soldier\\" [S. Knasick, below] - is also one of its greatest points: Shirer may not have been a professional historian, but he lived in Germany as a journalist during Hitler's rise and he had a lot of direct experience to draw upon as he researched this story. To the later day reader, this read is as much interesting for the author's own contemporary prejudices and cross-cultural paradigms as it is for its historical depth. I only had two personal gripes with the book: First, it could have said more about the Soviet contribution towards defeating Germany (it is very much an English speaker's perspective on the war); and second, Shirer's severe judgments on the German people as being almost fundamentally flawed would no longer appeal to many readers. However, as I have already said, these inadequacies are also somewhat interesting insofar as they very much reflect the mood of the times.\\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" is probably the biggest book I've ever read. Just to fit it all into one volume requires exceptionally small print - and then the footnotes belonging to many pages carry a print that is smaller still. At first glance, therefore, its sheer size probably puts off most potential readers. But the book is highly readable, thoroughly interesting, and one doesn't have to get too far into it before they realise that found in its size will be hours and hours of fascinating and compulsive reading. From Shirer's thorough account of Hitler's own rise and fall to the rise and fall of a fascist nation, this book is an excellent read. It will remain a must read on WWII for a long time to come."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"this is a book which brings the true about what happened in germany. we must all learn from it. very concise and believable."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is an incredible book...I can't believe I had never read it. It is a fascinating look at a chapter in history that we should all study and hopefully learn from."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Most history books tend to be very dry, spending much of the time listing names and dates and very thin on context & motivations... this book is the complete opposite of that! I especially like how the author spreads blame around judiciously and evenly. That he lived through this history gives Shirer the opportunity to draw on real insights and impressions of people and he takes advantage of this opportunity early and often. This will easily remain my most favorite history book for a long time."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is a lengthy book on World War II.

I purchased the Kindle edition to replace my very old, falling apart version I had not read in over 30 years. The story is well told, and having the perspective of Mr. Shirer, a reporter at the time of the events, is a treat.Mr. Shirer occasionally lapses into non-objective language, which is forgivable. His book can be read as finding advocating that there was a flaw in the German national character, something I think is an unwarranted judgment. I find that his judgment of the failure of France, Great Britain and the Soviet Union to act earlier fails to take into account the full political situation in all of those countries, and that earlier actions may have had serious consequences that are not appreciated. Still, to get a great overview of Nazi Germany with a lot of colorful detail, this book is worth returning to again and again."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"As the grandson of a WWII veteran, I have always had a deep interest in the events that precipatated Hitler's rise to power.

Based on other reviews, I might not have spent the money had it been its normal price. I am glad I bought this. This read is simply amazing- what a treat to see this period of history through the eyes of one who actually lived through it. It is thought provoking and enlightening. As others have mentioned it reads like a novel.Since others have commented on the contents of the book itself, I will limit myself to the kindle version. While it hasn't been fixed to the level it should be, is now quite readable. There are a handful of instances where a \\"1\\" replaces a Capital \\"I\\", and a few other things along those lines. For me it didn't impede comprehension of the text, rather just caused me to roll my eyes in disgust. The gross errors that, based on previous reviews seem to have plagued previous editions, are gone. Having said that, \\"quite readable\\" isn't really good enough- the kindle version of this book merits a real proofread by a live person. I dropped a star because of the lack of that human touch.I do read these on an app, and did find it awkward to check the footnotes. My application frequently froze when trying to access them. The footnotes added quite a bit of depth to the text, so I was frustrated by this. Hence the removal of the second star. I think if I were to read this again, or in a scholarly setting, I would buy the hard copy. Actually, in my opinion, this book merits having as a hard copy on the shelves so generations will be able to enjoy/benefit from it. The ebook is much easier to carry around, however!I do agree with previous reviewers and commentators, that the optical scanning done to convert books to digital format results in poor quality. That does limit my ebook buying, and I really hope that Amazon will make a visible effort to address this issue and improve the quality of kindle books. It's the reason I don't have a kindle- until the quality of kindle books matches that of the print versions, I refuse to marry myself to the technology."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This size of book is perfect for the Kindle instead of having to handle a massive tome.

Yet, Shirer's book is not just about Nazis arrival to the world stage, it is also about politics and economics of XX century in which a citizen was reduced to a cog and where big business and political elite formed an alliance which is still in place today, though with a one difference. If earlier this alliance was formed under the banner of National Socialism, today's banner endorses Democracy and Free Market Economy, the best possible combination for Capitalism to make profits.Egor Paanukoski, M.Pol.Sci"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"If you read only one book about the Third Reich and WWII, this book is by far the best option available. Mr. Shirer has written a well-researched, comprehensive and engaging account of Third Reich from its inception till its demise.

Most of his communication to the German people was lies and misrepresentation of what he had in his warped mind for Germany. Once it got started it traveled through out the country like a virus to a populace that had been put down since the end of the first World War; that was looking for something, anything to bring back a proud people to their previous position in the world order. Shirer knew first hand what transpired since he was a War Correspondent (American) that lived in Germany in the 30\`s as the Nazis were coming to power, and on into the war in the 40\`s.

Shirer personally witnessed much of what happened first hand, having previously authored the classic Berlin Diary. Written circa 1960, this wonderful book digs into the notes of meetings from frontline surviving Nazis rather than waiting a generation to interview an extremely old man, widow or descendant. With memories fresh and information available for this barbaric regime like no other, Shirer has weaved a true masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and read this book"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"There is not much more that I can add to those who have already posted before me but I'll try. This is the first comprehensive review of the rise and fall of the Nazi's. There is a bit of bias in the author's work but it is plain to see and he does not try to hide it. I think that it adds a bit of flavor that is lacking in other works where other authors who had not been there lack. The work is the first so as time has progress so have the knowledge base and analysis. Having said this I don't think that we should ignore this book it is a timeless work that few have ever written. There is so much information in this book, starting from the family tree of Hitler, to the personal backgrounds of his advisers, meetings of the high counsel, and strategic military plans. The author lived and reported in Germany before and during the war, so he is able to provide a first hand account of the plight of the average German during the war. The details the details the details is what make this work so great. They are so many and presented as a journalist would present them (because that is what the author was). I recommend this work to anyone especially to those who have forgotten what the name Nazi was really all about and so carelessly through it about now."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Shirer's world-famous book is nothing less than a complete history of Nazi Germany. It begins with a summary of Hitler's childhood, and gathers steam as Hitler becomes more involved with what begins as a rag-tag group of misfits in a Vienna basement. From there Shirer details the countless strategies done, lies told, and careers ruined in the creation of such an incredibly powerful new era in European politics and world history.A mere book review can never adequately convey the scope of the work, so I can at best describe how well Shirer achieves his aims in writing the book. The book throughout is fascinatingly told, even when its voice dryly accounts confusing maneuvers Hitler made in rising within the ranks of the Wehrmact government in the first part of the book. It obviously gains steam as Hitler begins to formulate his plans against France, Poland and the Soviet Union, and by the time the defeat at Stalingrad comes around it is consistently absorbing. What also differentiates this from the standard work of history is the emotion that Shirer puts into it (the war could not have been over for very long before he began the writing of the book, as it was published in the early '60's), his expansive access to German documents (secret or otherwise), and his physical presence in the actual places where some incredibly important WWII events occurred. In describing a scene between Chamberlain and Hitler in Munich in 1939, the writer recounts watching the two men actually leaving their meeting place, chatting, and walking past him. This detail wouldn't necessarily heighten or decrease the quality of the overall work, but it does give it a freshness and immediacy that both helps the reader be more than just a casual observer and gives it a street cred that other works written long after the fact may lack. It is this closeness to the subject matter that you continually feel throughout the book, which combined with the painstaking detail and concentrated scope of the book make it vital reading for anyone with any interest in the subject matter. From the early victories to the quick and stunning defeat, there is also a high level of tension and excitement in the book that really sets it apart. My only real issue with the book would be its occasional pacing; some of the events in the book are mysteriously given more detail than others (the Valkyrie assassination attempt section is much longer than the section on the entire Holocaust, for example). Read it a little bit at a time- it will go by faster than you'd think. One of the century's most important books."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I read the Chinese version of this book in college within two weeks, back to 1994.

Three years later, I read it the second time and still felt fascinated.It gave you a thorough view of the third Reich in an amazing detail and true objective view. Here you can find how and why German people chose Hitler and the country embraced Nazism at the time. Definitely the best history reference for the third Reich.To have a thorough view of the Nazi Germany, you just need to read this book. All others are waste of time."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is a phenomenal book by a reporter who was in Germany before the war and personally witnessed and recorded Hitler's rise to power and then, after the war, was one of the first allowed back in to look at and categorize the Nazi achieves that read like so many bureaucratic memo's from hell.If every American capable of doing so would take the time (a lot of time, it's a big book) to carefully read this book, then we would soon live in a different country.Our country would be changed by its informed citizens who see all around us the beginnings and beyond of the very things that the 20s and 30s presented in Germany and the world.If anyone could have known the results of letting Hitler get in (and they could, all they had to do was read Mien Kampf and believe it) they would have done anything to stop him. But \\"him\\" was more than just one man. He was the result of social and economic times and political decisions, primarily by the allies, that allowed and ushered in the Great Man onto the world stage where he began his ten year orgy of destruction.This is a carefully written, very well documented book. A must read for every thinking person. Make the effort, read the book. Then look around and see if you can tell me I am wrong."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer's famous Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is THE historical record of WW II Nazi Germany. However, that 1200+ page highly-detailed scholarly work is a bit more than many of us \\"short attention span\\" people can handle . . . not so with this edition.This 10x13 oversize hardcover blends the Reader's Digest abridgement of Rise and Fall with about 400 priceless photgraphs, illustrations and maps from the era of the Reich. On heavy glossy stock, nicely done.For many of us, this is the best way to enjoy Shirer's work. For the more scholarly, this version, with all of the illustrations, is an excellent complement to the complete unabridged original."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I would just love to know why the author has such a special dislike for Goering. Almost every single occurrence of the man's name is accompanied by some mention of his girth. One might expect a similar treatment of Hitler. The mad dwarf, the crazy diminutive, the nutty midget etc etc. Although Shirer does mention the fact that Hitler was a WWI corporal over and over as if that should be some sort of insult.At any rate, the book was wonderful. Much detail but at the same time very engrossing and interesting. The majority of the book deals with the rise to power as opposed to the fall. I would not recommend this work to anyone interested in a military history of the Nazis in WWII. This is a political history. It tells who how when and where the party came to power and it deals with the governing of the party more than the military aspects. Which is why this book is of such interest many man books have been written about the military aspects. Similarly the holocaust is also dealt with rather quickly though not glossed over.All in all I would suggest this book to anyone who would like a political history of the Nazi government. Just be warned if you are interested in a history of WWII the 1130(+-) of this book won't quite be enough."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer's titantic (1250 pages) volume on the third reich is an awesome achievement. Written by a journalist who witnessed the rise of Hitler first hand, then spent years combing through the mountain of documents left after the war, it is a definitive and comprehensive telling of how Adolf Hitler rose to the highest peak achieve by any conquerer and then fell into ashes, a victim of his own megalomania.This is NOT a history of World War II. Japan, the United States and other nations come into the story only so much as they impact Germany. The internal politics of Russia, the US and UK are not touched on. In fact, much of the military history is glossed over. But that is the book's strength -- it keeps it tight focus on the question; How did Hitler become so powerful and how did he fall from that lofty peak? We start with an exploration of Hitler's life and personality, go through his rise to power (I was stunned to find out that the Nazis never actually won an election). Then we get into the heart of the book -- Hitler's conquest of Austria and Czechoslovakia without a shot. You'll find a vital lesson in history when you learn the France and Britain could have ended Hitler in a week had they stood by the Czechs instead of trying for \\"peace\\" and only fighting him when six years and tens of millions of lives had to be sacrificed.The days preceeding WWII drag a bit. Shirer spends way too much time on negotiations over Poland -- negotiations that were ultimately false from Germany's side. But then he hits Olympian heights again with his depiction of Hitler's insane war on Russia, the horrific regime he was putting in place and his ultimate collapse before the unimaginable armed might of the Allies.The unexpected surprise for me was my sympathy for the German people. Their country was reduced to ashes by their blind obedience to one of the most evil creatures our race has produced. While I felt enormous satisifaction when justice finally found the most evil of Nazis -- I was saddened at the fate of the average German who knew nor cared little for conquest -- especially when I read that Hitler's ultimate plan on defeat was to raze his own country to the ground. The defeat of the Nazis was not really a triumph but the necessary conclusion to the 20th century's worst tragedy.This book is long and slow. But when you put it down, you will understand World War II better than you ever have."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I hated history in grade school. But was encouraged by a co-worker to try the book. Now, nine months later, I've just completed reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich : A History of Nazi Germany, a fascinating 1100-page collection of details. The style reminds me of James Michener's affinity for detail. Amazing how one person---apparently a close relative to Jiminy Cricket---could have witnessed so much history. The thought of accomplishing what William L. Shirer has overwhelms me.Thanks Mr. Shirier.I'd recommended this book to anyone who is fascinated by human behavior and appreciates detail."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is a masterpiece, hands down. It took me a few months to read it, but I wanted to take my time to get something out of reading a book of this length and breadth. It was worth the effort. This is the best overall account yet that I have read about the Third Reich - it's a must have for any serious World War II buff of the European Theater.If you are really intent on learning a great deal from reading the book, take notes, especially of all the names and abbreviations; it can be a bit hard to follow at times.A true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Yes it is huge but if you are interested at all in the Nazi era then you must read this book. It covers everything... what I was most impressed by was Professor Shirer's coverage of Post WWI Germany under the Weimar Republic. Simply astounding. This book reminds all of its readers why history is so important. Just get the book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Shirer's monumental study of the rise of Hitler's Third Reich is a historical classic that will surely be admired for centuries to come. From the serious student of history to the casual nonfiction reader, this book should be read by all. As a literary work, Shirer's writing rivals Gibbon's classical study of the Roman Empire. As a historical masterpiece, it is without comparison.Shirer leaves no stone unturned, discussing history, biography, diplomacy, military tactics, economics, even romance within his piece's 1500 pages. All areas are amazingly well-researched (the end notes and foot notes alone are an undertaking of mind-boggling volume).As a history lover myself, and one who subscribes very much to the notion that history is cyclical and we must learn about the mistakes of the past to prevent their repetition, I suggest Shirer's work to ANYONE (except, of course, children, as Shirer discusses at some length the gruesomeness of the Third Reich's racial theory and practices)."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I have just finished reading Mr. Shirer's work. I found it utterly fascinating on many levels...- the author's prejudices, foibles, weaknesses AND strengths are out front on every page. For me, the inhumane horrors of the Third Reich become more real as seen through the eyes of the all too human Mr. Shirer."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Since the time of Herodotus, the debate has always raged as to the distance someone must have from an event in order to objectively cover it historically.If too far away in time or place, the historian cannot be expected to fully grasp what has happened. He or she would probably not have the right access to the documents and wouldn't truly know what it was like.On the other hand, if you live during an event, you develop biases. Other reviewers have often commented (either favorably or not) on Shirer's biases in this book. Some are explicit, such as when his repeated value judgments on the evil nature of the Third Reich. Others are more insidious, such as when he refers to Hitler's cronies as bungling, stupid, piggish, etc. when these characteristics have nothing to do with the event he is describing.Shirer makes very clear his bias in his introduction when he states that totalitarian dictatorships are abhorrent to him. They are, in truth, abhorrent to almost everyone nowadays, yet most modern historians would not portray the facts with quite so much bias, in this case directly as a result of the author's terrible experiences living in the Third Reich.In addition, his biases towards others also sometimes raise their heads. He is very quick to point out the homosexuality of early Nazis, as if this is a universally acknowledged weakness in their character. He describes them as therefore perverted and even at one point makes reference to their inability to adequately lead directly due to their sexual &quot;perversions.&quot; While garrishly outdated, this particular bias serves to outline some of the others that Shirer, albeit not purposely, sprinkles through the book.However, while biases in this book do sometimes color the facts, the sheer number of facts is staggering and completely convincing. The access Shirer had to important people who lived through (and died during) the Third Reich is simply astounding. While I might not believe Shirer when he says that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was a bungling arrogant stupid diplomat, I certainly believe it after getting a glimpse into diaries such as Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's and German General Staff Chief Halder's.His access to facts and his knowledge about where to look for them is a direct result of his closeness to the events as they were taking place. This access and presentation is the victory of this book and what makes it a triumph and the definitive work on the Third Reich.One other small point. I am a little bit confused as to where Shirer was able to get his numbers as to number of victims, particularly the number of Jews that died in the Nazi Holocaust. It is today accepted that 6 million were killed, yet Shirer repeatedly mentions the figure of 4.5 million. What facts did he not have that we have today? I would like to point out that this may be a result of the insurmountable difficulty for someone writing a political and military history to comb through the records of the Final Solution and a bit too much of a reliance on that work by others, who vary widely in their reports."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I am by no means an historian, but I enjoyed this book as much as about any I've ever read. Shirer has deftly woven hard facts from captured Nazi documents, the Nuremberg trials and other sources with his own personal experience in Germany.Despite the ample supply of facts, he does a tremendous job of making his history an interesting story. It is truly a page-turner, as the reader wants to find out what happens next. I think his personal experience with some of the leading players allows him to make them human, easier to relate to than most historical figures. Shirer seems to have a keen grasp of the human psyche, and uses his perceptiveness to get frighteningly inside the head of men like Hitler.Reading &quot;Rise and Fall&quot; is much like reading a novel. The story is amazing, and because of the vast documentation available, we have as complete access to the events as possible. Some historians may shun this work, but I find it of immeasurable value and pleasure.A word of warning: The book is very long (1100 pages in the hardcover edition), and isn't exactly what I'd call quick reading, despite its intrigue. I'm a fairly fast reader, and it took me a long while to finish it. Even so, I would recommend this to any and everyone."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is a treasure trove of information consisting of not only the historical facts, but of unparalleled insights into the psychological make-up of those invoved in that history. The author seems to have been involved directly with the Reich, as he points out clearly he was close at hand during many historical moments. This view allows the reader to envision the scenes and understand not only the madness... but the reasons behind that insanity. On the low point, the author sometimes bears out to be somewhat prejudicial. When reading, one can't help but notice the pro-Nazi sentiments that are hidden between the lines as he rails against the regime. This makes the author appear to be less credible after around 600 pages. But...if you can get over the author's contradictions and read through them to the story itself, this is one great book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I have to say that I was never a fan of historical accounts but I found Shirer's history of Nazi Germany remarkable. If you are a historian and an expert in the field, this book will meet your expectations (the primary resources are most impressive) but if this is the first time you read something that is non-fiction, the author's style is not too oppresive as he presents the incredible events that transpired during World War II. The miracle at Dunkirk, the flight of Rudolph Hess, the rescue of Mussolini... if you don't know what I'm talking about, yet you're reading this review, you owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer's book recounting in extremely fine detail one of the most covered subjects in world history has a unique, magical quality. I will not dwell on its accuracy and breadth of documentation, other reviewers have already noted it. The sheer quantity of original and secret material from the Nazi administration archives Shirer was able to use as a background to write this book boggles the mind - and he himself admits it would've taken many men many lifetimes to go through it all; but this is not my point. My point is that in anyone else's hands, this material would probably have resulted in a jaw-droppingly boring listing of names and minutes from cabinet meetings. What truly astonished me about this book were its overpowering demand for attention, its totally consistent clarity, its lightness of style and exposition that never, ever forgot precision and in-depth observation. I read this 1,100+-page book in two weeks, and not once through it I felt I wasn't understanding what it talked about. I'm not a faster or smarter-than-average reader: it was simply impossible to let the volume stand there, so much so that for two weeks I brought it with me everywhere I went, using every minute of free time (and also a few hours of work time) to read a few more lines, a few more paragraphs, please, just two more pages, I promise. For all the countless historical characters and extremely complex situations presented here (how could there not be, given the subject?), Shirer leads the reader through them with such powerful grace and insight that you have to strain to remind yourself this is not a Dashiell Hammett mystery, and that Adolf Hitler wasn't simply any Little Caesar. Though Shirer's judgment on the whole story is fairly explicit - and please let me add that it should simply be any reasonable person's judgment - he never lets it cloud his narration. People here are mostly shown through their actions, not ex-post interpretation or psychobabble. They lunge for your throat. Even the first page starts, so to speak, in mid-action, at the end of January 1933, with Hitler rising to Chancellorship after 14 years of founding the NSDAP. As you turn the pages, as story - and history - unfold, you feel the same uncertainty with which life itself unfolds, as if the Third Reich is growing day by day before your eyes and you actually don't know what tomorrow and the next page will bring, as if you didn't already know how the story ended. Shirer's book is the perfect example of how all history should be written."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is the benchmark book on the subject. Reading it has great relevance for today. It is a treatise on the dangers of avoiding conflict and denying that, while we do not like it, there are and will be enemies of freedom in the world."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I'd known vaguely about WWII, the same way many people do, when I picked this book up several years ago. I remember it from my father's book collection. Anyway, it held my attention and I finished it about four days. William Shirer spent many years in Germany until about half way during WWII. His experiences during that time as a reporter allowed him to tell a more-or-less accurate story and tell it in a fashion that, unlike many historical books, is enjoyable to read.Some would argue as to the 100% accuracy of the book or to it's relevence to history. Personally, having read (and I'm not exaggerating) most of the so called &quot;classic&quot; biographies on the Nazi leadership, philosophy, policatal system and anything else, I think it is a very important contribution that covers the important parts of the Third Reich (1933-45) in detail. I think, given when it was written, that it is surprisingly unbiased and fair and Shirer has done his best to keep his personal feelings out of the book. He does make observations from time to time, but usually only in situations where he was actually present at the event.If you are new to the subject of the Nazi rise to power and the subsequent 12 years, then I cannot think of a better place to start. There are other books on the subject, but few that are as easy to read and cover quite as much as this one."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I started to read this title over 40 years ago while I was still in high school. I must tell you that reading this book is what turned me into a German major in college. I wanted to understand more. But Shirer started all that with this very well annotated book covering the whole ugly story of how a small group of radical took over the political, and eventually all aspects, of a country's life.I find his writing very engaging and he turned the history into a suspenseful tale with myriad twists and turns that any fiction writer would love to think of. There were many sections of the book that I had to stop reading and wait for my emotions to calm down a bit before I could continue. Shirer does not paint his pictures in the soft pastel palates of water colors. It is not for the troubled to read. One needs to be strong to think about some of the material facts presented in this book.It is especially timely now, when we Americans are in the throws of similar demogoguery and scapegoating in our political world. Indeed, it quite amazes me how many of the damning things said about the Jewish Germans are the same one being currently slung at members of other groups right now in this country."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Reading this book is like attending and watching an exciting World Series finale from a seat right behind the home plate.Excellent narrative history sprinkled with a good use of original quotes.Current paperback edition is deluxed-sized with a readable font."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer admits in his Foreword to \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\\" that he would not have started such a project merely on the basis of having been an on-the-spot observer of the Reich's development. Being stationed as a reporter in Berlin from the mid-thirties until just before America entered the war, certainly helped when the time came to take a deep breath and begin this work. However, what really spurred him on was the enormous, much too voluminous amount in fact, of material left behind by the German general staff and almost all government ministries, presumably in their panic to escape the Russians. In fact, Russian units entering the centre of the city found a few desultory piles of classified material burning behind the Reichstag and were even able to save much of that.This is a work that falls between two categories. It is hardly light enough reading to be easily packaged as an ordinary paperback (although paperback editions abound); nor is it a scholarly work trying to be complete in every detail, with all the antics of the vast assemblage of characters carefully foot-noted, cross-referenced and indexed. It is a solid book, but fortunately, immensely readable and I wonder how you could really get around an understanding of the Third Reich without it (or why you would want to). In addition, its writer is an American and for some reason, that seems to make it more dependable. Shirer is no fool; he treats the subject with openness and honesty, giving us what I feel is a better, more reliable view than certain European sources might do. This is in spite of a certain tendency he has to view the main protagonists with a jaundiced eye. But who could really view the von Ribbentrops and Goerings of this world with extreme fairness, much after 1940?There is nothing like having been there, and Shirer has recorded his experiences in diary form in \\"Berlin Diary,\\" which is also well worth reading. But if you are going to read just one main book about the history of the Third Reich, you won't go far wrong with this one. It's a major accomplishment."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This massive tome is still a solid treatment of WWII and the events leading up to it. While its history isn't perfect, it is Nazi Germany as the author saw it--he remained there until late 1940, which took special courage. Shirer did not know all that we know now, but a lot of what he says has held up.It would be a much more wearying book were it not for Shirer's unique and pungent commentary on Nazi figures he found lacking in merit, particularly Ribbentrop. (How can anyone resist a characterization like 'insufferable ignoramus'?) He delves into some of the more interesting rogues in the Nazi gallery, such as Alfred Naujocks, giving information not commonly known. Strongly recommended, with the caveat that one should also read other books to get a more complete historical perspective."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Don't let the size of this book deter you from reading what is truly a masterpiece. William Shirer's look at one of history's most ruthless regimes is nothing short of outstanding. It is a well-written and utterly absorbing account of Hitler's rise to power, his reign of the Third Reich, and his subsequent fall. Shirer's painstaking and extensive research, coupled with his clear writing, provides the reader with a terrifying account of the horrors of Hitler's reign of terror. It is truly amazing to me that one man could mesmerize a country and lead them into a war they did not want and felt they could not win. The only drawback to the book is this: I am admittedly weak in geography and would liked to have seen a few maps of pre-War and post-War Europe throughout the text. In addition, maps of troop movements and campaigns during the War may have provided a clearer picture of the expanse of the German Empire at its height; however, the lack of maps certainly did not detract from the written work. Overall, a truly exceptional book that should be read by anyone who is interested in German/European history, WWII, or Adolf Hitler."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is so good that despite the thickness, I read it twice. While it is a chronicle of the rise of Germany from the ashes of defeat in World War I to an even greater pile of ashes after World War II, it is not a historical account. Shirer is a journalist, and that is the approach he took in writing the book.There is no historical event more fascinating than the manner in which Adolf Hitler rose to such power in Germany and led it to such ruin. Approximately a decade before rising to power in Germany, Hitler stated his intentions quite clearly in the book \\"Mein Kampf\\" (My Battle). Yet, the German people were so desperate at the time that almost anything seemed to be an improvement. The one quote that always comes back is when a German citizen is being interviewed. When asked about giving up their freedom when the Nazis came to power the reply was, \\"Yes, but before we were free to starve.\\"I have read many books about the rise of the Nazi state in Germany, but this one is clearly the best in describing the actual events, from the beginnings until the disastrous conclusion. I first read it in 1975 and reread it again in 1994. Most likely, I will reread it again somewhere around 2014. It is the best description available about how bad things can go when ideologues seize power and the moderate forces in the society respond either tepidly or feel obligated to render their support. Few people realize that Hitler came to power legally and with the support of a large part of the political establishment."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I'm not a fast reader and I dove into the nearly 1,200-page tome with the understanding that I would probably devote the next month or two to the quest of gaining a much fuller understanding of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.I thought it would be worth the effort and I was right. William Shirer's engrossing narrative provides a virtual \\"everything you ever wanted to know\\" about the Third Reich from the vantage point of someone who was actually there!A few reviewers have carped about his tendancy toward journalistic license at the expense of academic research, but I was able to overlook this in much the same way that I got past the same criticisms while reading Shelby Foote's wonderful three-volume account of The Civil War. Dry historic research is okay for dry historic researchers.But, most popular writers are going to have some sort of bias, and Shirer can't avoid his need to remind us frequently the Nazis were really BAD people and did really BAD things. This I do not mind .. I appreciate it in fact."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"By reading this book I came to the conclusion that Hitler almost made it to rule all of Europe. I have not read a better overall account of the Nazis then this book offers. It does not have in-depth coverage of battles, as that is not the focus of the book. What it does cover is the overall details of the leadership of the Nazis through the period. The title could make you think this is going to be one of those very dry reviews favored only by history professors, but that is not the case. The book is a well-written and orderly book that is easy to read. The detail of the personalities involved made the list of characters easer to remember. There is just so much good information that this book should be the first book read by anyone wanting to gain an understanding of WW 2 in Europe."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is a spectacular achievement by an author who knows whereof he speaks. Shirer was an American journalist in Germany during the 1930's; he watched Hitler's rise from obscurity in Austria to become the most powerful and evil force in Europe. Shirer was witness to what Hitler built and nourished and he doesn't pretend to be impartial. He states in the book's introduction that he hates all totalitarian governments and he especially came to loathe this one as he watched its relentless assault and violation of everything that makes people human. Shirer pays Hitler grudging respect as a man of undoubted, if evil, genius. He knew how to manipulate time and circumstances to his advantage. But he couldn't have done it alone or in a vacuum, and Shirer builds a solid background on the historical events that made Hitler and Nazism possible. Antisemitism was an old story in Germany; there is an almost unbroken string from Hitler back to Martin Luther whose advice to kill and destroy all Jews as enemies of mankind was \\"literally followed 500 years later by Hitler, Goering and Himmler\\". He writes of how the great majority of Germans enthusiastically and blindly followed Hitler through conquest, war, and the destruction and devastation of their country. And he shows in convincing and sickening detail the German mindset that made them \\"ubermensch\\" in their own minds, and everyone else, especially Jews and Slavic peoples, subhumans to be killed or allowed to live as slaves to German \\"kultur\\".Shirer's book is abundantly documented, largely thanks to the bonanza of Nazi documents that fell almost untouched into Allied hands at the end of the war. Perhaps it was that mania for organization and precision that contributed to the \\"Final Solution\\": first, the determination that the Jews were to be eliminated and then the search for a method to most efficiently bring this about. So from mass shootings in the trenches, they progressed to Auschwitz and the gas chambers, and kept searching for ways to improve the rate and efficiency of the carnage right up to the end.What kind of people would participate in something as monstrous as this? Some of the most chilling passages in the book are the descriptions of the defendants' testimony at the Nuremberg trials, as when one officer says without batting an eye that he personally oversaw the deaths of 90,000 people. Even this pales before the descriptions of the medical experiments in the concentration camps, when respected doctors prostituted their science and their souls in some of the most despicable tortures ever perpetrated on human beings, and lost their own humanity in the process.One of the main strengths of the book, besides the wealth of documentation, is that it was written only 14 years after the end of the war, when many of the main characters were still alive. Shirer gives grudging respect to those Germans such as Halder and Speer who were able to face up to and acknowledge their own guilt and complicity that allowed the unspeakable to become real. One wonders what Heydrich or Von Ribbentrop would have told him had they not been executed, one by Czech partisans and the other by a hangman's noose after the Nuremberg trials.Shirer narrates in detail the failed plot to kill Hitler by his own officers in 1944, the revenge exacted by Hitler and his kangaroo courts, the Allied invasion of Western Europe and the final assault by Russia and the Allied forces that destroyed Nazi Germany, and not a minute too soon. He feels some sympathy for the German people who followed Hitler blindly to their own destruction, like lemmings over a cliff. It is difficult to share his feelings. One reads this awesome book and feels that they brought it on themselves, they enthusiastically backed Hitler's rise to power, and in doing so, unleashed a monster."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is nearly as astonishing as the facts themselves. The Third Reich, National Socialism and Adolf Hitler from cradle to grave: (unfortunately for humanity) a long tale told directly and comprehensively. The facts need no embellishment to captivate the imagination, and beyond the frequent sarcastic jibe at the men responsible for the upheavals (the Norwegian traitor Quisling derided as a &quot;Baltic dolt&quot;; Goering as the &quot;fat Reich Marshal&quot;), Shirer gives them none. He gives full treatment to the historical and contemporary political conditions that shaped Hitler, his followers, and the German Republic he seized, as well as European political conditions that allowed Nazi Germany's rise. Shirer's political astuteness and scholarly approach are not blended together in journalism today, but they should be. This is as well-written and interesting a historical treatise as you will find, perhaps on any subject."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is one of the most interesting historical book I have ever read in my life. In my high school days, history has always been one of my favorites subjects but I haven't done anything outside of school to expand on it. One event that has always piqued my curiosity has been World War II, specifically what happened with the German government and of course, with Adolf Hitler. I find it very hard to resist learning about the famous German dictator and in various times, I often search on Youtube for some of his videos. That quenched some of my thirst for knowledge but for higher learning, nothing beats reading a book and so my task was to find an unbiased book that not only chronicles the events leading up to World War II but that also dug into the mind and details of Hitler himself. I was immediately drawn toward this monstrous of a book by William Shirer. I have learned so much after having finally devoured this book from start to finish in just a matter of two and a half weeks.I will like to point out that for anyone who have a problem with people like me who took it upon themselves to dedicate a huge chunk of their time devoted to learning about Adolf Hitler, I can assure you its not due to admiration. Many of my friends think me crazy to actually wanting to learn about the history of this crazed man who inevitably led to the extermination of millions and millions of lives. If you never have thought it curious as to how just one single man on this planet could come to this much power, then obviously this book isn't for you. If you have never felt some sort of sympathy for the millions of lives lost and took it upon yourself to learn of their plight and what they actually had to go through, then obviously this book isn't for you. I could go on but I'm sure you get the point.The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich does an excellent job of presenting the facts of the events that took place, especially between 1933 when Hitler came into full power until his ultimate demise in 1945. There are definitely a ton more of written material on earlier events of Hitler's life but it was during that period I just mentioned that is so examined by many historians. Only after having access to the tons of captured documents after the war, which many of them comprises of secret telegrams, does the author have a remote chance of presenting and giving us readers as close as a picture possible of what actually took place in that fateful era of terror. Believe me when I say this that there will be many moments throughout this book that will just knock you out of your feet. It's so surprising for someone who don't have much knowledge on this subject, such as myself, to finally get an insight into how and why events folded as they did back then.For the most part, I can sense that the author tried very hard to keep any of his bigotry and opinions to himself but you can definitely also sense his anger and criticism throughout the book. For example, he keeps referring to Hermann Goering as the \\"fat\\" Reich Marshall. However, I can assure you that it does not hinder the reading experience at all and you wouldn't in any way feel throughout the book feel offended by the author's remarks. If you are actually looking for a book detailing the Holocaust event, you'll be disappointed in this regard and should look elsewhere if that is your main focus. The author, however, does dedicate one entire chapter on presenting details of what actually happened in the concentration camps and how the Nazi's planned for the mass extermination of the Jews.Every chapter is filled with footnotes and citations. My personal recommendation is that if you want to get the most out of this book, you'll definitely want to read all the footnotes from the author. However, many of the source citations I left unread. The author obviously had to include them (trust me, there are a ton of them) due to completeness sake. In fact, even the author himself stated how shocked he was to learn of how well his book sold for something that has so much footnotes and citations. To give you a hint of just how much is included here, the book itself contains about 1280 pages. The actual story ends at about 73% ( I read digital edition). The rest is filled with citations!This book really did open my eyes and I can't thank the author enough for this. I'm sure he spent countless days and nights putting this book together. While many people would automatically categorize upon hearing the name of Adolf Hitler into the \\"evil people\\" category, they have no idea or knowledge of the man himself. Many people would not consider him an evil genius because they have no idea of how he completely conquered his neighboring countries without shedding one single drop of blood. They have no idea that if you looked up the phrase \\"from rags to riches\\", you might probably find a picture of Hitler attached there. They have no idea that his last name of \\"Hitler\\" almost didn't become to be and if it were so, the course of history would have been changed forever just for that fact alone. They have no idea of how important Britain, France, Russia and the United States have played in the role of taking down the Third Reich. They have no idea how the country of Yugoslavia, at the expense of many people's lives, ultimately played the biggest role in the defeat of German troops in Russia and its not in the way you would think initially. These were just some out of the many other things I have learned from this book.I felt that I owed it that much to the millions of victims whose lives were lost due to this tragic event that I at least learn of what happened to them. In this way, they could at least continue to live on through the memory of other human beings and not fade into obscurity forever. There are still many mysteries that are left unsolved even after the capture of secret documents which the Germans failed to destroy. We, of course, have the benefit of hindsight and analysts and historians are able to leisurely dissect everything that has happened in the Third Reich era but there are just some things that cannot be accounted for no matter how hard one try. But of course, that's not the purpose of this book. If you do want to learn everything you can about one of the darkest period known to mankind, than you definitely have to pick up this book. Humankind can only pray that there will never be another Adolf Hitler. Once you've read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, you'll truly be able to understand why.As the author states at the end of the book, \\" Remembrance of the past helps us to understand the present\\". If you can't understand that, then I'll repeat here that this book obviously isn't for you.**********Here are some personal movie's I've seen and recommend relating to WWII and Germany:Schindler's List DVD (Universal's 100th Anniversary)DefianceDownfall [DVD]The PianistValkyrie (Single-Disc Edition)"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Anybody that is interested, like me, in German politics and history especially during the Nazi's 12 year rule, will find this book hard to put down. This is the best book out there on the 3rd Reich, and I have read quite a few. I have read it twice word for word and will most likely read it again sometime."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This has been one of the most entertaining, shocking, and interesting stories I have ever come across. And to think that it is true. Shirer's insight as a witness to many of these historic events add to the depth of information on this evil empire. Every detail one needs to understand exactly what went on, and how, is in this book. I highly recommend it. A classic for a reason."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I started reading this book when I was 13. It was the first book I had read about WWII. It was difficult to get into at first, and I probably would not recommend it to anyone who hasn't read anything about WWII before. Shirer sometimes introduces new figures without an explanation as to who they were. It took me almost half the book to figure out Goebbles position.This book is an amazingly detailed account of Nazi Germany. The details are arranged in such a way that it is extremely interesting. His thought progression is logical and he allows the reader to take in the important details.I find it very important for people to read this book. My views on life, politics, and war completely changed after finishing the book. We take so much for granted in the United States. It was only 80 years ago that Germany went through the depression. Politics were much different back then than now. Anyone who wants to be able to look at World War II in a different light, and see what they are really taking for granted, should definitely read this book. It is a truly amazing tale."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"In the \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" all of what is mankind - the greatest triumphs to the most revolting follies - are layed before us in this timeless masterpiece. The great powers placate the insatiable appetite of mad-dog Hitler only to be confronted with complete capitulation or fight. Read how leader of the free world, Prime Minister Chamberlain, deludes himself with his triumphal proclamation - \\"peace in our time\\" - only to be humiliated as the greatest political fool of all time. Great leaders Stalin, Hitler, Musolini, Churchill, and Roosevelt jockey for position at the eave of War. Blitzkieg! and combat fronts extend for thousands of kilometers as the Reich opens fronts and gathers conquests in all directions. Chills will run down your back as you read of true valor at Stalingrad. D-Day is almost anti-climactic as truly epic battles in years prior bring stagnation, then collapse of the Reich's Eastern Front. Anger will engulf your heart as you read about the \\"Final Solution.\\" The true character of Hitler will haunt you henceforth. You will wonder, \\"How on earth life might be today had the Allies lost.\\"William Shirer's book is so meticulously researched and footnoted, and so compellingly written, that the most devout \\"Holy Roller\\" will reject the Scriptures before he doubts this monumental work. You will read and re-read this book throughout your life, maybe, just maybe wondering, \\"What is Civilization anyway?\\" or \\"Is Pacifism Folly through and through?\\" Should you choose just one book of Human History, choose this one."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I had almost given up on my hope of getting this one on my kindle ... recently my pre-order for it had been cancelled ... but now it is here. There are lots of different perspectives in various works about the war, but this is one of the best in my opinion ... presented by someone who was well positioned to observe the progression of events that led to what became the greatest of all cataclysms ... and well written to boot. Thanx Amazon! :)"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"That Hitler's parent were 2nd cousins and that they needed an Episcopalian dispensation to wed? Or that his tenure as an \\"artist\\" consisted of painting crappy postcards for tourists? That if his father wasn't recognized by his father in middle age, that chants of \\"Heil Schicklegruber\\" would has resonated throughout the Reich? Well you should. The quintessential text on Nazi Germany written by William Shirer is something you should read. Quippy fun facts aside, this text is comprised of an eyewitness account from day one until VE day and beyond. Shirer had access to the captured documents, diaries, and files and is able to work fact and detail into a highly readable account. Previous issues with the layman reader tackling this work stemmed largely from size of the volume and not readability but the Kindle Edition provides the necessary ergonomic realities to curl up with this work. Read it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The book is excellent, but the Kindle edition has a lot of problems. Many of the footnote links don't work, and some footnotes are entirely missing. I believe this is an edition that's already been \\"corrected\\" to a certain extent, because it does have page numbers, which were apparently missing on the first Kindle edition.One of the most annoying problems is that there are many passages quoted from documents that are not distinguished in any way from the rest of the text. I imagine that in the hard copy edition, these are indented and use a smaller typeface; I read the hard copy edition years ago, but I can't remember. In this Kindle edition, it often is not at all clear that you are switching from the author's words to words from a letter or memorandum written by one of the protagonists. For one thing, the author often makes first-person observations, so a sudden switch to the first person doesn't always indicate a quotation.Here is one example, from page 501, location 12086:|| Three days later, on July 29th, Weizsaeker sent a secret dispatch by courier to Schulenburg in Moscow.It would be important for us to know whether the remarks made to Astakhov and Babarin have met with any response in Moscow. ||Not until I was well past that second sentence did I realize that this was the contents of the dispatch. At first I thought the author was saying that it would be important to him and other historians to know what the response was. The present tense \\"have\\" was my first clue that this was not an authorial observation.Some other instances are even more confusing, but I didn't start flagging them with a bookmark until I got so frustrated that I decided to mention the problem in a review."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"It's incredible and horrible truth,very detailed and never should have happened and never should repeat. Even as more than sixty years have gone by,this book is the monument of unbelievevel cruelty and horrors of war.The book deserves the best rating possible."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I read this book between semesters last year because I was going to take a History course that covered this period. I had wanted to read it for a long time--but the thing is so big, I kept putting it off!I am so glad I finally got around to reading it. I took a razor blade to my softcover copy to seperate the six books. It made it so much less intimidating! Only now I have to buy another copy!Shirer took a lot of sophisticated material and put it together in a very readable form. The first hundred pages were a bit hard, but after that the book absolutely soared! These are 1,500 pages that I will read again.Another thing I liked was Shirer's introduction. There are those who say that historys should not be written so soon after an event, but Shirer is well justified in his task as was Thucydides in his--and for the same reason. He was there."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"A must read for anyone who wants to expand their mind about history and the destructive power of hate. I just moved from Washington State, USA to Heidelburg, Germany and I was told that this book would fill me with pertinant knowledge. It did. The only drawback: Shirer is a homophobe. Very ironic, dissapointing, and distracting to the reading and learning experience. In teaching us how truly atrocious racism is Shirer feels the need to enlighten us on the fact that the Nazi leaders are &quot;Homosexual Perverts&quot; at every turn in the text. For those of us with good friends that are homosexual, it takes away from the story. If you can ignore that road-bump, this book will impact your life."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book was torture to read. It started off very exciting and interesting, Hitler's background and Vienna days and the formative years of the party were fascinating, but starting with the party's rise to power and with it EVERY twist and turn about how they intrigued and bullied their way to the top and then the occupation of Austria and Czechoslovakia it became excruciating and suffocating to wade through. Characters appear and vanish with breathtaking rapidity never to be heard from again, or else hang around for hundreds of pages (especially Schleicher and Dahlerus) and won't go away. This book's pious and mindboggling coverage of basically only the political events comes at the expense of details about other aspects of the Third Reich (like the Ss, Gestapo, Hitler Youth, Heydrich, Speer, exactly how Germany rearmed, etc.). For example, did we really need a blow-by-blow account of every single turn and setback and last minute comeback and every trivial detail (complete with date, time and even weather descriptions!) regarding how these gangsters came to power? So often I threw up my hands and tore at my hair and screamed as I kept reading about how so and so telephoned so and so at 2 a.m. in the morning then waited all day for a reply... or how many times Hitler flew into the absolutely worst rage in his life... it was sickening enough reading about how dirty and slimy Nazi politics had been but to have every minor character unearthed and every trivial detail thrown a spotlight on through virtually all of 1500 pages including huge footnotes--the footnotes may as well have been a separate book!--it was all just too much. And Ribbentrop, whom Shirer sneered endlessly at is on practically every page in the last two thirds. If he was so pompous and intolerable, did every item in his daily itinerary really needed scrutiny? I'm not exaggerating. Except for Hitler, Ribbentrop is the leading character in the narrative; as a result, more fascinating people like Heydrich and Rommel were given short shrift. Even a little more on Himmler--heck, Streicher--may not have hurt and may have tendered the endless monotony of diplomacy and backstabbing and squabbling. I guess what I am trying to say is that if this book had been a little more well-rounded, it might have been better. I realize one could read other books for more information about other characters and events, but I really wanted it all from this book. After all it has the all-encompassing title of &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; and everyone claims it the definitive history of those days. Also, Shirer has an annoying tendency for Monday morning quarterbacking, and his personal phobias mars the seriousness of this book somewhat. Also, his prose style is distracting and ebbs as much as it flows. The acute sections on the Holocaust and the July plot however were very worthwhile. Overall, three stars. Perhaps this book was not meant to be read from cover to cover; you have been warned."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Horribly dated piece of work. Shirer was a homophobe, and made it quite clear in this sentence: \\"Many of the S.A.'s top leaders, beginning with its chief, Roehm, were notorious homosexual perverts. Lietenant Edmund Heines, who led the Munich S.A., was not only a homosexual but a covicted muderer. These two and dozens of others quarreled and fueded as only men of unnatural sexual inclinations, with their peculiar jealousies, can.\\" The S.A. was a cesspool because of their bullying and murderous nature, not the homosexuality of a few of its top members; they were Hitler's muscle and they had no issue flexing that muscle much to the peril of many decent people. This alone should earn a reader's contempt, but undoubtedly readers in the early sixties probably saw homosexuality as a deep moral flaw. It just isn't that way anymore.I did, however, enjoy the manner in which Shirer rails against many of Hitler's \\"yes men\\"--Ribbentrop gets absolutely exposed and it seems Shirer took joy in revealing his shallow intellect (The passage describing the incident in which Ribbentrop almost knocked over a British dignitary with a sudden, unexpected Nazi salute was laugh-out-loud funny.) Also, the captured Nazi documents, many of which are reproduced verbatim, enlighten the reader as to what was going on inside Hitler's Germany. Shirer often falls back on these documents, as well as post-war testimonies at Nuremberg, giving the reader fleeting breaks from his slanted journalistic approach. The section about the Einsatzgruppen was particularly moving--it moved me to tears--and the insight from Halder's journal is key throughout much of the text. It's fairly long (somewhere over 1100 pages), and if you can adjust to its being horribly dated, you still may enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"For anyone eager to gain a fairly comprehensive understanding of the development, growth, decline, and collapse of the Third Reich, this book is it. With Shirer, you have someone who was a witness to many of the events described in this book - e.g. the Nazi Party rallies at Nuremberg, Hitler's marching of troops into the Rhineland in 1936, the incorporation of Austria into the German Reich in March 1938, the Munich crisis, and the French surrender in June 1940.Shirer also makes skillful use of the wealth of Nazi archival materials to give the reader a full scope of the characters and policies which defined and shaped Germany between 1933 and 1945.In today's uncertain times, reading this book should also serve to remind the reader that any democratic government, whether threatened by real or perceived enemies, can succumb to Fascism if its people permit the slow or precipitate undoing, by executive or legislative fiat, of their civil liberties."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is the fourth time that I have read this very important book by Wm. Shirer who was there during the ascension of Hitler. I re-read it every seven years or so as I always find that current events have their precedent in earlier history. The 'National Socialist Workers Party' sounds like something that Obama might lead, but it is the full name of the Nazi Party. Hitler started out as a left leaning politician with his vilifying of the established order of the day and he pushed for universal health care among other things. Does this sound familiar?This is a must read for any thinking individual who has an interest in politics and public policy."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The Angel HunterThis is an excellent account of the soulless wretches that established the Third Reich. The spine chilling events and political maneuvering that took place within the borders of the Fatherland beginning with the Treaty of Versailles cannot be digested in one reading; they are, in a phrase, too terrible to believe on the first pass. If you are looking for a firsthand account from a journalist who lived in the midst of this madness as it gripped Eastern Europe, this book is for you. If you ever doubted the inhuman suffering inflicted on the world by Nazism, or thought maybe the Holocaust was a Jewish lie, READ THIS BOOK! But be ready for a disturbing revelation that can only be reached by reading this work: the evil doers, in any generation, believe in their hearts, they are right. My God... how frightening."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I deeply believe that there is no question about the excellence of this great book. William Shirer, this outstanding historian, did one of his best (or maybe the best) lucubrations. My admiration directly goes to this durable work and I recommend it to all professional readers who want to know about the most infamous era of the 20th century, World War II, truly!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"By far the most definitive account of the Nazi era, this book is brilliant from almost all viewpoints. It touches upon the German inter-war government, European politics during that period, the German Wehrmacht and the great battles of the War, the turning points and then the end, all in sufficient depth and detail.The reader also gets a clear insight into the mind of the adolescent Hitler, his frustration on not being able to study arts at Vienna, his decision to leave home, the years he spent on the streets of Vienna (where his only company were the \\"rats, and the excruciating hunger\\") and his years as a Corporal in the Austrian Army, and finally his meteoric rise to become Chancellor of Germany.In over 1200 pages, Shirer explains how a regime of unimaginable cruelty came into place, and took over Europe, despite the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations, and the utter misery of the German people at the end of 1918.It seems to me as if the horrors of that age continue to be relived, as the oppression of peoples goes on, around the World. The book makes it clear, in no uncertain terms, that besides the tumultuous changes within Germany itself, the single biggest factor that led to the War was the policy of appeasement followed by the western powers of the day. In their burning desire to see the fall of Bolshevik Russia, the West betrayed many lands, before they finally realised the enormity of Hitler's militarism. Today we once again live in an age where neo-colonialism has arisen, and the world is once again bent on appeasement. I am reminded of the words of Hans Frank (Governor General of Poland), at his trial at Nuremberg. He said, \\"A thousand years shall pass, but the guilt of Germany shall not be erased\\".Before buying this book, it might be well worth remember that this is a book on Nazi Germany and the Third Reich, and not on the World War. For example, you wouldn't find too much on Pearl Harbour or the Imperial Japanese Navy. Also, while Mussolini's rise to power is dealt with, this book doesn't deal with the many dubious characters who arose in Italy during that period. And it certainly doesn't speak of the Red Army in detail. While some of these subjects do acquire passing reference, more authoritative books on them have been written and read.This book comes close to being perfect; even so, it has its vices. Shirer seems to have prejudices against some of the wily characters he writes about, like Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hermann Goering, etc. while some of the other equally scrupulous characters don't seem to invite adjectives as harsh. A more conspicuous drawback is the superficial treatment of the Holocaust. Although scores of pages have been devoted to describe the capture, transport and execution of prisoners, as well as the conditions at the concentration camps, Shirer fails to fully capture the reader's imagination, as he does in other chapters. The author time and again stresses that the topic is vast as well as deep, but in the end fails to narrate as much as was necessary, considering the fact that the Holocaust is the most striking symbol of Nazi flagitism.In spite of these negatives, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich remains an immortal classic. It shall forever be a reminder of the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany, and indeed the causes that led to it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich stands out as one of the best and most complete volumes on Nazi history. While long, it is still very approachable. For anyone who is looking for a starting place in World War Two or Nazi history, this is a good choice. Shirer covers the Nazi era from start to finish. Excellent detail and numerous primary source excerpts are found throughout. Even though it is considerably older than many Nazi history books, it is still relevant and useful. Check it out."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This well-known work from an American journalist present in Germany for some years before the Second World War and author of other famous books, deserves to be read for the sheer volume of the material covered. After reading David Irving's Hitler's War, I came to wonder how much respect writers deserved who were inaccurate or just plain dishonest in their presentation of some or much material regarding Nazi Germany. I specifically refer to his superficial dismissal of Dr. Theo Morell, Hitler's personal physician, as a quack. It was only in reading David Irving that I was able to see Dr. Morell as a conscientious GP who in fact did much more than give his patient pills. He ran EKG's on him and sent them under cover of anonymity to a leading Berlin cardiologist. As for the \\"pills\\" he prescribed, the pharmacological options at the time were severely limited compared to the present. Nazi Germany, its leaders, Adolph Hitler as military figure and the facts about the Second World War are still in need of objective study. There has been a great tendency to present the Nazis as supermen/monsters/clumsy fools without considering how contradictory all this is. IN addition, in the West, material all too often emphasizes Western battles without considering the overwhelming importance of the Russo-German war in the ultimate resolution of the conflict in the European Theater. Read this book, but read beyond it and read more recent studies, even if they challenge long-held conventional \\"wisdom\\"."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Shirer's, \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" is the definitive history of that regime. He takes the reader from Hitler's early years as a waif in Vienna, to his service in the trenches of France in WWI, to the beginnings of the Nazi movement in post WWI Germany, through his ultimate rise to power, and finally to his downfall. Written by a journalist who witnessed firsthand the events he describes and had unrestricted access to volumes of Nazi government documents, Shirer produced the most complete work on that subject ever. His work is as important today as it was when it was first published, perhaps more so.Hitler and his entourage produced a blueprint for dictators that is still being followed. The plan is simple: seize power by any means necessary, then use state assets to effectively control the population. In Germany, the Hitler Youth replaced hearth and home. Schools taught only the Nazi philosophy. The media broadcast the \\"Party\\" line exclusively. Churches? \\"They will preach what we want them to preach,\\" stated Hitler. Bound by these constraints an entire generation did the bidding of their Nazi masters without question. It can happen again, anywhere, including the U.S.A. It's a warning worth heeding. Adolph Hitler is alive and well today!Hitler alive? Yes! He showed up as Josef Stalin in the U.S.S.R., and again as Mao Tse Tung and his \\"Cultural Revolution\\" in China. He appeared as Idi Amin in Uganda, thoughtfully providing his executioners with an unlimited supply of marijuana after dispatching their victims with iron bars. He turned up again as Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, his \\"Concentration Camps\\" now being called, \\"New Economic Zones\\" and \\"Reeducation Centers,\\" and subsequently as Pol Pot in the \\"Killing Fields\\" of Cambodia. He surfaced in the Mid-East as Saddam and his acid baths in Iraq and appears regularly as Hezbollah/ Hammas suicide bombers in Israel. Air travelers constantly fear he will reappear as an Al Quida terrorist working for Osama bin Laden. And let us not forget, almost 50 million people have died in abortion clinics here in the U.S., far more than died at Auschwitz, Treblinka etc. The dictators named simply follow Adolph's plan. And like the democracies of the Nazi Era, we stand idly by while they conduct their nefarious activities. We have no right to criticize the British, the French or even the Germans. We are as guilty as they!Edmund Burk said, \\"The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\\" Shirer has shown the world how dictators operate. Armed with this knowledge, we should be able to prevent despots from rising to power. Clearly, this we have not done. The Allies did nothing until it was almost too late. Armed with Shirer's work and the bitter experience of history, hopefully, we will not continue to be guilty of the same."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I did not realize the version of the book I purchased did not include maps and images but was just plain text."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"A massive book (1200+ pages according to the Amazon information). I got it as a Kindle Daily Deal for $1.99 back in mid Sept and started reading it about the same time. That it took me a month and a half to finish it suggests both its length and that it was good enough to stick to it. I probably read about 10 hours a week.As history goes, it has some issues. The author insists on putting personal commentary into the book, mostly in the form of negative comments about various historical characters. To me this calls his objectivity into question. Having said that, I am not real sure I disagree with most of his opinions on these characters, but I think the book would have been better off without them.One of the things I found somewhat surprising was his seeming shock that the Nazis would have lied so much. They were mass murderers! Why would a few lies matter any? In any case, lying is a routine thing for most politicians and diplomats. Why would it have been any different in the 3rd Reich.I also found his continual suggestions that the army \\"should\\" have deposed Hitler to be a little odd. The German Army had a long history of serving the government in power, much as the US military serves the government of the US. Suggesting somehow they should have broken that allegiance makes me wonder if the author actually understands the difficultly that military men have in breaking the chains of loyalty that is a huge part of who they are. This was not a 4th or 5th world African country where the only history the military knows is one of taking over the country periodically. In any case, it is not clear that throwing the country into the chaos of a civil war would have been something German military leaders would have done lightly. It is also pretty clear from the few attempts that were made that the German military just was not good at this kind of thing, and maybe just never had the capability to do it.But, overall, the issues I had with the book were more than outweighed by a fascinating piece of history."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"While I haven't completed reading this book, as it is covering a long period in history, I find it fascinating to see the insights of how Hitler seized power in Germany in the 30's.

It would take a book to review this book. It's simply a must read for every human being on earth. The book doesn't begin in 1939 or even 1933. This book starts where it should, with the birth of Hitler's grandparents. Shirer takes you through generations then the life of the young man noting key points of Hitler's life that shape his personal evolution into becoming one of the most evil men ever to walk the earth. Shirer's first hand accounts are important as is the meticulous research he did. We owe an enormous debt to Shirer. This is one of my favorite books of all time. Kevin Hogan, ..."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"It can be very difficult to jump in, pick up a random book, and start reading about a subject so large, complex, and contriversial as Nazi Germany. Moreover, the terminology and huge cast of characters can be daunting to a beginner. I read this book as my first introduction to Nazi Germany and highly recommend it to others looking to \\"get their feet wet\\" and obtain a broad overview of Hitler's Germany. Through this book, I was able to obtain a good overview of the chronology of the Third Reich, as well as introductions to the main Nazi players, including obviously Hitler himself, which I was able to use as a spring board to jump into more detailed subjects. In that sense, Shirer's book has been invaluable to me. The other strong point is that Shirer himself lived in Germany during the early of Nazi power and provides a unique prospective of life in Germany after 1933.While I still highly recommend the book, there are some things I think readers should be aware of:1) The book was written in 1960, only 15 years after the end of the regime, and some facts are obviously dated. Much more information has come to light in the past 45 years, especially with the opening of the Soviet archives. However, this is understandable and does not detract from the quality of the book, though I do encourage folks to read some more modern texts.2) I found Shirer to be an obvious homophobe, specifically when discussing Ernst Rohm and the SA. Again, this is understandable given the times, but I did find it annoying.In summary, great book. Every student of Nazi Germany should read it, but shouldn't stop with it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I've had this book in the typical print for years, but never wanting to start something I wouldn't finish,it still sits on the shelf. However, once the audiobook was listed, I grabbed it for my ipod....WOW! The narration is fabulous, which is always the deciding factor for me in an audiobook. A fifty-seven hour masterpiece!!Five stars!!!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I don't see the point of a long review, there are plenty of those here already. Suffice to say that if you have an interest in history, the second world or just a good solid read then this is one of the must have books."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"An excellent breakdown of the events leading up to the darkest period in modern history, and the period of expansion and finally destruction of the Reich."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The book I received was an illustrated version of Shirer's text, condensed by the Readers Digest. It was not as advertised. Anyway, I like the photos. The condensed version is easier to read in short sessions. You need to be careful when you order, otherwise you're in for a surprise."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I found this book to be an excellent information piece of not only Hitler but all of the facts surrounding the Third Reich and a lot of facts about Nazi Germany I have found nowhere else. Its a bit long with a lot of speculation. Make sure you have a lot of time because once I picked it up I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"A well documented, frightening, extremely detailed account of the inner workings of Nazi Germany, this ook is a must-read for anyone studying WWII. It's also useful for compiling a further reading list, since the author cites a dizzying array of other books throughout the text. One note for purchasers of the mass-market sized paperback: put your copy in a book jacket of some sort right away, as the flimsy paper cover is not strong enough to hold the 1500+ pages together!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I had read this book about thirty-five years ago. Since then I have gone through several books on World War II - Churchill's great memoirs volumes, Toland and Fest biographies of Hitler, books on the Nuremberg trials...So I thought that Shirer's book would be a simple re-hash - it wasn't.If I were to be asked to recommend only one book on Nazi Germany this would be it. I was also very moved by the elegance of Shirer's writing. His prose is stirring and makes these cataclysmic events of the twentieth century very vivid.It is all here - Hitler's rise to power in the 1920's, the appeasement of the European powers during the 1930's, the sordidness of the Hitler-Stalin pact and then the war itself with, for a time Britain and Churchill standing alone. Enveloping all this is the hatreds of Hitler and the Nazi party; above their hatred of the Jews and then the Slavic and Russian peoples, their hatred of democratic values (what we would now call human rights), their hatred of the Versailles Treaty.Shirer makes no excuses for these and puts the blame squarely on Hitler and the German people. Versailles was never the humiliation it was made out to be. As Shirer points out this \`stab in the back' myth was also propagated by Weimar as well. Hitler knew how to rally the nationalistic fervor and pagan impulses of the bulk of his people.All the personalities are in here - and they are a powerful and colourful lot - but sad, as both German and non-German acquiesce to the force of the German leader. Chamberlain's fruitless efforts to achieve peace are overlooked today as he is framed with the word appeasement; but what politician today would be as honest as he was. Shirer quotes Chamberlain's honest and touching \`declaration of war' speech when Poland is brutally invaded by Germany -quite possibly one of the most poignant passages in the book as the world is now stepping over the precipice into war.Shirer uses many of Hitler's speeches to illustrate how the German people adored their beloved leader. One is struck by how a people could swallow these words so whole-heartedly - words that are so diametrically opposed to the best values of the Western World. The speeches are filled with hatred for Jews and ridicule for the leaders of the Western World. Hitler's reply to Roosevelt in 1939 before the war - though so successfully manipulative - is haunting in retrospect.There are perhaps a few things left out. One is the destruction of the Polish resistance uprising in Warsaw that Stalin left to the Germans to ruthlessly suppress - with the Russian army just outside Warsaw watching as the Germans slaughtered the Polish resistance movement.And there is maybe too much, I feel, on the Stauffenberg plot to kill Hitler. But again Shirer is correct in pointing out the hypocrisy of these \`anti-Nazi' conspirators who waited too long (Germany was obviously losing the war at this stage and its cities were decimated). Were they not morally inept - were they doing this to seize political power only? Were they really morally repulsed by the Nazi regime - or just mere opportunists?As mentioned if one reads only one book on Nazi Germany this has it all. But as a warning - reading over 1,100 pages on Nazism can wear one down - it becomes very depressing. However you are left with a greater understanding of this tumultuous era."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is one of a kind; a true classic for the ages. Commencing in the 19th Century it sets the philosophical foundation of the Nazi Party, examining the persons who created the ideology. Moving to Hitler's youth, the forces that shaped him are closely reviewed. Shirer then shows the rise of the Nazis as a political force in post World War I Germany, and how this was aided by an overly harsh Armistice treaty, hyperinflation, and a weak government. All of this is covered in what seems to be excruciating detail, but once the reader peruses the easily understandable text, it becomes apparent that a lesser treatment would almost be worse than no examination at all.Shirer then turns to the Nazis' ascent to power, and the years prior to World War II. Masterfully exhibiting a deft touch, Shirer exhaustively traces the consolidation of power, the first anti-Jewish atrocities, and the almost innumerable opportunities the West squandered in failing to stifle Nazism by diplomacy and appeasement, instead of using or threatening use of force. One by one, the Rhineland, Austria, Memel, Czechoslovakia and Spain fell into the Nazi orbit.Shirer's best work, in my opinion, is the discussion concerning the events leading up to the invasion of Poland. Hitler's cynical dealings with the equally cynical Russians are amazingly detailed in this book. A sense of breathless anticipation ensues as the date of the Polish invasion draws near. And finally the war begins.Shirer's treatment of the Second World War is superb. He focuses not so much on specific battles, but weaves them seamlessly into a general narrative of how the various thrusts, including the Balkans, Scandinavia, France, North Africa and Russia proceed from the Reich viewpoint. A fascinating chapter includes Hitler's aborted plan for an English invasion, and what would have been done had it succeeded. Shirer's research is such that he questions the loyalty of the Duke of Windsor, a by-now accepted premise, forty years ahead of its time.As the tide turns against Germany, Shirer veers slightly and presents a magnificent chapter about the Nazi genocides and atrocities, setting forth what was done in grisly detail. This reading is not for the squeamish, but it is necessary to understand what the true nature of the Third Reich was. He then turns back to D-Day and the collapse of Germany, concluding with the bomb plot against Hitler, and his subsequent suicide.One of the better parts of the book is the Epilogue, which covers the Nuremberg trials, and what was adduced by them. This is must reading.This book, and its companion work on the Collapse of France, comprise a rather complete history of Western Europe in the years 1870-1945. Certainly, they are a winter's worth of reading, but you will never find them dull, disappointing, or inaccurate. Shirer's two works are epic in stature, and will be read years from now. There are no photographs, and few maps. Those maps that are presented are very well done. Shirer is to be commended for his herculean effort and his studied objectivity in discussing such a cataclysmic evil.Again, the book is a true classic. I recommend it highly. NEVER LOAN IT OUT TO ANYONE."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Finally, a book on the Third Reich that doesn't focus solely on its persecution of the Jews. This book would be recommended to anyone who didn't live during that period so they realize that the Nazi reign of terror reached much further then one religous group. Mr. Shirer is to be commended."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"In reading the thoughtful and eloquent reviews contained within this site I can't help but think that my review is unnecessary, except to add one more voice of praise to the chorus. &quot;The Rise and Fall of Nazi Germany&quot; is the standard by which any work on the Third Reich needs to measured to. I use measured instead of compared because I highly doubt any other work on the Third Reich will rival it let alone better it.The history of the Third Reich is clearly told in a transparent easy to read prose. Considering the mass amount people and places that Mr. Shirer has to deal with it is surprisingly easy to keep track of who did what, when and where. The book is a gripping, entertaining read and manages to present and the detailed and intricate history of the Third Reich in a clear straight forward manner.Mr.Shirer relies on thousands of captured official German documents, diaries and correspondence of people involved in the events describe to flesh out a very accurate history of the Third Reich. Let me say that since the book was written that there has been additional information that have seen discovered that would expand or modify some of the conclusions reached by the author and thrown a different light on certain facts and events. For example at the time of the writing of this book it was not widely known that Japan had lost a series of clashes against Russia on the Mongolian frontier in 1939. That event would throw a different light on Japan's refusal to declare war on Russia in 1941. Regardless in the majority of instances this book is still extremely accurate.As to its downside I have the same reservation as mentioned by prior reviewers in that M.Shirer time and time again repeats some of his biases and observations. Again as mention by a prior reviewer, c leong73 the sexual orientation of some of the figures that played a major role in Nazi Germany has no bearing weather they were slimeballs or not. There were plenty of heterosexual psycho's running around Germany at that time.At any rate the good points in this book far out weight the flaws. A must read for anyone who want to comprehend this fascinating era in history."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is truly amazing. It should be read by every human being on the planet. An unprecedented historical account about the gangsters of the third reich, their rise to power, the takeover of western europe, and the fall of one of histories darkest and most deceptive aggressors. The only complaint that I can see people having is the author's tendency to express his opinion on the tons of factual evidence presented. This did not bother me, firstly because the author was THERE to witness the rise and the fall of the third reich, which gives literary license to write about what he saw and expirienced, and secondly because his opinions are of a superficial and briefly stated nature. It is a long read, needing a fare amount of contemplation, but certainly worth it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Originally published in 1960, this book still stands as one of the most comprehensive biographies of Adolf Hitler. (It covers all major events of the Nazi Party in general but gives most of the individual attention to Hitler, Goering, Goebbels and any other high leaders of the infamous party.)Perhaps the best part of the book is the first third of the novel in that it contains a narrative of German politics and the actions Hitler used to force control of the government through the Nazi Party. Throughout the book, the author is careful to point out many subtle events in history that could have altered the future of Nazi Germany if not for someone's change of actions. (For instance, Hitler was almost born Adolf Schicklgruber. Would the fascist leader have gained such a following with his &quot;converts&quot; required to shout, &quot;Heil Schicklgruber!&quot; An interesting fact and one of the many that the author has surfaced with his thorough historical novel.)If there is a negative part of this book, it is that the author shares viewpoints of mid-20th century Americans. He frequently cites the problems of Nazi leaders who were &quot;sexually disturbed homosexuals&quot; or &quot;deviant drug addicts.&quot; While many of the party's leaders were definitely not an angel by any stretch of the imagination, the author speaks as someone who lives in his time. In other words, the author implies that a Nazi leader's homosexuality is a source of his sociopathic criminal behavior. While this opinion made sense in 1960, it sounds strange to many 21st century Westerners and fails to give the reader a logical choice on what made these men tick.The author gives us a fair look into Hitler's mind. Sometimes mixed with admiration for his political savvy, horror at his brutal policies, sympathy (in the sense that he has become a pathetic figure) for his last days, amazement at his manipulation - the author takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride through the actions and mind of a world leader that will always be looked at as one of history's most evil figures."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The definitive book on Nazi Germany. Painstakingly written and researched, some of which drawn directly from the author's own experiences. Rating a book is often a subjective matter. In terms of sound judgement and objective method, Shirer has done a remarkable job creating a benchmark historical work on an era few who lived through it would like to remember.- Louis"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I am in the process of reading the book at the present time and as a fan of history (particularly the World Wars and the Civil War)I devour all the facts and information that the author provides. Be cautioned that if you are not interested in the why and the details of how the Nazi party was able to control Germany, this book can be a ponderous read. But, if you want to delve into the mind and the politics of history's most notorious dictator and his cronies, then this book will provide you with much detailed information."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I have to admit that this book is probably the best (and most truthful) book I've read on World War 2.Even though I like the World War 2 parts, the thing that interested me the most was Hitler's rise to complete power.Anyone who wants to read about World War 2 must read this book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I have wanted to read this historical account of WWII for years but was always daunted by its length. I'm glad to have gotten over that psychological hurdle because the book is a quick read, it is engrossing and therefore interesting to read for hours at a time. Shirer did a tremendous amount of research for this project. Moreover, his ability to organize vast amounts of information it truly impressive.The text covers everything from the political, to the military, to the nationalistic, to the anti- Semitic aspects of the Third Reich. While Shirer does not shy from stating his points of view, I thought his incites only added to this work. Shirer was a journalist in Europe during the war and therefore has compelling view and perspectives about the events surrounding the Third Reich. I would highly recommend this book; although, it was written forty years ago very little of the historical information is outdated."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I am a 42 year old italian reader; I am just finishing to read this unique book that I enjoyed very much. I read it because I needed to know an event, WWII, the I have not experienced directly, nor studied at school (in Italy at school History lessons stop at the end of 19th century, nobody knows why...). Of course one thinks to know enough about the biggest war in the world, but this book has provided me such a vivid image of what has happened that i feel extremely thankful to the author and I wish young people could read this book at school."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"We will be doomed to relive the past if we fail to open our eyes to it. Tis book will open your eyes."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"In Germany, the display of Swastikas is &#34;verboten&#34;, however, this book is informative and shines light on one of the very darkest chapters of German history. In German schools, history used to end with the first world war. It took me to immigrate to the U.S. to find this book, where I finally could read what I always wanted to know."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book was first published in 1960 and its relevance to the history of the period has not changed. Many, many do not know nor are they aware of what led to WWII and the deaths of so many millions of people. Even today it is a magnificent read in the hopes that facts and information could prevent it from ever happening again. Being aware of our past, just might make us aware of what so easily may occur in the future."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is a very imformative book, a hard read because it's so detailed, but very informative. I'm enjoying it, anyone that's a history fan should get this book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Rise And Fall Of The Third ReichWell written, historically accurate, and provides key insight into one of the darkest periods of modern history."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"For those who think preventive war is always bad, you should read this book. If there was any argument for preventive war against Hitler, especially before Munich, this is it. Appeasement was useless with Hitler. It only made him stronger and bolder."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"If you only could read and own one history book on Nazi Germany, this would be it. Don't let the 1245 pages daunt you, this is a very well written and readable book on the subject. Shirer was apparently a journalist and started research on the book when he first went to Germany in 1925. He spent 5-1/2 years writing it. The title pretty much explains it, it covers the rise of Adolf Hitler to the eventual fall of Berlin. There are other history books that cover specific aspects of the Nazi's, such as the recommended 2002 publication of Antony Beevor's The Fall of Berlin 1945, but this is the one history book on it all. Considering how the events covered set up the modern world, this should be essential reading for everyone on the planet."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Many people have remarked that Shirer wasn't the most objective observer of the Third Reich. Some reviewers have stated that they would have preferred a volume devoid of personal biases and slanted observations, believing themselves competent to form their own opinions of the characters involved. If you count yourself one of this group, don't read Shirer. Don't read, for that matter, any book written by a human. I am more than content to base my opinions of Nazi leaders on Shirer's observations. He was an incredibly intelligent man in the best position possible for giving us an outsider's view into the otherwise murky world of Nazi Germany. How else do we form conclusions about men and women who died 60 years ago if not by cannibalizing the observations of others? It is impossible for anyone lving today to form an accurate picture of any historical figure without relying on the words of previous observers. Where else but from Shirer could we have learned that Hitler was commonly reffered to as a \\"Teppichfresser\\" ('carpet-eater' - referring to his occaisional fits of rage that ended with him drooling on the floor and knawing at the carpet) by those who disliked him? By the very nature of its author and the circumstances under which it was written, this book will probably never be surpassed in providing a broad, yet incredibly insightful view into the Third Reich."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"One of the Top Ten Books of All Time!! A Triumph!!!Kershaw, eat your heart out, you are an amateur compared to Shirer.Shirer was actually there, during the rise and fall. He is not only a masterful story-teller and highly acclaimed journalist, but a witness to history. Of equal importance: He gets it right!Shirer, in this important book, explains not ony the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, but of Adolf Hitler. All other books on Hitler and Nazi Germany pale in comparison to Shirer's master work, which is truly one of the best books of all time."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I rented this book from the library, and it is definitely one of the most thorough history books I have ever experienced. It covers all aspects of the Third Reich on an extremely detailed and interesting level. The only down side (if you can call it that) is that being 1200 pages long- it takes a long time to read, so plan on having alot of free time before reading. Other then that, it is a very enjoyable book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"By far the most magnificent book I have ever read - something to pass on to our children. We must never forget."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is an informative and well-written history. There is an extensive index and meticulous source information -- making it invaluable to history majors -- but it is not overly pedantic or academic, so anyone can enjoy it. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting an informative overview of the history of Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I have to confess. I am only a freshman in high school. My aspiration is to become a history major, and so I read this book in 5th grade. This is the book that was mostly responsible for making me want to chose this path. Shirer is a genius, and he makes the reader want to learn more about each and every one of the historical characters that he introduces. Truly #1 on my list."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Overall the book is an interesting read, but the author's pro-American bias is abundantly evident. With the benefit of hindsight, the author levels all sorts of accusations on the naivete of the European rulers, as if he and the American leadership were onto Hitler's plans all along.The book also reinforces one of the greatest myths of WWII (especially here in the US) that Hitler was somehow a military and political genius, when in fact, even from the evidence in the book itself it transpires that Hitler was merely a high-stakes gambler that had a spate of lucky events in the beginning of his career.The book's age also helps reveal some of the lack of objectivity from the author when considering members of the Nazi party throughout its existence. It seems Shirer wants to believe that all Nazi party members were caricature movie villains, even trying to go into the minds of these people to analyze their reasons for belonging to a party that was not entirely different from a myriad of others that existed at the time in both sides of the Atlantic. When nothing else can be found against an individual, he calls them \\"homosexuals\\" as if that was a character killer.In sum, it is a coherent chronicle of the events at the time, even if the subjective interpretation given by the author to the reasons and consequences of the events are a bit biased by his own national/religious affiliation."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is invaluable for anyone (including myself) that only know the broad outlines of the rise of Nazi Germany. It is really a monumental work in its own and even more amazing that it was written in an age without the internet or even computerized research. Shirer is writing in an age (barely 10 years after the end of the war) where there was no Holocaust museum, no Holocaust memorial; he doesn't even use the word. In this way, the reader really gets a sense for how the war must have looked to people who lived through it. At a time when Holocaust survivors were on \\"This Is Your Life\\" he conveys a sense of horror that is much more modern than the period in which he wrote.The one criticism, such as it is, is that minor portions are dated. I'm thinking here specifically of his treatment of Ernst Rohm, an early Nazi-party crony of Hitler's and the head of the SA. Rohm, who was a homosexual, was murdered on Hitler's orders during the \\"Night of the Long Knives\\" in 1934. Indirectly, Shirer links Rohm's murderous, gangster-thug mentality to his \\"deviant sexual urges\\"."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book analyses the rise of Hitler and his party, how it went on to become one of the worst in the mankind. Also, it explains how the superpowers stayed away when Hitler was growing like cactus. As George in Seinfeld says \\"You could have put Chamberlin's face in the toilet and he would have given half of the Europe to Hitler\\", this book clearly portrays how Britain was a silent observer when Hitler took over Czech.Very worth reading eventhough the early days of rise of Hitler is being painstakingly explained. I guess it can be comparable to Churchill's work of WWII."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"A must read if you want to know about Nazism and the powerplays of the Nazi stalwarts. Very detailed, very informative and frightening.Too bad the author is dead. He could have updated this book with all the newly released information; especially from the former Soviet Union."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I was very impressed with the book. The author brings a first hand impression of the events leading to the most darkest ages of humanity. Although he was trying to stay subjective he did not and brought his own personal opinion from time to time. Historian is not supposed to do that. On the other hand the author was deeply involved in the event s and it is highly understandable why he acted like that. I thought that I am very familiar with those times, 1900-1945, but the book came and shows me what I was missing and it is a lot. The book opened my eyes to the real reasons for the NAZI party and the German people unimaginable behavior and it was a revelation. The book is very successful of explaining the roots of the German hatred to the Jews and the reasons to the Jews' and others' holocaust."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is meticulously researched with as extensive a bibliography as one would expect for a book which tries to cover in one volume a phenomenon lasting 12 years.The style does not carry the reader. This book is more a history student's companion guide rather than a volume one would pick up for the pleasure of reading. I also found irritatingly large numbers of pages where fly on the wall narration was provided without reference to a source which strained credibility because the author was not present when certain events occured, such as the meeting between Stalin and Ribbentrop in August 1939.This struck me as poor investigative journalism and more than once I wanted to close the book for good because of historical inaccuracies, the first of which really bothered me which was the death of Ewald von Kleist, whom I know was still alive in 1974.** A reader pointed out to me there were in fact 3 Ewald von Kleists active in the Wehrmacht at the time, one of whom was still alive at least until the turn of this century and one of whom, as Shirer points out, was executed in 1945. This point was not made clear in the book, hence the confusion on my part.**For the most part, the narrative fleshes out the bones provided by the the references used in the bibliography quite admirably, but at times the story is weighed down by the author's labouring to provide the detail. He says the book was 25 years in the writing. It has taken me more than 12 months to read the 1000+ pages, largely because the style just doesn't flow as perhaps the style of a Hugh Trevor-Roper flows.The subject matter is fascinating, meticulously researched and extensively annotated, but as historical records go, it seems the composition was not a labour of love for the author and so it is not a labour of love to get through as a reader. I find the faults with this book are what I am remembering most, whereas with other books on this subject, my overall impressions are positive across the entire book.This is not one you're going to read twice from cover to cover."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Quite a good and very thorough account of the time. The problem I have is that he lets his liberal slant show through in his treatment of the non-Nazi political movements of the 1920s. But I am quite impressed with his tracing of the roots of the Nazi ideology, especially in regards of the German philosophers of the 19th century who he readily acknowledges to be the progenitors of both Nazism and Communism (Hegel, Fichte, Kant, Nietzsche, etc.). Very few commentators seem to acknowlege that Fascism and Communism are two sides of the same statist coin, coming from the same philosophical roots."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The work of William Shirer is without a doubt an enormous historical effort, that goes into depths and internals of the Nazi Germany as few other works. It brings to light the multitude of facts, transcripts and first-person perspectives about the Nazi leaders.However, it makes several important omissions. First, it concentrates primarily on the leaders of the Nazi Germany and doesn't research well enough the empire beneath (industrialists, people, antisemitism, foreign relations, etc). It wasn't just a bunch of maniacs who managed to ruin and bled Europe almost to its death. Secondly, the book is unbalanced in its treatment of the Allied and Soviet role in the war. But the most alarming, if not shocking, is the final conclusion the author makes about Germany and German people. Born in Russia, I'm well aware that Soviet and modern Russia, despite the casualties suffered which are orders of magnitude greater than those suffered by the Allies, always stressed that it fought against Nazi Germany and Nazism, and NOT against the German people. Any author's generalizations about German people simply don't agree with the philosophies of the Allied forces, which fought against any racial or ethnic prejudice of Nazism."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"First of all, a lot of people ask me how come I am reading a 1200+ pages book with the tiniest font ever printed on a book! My answer is that, if they ever start reading this book, they will swear by them too!Fantastic recap of Third Reich -- Please note and emphasized -- this is not about Hitler, but it is would the Reich led by Adolf Hitler -- so therefore, there are some chapters dedicated to Hitler's life etc -- but as you read this book in its entirety -- one will understand that (a) portions dedicated to Hitler is not that much, and (b) most importantly, why Hitler did what he did!I must say that I have a completely different perspective about history (not restricted to Germany) but overall (at least during the periods of 19th and 20th century) as to how things have happened, and why some one gets demonized and while some got away with it. Hitler might have done certain things atrocious and was publicized in a negative way in the world to earn hatredness, but there are a number of others who did exactly the same, but never one talks about it -- Wonder why? It is not my justification for anything that Hitler did, but the philosophy of few get noticed and others, however blatant getaway with it, is very intriguing. Worth a research, but am sure will never get published due to political correctness, of course.If you like any shade of history, this is one of the books. History always teach a lot to any one, and as they say history repeats itself, but after reading the book, that history repeats itself not every 200 years, rather every 10 years -- it seems so; not necessarily the similar set of events -- but in terms of people's behaviors.I know this review may not be helpful for many to decide on whether to buy this book or not -- but I somehow wanted to put in a word for my ardent respect for this book and express some of the peripheries of the book, rather than simply write a review of this book. In fact, after reading this book, I am not worthy to write a review on this book!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is one of the greatest works of non-fiction ever written, and well worth the time (in fact it's a quite a fast read). You will be an improved, more well-informed person for reading this book, and perhaps taking some lessons from it. I don't think I'll ever forget it. Powerful. Awesome. Majestic. Shirer was there as a correspondant, and he also spent an extraordinary amount of time reading through the masses of the regime's documentation (German efficiency) that weren't destroyed on its fall, which gives this book an almost impervious sense of truth and accuracy."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is the second highest selling book of all time, outsold only by the Bible. It is rare that a bestseller compares in quality to its number of copies sold, even a Pulitzer Prize winner such as this one, but here it is totally justified. It is also the second greatest book of all time. No one today can claim literacy without having read it, because the story told here is the most important and relevant story of our time.Although William Shirer was not a historian, he was a talented journalist who lived under the regime he described. Shirer utilized a team of researchers and tons of documents and records from and about the Third Reich that has never been equaled, and never will be. We are fortunate that Shirer was a journalist because it enabled him to write a history that is accessible to most readers, not just a limited academic intelligentsia. That is no doubt one reason why it is never boring or tedious.While it remains the undisputed summary history of the Third Reich, it's strongest point is its detailed description of the rise of evil, as opposed to the majority of other accounts that skip that most important part to hurriedly get to the more exciting and action-packed details of the crimes and ultimate collapse of the Reich, such as the many battles fought until the Reich's Waterloo at Stalingrad, the greatest battle ever fought. While these are covered here as well, it is the detailed description of the rise of Hitler and the Nazis that make this work so important and relevant today, because this is the lesson to be learned if a recurrence is to be prevented. It is the surprising account (surprising because it contradicts the common notion of a madman with Svengali-like charisma capturing a nation with his hypnotic power of persuasion. A good story but almost completely untrue) of a political failure transformed by moneyed interests into a political powerhouse. This was true of both the Nazi Party and its most successful and powerful leader. Hitler was not only financed via contributions to his Party by Big Business, but by direct payment from them, i.e., outright bribery. It is a lesson learned too late of the dangers of mixing money and politics.By recounting one nation's tragic subversion by fascism and the resulting horror inflicted on an unsuspecting world, the second greatest book ever written should be required reading for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"No single book can contain in depth accounts of the horrors and evil of the Nazi era, but if I were asked to recommend an entry level book for someone less versed or less interested in history of that period, I would recommend \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\". It does not cover any one subject in overwhelming detail but it covers most important events and people of the era in enough detail to get a clear picture of what went wrong and when, and, if you have a thirst for knowledge, the long list of references is invaluable."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Despite the virtual tsunami of words that have been written about Nazi Germany, its antecedents, and World War II, Rise and Fall of the Third Reick remains a standout in the field, and truly qualifies as a must read for anybody who is seriously interested in this era.Shirer's massive work (1143 pages in the paper edition) is particularly good on the pre-war years and the rise of Hitler and Nazism, when Shirer was for many of those years stationed as a correspondent in Berlin. The book is noticeably thinner on events after the US enters the war, when Shirer departed Berlin. Thus,the years 1942-1944 are covered in somewhat more summary fashion, with most of the attention focused on the major military battles of Europe and North Africa. Shirer also pays relatively short shrift to the Holocaust, which is something of an anomaly, because its full horrors were certainly well established by the time of his writing.The other great strength of Shirer's work is its vividness. As a long-time correspondent in Berlin, Shirer, unlike so many of the subsequent historians who wrote of this period, had direct and personal knowledge of many of the Nazi leaders, and that knowledge informs his writing. Although he makes no secret of his revulsion at all of the Nazi leadership, his particular disdain for Goering, Ribbentrop, and to a lesser extent, Goebbels, shines through clearly. That insight, combined with typical and illustrative repertorial detail, such as the weather at the time, what the local newspapers were reporting about the developments of the day, etc., give Shirer's work an immediacy that other historians simply cannot achieve.Shirer was not an historian by training. Yet, because of its power, and because he was correct in the vast majority of his conclusions, his work stands up admirably against the works of professional historians. If the subsequent passage of time and the opening of the formerly Russian archives have taught us anything, it is how right Shirer was about so many things, writing in the late 1950s. Later historians, such as Richard Evans, have written more analytically, and in more typically scholarly ways, about Nazi Germany, and as I noted, others have had greater access to documents, but Shirer's broad themes have been validated by the test of time.As I have suggested, Shirer's work is not without flaws, but its weaknesses are utterly overwhelmed by its great strenghts. This is a must read for people who want to understand World War II and its pre-history."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is based upon captured German records released after the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945. Thus it is based almost solely on primary sources. If you are looking to write a report or if you just want the essential reference book for Nazi Germany this is what you've been looking for. A combination of a biography of Adolf Hitler and a 12-year history of the authoritarian dictatorship he created, by a journalist renowned for his work as a foreign correspondent, this work will be unequaled for years to come in its scope and its reliability. It's not so hard to believe when you consider its been in print for 46 years.In the beginning, Shirer was branded a \\"German-hater\\" by West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer and he was treated unfairly by contemporary historians because of his lack in the field. But in retrospect, we can clearly see now that he was and is a very respected and gifted author.Shirer went on to write End of a Berlin Diary and numerous other books on history and his work as a journalist, but he is best known for \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\", an unexpected bestseller which catapulted him to literary fame."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Like reviewer Clifford Stanford (May 30, 2006), I too kept this book on my shelf for years before reading it. But unlike other tomes of this size, the size of this book is worth it. For it chronicles everything you want to know about Nazi Germany, and more!The political and military histories are extremely detailed. They are carefully supported by ample references, including many 'secret' 'top secret' and 'most secret' cables. Reading these histories, one is shocked by just how many chances Germany, and then the world, had a chance to stop the horror of the Nazi regime either before it was born, or before it became so powerful and caused such destruction, but failed to do so for what seem to be, in hindsight, reasons that are small minded, if not down right selfish. I was particularly shocked by the cavalier decision of Europe to 'sacrifice' Czechoslovakia for 'the greater peace' and of the Soviet Union's decision to ally with Germany, foolishly thinking it would be safe by doing so from Hitler's greedy wrath. The military histories chronicle the Nazi military machine from its victorious beginnings when it overran country after country to its dramatic losses in the forbiddingly cold Russian winter, where machines literally stopped working (due to frozen fuel and oil) and the soldiers froze to death.But this work contains so much more than just political and military histories.There is a biography of Hitler from his childhood, to his years as a vagabond wandering Austria (where he picked up much of his ideas) to becoming the Nazi warlord of Germany to his suicide in the end. However, Shirer doesn't just give us dry facts, but includes interesting details on his personal life (for example, his relationships with women, including his lover Geli Raubal and wife Eva Braun) and personality (his weird psychological state, often foaming and twitching, etc).There are sections about the German people, detailing how their history, philosophy and culture had shaped them so that they could participate in the creation of such a horrendous regime. In particular, I found sections about Goebbels and how his powerful propaganda machine fooled the Germans into accepting this regime truly frightening. I fear that similar propaganda efforts maybe afoot today, and in the future, we maybe seen as foolish as the Germans for believing in them.There are graphic descriptions of Hitler's horrific treatment of Jews, Poles, Russians and others in concentration camps, including murders, massacres, medical experiments and more. Also described in some detail is how the land of the conquered was plundered by the Germans for raw materials and profit.There are the stories of the resistance in Germany, whose members tragically were slow to move in the beginning. When they did become energized in the end, it was too late. However, resistance fighter Count Von Stauffenberg emerges as one of the few heroes of this book. Stauffenberg was a bright spot in a work that is filled with so many villains, but even more frighteningly, so many more regular people who just wanted to go about their regular lives, and not shake the status quo. This is one reason that I believe that the Nazi regime (and other evil regimes) are able to cause so much damage- we the \`regular people' are unwilling or afraid to face evil in the eye for fear of personal consequences.Apart from his massive research, Shirer had the distinct advantage of actually being present in Germany as a journalist, witnessing some of the events first hand. His personal reactions to events (such as Hitler's speeches) offer a power to this book not found in other histories of the regime.The book could have been strenghened further with additional supporting material. I agree with Clifford Stanford that maps would have been nice, along with pictures. I think a brief timeline, as well as a compendium of the main characters with a brief description of their role would have been helpful for non-historians like me. There were so many characters, many playing a significant role, that it was hard for me to keep track. I would often have to go to the index, and flip back through many, many pages to jog my memory of various characters."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a unique history of Hitler's Germany as seen through the eyes (at least during the first half of its life) of an American journalist in Berlin.The whole book, categorized labouriously into many sections detailing Hitler's youth, his rise to fame, the political machinations that led to his ultimate rise to power are ruthlessly laid out in chilling detail. The first half is especially fascinating for it builds up the tension as Hitler strides from relative obscurity to become the most powerful man in Germany in one stroke and then mercilessly annhilating his political opponents (including those in his own party).The second half of the book deals mainly with the events that led up to the World War II, something that is laid out in great detail (especially the political events in the capitals of Europe). Here, the book becomes more historic in nature (though a lot of quotes are still given).The capitulation of Austria, the bloodless conquest of Czechoslovakia, the fall of Poland are all given thorough examination and a wide treatment.The third half of the book deals with the fall of the Third Reich and here the read becomes terrifying (especially the portion titled \\"The New Order\\"). This part of the book details, in sickening detail, the treatment of the prisoners of war, the Jews and the people in the conquered lands. The butchery and savagery of the Nazis apart, the bestial medical experiments conducted by the Nazis are also detailed here: something that could have been avoided.The book is a hard read and sometimes there are inconsistencies (such as when some events are given extremely detailed importance while others are glossed over).Some of Hitler's closest subordinates are also pictured in lurid detail (some of the funny ones being the corpulence of Goering and the mental incapacity and vanity of Ribbentrop, Hitler's foriegn minister).All in all, an excellent book and a must-read for all those seeking knowledge of the Third Reich and its Supreme Leader, Adolf Hitler."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"With all of the two bit books around today that try to attract readers with wild theories or incorrect information about the Nazis, this book should and does stand as the gold standard by which all the others are measured, and all fall short of. And with good reason. No other book on the Third Reich covers the entire life of Nazism, from the early life and infulences of Aldof Hitler to Goetterdaemmerung in the Berlin bunker to a brief review of Nuremburg and none with such detail. Shirer intended to make his book the only one with all the details of the years of Hitler. He not only covers those years but does so with the massive detail that only he, who covered the Nazis in Berlin from 1925-1941 and also poured over the 400+ tons of German documents for five years while writting his book, could. From the years of 1925-45, Shirer uses both these sources to cover every relavent detail of the period. Shirer tells the story of the Nazis very professionally. While he derides many deserving Nazi leaders, loosing his true jounalistic objectiveness, he presents all the facts without speculating about why the Germans let Hitler take over or offering any other crazy theories. This lets the reader go through the history making his own conclusions instead of interpreting some quack's thoughts on Hitler. The only slight fault of this book is that Shirer depicts Berliners and other Germans as good natured people who were taken advantage of by Hitler and who wanted no part in WWII. Though this is most likely true for some Germans, others, if not most, agreed with Hitler. Shirer probalbly befrended many Berliners during his time there and was hesitant to goup them with Hitler. This minor flaw is not nearly enough to drop this book from a perfect score. If you want a definative, no questions at the end, every last detail history of the Third Reich (as every history enthusiast should) look no further."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I liked this book because it is factual. The author did remarkable research. I would recommend this to anyone who lived through the second world war, or anyone who would NOT want another war."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Everyone should know the mistakes/atrocities of the past so that we know that we should never allow them to be repeated and Shirer illuminates that period with detailed information from diaries, journals and confidentional information preserved in records kept by the Third Reich."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I am not usually a history buff, but Shirer really brought to life the events of WWII Germany - the highs, the lows, and everything in between. Through colorful & descriptive narration, Shirer puts the reader at the scene, to experience the history of Nazi Germany during the time of the war, as if the reader were actually there. The book is thorough, thus the many pages, but it is definitely worth the read!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I read this wonderful account of the ascent and dissolution of Hitler's Germany decades ago. As a much more mature person, I appreciate the immediacy and thoroughness of William Shirer's masterpiece with more admiration. It is easier to hold on the Fire, too!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Not an easy read but a very comprehensive book covering Hitler's youth, rise to power and downfall. The author provides an incredible level of detail. I read it over a 6 month timeframe and enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Instant download to my kindle. Best way to read lengthly books for me. So far the book is interesting and easy to read."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"My husband loved reading this book. He is very interested about the 2nd world war. He had an old copy that he read many years ago and it was falling apart so he was happy I found the book again. The book is well written and informative."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Exhaustive and essential. On every level a fantastic historical record. This is one of those books, like Foote's Civil War History, that is basically all you need to read if you have a passing interest in the overall subject matter. Yes, some new information has come out since its publication, but that hardly takes away from the importance of Shirer's work."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Although many years have passed since this book was first published, it is still a worthwhile read for the historical aspect and the lessons learned."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I first tried to read this in about 1976. When I got to the part about Hitler's \\"Final Solution\\" to the Jewish \\"problem\\", even though I had known about the Holocaust, the way it is told in \\"Rise and Fall...\\" was so vivid, I had to stop. 36 years later I can go on. When you read this, think of the people who say the Holocaust did not happen, and never let them rise to a place of power."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I had put off reading this book being intimidated by the length. I also feared that it would be extremely dry and boring. I'm happy to say that it was neither of those. This is very well researched and very well written. You get a real sense of all the history before during and a little after. It put so much of what I had already read into perspective. If you read nothing else about this time period, read this book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Though this book was written 50 years ago or so, it is still compelling. Written by someone who was there, a trained journalist, who witnessed the rise of Hitler and the Nazis. It is a very personalized account. Though much has been written on this subject, this book is still must reading for anyone who is interested in this pivotal period of time. We still live with some of the results of this war."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I think the highest praise you can give a book is stating that you had a hard time putting it down. That's certainly the case here. Shirer puts you at the scene of some of the most secretive and important meetings between Hitler and his staff, and between Hitler and the leaders of other countries. You get a chance to experience the mind of Hitler, how he operated, and how he treated others. This is possibly my new favorite book. I spent many late nights reading this book and lost sleep because I simply couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Shirer's book on the Third Reich is the ultimate textbook on Hitler's Germany. It follows in detail Hitler's extraordinary rise from the gutters to the most feared, revered and hated man in modern history. It is all embracing - from the Versailles indignities, the war itself, the blitzkrieg of Western Europe, the Battle of the Atlantic, the initial triumphs on the Eastern Front to the total war that that front eventually became, to the horror of the Holocaust. Don't miss this magnificently researched book by an author who lived in Nazi Germany through its early formative and powerful 1930 era. With Hitler's suicide now exactly 55 years ago it remains a timeless study on an era that reshaped the world we now live in. We all said it should never happen again - but it did in Yugoslavia some fifty years later, proving that the human race has a tendency to repeat its history; irrespective of past \\"lessons\\"."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Anyone interested in WWII and Nazi Germany should read this book. I have read few accounts of how the Nazis rose to power in Germany better than the account in this book. The book is long, but reads like a novel. If you want to learn about Nazi Germany, this is the book to read. Don't be afraid of its size. It is worth it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"A completely absorbing study of the characters and events that shaped the Third Reich. Together with the &quot;World At War&quot; video documentary series, this is the most accessible way to study WWII. Perhaps it's only minor weakness is that he didn't have access to all the extra information on technological developments that we do now. He correctly identifies radar as key in the Battle of Britain, but couldn't know how crucial the Enigma codebreakers at Bletchley Park were to the Battles of the Atlantic, North Africa or D-Day. But as a study of the people at the heart of the Reich, it's superb."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Bill Stevenson's critique of this book on Amazon should be ignored. We should remain grateful that one man dedicated so much to write this book. 485 tons of paper he shuffled through. Bill, I'd like to see you do that! Sure the book is written in a cold, sometimes clumsy manner - but the effect is chilling. As a 35 year old I now understand the madness of the German regime and Hitler. The crucial memos and communications have been preserved forever in this book. I felt the holocaust was dealt with in enough detail considering the hugely wide brief the author allowed himself. There are plenty of books on this issue Bill, and I personally didn't feel Shirer was skimming over the most sickening tragedy one can imagine. I have been surprised since reading this book to discover just how many other people have read it. I gave it four stars - with the only fault the 1959 broadsheet writing style. However it is an extremely valuable piece of journalism and the ultimate condemnation of Nazism."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I definitely reccommend the unabridged large paperback as opposed to the mass market paperback- it's easier to read---it's typeset better. There aren't any photographs, so you have to use your imagination."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"A complete and comprehensive book about the rise and fall of German nazism and WW II. The book is my WW II bible; it is very well written; it gives details of WW II from inside the German HQ where decisions were made, and it tells how these decisions were implemented. The book is full of details without beeing boring. An excellent piece of history."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I had the good fortune to spot an old dusty hardback of this volume in my local bookstore. I was at once pleased that I bought it. William Shirer managed to acomplish something very rare in the business of non-fiction: he actually made it an enjoyable read. I sometimes found myself chuckling at the actions of the respective governments. This book reads like a novel, it is superbly written and very entertaining. I regret to say I have not finished it yet, but am on page 678 of 1240. To let the length of the book deter you is a mistake, if you pick it up and read a little at a time, you will breeze through the insightful pages like a swift winter wind. A very throuogh account of the roots, humble beginnings and the eventual downfall of the Third Reich, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; is a masterpiece for anyone remotely curious about this unique era of the Twnetieth Century. Have fun with it, the content more than makes up for the length."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"What is best about this is that the author was there from 1934-1941 and witnessed the Nazis firsthand. It's always the best history from those who were there and SAW. Also the amount of detail is what also makes this a classic and a must read."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is the definitive book on Nazi Germany. Shirer's masterful study covers every single aspect of this period of the world. From the birth of Adolf Hitler to the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials, everything is in this book and no aspect is deemed to small to be dismissed and not included. No study of this time can fully be completed without reference to this book. Perfectly readable and very easy to access for reference, it is the best book this this reader has read on the history of Hitler and his 3rd Reich."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Shirer's book is engrossing and gives the reader the details behind the devils. Although the subject matter is very disturbing in many ways, it also is interesting to review the path to power of the Nazis and their eventual defeat. Reading Shirer's book you feel as if you are looking over Hitler's shoulder as he and his court make decisions that seal the fate of their enemies and their nation. An important lesson for Americans is the fact that the Nazis were able to manipulate the democratic process to their advantage and upon gaining power were then able to consolidate through favors to the military and industry. Although the ending of the story is well-known, the details of life in facist Germany, including narratives about daily life, education, and industry, illustrate the total control Hitler gained as his regime continued. It is chilling to think of what Europe and the world would be today if the Nazis had prevailed. I think the book would be especially interesting to younger generations who have enjoyed the freedoms provided by the Allied victory, but have not had direct experience with the cost."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I have not really gotten into this book yet, due to a malfunctioning Kindle, but it appears to be well researched. Sorry I cannot give a better review at this time."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I had the hope that this would be easier to read than my paper back copy. The problem is in me, not in the electronic version of the book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I have read about a third of the book, and I am amazed at the similarity of the two countries. The US currently and the German nation of the 1930s. It is amazing that the Austrian Corporal could use all the legal means to transfer Germany from a republic to a dictatorship. I can only pray that this history does not repeat itself!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I read this book years ago and had wanted to reread and lo and behold it was the Amazon deal of the day. This is a very well written story of evil. It is scary that this could happen in a civilized world."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"A very interesting read. You learn the details of what led Hitler to what he became, from a young child to the end of his life, as well as the environment in Germany from 1800s to Hitler's reign."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"As a WWII history buff, learning Hitler's early years and build up to his rise within and to the 3rd Reich was made very interesting and sequential by the author."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"When a book has this many positive 4 and 5 star reviews, there's notmuch left to say so I'll just say this. No single book covers both thediplomatic and military aspects of the Third Reich as well as this one.This and the astute personality profiles of the main actors makes thisa key book in any WWII buff's library."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is deservedly a classic. It is reporting, not scholarly analysis, but Shirer was there and reports what he saw."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is probably the best book ever written on the subject of Nazi Germany. Absolutely required for any student of the subject, and highly recommended for any history buff."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I read this book when it was first issued and then loaned it out and it never came back. Was so happy to see that I could buy it for my kindle. It is a good reference book and excellent reading."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"It says a lot about any book to remain in print for forty years, especially historical non-fiction. Historians never rest. New information is always being uncovered. And, unfortunately, facts tend to change with the political winds. Nevertheless, Shirer's work is so comprehensive, fact-based, and readable that no other book has come along to displace it as the best volume on the complete history of Hitler's Germany. There are certainly other great books on the subject, but most deal with only specific aspects, not the full story.Shirer was fated to write this book. He had location, access to the German documents, and training as a journalist. The world benefits from his five-year effort to leave a definitive record of the origins, machinations, and demise of the Third Reich, possibly the scariest and best organized evil empire mankind has ever seen. This complete and accurate record can play an important role in helping prevent future generations from making the same mistakes.Though the 1500-page book is of daunting size, the topic is so amazing, and the text so readable, you hardly notice. What struck me after reading it was that, despite now knowing and understanding the individual parts, I still could not comprehend the whole. How was Hitler able to get such a large number people to behave so badly? It could be 15,000 words, and I still wouldn't know. Therein lies part of Hitler's mystique. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Every home ought to have a bookshelf in the family room where classic, timeless books are kept as homages to reading and learning, and this book is required for that bookshelf. So thorough, so well-written, so engrossing: it is undeniably a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Shirer did a fine job explaining Hitler's origins; for this he deserves full credit. However, the book follows several blind alleys--parts of the story of WWII that are not really relevant 55 years later. Example: Shirer catelogues the multitudinous plots against Hitler that never were carried out. In retrospect, only the 1944 assassination plot had any real significance (by indirectly leading to Rommel's death, among other things).My advice to everyone is to read this book, but when Shirer starts diverging from the main topic, to just flip through those pages."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I've read with dismay some of the reviews on Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. The first time I read this book, I sat down and read it cover to cover in one reading. It is not too long. Then, when I finished it, I turned around and read it in depth again, comparing it point by point to other histories I've read with their different points of view. I have since read it several times along with Manchester's books about Winston Churchill and Churchill's 6 volume personal account of the war from his perspective, to name a few favorites.This book is a personal account of the rise of Nazi Germany as Shirer witnessed it. It is what he saw at the time. You don't have to like it, but it is fascinating. There are not alot of battles in it. It concerns the politics of the country, how such a man as Hitler could rise to power, what he did when he grasped that power, and how he self destructed, nearly razing the country and a whole generation in the process.This book detals how Hitler controlled the people by controlling their information, the experiments done in the concentration camps and details on how he shaped the minds of the youth through Germany's public education. It is enlightening and applicable to things in the world today.The book's approach is from that of a journalist. That's what Shirer was. He was in Germany while it was happening. Furthermore, before the captured records were shipped back to Germany, he was granted free access to them. He used them to further document his book. Read the preface and afterword.This book requires a little education to appreciate. Some wisdom and life lessons, ie., maturity, will help make it more understandable.I highly reccommend it.My wife wrote this review using my Amazon account. I am in the process of reading the book and endorse every word of the review based on what I have read thus far."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I must confess that this can be a debilitating and exhausting work to read, especially when one must plow through the section detailing the Nazi atrocities; considering the amount of literature published on the Holocaust since the 1970s people today will not find much new here, anyway (and there is not as much information on the Holocaust as there is on the attempt on Hitler's life). Shirer has his prejudices, including the anachronistic charge of homosexuality (or \\"perversion\\") leveled against Nazi leaders - a charge not unjustified in certain cases, but myopic in light of the Nazis' persecution of homosexuals. He is annoyingly simplistic in his characterizations of the most famous Nazi leaders (they are evil, and therefore unappealing, ineffectual, and unattractive - my goodness, how could such losers captivate a nation? Had they no magnetism, no charm?), and certainly there are omissions in his account of how Hitler rose to power (Britain's and even the United States' relationship with Nazi Germany was complex but is given short shrift), but overall this is an excellent resource on the subject, the first definitive history of this era, comprehensive (although flawed), and a literary classic in its own right."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"One subject that seems to produce countless new books every year, is the Second World War, yet some 40 odd years ago one of the, if not the, most authorative accounts of the war and it's circumstances were written by mr Shirer. He draws on the best sourcematerial there is, personal diaries of the German generals, interviews, whitebooks and such, and delivers a truly interesting tale of a Germany rising from the Great War en route to an even greater one. He writes it in a fresh, journalistic style, which, dispite it's bulk, makes it an easy and enjoyable read. The force of this volume is really in it's detail. It covers a lot of ground and thus presents and explains a lot of the background for second world war (which is sadly lacking in many other books) and lays a solid foundation for further reading. Mr. Shirer stays resonably objective throughout the book, although he at times slips in his own opinion (eg when he calls G&ouml;bbels an idiot).As can be seen from the post script, mr Shirer is clearly biased against Germany, even to this day (he mentions \\"the German problem\\" anno 1991) and seems to think, that another war with Germany is inevitable. Luckily this dosen't shine through in the main text.This is a great work and is worth of all the praise it has received. It belongs on any and all bookshelves around the world as it, in my eyes, is one of the best books on the Thousand Year Reich readily available today. If you want to know about WWII this is a good place to start. Highly recommendable."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"It is exceedingly difficult to put the excellence of this book into a review. I have read many books, this is the very best. For contemporary, documented history, RAFOTTR is the greatest story every told. To call a 1200 page, densely written book a quick read it hard to do, but it is.The sheer humanity of this work is what makes it so special. The reader is taken back to 1920's Austria. Imagine Hitler, a vagabond former corporal, with no direction or prospects in life, who was a failure at his only dream (painting), discovering his calling in life. You follow Hitler from these depths to the heights of \\"most powerful man in the world\\", a megalomaniac drunk on power, who falls to the absolute depths as quickly as he rose.As you are reading this book you have to constantly remind yourself that it is nonfiction, that this spectacle really happened and in the not too distant past. I recommend this book to anybody that can read."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I am a beginner in WWII history and knowledge. I picked this book up to do some research for a paper. After reading pieces of it for research I decided to read it in its entirity at the moment. It defintely has done on thing, it has increased my interest in Nazi German history. The way it is written it makes it readable opposed to dry like a text book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"having read this book, you really feel you have the a-z on the unfolding of this unforgettable chapter in history. Hitler's eveilmachinations leading up to the war are particularly enthralling."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I have been studying WWII for over 40 years and this is one of the books I have used for years. It is an excellent work by someone who was there at the beginning and reported on the whole thing.He heard and saw Hitler and his henchmen and writes about what he saw. He may be a little slanted in his work, but how could he not be, when he saw the outcome of that disastrous time.Don't expect to read it quickly, you wont. But is is worth the time."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This tome is the horse's mouth for getting inside the Nazi regime. Shirer was there, it is as simple as that. Although, as others have complained the history is too turgid with facts, I found myself skipping over many of the drier parts to vignettes of Hitler himself, and Himmler Goebbels and Goering and Mussolini and the incomparably brave Rommel. I shuddered. The insane fanaticism of Goebbels and his wife who had their six children, who had just before been playing in the bunker, destroyed by lethal injection belies credulity. How COULD they murder their own children? Mussolini's more or less grovelling before Hitler gave me the creeps and I sweat through the various plots to assassinated Hitler. In a famous case, the briefcase containing the bomb was kicked inadvertantly from its place right next to Hitler's feet by a staff member who had no idea a bomb was in it. Hitler thus escaped being blown up by a hair. Eva Braun's character is woven throughout the book. Not very intelligent but described as very, very nice, she languished for twelve years as Hitler's mistress and rather like an obedient dog determined to die with him without fuss or without fanfare. Hitler did not love her.There are descriptions of Hitler in the bunker when his face would turn red with rage, the blood vessels in his forehead could be seen pulsating, his hands would shake, one leg would shake, he would practically scream out his vituperation. I got this horrible impression of a puppet on a string being controlled by demons.The macabre wedding breakfast in the bunker replete with champagne after Hitler marries Eva almost belies belief.I can see the group probably looking at their shoes, smiles that were grimaces plastered on their faces, having to listen as Hitler ranted on and on.The man who destroyed his own country ended his long soliloquy by saying he wished there was peace again so he could go to the opera or other pleasures.Don't let the length of \\"Rise and Fall\\" deter you. This book is a masterpiece.I didn't read it all but the characters who played on this monstrous Third Reich stage and who are revealed in the book, will make me cringe forever and wonder how mankind could be so evil."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Considering the subject matter this was never going to be an easy book to read but would it be factual, objective and well-written?Well, factual certainly: the great number of records and archives that became available after the war has made it possible for historians to have a much clearer picture of this period of history than they have had of possibly any other event previously.Objective? Shirer was a correspondent living in Germany during the war and he openly admits that there are some aspects of the book that are more to do with subjective opinion than objective fact. Nonetheless, any recounting of an historical event is based on whatever documentation you can find (which may or may not be embellished, falsified, inaccurate), photographs, memorabilia and always, in some part, word of mouth accounts.Well written? As a correspondent Shirer was a career wordsmith and he does write eloquently. When I initially began reading the book, it did seem to jump around a little but I quickly became accustomed to Shirer's style. His sudden leaps ahead from, for example, pre-war events to conclusions drawn as a result of Nuremburg trials did have a logic. So many things were covered in this book that an entirely chronological record would have been extremely difficult to follow.World War II is a period of history that all of us must have some knowledge about, no matter how perfunctory. As it happens, this is a period of history that I read extensively about a few years ago and I felt sure that The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich would simply retell facts I already knew, rather than add anything additional to my knowledge.I was, of course, wrong. This book ran for 45 hours (I listened to the audio version) and a great many things were new to me. William Shirer's first hand observations of Hitler and his formidable rages, the rumours Shirer picked up from correspondents, the events he was privy to as a member of the press: these are all things that are unique to his story. This is a factual chronicle of events that led to Hitler's rise to power and the subsequent political events that led to the war but it also serves as a memoir of a foreign correspondent's time living in and reporting from a country at war.I found the political aspects of the story easier than the military aspects. Shirer does discuss military movements with some considerable detail, which I found difficult to follow at times and as a result I struggled to remain engaged. However, his telling of political events was utterly beyond reproach. He paints a conflicting picture of Hitler, which fits so completely with the fact that Hitler was a very conflicted man with a very conflicting persona. Charismatic one moment and raging blindly the next, he was beloved to his people, feared by his peers, abhorred by his enemies.Shirer bravely states what many of us would feel unable to utter: Hitler was a remarkable politician and tactician. It was these traits that made him such a formidable opponent and made his regime so frightening. When you place someone utterly brilliant in such a position of power, it is the recipe for disaster and Shirer witnessed this first-hand.There are some who have disagreed with Shirer's assessment of events or the way in which he perceived things that were occurring around him but I have read few chronicles that can rival this for the sheer amount of detail. Any book about this period of history will be difficult to write and difficult to read but this is an excellent effort from Shirer to document a horrific period of history."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Reading this book, it is easy to draw relevant parallels between the events that led to the rise of Nazi power and current political activity in America. It is frightening reading for anyone open enough to understand that history DOES repeat itself. This book should be required reading for any high school graduate, and especially anyone running for or holding a political office."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is a history book that reads like a novel. 1100 pages? I found myself re-reading sections and when I reached the last 200 pages or so, I found myself stalling, like an amazingly gripping novel which the reader wants to avoid the unpleasantness of it ending, though wanting the sweet satisfaction of completion. Shirer's work is one of the finest historical account balanced between massive research and eminent literary value. This should be mandatory reading for high school or college.Reviewers here have said it all; there is little needing to be said. However, when Shirer writes about Hitler's negotiating with foreign leaders, it is as if the reader has been invited to the meeting, and are witnesses to the deception that was Hitler.Shirer also does a good job of portraying Hitler; not always the genius, nor always the street demagogue, she allows us to see how, at times, Hitler bantered back and forth between both roles, and how the frustrated 'b' artist's early childhood abuse led to both cruelty and insecurity. ***** Star research ***** Star interest ***** Star literary value. I struggled to put this book down, night after night."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Given the genius of the German people, it's amazing that Hitler rose to power. What struck me most was this: the great generals, from the old school, were attempting to conduct warfare as soldiers, whereas Hitler and his henchmen were butchers. I'm not going into an in depth review, but Shirer was there, and writes from first hand knowledge and good documentation. The reading is gripping: in the final analysis, those generals who wanted to end the war were executed as traitors. If you want authentic reading, this is it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is a great review of Hitler's early life, what shaped his ideology, how he rose to power, and how he eventually fell. It's also a good start on what was going on in Germany in the 20's and 30's that allowed Hitler to take power. Gives a great view of the calculating nature of Hitler that pushed him to become the most powerful man in the world while also giving insight into the complete insanity of Hitler that caused his downfall. Shirer does a great job of showing the people around him that helped him to power. He also dives into great detail about those who could have, and should have, easily stopped him but waited until it was too late.The only reason I give this 4 stars is for the lack of maps, as one reviewer already stated. I would actually give it 4.5 stars, but it's not possible. I would advise having a map of 1939 Europe available while you read this book. I would also advise finding a list of all of the German generals and Nazi figureheads (or at least have google ready) with a brief biography about each. Shirer talks about so many people that it is hard to keep up unless you're a historian.This should be mandatory reading for high school history classes. Everyone should know what horrible things happened as to open their eyes so it does not happen again. Not spoon fed in 10 pages of a so-called history textbook. I would say that at least 95% of high school kids really have no idea what actually cuased WWII. I cringed when reading this book thinking about a half dozen places where similar situations are currently going on. How long until we are forced to relive history?"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I read this important book, here in Brazil.This book was published about 50 years ago.And even so, this book remains important.There are failures in this book.One is that about the war itself, it is just regular.Many things revealed, after the publication of this book, such as the breaking of Enigma code machine, has no space in this book.The author saw the fall of France in 1940; he realized that France fell because of lack of will to fight, not weapons.Even so, he is weak about France's fall, because only more a decade later, the people could to know that France had more and better tanks, than Germany in 1940. About the massive amount of money from then Soviet Union and from famous germans, such as Paul Warburg to the nazi party also has no place on this book.The book itself is a little more than regular, but there's a good thing about the author:he lived the Third Reich and the war.He was there.William L. Shirer saw the facts.There's better options about the Third Reich, than this book?Yes, but this book remains important, after 50 years."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer's book, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, is an extremely detailed and accurate acount of the rise of Hitler and Nazism, and the early fall of the supposed Thousand Year Reich. Shirer goes into great depth of Hitler's rise to power in Germany through the NSDAP(Nationalist Socialist German Workers Party). He doesn't go into vast details of the actual battles, and war, however he does give enough that I learned alot of new facts. But he goes into more detail of Hitler, and the diplomacy of other countries with him in the pre-war and throughout the war years also. Because I am only 13 years old, it did take me a couple weeks to actually read the whole book, but it was a great expeirence for me, and I would recommend this book to anyone who has enough time to read a 1,200 page book, and is interested in Nazism and WWII. I would also recommend Mein Kampf, by Adolf Hitler, which was a very hard book, but I gained great insight on the mind of Hitler by reading it."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Superb work by William L. Shirer. Although it is a long book, I have read it many times. WW2 is an immence subject. Shirer focuses on Hitler, his reich, his country, his policies, his evolution. This is first hand storytelling; Shirer was there. Altogether great history. Technically and by organization, it is well constructed, but goes far beyond mere expertise. The tale of human history and human nature is profound. One becomes a fly on the wall as witness to unbelievable extremes of human conduct on a monumental scale; cowardice, heroism, deception, stupidity, indifference, hatred, struggle, brutality, and more. The focal point is the contradictory and confounding evil genius of Hitler; simultaneously fascinating and repulsive."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I probably have read this book a hundred times, and will keep reading it until it falls apart. Shirers writing has a quality about it that makes the complex very clear, and takes dull facts and transforms them into fascinating reading. Shirer provides insights and descriptions that only a man who saw it with his own eyes could, and the result is that the book is not only an excellent coverage of the war, but it also touches on the individuals who played key roles during this time in history. This book is not always perfectly objective, but the historical account is accurate and among the best I've read. It can also be very funny, and with its outstanding collection of photos it is a very educational and entertaining piece of literature. I've been recommending this book to readers for years, and not one person has been disappointed yet."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book is both a classic and as grippingly readable as anythriller, though unfortunately not a work of fiction. I first readit when I was a teenager and have re-read it several times since then, my enjoyment actually increasing with every new read. One problem with this particular edition is that the binding quickly comes apart. The new epilogue (written just after the Berlin wall fell) is a must-read though. I love this book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William L. Shirer brings to light, with marked detail, one of the darkest periods in world history. His use of captured German documents and secret communiques between the leaders of Nazi Germany opens ones eyes to evil that pervaded the Third Reich. Anyone who calls themselves a World War II historian or enthusiast NEEDS to read this book. I know far more now that I have read it. Without Mr. Shirer and his dedication to a topic that was contained within volumns of paperwork a much needed work of history would have gone aside."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is by far the best , as well as most informative book ever written on Russia and Germany during the Third Reich. Shirer is a genius. The book was long and sometimes the reading seemed tedious, but the knowledge that I GAINED was amazing. I was actually able to remember many facts that were present in the book, unlike in any of the other books that I have read. My favorite section in the book would have to have been THE NEW ORDER. Though it was on the gruesome topic of the concentration camps it was so flowing and descriptive that I felt the hurt. It wasn't presented as a bunch of facts on a page but was written out to tell the true horror. Mr. Shirer's research was so extensive and painstaking, but in the end his result was far more superior than any other book ever written. I would like to end my statements by saying that THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH will forever touch me, and Mr. Shirer's work shall never be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer was a journalist who lived in Berlin during the '30s and '40s and saw first-hand the horrors and the allure of the German Nationalist Socialist party. Based upon his own personal experiences and a large number of official German documents captured in the war, he has written _the_ history of the era. It covers the history of the Nazi party from the birth of Hitler, all the way to the bitter and shattering defeat in 1945.The writing is superb and the story he tells is both compelling and horrifying. If you must buy one book on the 3rd Reich then this is the one. A classic."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"First I want to point out the negatives I see in Shirer's work. Shirer wrote the book over five decades ago, and this in and of itself, makes the book less reliable in some areas of study. It has the obvious flaw of not having the time nor the resources now available to write a book from a well-balanced and documented viewpoint. There is also the weakness in the fact that Shirer was a journalist and not an historian. This fact is really negligible given the fact that history is written by people who observe and write about events. Saying he was unqualified to write history is like saying that Anne Frank was not qualified to write about the experiences reflecting all Jewish families during the Holocaust. Her experience may be characteristic of most, maybe even all Jewish families; however, this means nothing to relevance of her story. Shirer also has the flaw of verbosity, which is a major reason why it lasts 1100 plus pages. Finally, the Kindle version does need work with commas, periods, etc.. This is not Shirer's fault. He has been dead since 1993, long before the Kindle or its version was in existence. That issue should be taken up with Amazon and not used to rate his work.The book stands alone as a classic among the works that attempt to explain what went drastically wrong with Germany and its Third Reich. Even with the flaws mentioned, he makes a grand attempt to bring to life some of the key events and ideas that created Hitler and Nazi Germany. Most of his facts are dead on, and the work has the benefit of reflecting attitudes and dispositions of those who were on the \\"winning\\" side of WWII. The study of history is not for the faint of heart. To be successful at the endeavor requires reading primary and secondary sources that sometimes are excellent due to the fact that it is \\"less than perfect.\\" The field is a critical thinking field that forces its true students to hash through information that is sometimes long, tedious, and sometimes misguided. Shirer's book contains all of these. One of the greatest uses of the book is the window that it provides into the past, not just the past of the Nazis, but the time that it was written in and its audience.I was first assigned this book in college. It was the longest book I had ever read at that point on any single topic, and I was petrified. However, I tackled it, suffered through some of it, and then found it fascinating. I have a real problem with students who write about the book saying it is boring or even asserting that their requirement to read the book should somehow critically apply because they think they deserve to \\"have a life.\\" I am sure the people who experienced the Third Reich felt that they were worthy of having a life as well. I believe that both Nazi and those who were persecuted would stand amazed at the fact that we live in a \\"free world\\" where people believe that history (or any academic study) should be based on entertainment quality and brevity. The book is dated in its language, but can be read by anyone with a middle grades education (or should be). I am not dismayed by the fact that you do not understand what you are reading because that is simply a reflection of what our schools have allowed in an age of \\"make 'em successful and not necessarily educated.\\" If you fall into this category as a student and do not wish to push through and learn to deal with a challenge, I suggest you explain to your parents that their desire for you to become a well-round liberal arts student is not for you and pursue an endeavor that is more suited to your motivation and interests. Our colleges today are graduating far more non-thinking imbeciles than we can ever hope to gainfully employ. There are fields that need you and will pay you well without torturing you or taking advantage of your right to have a life. The schools may be promising you an A but academia does not grade quality on a 4.0 scale or your ranking in the graduating class."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"An epic historical masterpiece. William L. Shirer delivers an exhaustive account of the Third Reich that even to this day has been surpassed by none."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"A very wise man once said if we did not learn our lessons from history, then we are destined to repeat it. When I bought this book I was looking for parallels from history to these current economic times. Although we are supposedly more enlightened,which I am doubtful, we are facing perilous fractures in the economic wall of conformity. The object of a global ecomony was to create a parity in monetary systems (theoretical). We need to reel-in our theories and repair the breeches in light of history. Hitler was rebellious, yet he honed his powerful rhetoric in the slum hostels of Vienna. He nationlized everything once he became the ruling authority. There comes a time when looking back on the fiercest dictator in the 20th century can be a valuable tool. More people need to investigate his method and come to some chilling conclusions."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I have owned this volume since it was originlly published. It has a place of honor in my personal library. My recent purchase was a Christmas gift for an adult son who requested it. This volume, at over 1200 pages, is not for the person with a casual interest in American and World history. For the history buff, it is a fascinating tale of how a relatively small group of thugs hijacked a country and, in a few short years, 1933 to 1945, brought that country to ruin. It stands as an important cautionary tale for the United States today as it has to deal with thugocracys around the world. William Shirer was not an academic who researched ancient writings of other authors to produce his book. He was a reporter who lived in Germany after World War I and watched the events unfold from inside the country. The writing is authentic. The tale told is gripping. For the serious history buff, I can only say that it is worth the time to read every page. After you have read it, you will want to pick it up again, from time to time, to remind yourself how important it is to pay attention to what YOUR politicians are doing and to RAISE HELL when they are not truly representing the people."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I consider myself a fan of good history books yet I am no PhD in history or anything like that. Quite simply, this it one of the best history books I have ever read. It is all-encompassing in that is completely explains the 3rd Reich from its inception to his death. Every detail is there including Hitler's childhood, coming of age, the War, the death camps, all of it. Yet despite this broad scope, the novel is a remarkably easy read. The prose rarely bogs down in technical details. The Nazi regime comes to life. And most chapters are literally page-turners since it is so heart-wrenching to watch as the world tries to cope with Hitler, failing to realize what a evil maniac he truly is. If you like history books yet dread dry, technical prose as I do, this is the book for you. I was truly sad when I finished it and will liklely read it many times again."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"At well over a thousand pages, one might wonder how \\"readable\\" such a history could be, but Shirer's work is excellent. I won't repeat much of the acclaim already found here.One stumbling block is that in a very few places the terminology is outdated, and most certainly not politically correct. For example, the homosexual leadership of the SA are described as \\"perverted\\" and \\"deviant\\", and its hard to say from the book whether they truly were or if this is just a 1950s label for gay. Similarly, the Japanese turned down negotiations with \\"Ah, so sorry, please\\". I doubt that's a direct quote.Those two snags aside, the rest of the book holds up exceedingly well, and there are actually very few references that are lost on the modern reader, especially compared to the writings of, for example, Churchill, which are full of references to then-current names and events that have lost their relevance over time.The thesis that the readiness to accept National Socialism was built into German culture and mythology of the day may not be a popular one, nor commonly accepted today, but Shirer provides enough supporting material that one can at least see his point.Be prepared for a lot of detail: D-Day doesn't occur until well past page 1000, for example. One thing I loved however was that the book was not full of throwaway names that appear only once. That's usually an issue for me (names and dates that will be forgotten soon after reading) and this book is largely absent of them.It's also relatively even, in that there are very few places where it drags. With few exceptions, the narrative progresses smoothly and its as much of a \\"page turner\\" as non-fiction can be."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"When this book was first published in 1959/60 I was still in High School. Why would I want to read a book about an idology and people that had spread so much hate and who had been defeated?Time passes and while I had seen just about every documentary on Germany that explained that time period, current events have made me question much about the rise of Hitler. I thought I \\"knew\\" all I needed to know about the subject. I was so very wrong. Shirer's well researched and documented material is worth the time, effort and thoughtful reflection about the events of post WWI Germany and the fertile bed of self-interests that fueled the rise of a man like Hitler.Hitler writes in Mein Kampf that his only \\"real talent\\" was to give good speeches. He drew from others the base for his ideas and brewed them in the broth of anti-Semitism. He selected thugs, perverts, sadists and pimps to be in his \\"inner circle\\". Whenever he was challanged by others, he would enter into triades that silenced those who opossed him,or disgraced them, or eliminated them out-right. His total control of the German people and the policies he put into place was seen \\"as the right thing to do.\\" Sound familiar?Pages 61 and 62 strikes a very haunting cord. I strongly urge everyone to read those two pages about the distruction of the German economy from 1921 through 1923....read it slowly and think about it in depth.All in all, this is a work that puts truth to the phrase...\\"Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\\"It is a long (1143 pages without the notes 1245 with references) missive but take your time.

Even several decades after hitler attempted to destroy the world, this publication provides the best assessment of the face of tyranny. We can, and must, assess current events using Shirer's definitive assessment of exactly how hitler climbed into the seat of power. We must use this as a guide to help future generations take on - and defeat - future attempts by evil when it raises its ugly head. We must still look this history in the eye and use it to prevent another outgrowth of tyranny when it comes - and it WILL come again..."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I'll keep this short.I've read a lot of histories of the second world war, but this one I found the most interesting. It covers the entire war, including the build-up, from a unique perspective, that of an American journalist and war correspondent (later a historian) who experienced the rise of the Reich and the first half of the war first hand. He saw and reported on Hitler's speeches, he was there when the French signed their armistice, he saw in person men like Goering and Goebbels. It's a fascinating read.It's also extremely well researched, with one important caveat. You have to remember how long ago the book was written, some fifty years ago. Much of what we now know is based on evidence that was not then available, so sometimes he'll conecture things, for example, that we now know the truth of. A good example is his description of Johan Elser, a man who attempted to assassinate Hitler in '39, and of the attempt itself. Suffice to say, his speculation is very different from what's generally reported today. There are also some occasional anachronistic biases, like his listing of the homosexuality of certain top Nazis as though it were one of their 'perversion'. Different times, I suppose, but still uncomfortable to read.There's one last problem, the conversion to E-book format. For one, this is not the fiftieth anniversary edition, with the new introduction by Ron Rosenbaum (I'd dearly like to read that, ah well). Worse, though, is the sloppy transcription. It seems like the book was scanned into digital format without even so much as running a simple spell-check afterwards. You'll see 'words' like \\"uves\\", a misreading of \\"lives\\" by the scanner. You'll find end-of-chapter notes occasionally not linked, and if one of those asterisks is on the end of the same sentence as a footnote number, the links merge into one that only goes to the footnote. It's not formatted properly. Long quotations are sometimes not indented, or sections of text by the author ARE indented when in the middle of two quotes, so you have to be careful sometimes to keep track of who's talking, author or source.All of this is unfortunate, but what really matters, the content of the book, is stellar, and well worth putting up with the issues. You might want to pick up the new edition in book form, but I don't shy away from recommending the Kindle version if that's what you're looking for.I guess I wasn't as concise as I meant to be!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The Rise and Fall of the Third ReichBy William L. ShirerBook ReviewBy Richard E. NobleWith \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" Mr. Shirer achieved the dream of every writer. He wrote himself into immortality. This is one of those great books that will never die. As long as there are people, this book will be read.I purposely postponed the reading of this work until I finished writing my book \\"Mein Kampf - Analysis of Book One\\"Mein Kampf - Analysis of Book Onebecause I feared that my work would be unduly influenced by Mr. Shirer's work. After reading \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" by W.L. Shirer I feel I made the correct decision.I was pleased to find that many of the quotes selected by Mr. Shirer from Adolf Hitler's autobiography \\"Mein Kampf\\" were also selected by me as being important and worthy of additional analysis.Mr. Shirer's book is exactly what the title states it to be. It is a detailed and well documented study of the rise and then the fall of the Third Reich.This book is over 1100 pages long. To write a thorough review would be impossible. So let me simply highlight a few of the things that I learned or found interesting.One thing that has always been a curiosity to me was why Germany (Adolf Hitler) declared war on the United States after the bombing of Peal Harbor on December 7, 1941. If he had kept his mouth shut he would have had the U.S. occupied in the Pacific while he could have concentrated on his war in Europe. From my reading of the times, it would have been difficult for Roosevelt to win the American people over to an attack on Hitler's Germany in Europe when we had Japan who just attacked us in the Pacific.I was told that this was mandatory because Germany and Japan had an alliance.This was true; Germany and Japan did have an alliance. But this agreement was only called into play if either Germany or Japan were attacked by another nation. The alliance did not come into effect if Germany or Japan were the aggressor and attacked another nation.This is why Japan did not come to Germany's aid in its struggle with Russia. Germany requested Japan's support in this cause several times but to no avail. Germany had attacked Russia. Russia did not attack Germany. Therefore Japan had no mandate to come to Germany's aid. And Japan never did assist Germany in this effort.Japan then attacked the United States. Germany had no treaty obligation to declare war against the U.S. but nevertheless it did. Why?If Germany had not declared war against the U.S. it would then have been up to Roosevelt to declare war against Germany after we had just been attacked by Japan.I think with all the pro-German sentiment in the U.S. at that time, such a declaration would have been difficult for President Roosevelt to get past the legislature. In which case the U.S. would have been distracted from its efforts in Europe and forced to concentrate in the Pacific on Japan.Once again it seems that Hitler had gravely underestimated the capacity and spirit of his enemies. It seems that Adolf felt the U.S. to be a paper lion and not ready or capable to form any great war effort. He made the same mistake with the British and then again with the Russians. I suppose it could be said that he overestimated Germany's abilities rather than underestimated his enemies but either way, he was gravely mistaken in his projections.Mr. Shirer's book also corroborates my notion that one of Adolf's greatest attributes was his ability to dull the compassionate instincts of an entire nation of people.Unfortunately we have a similar circumstance happening at this time in our own country.Hitler used patriotism, national pride, the German flag, military prowess and strong appeals to individualism and selfishness to immunize the German people. One can only hope that these tactics which are being pushed relentlessly here and now in our own country by right wing extremists will not be as effective here in the U.S. as they were in Nazi Germany.I also feel supported by Mr. Shirer in my bias that the Nuremberg Trials were not the great success that they have been portrayed to be historically. Even Alfried Krupp was let off the hook. As I now know, from other reading, many American businesses who aided, supported, and profited from dealing with Nazi Germany during the war were able to skirt prosecution and investigation via the attention and publicity provided by this event.Mr. Shirer also puts to rest for me the notion or excuse that \\"people\\" were not aware of the slaughterhouses and extermination camps. Somehow Hitler was able to keep it all a secret from everybody, we are so often told.Well it seems to have been far from any secret. People who lived around the extermination camps were constantly complaining to the local authorities about the \\"burning flesh smell\\" emanating from the camps. The public bids from construction companies, with their detailed drawings and explicit instructions and suggestions on clever, new machinery and methods on how to kill the most people and remove any \\"waste material\\" and dead bodies at the cheapest cost are ridiculously blatant.These detailed bids should also be put on display in all nations around the world and specifically to any \\"free market\\" capitalists who are presently advocating the moral integrity and the notion of \\"self-policing\\" by banks, insurance companies, the stock market and the so called free market system in general.I also thought it interesting to note in this era of \\"body art\\" that tattooed skin was a first priority for those purchasing or collecting \\"human skin\\" furniture and lampshades for their homes and apartments.I could go on and on, chapter by chapter, making comments and pointing out interesting references but better to suggest that if this subject interests you, your time will not be wasted here. This is one of those monumental works that should be and I am sure will be read for years and years by students, historians and all those interested in what we can only hope will be our last ever World War."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"If you want to be taken seriously as a historian of the Third Reich, this book must be in your collection. Shirer's meticulous research and ability to meld multiple sources into one compelling narrative remains a definitive work on the Nazi party. This in political and top-level government history; those looking for the fun military stuff should look elsewhere. But get this book, read it and keep it for future reference. Your fool brother in law might spout off sometime and here's a great tool to hush him up."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I just finished this monster of a book over the weekend and I'm still digesting everything I just read.First let me state this is one of the best books I've ever read, hands down.I love the horror genre but wanted to transition into non-fiction, and this book accomplished both those needs--it's definitely one of the scariest books I've ever read because it all really happened (not too long ago either when you step back and take in all of history), and in this crazy world we live in with values people are willing to die for and kill for, you realize everything in this book can certainly happen again.Maybe in a different place with different people and a different goal, but with the same murderous zeal and commitment to death.From beginning to end Rise and Fall hooks you and won't let go--from Hitler's undistiguished origins to his early manhood as a failed artist standing on the brink of mediocrity ready to fade from history, to the outbreak of WW1 and his unbelievable change of fortune and his subsequent meteoric rise to most powerful man in the world guided by some horrible fate. You know how this story ends, but still Shirer masterfully keeps you on the edge and the book remains suspensful throughout.A must-read for anyone interested in WW2!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is really an exceptional book. I avoided it for years simply because it was too long but once I picked it up and began reading I couldn't put it down. It has actually changed the way I view the world around me. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I have been a student of WW2 off and on for years. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MY FIRST BOOK! I can't rate this book highly enough for exactly what the title states AND how WW2 started, etc. After reading this book, I and I believe anyone else will be able to watch any documentary on Nazi Germany and will have a firm grip on the chronology of events as I have found films have a tendency to bounce around and become confusing. This book ( since I have read topics in reverse order apparantley) is a great jumping off point to reading other topics on the Nazis, there is no end to the madness. There is a serious lesson to be learned from the Nazis and the events found in this book and applies to events today; Appeasement never works or accomplishes anything but destruction...eventually. For evil to flourish, requires good men to do nothing"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is probably the finest historical work on the Hitler regime ever put to paper. Even after 51 years, Shirer's incredible work is still a potent and worthy read.Although the last five decades have shed a considerable amount of light on the Third Reich, this book is still a must read to get a great general understanding of how this group of gangsters took over an entire nation. Those obscure moments when Hitler could have been thrown from office, e.g. the march into the Rhine or the march into the Sudentanland, show how important it is for politicians of today to be able to see \\" around the corner\\" and use one's common sence and do what is right no matter how difficult it is to do what must be done. Shirer also brings up a point that I have never heard any other historian use about Hitler and it's this; Hitlers fatal flaw was his Eurocentric way of thinking. The man had absolutely no concept of the power of the United States.I suppose that A.H. was a man of his time and saw America,(as Goebbels put it), \\" a country that made good refrigerators and razor blades but nothing else\\".Well, his hubris was our gain, we destroyed him utterly.In conclusion, William Shirer's book is a timeless, magnificent read."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This bestselling classic book by a foreign correspondent and historian is fantastic. It describes in great detail the situation leading up to Hitler's assumption of power and how he and his cronies took power and led Germany to commit some of the most despicable atrocities ever. The author gives a number of detailed passages about some of these horrid acts of inhumanity. He describes the period leading up to World War II and the war itself. He explains Hitler's deceptive methods and much, much more. A must read book."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Don't be intimidated by the 1100+ pages of \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\\" It reads more like a novel than a dry historical narrative and -- trust me on this -- this book is awesome.As a reporter for CBS, William Shirer lived and worked in Germany during much of the Nazi movement. Until he left in 1940, he saw firsthand Hitler's rise to power, the consolidation of that power, and the use of that power. As a fallible human being, his prejudices may show through at times, but this is not necessarily a weakness. In today's climate of political correctness, works by historical revisionists -- that purport to show that Hitler and the Nazis weren't so bad -- are not only published, but they're even taken seriously. Perhaps our modern view of Hitler has been distorted by allied propaganda and Hitler and Goerring were fun loving and lovable guys, they say. At the extreme, some revisionists even claim that the Auschwitz death camp didn't even have gas chambers - they were added later as a tourist attraction! Yeah right.In that sense, Shirer's book, published in 1959 is refreshing. He doesn't hold back one bit with his opinions.Hence, Quisling is \\"pig-eyed\\", Rohm is a \\"pervert\\", Goebles is \\"dwarfish\\", Goering is \\"corpulent\\", Ribbentrop is \\"vain as a peacock\\", Brauchitsch is \\"unintelligent\\", Eva Braun has the \\"brain of a bird\\", and so forth. Such epithets may offend the sensibilities of some modern day readers, but they certainly spice up the telling of what could otherwise be a boring tale. (If you don't know who these people are, buy the book. Believe me, if you read it all the way through, you will become a formidable expert in Nazi trivia).Because \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" was finished a mere 14 years after the fall of Nazi Germany, some facts that have come to light after its publication are necessarily missing. The premier example of this would be the breaking of the secret Nazi military codes by the British. But writing this book in 1959 also had its advantages. Many of the participants were still alive when William Shirer was doing his research. Hence, when encountering a slight inconsistency in General Franz Halder's war diary [The Chief of Staff of the High Command (the OKH)], William Shirer wrote to the old General and received \\"a prompt and courteous reply.\\"Perhaps Shirer's most vivid firsthand account of all is the several page description of the French surrender in the rail car at the forest at Compiegne:\\"I look for the expression in Hitler's face. I am but fifty yards from him and see him though my glasses as though he were directly in front of me... He glances slowly around the clearing, and now, as his eyes meet ours, you grasp the depth of his hatred.\\"Amazing stuff.But these personal accounts only take up a very small portion of this absolutely fantastic book. Particularly well covered was Hitler's rise to power -- a story that is not often told. The Hitler that Shirer paints during these early years is a very astute political observer who shrewdly plays the German people like a violin. He promises the people what they want, plays on their fears, and is extremely ruthless to anyone who dares to oppose him.In later years, Shirer's Hitler's political savvy falls apart. At one point Shirer calls his inner circle a \\"lunatic asylum\\". Except for very occasional bursts of brilliance, Hitler has no idea what the heck he is doing politically much less militarily and yet his fanatical followers still go along with him. Hitler's megalomania goes on overdrive until, like a Viking in a Wagner opera his body is burned in a last stand against the Russian army just blocks away from his bunker.While making my way through \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\", I can't tell you how many times I would read about a pivotal event and wonder \\"WHAT THE HECK WAS GOING THROUGH THESE GUYS MINDS?\\" I always knew the Nazi's were nuts as well as scary. This book provided all of the details I needed."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This review is not of the excellent scholarly work of William Shirer but of the Kindle version of this book. Clearly the book was converted electronically without even cursory proofreading. Problems that I encountered include, but are not limited to:* Readability is impaired by the incorrect placement of commas instead of periods and apparent random insertion of periods in the middle sentences, usually due to incorrect interpretation of a comma but in some cases this appears to be random insertion.* There are many instances of random incorrect capitalization of words within a sentence.* Many words are not correctly recognized. For example \\"Uve\\" is printed in the Kindle conversion when the correct word would have been \\"Live\\" or the conversion interpreted \\"attack\\" to be \\"a tack\\" with the apparent two spaces between the two incorrect words.* Since this was a conversion from the original printed book most, if not all, of the hyphenation that was used for word wrapping now appears in the middle of a line instead of being combined into the correct single word.* Footnote hyperlinks are often misplaced and in one chapter the footnote links were not even present. The hyperlinks for footnotes often overflow in the text and in the worst extreme an entire paragraph is converted to hyperlink meaning that a user would not be able to select individual words, lines, etc. This version also attempts to hyperlink certain key names, locations and events to the Index, however the hyperlinked text far too often is only for part of the word or phrase which is extremely annoying when part of the word and/or phrase is in blue and the rest is in normal font color.* Many letters are incorrectly translated - most of these are the confusion between \\"1,\\" \\"I\\" and lower case \\"L\\" but as noted above this occurs with other words or letters.* Despite the updates to the Kindle for Android software, page numbering was not available, just the not formally defined position.Overall the book as originally written and published deserves 5 stars, or more, but the Kindle conversion is what I am rating at 2 stars. It would have been a single star but having previously read the 30th anniversary printed version I am better able to make the corrections within my mind although it sometimes takes several re-readings of a sentence or paragraph to determine what was really written. Correction - after previewing my review changed the rating to a single star.What is needed is to have each and every conversion of a book from print professionally proof-read before releasing this. To date I have only read two Kindle books and both share the same poor quality of conversion to Kindle format.What is Amazon's policy if a Kindle book is eventually corrected and replaced with a more readable version? Do previous purchasers receive the correct version via sync and are they informed of this in the event that they were unable to finish the poorly converted version?Another problem is that the dates published for virtually all titles are only the date of release in Kindle version and do not reflect the actual date of release of the actual text being read or the edition. Others previously noted that this poor quality conversion was not either the 50th anniversary edition as indicated in the product description or the updated 30th anniversary edition but an apparent conversion of an earlier edition. While this sometimes can be gleaned if one carefully reads each and every word of the description but a more honest presentation of this information would be to make that a separate line item in the product details, not buried in the product description or in reviews.Correction - I have read three Kindle books and all share the same problems although one was to a much lesser degree.UPDATE: I copied and pasted this review into a support email to Amazon using their webform. They responded asking that I provide citation to the problems and their locations but I am not willing to be an unpaid volunteer proofreader. My reply was limited to a single example of most of the problems that I reported but the problems are spread throughout the entire Kindle version fo this book as well as another that I wrote a review of. I am reading these books on a 10-inch tablet using Kindle for Android.UPDATE: April 26, 2012 - Amazon still hasn't taken any action except to find or manufacture over 350 additional reviews to dilute the negative reviews of the extremely poor kindle conversion. Somehow the number of reviews went from 31 to 385 in just 3 days. What a coincidence!UPDATE: May 2, 2012 - received a response from Amazon.com's Executive Customer Relations. It stated that there was an update in progress by the publisher with a subsequent conversion to Kindle format by Amazon which should hopefully correct many of the errors that so many of us have reported, a time frame for replacement was not offered which is probably best as unforeseen delays would artificially create ill feelings.. They also responded favorably to a suggestion to clearly indicate the edition or date of publication as this is very important for historical books. Finally, the addition of so many extra reviews is being attributed by Amazon to merging reviews of other versions. While I may not agree with the last as the reviews of various editions were previously mixed before the Big Bang occurred it is also possible that the complaints and poor reviews may have triggered some of this as well as correction of existing errors. Again, Thank You to everyone that chose to post accurate feedback of the problems with the Kindle edition.UPDATE: August 8, 2012 - I could not get the version to update including many instances of deleting the title and finally Amazon forced a send. It took three more tries but I now have a version with page numbering. Having so recently labored through the defective version I am unable to re-read this new version to determine if most of the errors have been corrected or new ones added. Getting this updated required significant complaining finally resulting in addressing an email to Jeff Bezos and associated reassignment to higher level customer service representatives as the lower level representives declined to initiate investigative action."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is a great book for not only its detail, but also the unique perspective that the author provides. Every stage in the history of Germany during the mid twentieth century is explored in fantastic depth. The Kindle edition however appears to have never been edited. Typographical errors occur frequently enough to distract from the text. There are also numerous footnotes that are not active, or lniked to other citations making them inaccessible. It is a shame that this was offered in such a condition, it has made me far less likely to purchase Kindle editions of older works."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"It would be difficult to overstate the importance of this book. It was the first comprehensive popular history of Nazi Germany to appear in English, and it is probably more responsible than any other single source for shaping the way that Americans think about Nazi Germany, World War II, and the Holocaust. More than that, this is an estimable work of history. Shirer has done an admirable job of combing through the mountains of primary source material that the Nazis left behind and assembling a coherent and comprehensible narrative from it.Of course, it would be a mistake to view this book as simply or even primarily a work of history. It is intended as an indictment of the evil and barbarity that the Nazis perpetrated in Germany and across Europe for more than twelve years and as an indictment of the men and women in Germany, in France, in Great Britain, and elsewhere who allowed that evil and barbarity to occur. Shirer is not content to point out that Hitler and Himmler and Goering and Frank were monsters; he also is intent on showing how complicit the German Army and the German people were in what happened and how the ignorance, stupidity, and cowardice of the politicians of the West and the Soviet Union actively assisted Hitler's monstosities in coming to pass.The reader can almost visualize Shirer shaking in outrage when he considers the evil Hitler wrought with the help of the rest of Europe. This outrage is, in many ways, both the book's greatest asset and its greatest shortcoming. While Shirer's indignation makes this a great moral work, it also causes him to be more than a little unfair to some of his subjects and to present the history as being more one-dimensional than it in fact was. Shirer never tells, for example, that one of the principal reasons that Chamberlain and Daladier were willing to appease Hitler was that the Depression had bankrupted both Britain and France. They believed that they could not afford to rearm so that they could stop Hitler militarily, and so they sought to get the best deals they could at the bargaining table. Their policy was, of course, dangerously short-sighted, but it is unfair to both men to suggest that their policy was almost solely the result of cowardice.Then, too, is the fact that Shirer almost invariably describes Rosenberg as a befuddled dolt, Goering as fat, and Ribbentrop as vacuous. It is readily apparent to the reader that he does so because he feels he must constantly reiterate their lack of praiseworthiness, but it is disconcerting to the reader. I am at a loss to explain what Goering's girth has to do with anything, or what it was about Rosenberg's writing that made him any stupider that most Nazis. While I believe that Ribbentrop deserves almost all of the calumny that can be heaped on him, Shirer never makes a real case for his vacuity.Finally, it must be said that Shirer appears to run out of steam towards the end of the book. All of World War II is covered in the last 25% of the book, and many important topics, including the Holocaust, get short shrift as a result.These criticisms should not be taken to mean that I believe that this book is not meritorious or that it should not be read. On the contrary: one would be hard-pressed to find a better, more comprehensible, more accessible one volume book about Nazi Germany. It ought to be the starting point (but not the ending point) for anyone interested in World War II or Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer was an American journalist in Germany from 1934 until presumably 1941 (when Germany declared war on the USA after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour). Shirer occasionally mentions his participation in reporting history from Berlin or the front lines and admits to having been influenced by the endless barrage of Nazi propaganda. Occasionally his sharp post-war opinions on the characters of the various leaders depicted breaks through. The book is based on the huge amounts of documentary and verbal evidence that became available after the war and the Nuremberg trials. The book represents a huge work of research - one wonders, however, whether the author's motivation is an atonement to his blindness (along with many millions of others) to the monstrosity of the Third Reich as it actually happened.On reading the book (a rich 1200 pages!) one wonders whether it should not have been called \\"The Rise and the Fall of Adolf Hitler\\" for it centers around Hitler and his generals and seems to almost forget Goering, Goebbels, Himmler and other Nazi leaders after their initial appearances. A central conclusion from the book is, no doubt, that the Third Reich and World War2 would not have come about were it not for this one man - Adolf Hitler. All the other players in Shirer's story pale into insignificance beside the genius, charisma, madness, vision, evil, manipulativeness, leadership and single-mindedness of the one man. The only other \\"heros\\" of the book, although not covered in great detail, are Stalin and, rather more so, Churchill whose vision, inspiration and leadership changed the course of history.Besides Hitler, Churchill and Stalin most other players in the drama of the Third Reich appear in Shirer's book as sycophants, ditherers, brutes or nonentities. The weakness and blindness of pre-war England and France are difficult to imagine. The blind neutrality and unpreparedness of the governments of Belgium, Holland and Norway is also noted. The world's blindness is all the more noteworthy considering, as Shirer carefully points out, that Hitler laid out his philosophy and intentions very clearly in Mein Kampf which he wrote in the mid 1920's. [This andThe Myth of the 20th Centuryby Alfred Rosenberg who had a huge influence on Hitler's thinking are two 'must reads' for anyone interested in the background of Nazi thinking and philosophy.]In hindsight, one is open-mouthed at the success of Hitler's bullying which allowed him to annex Austria and dismantle Czechoslovakia without firing a shot. Hitler also intimidated his generals who dared not disobey him even if it cost the lives of thousands of their troops and endangered their own. As the war progressed more and more of them either resigned or were fired in Hitler's increasing rage and frustration at ever increasing failures. It is quite amazing to read about the chain of events which led the ex-Austrian corporal to take over direct command of the German armed forces in the first place. There is no doubt that, during the early stages of the war, Hitler's ideas of where and how to attack and invade were smarter than those of his generals, as was his assessment of the procrastination and unpreparedness of the countries to the north and west.However Hitler had a number of critical blind spots that were to cost him the war. He underestimated the will of the Russians to fight for their homeland as he misjudged the tenacity of the British and readiness to fight of the Americans. Hitler was more paranoid about the dangers close to home to his regime and his person. He made sure to eliminate (literally) any real or supposed opposition including the many members of the July 1944 plot. Shirer documents the various attempts within Germany during the war years to overthrow the Fuehrer which all failed from combinations of bad luck, ambivalence, mutual distrust and lack of resolve of the plotters.The book's main themes are the rise of the Nazi Party, the build up to and then the conduct of the war until its demolition of the Third Reich. From a history of the Third Reich, I would have expected something more on the instruments of government and power under the Nazi regime. There is also little on the Nazis' innovative, systematic and extremely successful uses of deception and propaganda to further their aims. Shirer, however, chooses the more exciting stories and gives us a tantalizing insider's view of the Reich. The detail furnished by some of Hitler's loyal subordinates of meetings give us the feeling of having been there in the Chancellery or in Berchtesgaden as it happened. For those of us who grew up on the Allied story of the war, this glimpse into the enemy camp is a memorable one. I will not forget this book for a long time."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I grew up near Lenox, Massachusetts, where author William Shirer spent his last twenty years, and we often drove by the old Victorian where he lived, set back from the road as it was, with a large, lovely lawn hiding the rather reclusive author from public view. I picked up this book again to reread it once more, for I find that it is a wonderful treasure trove of personal observations and actual eye-witness history, written on the run by a man married to a German woman and living in the shadow of the nazis as they climbed into power.William Shirer's comprehensive treatment of the curious rise and horrific fall of the Nazis in post-Weimar Germany is the benchmark volume to measure all other treatments of the era by. There are so many monographs on Nazi Germany that one reels before the list looming in a relevant bibliography. Save yourself the trouble; this book gives one exactly the kind of complete immersion in and coverage of the realities of the era that too many of the other books lack. Shirer, an American journalist stationed in Berlin as a newspaper (and later radio) correspondant during the rise of the National Socialists, was there, on the ground and at the scene witnessing many of the events he describes in such detail.He has, of course, written extensively on these experiences, both herein and elsewhere in books like 'The Nightmare Years' and 'Berlin Diary'. But this book has to be considered his masterpiece, and is worth the time, trouble and price for this hefty best-selling volume. After all, it has never been out of print in the forty years since its original publication in the early 1960s. I promise that if you read this, you'll never think of World War Two in the same way. It is indeed a long and difficult read, but one that is well worth the effort. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William L. Shirer's classic &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; is the most complete single volume account of the history of Nazi Germany ever written. Shirer was a journalist, not a historian and the advantages of this show in his very readable prose and his vivid descriptions (for example, often referring to Herman Goering as &quot;the fat Field Marshall&quot;). The book starts with the birth of the Nazi party and how it found a spokesman early on in an ex-serviceman named Adolf Hitler. The narrative continues through until the end of the war, Hitler's suicide and the final few days under Admiral Doenitz. The only warning to the casual reader is that the book's length exceeds 1100 pages and it is crammed to the brim with facts. Also, it should be noted that the book was published over forty years ago and does not include more recent information that has come to light from, for example, the former East German archives. Nevertheless, this is still a classic work of jornalistic history."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Lest anyone mistake the three star rating for rejection or dislike, let me say up front that Shirer's monumental work is absolutely informative, eye-opening, and, as so many reviewers have said, probaby *should* be read by just about everybody, not just those with an interest in World War Two.That being said, there are some criticisms to be had. First is the length. I have nothing against 1000+ page books per se. Shirer's work, however, could have been several hundred pages shorter but for his near obsessiveness toward recording every detail. The days leading up to the invasion of Poland, for example, are told almost in \\"real time.\\" Second is the complete lack of maps. There is very little more frustrating than to be bombarded with place names and to have only a rough idea of where these places are. Third is the lack of focus on the Germans themselves, especially once the war starts.Some parts of this book do stand out. Shirer's two chapters on life in Nazi Germany and the occupied countries are both gripping and horrifying. Shirer's forays into his own recollections are also welcome diversions from the endless barrage of Nazi documents, memoranda, and diaries and are, perhaps, the best parts of the entire work. And Shirer's account of the Nazi party's rise is fascinating reading, and shows that, indeed, Hitler and Stalin had more in common than one would have thought.All in all, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a worthwhile read. It is not great \\"literature\\" in the sense that Gibbon or Will Durant are (contrary to what some others have suggested), but it is an investment in time and attention that will pay off for the reader."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"If you only could read and own one history book on Nazi Germany, this would be it. Don't let the 1245 pages daunt you, this is a very well written and readable book on the subject. Shirer was apparently a journalist and started research on the book when he first went to Germany in 1925. He spent 5-1/2 years writing it. The title pretty much explains it, it covers the rise of Adolf Hitler to the eventual fall of Berlin. There are other history books that cover specific aspects of the Nazi's, such as the recommended 2002 publication of Antony Beevor's The Fall of Berlin 1945, but this is the one history book on it all. Considering how the events covered set up the modern world, this should be essential reading for everyone on the planet.I see that this is the first review for the hardcopy version of the book, which is the version of the text that I have. Those wanting to read other reviews should go to the paperback version site."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"For those who have never read this monumental and essential work, the issuance of a 50th anniversary edition represents an excellent opportunity to acquire and read it. For a reader and student of modern German history like me, who bought the first edition as a high-school student 50 years ago, it represents an opportunity to revisit the book and refresh one's understanding of that singular and mystifying era. But an anniversary edition should bring something new to the table in addition to being a commemorative edition to add to the bookshelf. Ron Rosenbaum, the author ofExplaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil, does his part toward this end by adding a modern specialist historian's perspective at a distance of half a century from the original publication, and in that, this book fulfills the requirement for something new.But because I ordered the book sight-unseen, I was disappointed in the lack of new typography, which would have made the book much more attractive. It is evident at first glance that the pages carrying the main text were printed not from masters newly composited for this anniversary edition, which would have given freshness to the appearance and readability of the book, but from masters made by photocopying the pages of the original book. This process gives the characters on the page a slightly eroded appearance, with sharp points blunted, lines and curves ragged, and interior corners filled in, lending an antique if not archaic, and definitely B-list, appearance to the typography. The resulting appearance is distinctly inferior to that of the original book, which of course was originally-composited, and far inferior to the fresh compositing and modern printing, in the same typeface, of Rosenbaum's introduction. The irony is that (or so I should think) a publishing intern with a high-resolution scanner and modern compositing software could have produced a clean new file for each page, with identical line breaks, justification, and pagination to the original, scanning errors corrected, in five minutes--the whole book thus cleaned up costing the publisher three weeks of an intern's salary. The index might have been too complex to scan and verify in a cost-effective manner, but leaving this part in photocopied form would not have been too jarring. And the whole main text would have had the same beautifully clean and sharp typography as the introduction (which, juxtaposed to the main text, only adds to the latter's visual disappointment). In summary, I'm glad to have the book, but I'd have been willing to pay more for a book done as above."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I wish this book was available to me when I was in High School. For students in school, such as my daughter who is now in the 6th grade, WWII is waxed over. They seem to get the Cliff's Notes version of what happened. They have numbers, dates, and statistics thrown at them, with little substance behind it. However, this tends to raise more questions than it answers. I first read this book while in the Army back in 1987 while stationed in Nuernberg Germany. It was a long read, but one definitely worth the time. Most books on the subject focus on the horror of the Third Reich and the Holocaust. They cater to the &quot;what&quot;, but too seldom tend to the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot;, which were two of the biggest questions in my mind. William L. Shirer. His work sets the stage for what is to come, gets inside the machinations that took place, economic hardships, the total desparation of the Germanic people. A people who were at a point where they would take heed to the words whispered into their ears, and unfortunately, Adolf Hitler told them what they wanted to hear. Since '87, I have read this book another three times, learning more each time I pick it up. I agree wholeheartedly with General Eisenhower about those who don't learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. The more information we have about the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; can help us prevent such horrors in the future."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"William Shirer was an American journalist in Germany from 1934 until presumably 1941 (when Germany declared war on the USA after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour). Shirer occasionally mentions his participation in reporting history from Berlin or the front lines and admits to having been influenced by the endless barrage of Nazi propaganda. Occasionally his sharp post-war opinions on the characters of the various leaders depicted breaks through. The book is based on the huge amounts of documentary and verbal evidence that became available after the war and the Nuremberg trials. The book represents a huge work of research - one wonders, however, whether the author's motivation is an atonement to his blindness (along with many millions of others) to the monstrosity of the Third Reich as it actually happened.On reading the book (a rich 1200 pages!) one wonders whether it should not have been called \\"The Rise and the Fall of Adolf Hitler\\" for it centers around Hitler and his generals and seems to almost forget Goering, Goebbels, Himmler and other Nazi leaders after their initial appearances. A central conclusion from the book is, no doubt, that the Third Reich and World War2 would not have come about were it not for this one man - Adolf Hitler. All the other players in Shirer's story pale into insignificance beside the genius, charisma, madness, vision, evil, manipulativeness, leadership and single-mindedness of the one man. The only other \\"heros\\" of the book, although not covered in great detail, are Stalin and, rather more so, Churchill whose vision, inspiration and leadership changed the course of history.[Reviewer's personal note: WW2 and the Holocaust are themes of enormous importance to me personally. Both my parents were born in Germany and, had it not been for Hitler I would have been born a German. Once the Third Reich existed I might not have been born at all were it not for Churchill, and I almost certainly wouldn't have been living in Israel if weren't for WW2 and the Holocaust. The realization (sharpened after reading this book) that my life ,and that of so many millions of others, would have been so different were it not for two men is quite shattering.]Besides Hitler, Churchill and Stalin most other players in the drama of the Third Reich appear in Shirer's book as sycophants, ditherers, brutes or nonentities. The weakness and blindness of pre-war England and France are difficult to imagine. The blind neutrality and unpreparedness of the governments of Belgium, Holland and Norway is also noted. The world's blindness is all the more noteworthy considering, as Shirer carefully points out, that Hitler laid out his philosophy and intentions very clearly in Mein Kampf which he wrote in the mid 1920's.In hindsight, one is open-mouthed at the success of Hitler's bullying which allowed him to annex Austria and dismantle Czechoslovakia without firing a shot. Hitler also intimidated his generals who dared not disobey him even if it cost the lives of thousands of their troops and endangered their own. As the war progressed more and more of them either resigned or were fired in Hitler's increasing rage and frustration at ever increasing failures. It is quite amazing to read about the chain of events which led the ex-Austrian corporal to take over direct command of the German armed forces in the first place. There is no doubt that, during the early stages of the war, Hitler's ideas of where and how to attack and invade were smarter than those of his generals, as was his assessment of the procrastination and unpreparedness of the countries to the north and west.However Hitler had a number of critical blind spots that were to cost him the war. He underestimated the will of the Russians to fight for their homeland as he misjudged the tenacity of the British and readiness to fight of the Americans. Hitler was more paranoid about the dangers close to home to his regime and his person. He made sure to eliminate (literally) any real or supposed opposition including the many members of the July 1944 plot. Shirer documents the various attempts within Germany during the war years to overthrow the Fuehrer which all failed from combinations of bad luck, ambivalence, mutual distrust and lack of resolve of the plotters.The book's main themes are the rise of the Nazi Party, the build up to and then the conduct of the war until its demolition of the Third Reich. From a history of the Third Reich, I would have expected something more on the instruments of government and power under the Nazi regime. There is also little on the Nazis' innovative, systematic and extremely successful uses of deception and propaganda to further their aims. Shirer, however, chooses the more exciting stories and gives us a tantalizing insider's view of the Reich. The detail furnished by some of Hitler's loyal subordinates of meetings give us the feeling of having been there in the Chancellery or in Berchtesgaden as it happened. For those of us who grew up on the Allied story of the war, this glimpse into the enemy camp is a memorable one. I will not forget this book for a long time."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"I'm 43 years old, and I first read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich when I was ten years old. In the intervening years, I've read it two more times, and everytime I do, I understand more about the Third Reich. Shirer's book is an excellent work by an author who was most intimate with the subject, having been CBS Radio's correspondent in Berlin from the mid-30's until December 1940. Having met most of the major players and seen the major events, such as the Anschluss, the Sudeten crisis, Prague 1939, and the surrender of France in June, 1940, few people were in a better position to be able to interpret these events. Also, the massive amount of research involved is staggering. The Nazis churned out tons of records, which, because of their thoroughness, help to convict them at Nuremberg. This ocean of documentation Shirer waded through to give us this magnificent book. A more-than-worthy addition to anyone's library of the history of World War II and Hitler, Nazism and the Third Reich."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This gripping classic thoroughly covers Hitler's rise (via free elections), life in Nazi Germany, and the inexorable march to disaster. The book touches nearly all bases, including politics, economics, social policy, diplomacy, the war, holocaust, etc. Readers see how Hitler was named chancellor in hard times, reducing joblessness thru rearmament, while tightening his grip via arrests, murder, and Gestapo terror. We also read his secret war directives (and plans for mass atrocities) from before Munich through utter defeat in 1945. Readers learn all major players and events, plus how a majority of Germans backed Hitler's lunatic regime. Author William L. Shirer (1904-1993) was a foreign correspondent in Nazi Germany from 1934-1940, and he later spent five years examining captured German documents to write this outstanding volume. I like the readable blend of eyewitness journalism and scholarly history, plus the skilled inclusion of authentic documents to illuminate events.This stellar book isn't flawless; a couple of Shirer's conclusions seem debatable, he name-calls top Nazi's he personally detested, and his coverage of events ranges from superbly in-depth to merely adequate. Also, denied access to certain now-open archives, Shirer missed facts like Britain's breaking of Germany's military code ENIGMA. Still, this is a superb achievement overall, and so readable despite its length that it's sold over 20 million copies since 1960 - incredible for non-fiction.This superb bestseller left readers amazed, academic historians jealous, and many wrongly assuming the author was Jewish (he was Protestant). In a dangerous world, this book plus Shirer's other volumes on Nazi Germany (BERLIN DIARY-1941, NIGHTMARE YEARS-1984) are timeless reminders."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is one of the longest books I have ever read. But don't let that get in the way. It was also one of the most readable books I remember.While it drowned out all my other reading and occupied all my spare time, its 1143 pages of small print captivated my attention, spellbound me, drove me to google images of the key players, review historical accounts, look up other books on the subject and dig into fringe Internet sites like those of Holocaust denial movements.Since I always read before going to sleep, sometimes my dreams were deeply disturbed. When I turned the last page today of Shirer's afterword, I was relieved. This was hard work, it was consuming.Shirer starts telling the story of Adolf Hitler, with that of his parents and grandparents in Austria in the latter part of the 1800s. All through the story, of course, I knew how it ends, but I never knew any of the details. Shirer was actually present in Germany during the early years of the Nazi regime and he was often in the room - or in the arena - when Hitler spoke. As he told the story of the Third Reich, he guided me through conversations and events, making me feel like the proverbial fly on the wall when momentous things were going on. He showed events from the perspective of the German perpetrators, every step of the way, memo for memo, order for order, phone call for phone call, speech for speech.Reading Rise and Fall laid open for me how disastrous this period of history was for Germany and for the world. I always knew it was bad. However, it was much, much, much worse than my worst nightmares could have played out. I am now stunned, shocked, disturbed and astonished. Most importantly, I am motivated to learn more and to research further.I regret only that I didn't read this book when I was 18 years old. Why is it that as young people, with few exceptions, we are not very interested in politics and history? Somehow, for most of us, history does not captivate us until later in life.I cannot state enough times how important it is for every citizen of the world to read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. It should be required reading for humanity.Somebody should dictate that!"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"The late William Shirer left us one of the very few sober accounts written about Hitler and Nazi Germany.The credence of this book lays in the fact that the author lived in Germany, witnessed and felt the pulse of the WWII events.We do not see many silly \`labelling' of Adolph Hitler \`the mad man', his \`illegitimate father'. Or Hitler loitering the street of Vienna \`roaming on his face', having failed his exams at National Art Academy, deciding to avenge from Austria \`to vindicate his honour'.In this book we can learn the early events that led to WWII.We can see how Churchill's reticence to respond to many peace overtures Hitler offered in 1939 and after - when the British and French leaders were fighting much among themselves - hampered the quest for reconciliation.Shirer spoke the language and mixed with the German people, he ate with them, rode their buses, listened to their radio, read their newspapers, and what is appreciable though is nowhere in the book one can see accusations that Hitler was a world threat - no wonder why the author was blacklisted in the early fifties for his daring and open-minded views.Shirer couldn't have possibly seen how Paul Reynaud, the French Premier, listened to his mistress - Madame Helene de Portes - to sign the armistice with Germany at the time Churchill was equivocal with his promises to help France when Roosevelt was unprepared.Shirer wrote on Page 740 \\"Hitler was determined above all not to allow the French Fleet to fall into the hands of the British\\".........\\"the armistice terms were designed to keep a French government functioning on French soil, and the French Fleet neutralized\\"... Whereas Churchill had aimed at getting the fleet scuttled because he was not sure the French were able to fight from North Africa, and sending the fleet to British waters would have been a liability on GB. Churchill would be held responsible for French towns destruction from the German air raids \`as long as Britain held the French fleet'.This is a great book to read, and a must read by scholars...."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"There's a remarkable passage in Shelby Foote's history of the Civil War where Foote speculates on the true nature of patriotism and courage. Describing Pickett's Charge, Lee's epic mistake during the Battle of Gettysburg, Foote first acknowledges the tremendous courage it took for the Confederate troops to march across a mile of open field in the face of the Union Army's guns. But then he goes a step further. True courage and true patriosm, he says, would have been to defy Lee and refuse to make the charge, to tell him he was making a horrible mistake and ordering Pickett's division to committ suicide.This is the underlying theme of Shirer's book The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. The German soldier was undoubtedly brave in battle, but genuine courage and genuine patriotism would have been to defy Hitler and not obey orders. Tragically, although many in the higher levels of the German officer corps were aware that Hitler was no patriot, but an evil, demonic man leading his country to destruction, few of them had the courage or the imagination to disobey his orders. There was something lacking in the German soul, Shirer argues, that prevented even the best educated Germans from the best families from stopping the Nazis destroying their country in an act of suicidal folly.The book, in the end, is Tolstoyan for, as Tolstoy argued in War and Peace, Kings and generals, in the end, have little effect on history. Ordinary Germans made Hitler possible. It was ordinary British, Russian, and American soldiers, not the Christian aristocrats on the German general staff, who finally had the courage to fight and die to bring down the Third Reich."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This very readable history is indispensable in understanding the political psychosis which propelled a self-styled Fuehrer to fashion, with horrifying consequences, a Third Reich which came close to achieving total domination of Europe (and perhaps even the world itself.)Shirer witnessed first hand Hitler's consolidation of political power in the dying days of the Weimar Republic and likewise the grim aftermath of postwar ravaged Europe.Shirer's impassioned recognition and denunciation of pure, unmitigated Evil may be out of fashion in our ironical, postmodern age, but his first hand experience with Nazi Germany lends a moral authority to his critique and, along with his meticulous documentation of Nazi archives, is the book's main strength.Sadly, in the fifty some odd years since Hitler's defeat, the capacity for evil and the appetite for mass destruction still burns within human hearts. THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH should be essential reading for a new century and a new millennium. As Shirer writes in the foreword:&quot;In our age of terrifying, lethal gadgets, which supplanted so swiftly the old one, the first great aggressive war, if it should come, will be launched by suicidal little madmen pressing an electronic button. Such a war will not last long and none will ever follow it. There will be no conquerors and no conquests, but only the charred bones of the dead on an uninhabited planet.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This book, is truly one of the finest of its genre following the origins of one of the most opressive regimes in modern history to its bitter end whilst maintaining a distinctly unbiased stance throughout.Clearly, Mr.Shirer spent many hours,days,months etc on this book as he leaves no stone unturned in his presentation of the rise and the fall of Nazism.If there is one criticism, it has to be that it reads in a manner that allows perhaps 30mins to 60mins at the most per session as it has so much sheer information to digest.Apart from that, a Tour de Force."},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","review":"This is clearly the finest one-volume &quot;briography&quot; if you will of the Third Reich. But it is not without its problems. The book badly needs maps. When the author discusses troop movements, the reader is left in the dark unless he has an atlas by his side. Too much time is spent on the plot to assassinate Hitler, which, after all, was a minor event. He doesn't even mention the sinking of the battleship Bismark and what a devastating effect that had on Hitler's ability to conduct a sea war. Allied generals are mentioned, but given short shrift. Nevertheless, Shirer has managed to compress tons of documents into an understandable and often fascinating narrative. This book reads like a novel and was, for me, impossible to put down. A great achievement despute the reservations noted above."},{"Title":"The Hidden Value Of A Man - The Incredible Impact Of A Man On His Family","review":"a great book for the man who is looking for answers as to his role in todays family. based on principals far more solid than the ever-changing views of mainstream thought, it provides direction and areas of focus for men that will build not only themselves but their family. with the included work book it can be used for even deeper study and will continue to direct the search. i believe this is a book that every searching man should have in his library to be read many times over. if you are not interested in improving yourself as a father and husband find another book."},{"Title":"The Hidden Value Of A Man - The Incredible Impact Of A Man On His Family","review":"It was not a pleasure to read this book, as the grammar and flow was a challenge.

The text itself is a great read, and when it is properly staged, the play is spectacular. For those of you not familiar with THE MOUSETRAP, the plot involves a classic cozy murder mystery--perhaps the classic cozy murder mystery. The characters are well-drawn, and my wife even verbally gasped when she first saw the play's final plot twist. Great work. I hope it survives forever."},{"Title":"Mousetrap & Other Plays","review":"&quot;The Mousetrap&quot; may be THE classic stage mystery of all time; if you're ever in London, GO SEE IT! Failing that, read it here, along with &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; (with a different ending from the book that does not upset the pattern of the plot), &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; (with a double whammy shocker at the final curtain), and five other plays, each with its own unique quality. Interestingly, three of the plays - &quot;Appointment With Death,&quot; &quot;The Hollow,&quot; and &quot;Go Back for Murder,&quot; are adapted (by Christe herself) from Poirot novels (&quot;Go Back for Murder&quot; is from the book &quot;Five Little Pigs&quot;), but none of the plays features Poirot, and, guess what: YOU WON'T MISS HIM! &quot;Appointment with Death&quot; has a different murderer in the play than in the book. Read the plays and compare them to the novels; double your pleasure!"},{"Title":"Mousetrap & Other Plays","review":"i didn't care much for the other stories but Mousetrap was real good - I seem to have bought this book long ago- ofcourse the cover was different. What particularly impressed me about Mousetrap was that there were not many people in the cottage who could have &quot;done it&quot; and yet it was impossible to tell &quot;who did it!&quot;"},{"Title":"Mousetrap & Other Plays","review":"Agatha Christie (1890-1972) made her reputation with a series of mystery novels so widely read that she is often considered the single best selling novelist in the history publishing--but from about the mid-1940s to around the end of the 1950s she had another claim to fame: she was a playwright who created one hit after another.THE MOUSETRAP AND OTHER PLAYS does not contain all of Christie's plays, but it does contain a good chunk of them: TEN LITTLE INDIANS; APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH; THE HOLLOW; THE MOUSETRAP; WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION; TOWARDS ZERO; VERDICT; and GO BACK FOR MURDER, all of which were staged between 1943 and 1960.The \\"monster\\" hit of Christie's career as a playwright was THE MOUSETRAP, which opened in London in 1952... and continues to play to packed houses more than fifty years later, the longest continual run in theatrical history. Based on a short story which was in turn based on a radio sketch, the play presents us with newly-married Giles and Molly, who have decided to open a guest house in rural England--only to find themselves and their guests snowed in with a killer. The play is classic Christie, presenting us with an isolated group of people and a truly jaw-dropping final twist; it is also remarkably well-written, tightly structured.Even so, most critics tend to dismiss THE MOUSETRAP in favor Christie's second stunner: the celebrated WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION, which opened in London in 1953 and proved a smash both there and in New York. The play is essentially a courtroom drama: Leonard Vole has been accused of the murder of a somewhat elderly woman and only the testimony of his wife can save him from certain conviction. But his wife, Romaine, is a unknown quantity, a mysterious woman who may have her own reasons for wanting to see Leonard hang. Can the eloquent Sir Wilson, acting for the defense, save his client from death? Like THE MOUSETRAP, the conclusion is a stunner--but with a double twist that has continued to shock and astonish audiences in its numerous revivals and the celebrate film version for well over fifty years.There is a third \\"great\\" success in this volume, and it is TEN LITTLE INDIANS, adapted directly from the Christie novel AND THEN THERE WERE NONE. Opening in London in 1943, it successfully transferred to New York and in both instances enjoyed long runs before becoming an extremely popular title in regional, community, and educational theatre, where it remains a staple to this day. The basic story is extremely well known: ten people are invited for an island getaway by an unknown host--and once cut off from the world are accused of having committed murders that the law cannot touch. They are then picked off one by one in accordance with the nursery rhyme posted above the fireplace. Read today, TEN LITTLE INDIANS is distinctly old fashioned--but that's part of the fun, and the conclusion contains a surprise twist that will amuse those who have read and enjoyed the Christie novel upon which it is based.The remaining plays might be described as \\"distinctly of their time\\" and vary significantly in terms of quality. The two weakest titles are the 1945 APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH and the 1958 VERDICT. Based on the Christie novel of the same name, APPOINTMENT WITH DEATH lacks the focus found in most Christie works; it was not a success, opening and closing in London within a few weeks. VERDICT, which Christie wrote for the stage as an original work, was reasonably successful--and was a bit of a departure for Christie in the sense that it is more suspense than mystery. Read today, however, it has a distinctly implausible quality.THE HOLLOW, TOWARDS ZERO, and GO BACK FOR MURDER are much stronger plays, with the latter easily the best--and certainly the most interesting in terms of staging. Based on the Christie novel THE FIVE LITTLE PIGS, this 1960 play finds a young woman determined to get to the bottom of a family scandal: her mother was convicted of her father's murder. The approach is particularly clever, introducing each character separately in the contemporary world and then sending them back in time to play out the past. THE HOLLOW, produced in 1951 and based on Christie's novel of the same name, was a significant success; TOWARDS ZERO, produced in 1956 and based on Christie's novel of the same name, was also reasonably popular. Both are distinctly Christie, but both tend to read as old fashioned in a way that is not nearly as entertaining as TEN LITTLE INDIANS.As Ira Levin notes in his brief introduction to these seven titles, mystery plays are rare birds, and few authors produce more than a single successful play. With three major hits and many more minor ones, Christie broke the mold--and, of course, THE MOUSETRAP's success didn't so much break the mold as shatter it entirely. Strongly recommended for Christie fans, mystery fans, and play-readers everywhere.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Mousetrap & Other Plays","review":"This book was REALLY good.

Forty years ago I saw the play, and on November 4, 2010, I saw it again in London and loved it. It reads very well, and the stage version is a perfect rendition of the script.A young couple are expecting their very first guests in their newly opened B and B in the family's old manor house in the country. Outside there's a fierce blizzard raging which you can see through the windows. It looks as if the house will be isolated for quite some time. One at a time the characters arrive including the husband who has been out in the countryside running errands.The wife on the wireless hears that there has been a grisly murder of a woman in London. The only description is that the perpetrator was seen wearing an overcoat, scarf and fedora. There's a bit of humor as we see each new character come in with the same accessories. There's a strange, quirky young man named Christopher Wren, a hypercritical older woman named Mrs. Boyle, a former magistrate, a retired army man, Major Metcalf, and the enigmatic young Miss Casewell. At the last minute a rather dodgy gentleman named Mr.Paravicini shows up unannounced.A policeman, Detective Sergeant Trotter, arrives on skis to warn everybody that there are victims and a murderer among them. The nursery rhyme \\"Three Blind Mice\\" becomes a key to the plot. At the end of Act One, one of characters gets murdered.This is a fun play that holds up amazingly well. Christie wrote a dozen plays, and she was very adept at creating suspense, and delineating characters. She had a good theatrical sense.The set is delightful with doors going off in all directions and even a glass door leading out into the snowy landscape.

Thus, many Lutherans have never read much Reformation-era thought on the Sacrament of the Altar, the Lord's Supper. Because of these new translations, does Teigen unearth any new revelation or new Lutheran theology? No, he does not! In the first four chapters, he covers basic Lutheran belief on true presence in the Lord's Supper and why, based on Scripture, we believe what the mind cannot fathom.Yet saying that this book is without controversy among some Lutherans would be false. For in chapter five, Teigen covers what Martin Chemnitz believed about consecration and what it effected, that is, caused. According to Teigen, Chemnitz believed that the consecration brings about true presence, not distribution or reception. Although quite controversial among the different Lutheran churches today (WELS, ELS, CLC [Concordia Lutheran Conference], to name a few), did Teigen get Chemnitz right, or did Teigen go off on some tangent? Let's see! Question 251 in Chemnitz's book, Ministry, Word, and Sacraments, asks about consecration and its relation to Jesus' true presence: If the words of institution have been recited over the elements (consecration), are Christ's body and blood present, even if no one receives the elements, and they are instead &quot;laid up, enclosed, or carried about?&quot; Chemnitz replied that Christ did not set up this Sacrament for such abuses. Nevertheless, even if no one receives the elements, Christ's body and blood are still present! Whoa--if a modern-day Lutheran theologian wrote this he would be accused of being a transubstantiationist.Nevertheless, thie revieweer must concede that Teigen did portray the theology of Chemnitz correctly. It now begs the question if Chemnitz was correct in his understanding of the Lord's Supper. On the same subject, Luther wrote that no person's word or work produces the true presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Supper, whether it be the merit or declaration of the minister, or the eating and drinking or faith of the communicants; but all this be ascribed alone to the power of the Almighty God and the institution and ordination of our Lord Jesus Christ. [But all that which we have present in the Supper of Christ is to be ascribed absolutely and altogether to the power and Word of Almighty God and the institution, etc.]. Yes--Chemnitz agree with Luther on this. Both Martin are of one mind on this issue: the consecration effects true presence, not the distribution and reception.Why then should Lutherans believing that consecration effects true presence be controversial at all? Teigen wrote that 17th century theologians strongly influenced our modern Lutheran thought on Jesus' true presence. These theologians were, in turn, influenced by Melanchton--not Chemnitz, not Luther. Even Missouri Synod's first president, Ferdinand Walther, fell prey to this Melanchtonian error when he quoted Quenstedt in his Pastoral Theology: &quot;The sacramental union does not happen except in the distribution.&quot; Other conservative Lutherans say that without distribution and reception a valid Sacrament does not exist (with which this reviewer agrees). Nevertheless, this reviewer agrees also with Teigen, Luther, and Chemnitz: it is the consecration that effects true presence. What are other arguments that some Lutherans have against believing that the consecration effects true presence?-First, such beliefs about consecration have been the belief of some Lutherans but not the Lutheran Church. In response, are Luther, Chemnitz, and The Book of Concord &quot;some Lutherans&quot;? -Second, some raise questions about what happens if the consecrated elements are spilled before consumption if Jesus' true presence is really in the elements? In response, we Lutherans should always use simple, clear passages for deciding doctrine, in this case, &quot;This is my body; this is my blood.&quot; We never should use unclear or dark passages (or ideas) for establishing doctrine, in this case, the question about spilled wine/Christ's blood. It is a serious matter when any Christian questions such a &quot;sedes doctrinae&quot; passage.Luther's response to both questions would be, &quot;Since, then, He [Jesus] says here 'This is My body,' He certainly can and does make it so. ...........&quot; One area that Teigen does not cover in depth is the difference between Luther and Chemnitz on true presence outside the Sacrament of the Altar. This reviewer beleives that Chemnitz would contend that Jesus' true presence still exists and that Luther would say that outside the Sacrament no true presence exists, that is, the elements would have to be consecrated, distributed, and received.Despite such differences, this reviewer cannot say--with absolute certainty, since Scripture does not say--what does happen to Jesus' true presence in the unused elements after the Lord's Supper is finished (sometimes called the &quot;reliquae&quot;). This reviewer assumes that Jesus' presence would leave since the sacramental act is finished, and Christ's words, &quot;This do,&quot; have been completed. Nonetheless, such thought is purely speculation! Yet even if Chemnitz may be correct, how then should we as Lutherans handle the unconsumed elements, the reliquae? Chemnitz's and Luther's response was to consume all the elements (refer to Luther's letter to Wolferinus on this subject, dated 20 July 1543*). Such practice would prevent a person from taking offense; it would, also, prevent such a &quot;what if&quot; questions about the unused elements from ever being asked.If we in the modern Lutheran churches decide to continue, and most often begin, this practice of consuming all the elements, we would have to decide more carefully the right amount of wafers and wine for consecration. This would prevent an unusually large amount of consecrated elements for the pastor and elders to consume at the end of the Sacrament.Yes, Teigen's book unflinchingly looks into a subject that many Lutherans would prefer to forget: it makes us uncomfortable thinking that our modern-day practice may be incorrect. This reviewer, nevertheless, must agree with Teigen because Teigen agrees with Luther and Chemnitz, both of whom were right. In truth, this reviewer would go as far as to say that any person who denies that consecration effects true presence makes the Lord's Supper into a human work. For then only one other conclusion exists: it is our work (distribution and reception) that effects Jesus' true presence. When a Christian denies the power of the Lord's Word to cause true presence, such denial removes the spiritual comfort that this means of grace provides. For is not a means of grace completely God's work, and not ours?* Excerpts from the Wolferinus letter:&quot;For if such a quick breaking off of the action really exists, it will follow that after the speaking ..........&quot;&quot;Therefore, we shall define the time of the sacramental action in this way: it starts with the beginning the Our Father and lasts until all have communicated, have emptied chalice, have consumed the hosts, the people have been dismissed, and [the minister] has left the altar. In this way, we shall be safe and free from the scruples and scandals of such endless questions. Dr. Philip defines the sacramental action concerning what is outside it, that is, against reservation of and processions with the sacrament. He does not split it up within [the action] itself, nor does he define it in a way that it contradicts itself."},{"Title":"Sharks Tattoos (Dover Tattoos)","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my BFF's 6 year old son and he has had so much fun wearing these.

But the real wealth here is the treatment of UI, UG, EI, and EG.

Wuest, M.S. in Computer Science, AI, Data FusionCaveats to the Rating:1. You had better be willing to work at this book2. This is a classical, analytical approach3. The terminology is not the easiestStrengths of this book:1. Serial proof notation2. Much emphasis on the accurate representation of ideas3. The approach to formal logic is analytical (as opposedto brute force, \\"sub-logical\\" algorithms such asresolution). This provides a theoretical background forsound algorithm design that is lacking in programmers onlyfamiliar with resolution4. The quantified exercises given begin to develop intuitionas to the most efficient ways to combine multipleoperations--such heuristics are key to designing automatedproof generators.5. I have only found about 1 error in the answers.I agree with the comment of Mayer: many technical people do notknow how to accurately represent English statements in a formallogic notation. I work with engineers, and have observed theconfusion of cause and effect in their rule writing, and theconfusion of abductive pattern matching with deductive reasoning(abductive pattern matching is not covered in the book).Exercises in representing English sentences in symbolic logicnotation would soon fix this confusion.I rate one of the strengths of Copi's notation to be the serialproof (as opposed to tree). Tree notations blows upcombinatorially, and become useless for anything but toyproblems.

It is not very current or modern, and it's probably not appropriate for teaching logic in the math or computer science departments, but otherwise, it's a lovely book. The two nicest features of this book are the wealth of interesting exercises and the emphasis on language: The correspondence between sentences in English and propositions in logic.Re the logical structure of English sentences, I would like to note that I used many of the exercises from this book in a logic class I taught a few years ago, and was stunned to see the difficulties students were having: Difficulties in comprehending the logical structure of a sentence in English and then expressing this structure using Boolean connectives and quantifiers. I found this discovery both alarming and curious."},{"Title":"Symbolic logic","review":"Copi's textbook lays out all of the basic concepts in symbolic logic necessary for more advanced work as well as many of the fundamentals of discrete mathematics. Some people have commented that his treatment is outdated, but a thorough understanding of chapters 6, 8, and 10 should equip anyone to understand the newer forms of notation. Chapter 7 is notably excellent but seemed out of place. As the most advanced of the whole book, it relates more than later chapters to the \\"further reading\\" topics. Proof of the redundancy of \\"indirect proof\\" (chapter 3?) and multi-modal logic were other very notable highlights.A few criticisms: Copi explains the quantification rules of first order predicate logic rather tersely for a primer, and I was glad to have used Virginia Klenk's book originally when encountering these concepts. (Although Klenk's explanation of EI and UG are non-standard and will make transitioning very confusing if you cannot grasp the validity of her methods.) The index only provides a step by step answer key for selected exercises, which leaves stuck if Copi has solved only one problem to demonstrate some concept which still isn't clear. Finally, the binding on this book is just cheap. On all copies that I have encountered, the glued pages were breaking away from the spine after only a few months of regular use. Perhaps the newer edition is better, but I haven't had experience with it.Despite these rather minor shortcomings, Copi's work unfolds almost as systematically as the content it teaches. This is an excellent introduction."},{"Title":"Symbolic logic","review":"Anyone who is looking for reassurance and confirmation for what they have picked up from different logic books will eventually come across Copi's Symbolic Logic. True, the explanations can be a bit ungenerous for some of the exercises - aren't they always in any textbook for a recreational logic student - but the clarity of style and the selection of examples motivate the reader to push themselves harder. The examples themselves are neither modern nor outdated. They appeal to the basic building blocks of language, shorn of pretence and ornament. In the treatment of the matter Copi heads off the reader and asks the vexing questions himself. The notation is user friendly and will not deter a non-maths graduate. Where the book comes short is a cheap cover and sparse answers to the exercises - kind of understandable given the scope of some answers in logic. Help is at hand from Peter Suber's website where there are more copious translation tips from English into symbolic logic and answers to the exercises which Copi doesn't give.

In addition to the discussion of symbolic notation that I was seeking, I also greatly enjoyed Copi's discussion of the relationships between meta and object languages. One minor drawback (later editions may have addressed this point) is the absence of answers at the back of the text.I highly recommend this book to anyone like my self that is looking for either a reference or a review of symbolic logic.
