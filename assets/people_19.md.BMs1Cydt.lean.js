The character of Harper seems weak-willed and too dependent upon her \\"brother\\" for everything. She has some moments of standing up for herself, but immediately goes looking for her brother to save the day and make her life all right again.It's the desperateness of needing her brother that doesn't sit well with me.

However, I found it rather disturbing, and then when I read something (you will read below) I just put it down and I was done. I read ALOT and love mysteries. I kept hearing about this author and requested this book at the library and began to read immediately. As I kept reading, I got more and more disturbed with this character, Harper. Here are some examples.First of all, the relationship she has with her stepbrother is CREEPY! My husband has a twin sister and I kept reading excerpts from the book to him regarding this relationship. His response was laughter and a WOW. Just one example is- and remember this is her stepbrother! - \\"I loved hugging Tolliver, who was bony and hard and warm. I loved to listen to the air going in and out of his lungs, the swoosh of his heart.\\" They call each other honey and really have a creepy relationship in my book.Another thing that bothers me is her nonchalant attitude about the dead. This bothered me - she was talking about her worst dead find, which was a baby. then she said, \\"But mostly it's not so bad, Mostly it's girls who don't come home, or older people who run away. Sometimes abducted kids - \\" REALLY! That's not so bad !!!! She is a freak!!!And here was the part of the book that made me stop reading this garbage.She was jogging and 3 guys in a truck pull up, block her way and get out of the truck. She asks them if they are going to rape her - they say No and this is what she thinks in her head. 'Of course real men should be ready to have any sort of sex, any time. So if they didn't want to rape me, I must not be desirable'.

Harper was struck by lightning as a teenager, and with the support of her pseudo-brother Tolliver, she finds dead bodies through a psychic-like sense. Fans of her darker Lily Bard series will enjoy the touch of dry wit and fans of the slightly lighter Sookie Stackhouse novels will appreciate Harper's unique supernatural situation. With her hint of romance, thick mystery, and sense of humor, I personally will be enjoying this series for as long as Harris chooses to write it."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Female character that has a difference that makes her all the more remarkable.

The setting is modern day, the victims a teenage couple, and the \\"detectives\\" the psychic and her step brother, who are investigate reluctantly.Overall, this novel is nicely written, enjoyable, entertaining, and closes nicely. On the other hand . . . the mood is pessimistic and glum; the pshychic and her brother actively seek one night stands with complete strangers (which grosses me out); the psychic spends way too much time feeling sorry for herself; and the third quarter drags on a bit. Still, I enjoyed it and I'll read the sequel."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I really like Charlaine Harris as an author.

I was interested in seeing what she could do with another cast of characters. She did well.The storyline and world view are completely different from Sookie's world in this first book of this series. Harper Connelly has the unusual ability to sense dead people and experience their last moments. She's accompanied by her step-brother, Tolliver, who also acts as her manager and major support system as they take cases finding missing persons, presumed to be dead. Harper is a darker character than Sookie. She doesn't have that same sense of humor that gets Sookie through her predicaments, but her background probably effectively squelched that for her as she was growing up. Still, she's a compelling character with human frailties and issues that she's forced to deal with daily, in addition to handling the superstitions and often outright antagonism that she often brought out in others because of her 'dealings' with the dead.All in all I thought this was a well-written and riveting first novel of this series. I enjoyed meeting this new cast of characters and following them through their attempts to escape the town that threatened to keep them from leaving and telling their secrets. I'm looking forward to reading more in this series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I picked up Grave sight because I LOVE Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire series. I really enjoyed Grave sight and the concept of finding dead bodies. Scary concept, but the way Charlaine writes, totally believable. I was happy to find it was more of a mystery then the vampire series. It has the super natural, but more down to earth then the shape shifters, vampires, warewolves and other very interesting characters in the Sookie Stackhouse series. I really love the characters in the Harper Connelly mysteries. I just started on Grave Surprise and am enjoying the 2nd book even more. I'm pretty sure I will be making my way thru all of Charlaine Harris' Books. She's a wonderful writter and her books are filled with wit and charm. I look forward to reading every word she puts on paper."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"The first thing I will say is that the premise is really very interesting. The main character, Harper Connelly, was struck by lightning when she was a teenager and now has the ability to sense where corpses are and, upon getting close enough, witness their final moments. A horrid poverty-stricken past and lack of marketable skills leads Harper to turn this strange ability into a job, with her stepbrother Tolliver coming along to act as bodyguard, support, companionship, and someone to run the check to the bank to keep the person who hired Harper from changing his or her mind about paying. (Apparently many people don't like being told how their loved ones died, despite hiring Harper to find out; the book includes a scene with an old woman who is firmly convinced her husband was killed by his ex-wife and nearly becomes hysterical when Harper informs her that the cat did it.)This lifestyle requires Harper and Tolliver to be almost constantly on the move, especially since Harper has a \\"get in, find body, get out\\" mentality. However, when they are called to the town of Sarne to find the body of a teenaged girl, Teenie, things are a bit more difficult than usual. Teenie's been missing for over six months, and many assume her body is somewhere in the woods near where her boyfriend was found shot. The boyfriend's mother wants to clear up the town rumor that the boy killed his Teenie and then shot himself. But when Harper finds the body and tells everyone that Teenie was definitely murdered, and almost certainly not by her boyfriend, she and her brother find themselves in danger.I did a bit of searching before starting to write this, and I was quite surprised to find out that, while this is the first book of the Harper Connelly mysteries, Charlaine Harris was already a well-established author when it was published. The plot line is rather a good one, but the writing seems rather amateur to me. For example, this paragraph: \\"Tolliver tossed down the aged magazine he'd been riffling through. He pushed himself up from the fake-leather chair. Tolliver's twenty-seven. His mustache has a reddish cast; otherwise, his hair is as black as mine\\" (Grave Sight pg. 5). First of all, that description of Tolliver's hair color comes out of nowhere, even when read with the rest of the page, and it goes nowhere. We get two sentences about hair color and then back to the plot. It's sudden and unnecessary. Secondly, this paragraph has is but one example of the flow problems that pop up here and there throughout the whole book. Notice that the first three sentences have no pauses and are all rather short. This similarity between them disrupts flow and can knock a reader out of the book, which is what happened to me several times. Very few things annoy me as much as being distracted while trying to read a good book, especially when the distraction is a problem with the book itself.Even with that, however, this is definitely on my Recommended list. The plot is engaging, the characters are interesting (though a couple of the minor ones are a bit flat), and I love the talent that Harper has.Does include profanity and one slightly descriptive sex scene.(this review can also be seen at http://rompwithjoy.blogspot.com/2008/10/writers-perspective-grave-sight-by.html)"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Charlaine Harris has such a fun, light style of writing. If you like her Sookie Stackhouse novels because of their wit and sarcasm as well as their creatures, then you can read the Harper Connelly books for dessert. So, grab a couple scoops of frozen Cool Whip, and settle down in your favorite chair, and prepare to enjoy a slightly altered reality for a couple hours.FYI, for such a quick read, Charlaine provides superior character development and sound geographical references. And if you read with an open mind, she finds a way to poke fun at all the bigots in the world, without offending anyone in particular.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. I will certainly be reading the follow-up books."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This was a very good book. I got pulled in right from the start, as I would expect from Charlaine Harris. If you like her southern vampire novels, you'll probably like this book. Harper connelly sees the last moments of someone's life, and has used this gift to her advantage, though not everyone likes the things she finds. It's definately worth a read. Or two!"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I'm probably only one of two people in the world who isn't a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series *g* but I was definitely looking forward to reading Charlaine Harris's GRAVE SIGHT. I wasn't disappointed--I think this book is an excellent start to a new series.Harper and her brother, Tolliver, are both interesting and well-developed characters with the requisite flaws to keep them entertaining. When Harper was a teen-ager, she was struck by lightning--and given an extraordinary gift in the form of the ability to find dead bodies, and relive their last moments of life (i.e. tell how they died). She travels around the country with her brother as her assistant/bodyguard/accountant, traveling to aid whoever has hired her to find the body of a loved one or determine if they met with foul play.As they travel to the town of Sarne, the bodies start piling up, Harper and Tolliver are suddenly suspects in a murder, and the suspect list just keeps growing and growing. The outcome was definitely, at least to me, unexpected, and I thoroughly enjoyed this beginning of Ms. Harris's new series.The only small problem I had with the book was it's verrrrry slow-moving pace. I felt like the whole book could have been told in about 100 less pages, but it might just be that I was feeling in a hurry. =)Overall, GRAVE SIGHT was a dark, brooding, suspenseful read--just the kind I like!"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I love every book I've read by Charlaine Harris and this one is no exception. The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it was too short. The book wrapped up everything completely... it's just it took me about 4 hrs to read and I wanted more!"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This book lacks the supernatural element in the Sookie books, but it was still a very driven mystery. I enjoyed it, but I felt the ending was too predictable. I didn't feel any real buildup in suspense. I enjoyed learning about Harper and Tolliver more than the acutual mystery. I would definitely recommend this book to any fan of Charlaine Harris."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"At the beginning of the book, when Harper is describing how she and her stepbrother get in to town, find a corpse, cash their check, and get out, I wondered how Harris would get her characters to stick around long enough to get involved in a murder mystery. Not to worry, Harris has some plausible plot ideas up her sleeve. Before you know it, Harper is up to her elbows in trouble. While I was pretty sure, halfway through the book, that I'd guessed the bad guy's identity, Harris tossed in a few more plot twists that caught me by surprise. It was a fun read all the way. I'm assuming this is the start of a new series; if it isn't, I'll be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Harper after being struck by lighting can find bodies if the price is right. Her brother Tolliver handles the business end while watching out for Harper. What should be a simple job find a missing girl in a small town turns into a murder mystery. I like the book the only fault I had with it is I figured out the killer before Harper and Toliver did. Still in all if you are looking for a good read this is it."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I quite liked this book, not least because the main characters and the secondary figures have some substance to them. Like almost every one of these \\"first in a series\\" books, the main characters don't develop much over the course of the plot. But some of the minor characters do, and--more interestingly--nobody in the book is just blandly nice, stunningly gorgeous, or gifted with amazing and ever-growing super-powers. Neither the main character, Harper, nor her brother has great people skills--a huge handicap when your business is based on working with the bereaved. In fact, Tolliver is kind of a jerk, even toward his sister, and Harper blames all the problems she has with clients on the clients themselves, saying that nothing she does will affect the outcome because they all resent her for not working for free. On the other hand, just because they're flawed doesn't mean Harper and Tolliver are unlikeable. I would recommend this book to people who like their mysteries laced with a little fantasy and want to be exposed to characters with believeable personal problems."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I thoroughly enjoy the Sookie Stackhouse novels, and I was curious to see the difference between Ms. Harris' two heroines--I was not disappointed. Where Sookie is warm, friendly, and disguises most of her most painful neuroses with a tight smile, Harper Connelly has had a rough enough life to not feel obliged to smile unless she truly feels it. I enjoyed Harper's 'brittle' toughness, and truly felt for the incredible vulnerability she tries so hard to ignore in herself. Her talent is original, and nicely defined, and her emotional fragility is entirely believable. I also liked the easy banter between Harper and Tolliver--and I can see why neither of these characters will yield to the bond and attraction that is so obviously intense that in excludes a possibility of a normal relationship outside the two of them. I gave this novel five stars because I felt that as the first novel of the series, it was laying the (excellent!) foundation for what is going to be some awesome character development in the future--another reason to rank Ms. Harris in my top ten reasons to love reading modern femme centered sci-fi:-)"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"After being struck by lightening, Harper Connelly can locate dead people and know if they died of natural causes, committed suicide, or were murdered. Relatives of missing people hire Harper to find their missing loved ones. Harper knows how they died because she senses the last minutes of the individual's life. Right now she and her step-brother Tolliver are in the Ozark town of Sarne, hired to find Teenie, a missing teenage girl.Harper finds the burial place and knows that the girl was murdered. She also discovers that Teenie's boyfriend didn't kill her and in remorse committed suicide but was murdered as well. Hollis, one of the police officers working the homicides, is interested in Harper who tells him that his wife Sally, the sister of Teenie was murdered and not an accident victim. Someone wants Harper and Tollivar gone and that person will not hesitate to use violence if it results in getting rid of them permanently.Considering that the heroine can find a dead body and learn how they died, she is amazingly normal and treats her skill like any of her other five senses. She even make a living out of it, not to exploit people but to give closure and sometimes even helping her client figure out who killed them if it was a homicide. Fast pacing, excellent character development and a strong storyline make GRAVE SIGHT an excellent reading experience. This fabulous opening gambit affirms that every series Charlaine Harris creates is utterly fantastic.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I read the first chapter before buying it the hardcover. It's worth it. For readers who gravitate to characters first, then plot, don't let the initial difference in tone put you off.As it's been said, much more serious and darker tone, but all of it is approprriate for the character of Harper. I must emphasize that this time Charlaine Harris has created heroine who is a survivor of a physical tragedy, and this often changes the outlook and personality of real life survivors too. Add the traumatic childhood backstory and her attitude fits together within the heroine's perspective perfectly.Sookie's personality comes across so cheerfully because she's just such a downhome sweetheart who is morally bound to be good at all times. (Nevermind that thing with Debbie Pelt). The underlying thread between the characters is that they both are constantly reminded of how their very useful talents are also very unwelcome. Harper and Sookie have a lot more in common than you might recognize at first.I have also noticed the physical side of most warrior princess heroines are human but a little pronounced. Sookie is blonde and cute and stacked. Doesn't do much excercise, but is in excellent physical shape. Harper, like LKH's Anita Blake, is big into running for excercise. She is compensating for a weak leg. Running is a metaphor for Harper's situation. In her world, she must fight or take flight. She runs away from or tries to compensate for some lack, and she comes off a little worn down by the struggle. Not hopeless, just realisitic.This makes her all the more appealing to me."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"As an avid reader of both the Lily Bart and the Sookie Stackhouse series, I immediately ordered GRAVE SIGHT and was anything but disappointed. Too, having briefly lived in a small Arkansas town, the flavor of Sarne Arkansas is just right in GRAVE SIGHT. Too right for me because I didn't enjoy the experience---it's wretched to have no privacy even if one has nothing to hide, since everyone knows you and yours as soon as you move in. One is reminded of Agatha Christie's village life in her Miss Marple books. Give me the peaceful anonymity of even a small city, please!That said, it's really a compliment that Harris gets the life of Sarne so right: the claustrophobia, the caste system, the lack of choice and variety regarding almost anything, and the lack (in most cases) of sophistication. Actually, that's probably the whole point of small town or village life. Harris shows it so well that, to me it's a negative, admittedly due to my own personal quirk.Another item on the negative side is that while I agree with one of the former reviews which ended with a statement about not being able to like Harper Connolly much, I must qualify the negative and say that there's lots of room for her to grow on us in future books, I think. None of Harris' characters are as appealing as Sookie Stackhouse due to her particular quirks and her vulnerability; Lily and Harper have tough shells, which is understandable to some degree, but we like the fact that Sookie really hasn't bothered to develop one and we like her all the more for it. (It's excellent that the Southern Vampire books are to become an Alan Ball series of HBO in the future!)Yet you'll note I gave the book 5 stars. I did because painful descriptive accuracy and minor character flaws certainly don't make GRAVE SIGHT any less an enjoyable read. The plot makes it a page turner and to continue on the positive side, Harper's ability is interesting as hell. She can find a missing body and tell how that person died, but not who did it. She is sensitive to all the dead but in various levels of discernment due to the various conditions of the dead. This strange ability is the result of the fact that she was struck by lightning some years before and Harris' descriptions of the phenomenon as it affects those struck is particularly vivid.So, bear up under the burden of small-mindedness and resulting potential as well as actual violence for the backdrop of GRAVE SIGHT and you will enjoy this first in a series as much as I did. I seriously look forward to Harris' future work in the series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"After reading the reviews on this page, I couldn't help but wonder if I had read the same book. The main character, Harper, was struck by lightning as a teenager, leaving her with the ability to sense dead bodies, and sometimes relive their final moments. Not a comfortable talent to be sure. As some of the reviewers pointed out, Harper is very needy and totally dependent on her \\"brother\\" - who by the way, IS IN NO WAY RELATED TO HER. Harper's mother married Tollivar's father, they are stepbrother and stepsister. The marriage took place in Harper and Tolliver's teenage years, so they weren't even raised together. It is obvious to me that Tolliver is deeply aware of this fact and loves Harper totally - and not as a sister. Harper is the one who has yet to realize her feelings for Tolliver are not those of brother and sister, but are the feelings one has for mate. Yes, Harper is pretty needy, dependent, but I also realized it was from the trauma she had undergone from the lightning, new talent, terrible family background and even her younger sister being stolen years ago. As the book went on, Harper started doing more for herself - especially finding a slight strength as Tolliver spent time in jail. I believe that as the series goes on, Harper will emerge as a strong female character, who realizes she loves Tolliver, and not as a brother. But as for the story itself, it was too convoluted and elaborate. Entirely too many characters were introduced with not enough background on each of them to give you insight or a clue to their motivation. I will buy the next book in this series to see where Harper and Tolliver develop from here, but if the next book is overdone like this one, it will be the end for me. I think the major flaw of the book is that while I developed tons of empathy for Harper, I failed to like her. Definitely not a failing of the Sookie Stackhouse books."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Harper Connelly sees dead people. No, really. She does see dead people. After being struck by lightning as a teenager, Harper developed a special skill. She can sense dead bodies. And if she comes into contact with the dead by touching them or their grave, she can see their last moments.It's not a huge surprise that Harper is hired to find the body of Monteen \\"Teenie\\" Hopkins. Presumed a runaway, Teenie has been missing since the day her boyfriend was found dead; his death an apparent suicide. But when Harper arrives and stands on the dead boy's grave, she soon knows he was murdered, and so was Teenie.Harper and her brother Tolliver soon become wrapped up in the why of the case. Why were these two kids dead? What had happened to them? Soon, someone is gunning for Harper. She is shot at and nearly killed, then Tolliver is jailed on bogus charges. Someone is trying awfully hard to cover up information related to these deaths, but Harper will have to figure it out before she joins Dell and Teenie six feet under.I am quite a fan of Charlaine Harris'. I read the Sookie Stackhouse series, which I really love. So when I heard \\"Grave Sight\\" was being published, I was pretty excited. Unfortunately, I was a bit letdown by this novel. I thought the premise was very good, but something about the execution of it was all wrong. Harper was likeable enough, as was Tolliver and the other characters. I think my problem was with the plot. I wasn't very interested in the story, while I liked the characters and the idea of them.I will definitely give any further adventures of Harper and Tolliver a look before I drop the axe on this series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"After partaking of the first books in both the Sookie Stackhouse Southern Vampire series and the Harper Connelly series (Grave Sight & Grave Surprise), I have to say I prefer Harper and her brother Tolliver to Sookie and her friends. The Sookie series is much lighter fare with humor abounding. Her exploits revolve around her ability to read the minds of the living and her involvement with vampires who have 'recently come out of the coffin' and are now living in her hometown of Bon Temps. Harper, whose job it is to wander the country with her brother Tolliver reading the minds of dead folks, often encounters prejudice, disbelief and violence on the part of those who've hired her to find out how and why their loved ones have died. In my mind, the big difference between these series is that the Sookie Stackhouse novels put more emphasis on romance with a side order of mystery. The Harper Connelly novels are mysteries with a little dash of romance to season the storyline. Many of the negative reviews here seem to be from Sookie fans who don't like the path Ms. Harris has taken in the Harper novels. I think it's fine that she's begun writing books that may interest a different audience."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This is a paranormal mystery.The sleuths are a \\"brother sister\\" pair - she can talk to the dead, he protects her from the world.Once again, Harris brings us a real-life heroine, despite her gift/handicap. She's strong in some ways, but horribly flawed in others. She runs to keep herself fit, yet is scared of thunderstorms. She reads all the time, but hasn't a memory for jeopardy details. She's a woman you might know, but of course, you don't.Ms. Harris tells the story of Harper and Tolliver with the same gift she brings to all of her books. They are live, gritty people in a live, gritty world. They find humor in the strangest places, much as anyone would.The lower rating is for the story itself. I found the criminals frustrating, the story itself was almost disturbing (not in an \\"Along Came A Spider\\" kind of way) in the offhand manner in which people killed others. The basic plot loses that grip of gritty realism that often lies just below the fantasy of Ms. Harris's stories.This was not as entertaining as Sookie, and not as riveting as the Shakespeare opener, but is a good read anyway! If only it didn't basically say at the end... read the next book (I always subtract a star from my ratins for obvious sequel plugs).(*)>"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"As a fan of her southern vampire series, I was eager to read another book by this author. Grave Sight is a murder mystery with a twist of the weird. I enjoyed the book very much, but I was not expecting the more serious tone. The S.V. series is more light hearted, whereas there is a somewhat meloncoly tone here. It is still well written and enjoyable however, and I recommend it to fans of Charlaine Harris."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Let me first state that I really wanted to like this book. Not because I've enjoyed other series by this author (although I have) but because I truly thought the premise behind it was a good one.I can be very forgiving when it comes to books ... I realise that not every book by the same author is going to have the same success as it's cousin. And every author has an off \\"book\\" ... where they just can't seem to bring it all together.This is Charlaine Harris' \\"off\\" book.The book starts off promisingly enough, with a good set-up and an intriguing first few pages. However, shortly after the first 10 pages it goes downhill.Harper is presented as a woman with a gift, who's had a traumatic upbringing (riches to rags) and been sold down the river by her mother. Her step-brother Tolliver is in the same boat, with his father having discovered drink and drug shortly before discovering Harper's mother. Somehow, we are expected to believe these 2 children single handedly raise their 2 younger sisters (who are mentioned almost passingly and have no real reason for being as it relates to the story) and that, when Harper is struck by lightning, Tolliver assumes a paternal/husband type role with her. OK, weird ... but OK, I can forgive this.Then we get into the presentation of their relationship ... we're supposed to buy that Harper is strong enough to withstand what she sees and be mature enough about herself to be on her own but, throughout the entire book she does nothing but behave as though she were a petulant 7 year old who just had her lollipop taken away. Tolliver, who spends a good majority of the book vascillating between over-bearing husband-figure and self-sacrificing brother who has been saddled with caring for his disabled sister, seems to be more like a handsome plot device than caring sibling-type. It's almost as though this book were more a giant device for presenting Ms Harris' ability to work through her own issues than an actual work of fiction that could be accepted as \\"viable\\".Again, I really wanted to like this book ... but, by page 50, I had already picked out the bad guy, worked through my own \\"Daddy issues\\" along with all the other women in the book and had managed to develop an almost hatred for the inter-reactions of Tolliver and Harper.I'm going to try another series and see if it appeals to me ... but if not, I at least know Ms Harris does have talent in other series ... and I can always re-read those."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"If only the writing of the preface of Grave Sight wasn't positively awesome, I would not have had such great expectations for the latest from Charlaine Harris. BUT, the body of the book wasn't the gripping caliber of the preface. The premise is an interesting one - a young woman who was struck by lightning when she was 16, and it changed her life - the trauma added a new sense - the ability of finding the dead and seeing how they died - She now travels around with her step-brother helping folks find their missing loved ones - for a price - The story bogs down as Harper gets too wrapped up in the small town intrigues, and you lose track of what she does -If Ms. Charlaine centers on the premise of the talent of the characters, and what drives them, she'd have a great series.Hopefully the next in this series will take off."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I really liked the Sookie Stackhouse series so figured this one would be good as well. WRONG. Boring characters, boring plot. It took a lot of effort just to finish this book.This is a terrible series. Of course now that I have gotten through the last few Sookie books, I begin to think the good ones in that series were just a fluke. Charlaine Harris is grossly over-rated and is really a below-average writer."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I too read this b/c of vampire series. I expected this to be different, and it is. I liked the grimmer heroine but found the plot predictable.

I also found the romance lackluster, but that too was okay b/c Harris' eye for atmosphere kept me reading."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Because I'm having a hard time waiting for the next Sookie Stackhouse book I gave 'Grave Sight' a go. Unfortunately, its just okay. The first thing one notices is the type is set in such away to strech a short story into a full book. It should have been left a short story. Everything is there to make a fun read - the slow development of main characters, the slight amount of background that you know will be uncovered in another book, the oddity of her gift. But its just not enough. More Sookie please."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"It was okey, but I'd skip pages to get on with the story, To me it wasn't a hang on every word book"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"There have been some very negetive reviews about this book and because of them I waited until the local library had this in. I'm glad I did because while it wasn't terrible, it certainly wasn't as colorful as the Southern Vampire novels or as deep.SPOILERS: Harper is a girl who can find spirits and she has her step-brother Tolliver manage her bookings. While some people found their relationship totally creepy, I actually understood why Harper was so dependant on him (the girl had been zapped by lightening and he saved her life with CPR). I personally didn't read any hint of sexuality between them, but some people said the subtext and dependancy bothered them.Because the two move around so much, the supporting characters introduced didn't have flavor. In the back of my mind was the idea that we'll never hear from them again in the next book. That's not to say the story wasn't interesting...it was a good read (especially since I got it from the library). But it definitely lacked the richness from her previous novels and I really hope she gets back to Sookie and the \\"job in March\\" Eric wants her for."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I usually enjoy Charlaine Harris so much, and was excited to read a new series. I did finish this book, but I never connected with the characters. The story wasn't edgy enough. The characters weren't charming or funny.

In Grave Sight she, Harris, does not disappoint. The mystery is solid, the new characters and their problems are well drawn and believable, and the writing is thoroughly enjoyable. I recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries with a twist."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This wasn't a bad novel by any means. However, I expected something different from Charlaine Harris as I'm a huge fan of her Sookie Stackhouse books. Harper Connelly was hit by lightning as a child, enabling her to sense where the dead are located. She can't communicate with the dead but she can tell how they died and will often get a flash of their memory of their death. Her stepbrother, Tolliver, handles the business end of things and offers emotional support to Harper as she is terrified of thunderstorms and still has some physical ailments that affect her if she is upset or doesn't eat properly. The novel begins with Harper and Tolliver arriving in the town of Sarne, Arkansas, to locate a missing teenager, Teenie Hopkins, whose boyfriend, Dell Teague, was found dead in the woods, allegedly a suicide. Most folks in the town believe Dell killed Teenie prior to killing himself. Dell's mother, Sybil Teague, initially changes her mind about hiring Harper but decides to hire her after Harper proves her ability exists. Harper finds Teenie and in the process clears up the town mystery- both Teenie and Dell were murdered by another party. Unfortunately for Harper and Tolliver, the murderer believes they know more and this sets off a series of events, including the arrest of Tolliver on trumped-up charges. Meanwhile, many of the town fear Harper's ability and she is attacked twice. The mystery is eventually resolved but I found myself wanting to understand more about the relationship between Harper and Tolliver as well as why neither seems to have other emotional attachments. I also felt like the town of Sarne was populated with too many creepy characters who were mainly one-dimensional, including even Harper's lover, Hollis Boxleitner. However, I will read the next novel in the series just to see where Harris takes this one. Overall, this was worth reading but don't expect a Sookie Stackhouse style novel."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I'm excited about Ms. Harris new series. As always, her characters are well written. Harper and Tolliver are only trying to make a living from Harper's handicap (finding dead people). They are asked to come to a small town to see if they can find a missing girl. Harper does find the girl, but doesn't provide the answer the town is looking for. A murder occurs after they leave the town and when asked, they return. Ms. Harris has crafted a great story, there is tension between Harper and Tolliver (brother/sister tension IMO) and it seems everyone in town is kin in some manner. A GOOD read, can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Since she was struck by lightning years before, dead bodies have spoken to Harper. They don't say much--mostly just a description of where they are and how they died--but it's enough for Harper to make a career out of it. Accompanied and protected by her stepbrother, Tolliver, Harper finds bodies--for money. In small-town Sarne, Arkansas, there are plenty of bodies to be found. The civic leaders hire Harper to find a missing girl. Sure she might have run away, but she disappeared at the same time as a local boy ended up dead. Harper finds the body--and discovers that the dead girl was murdered.Although Harper has done her job, the locals are anything but grateful--and Tolliver is quick to make sure their check is cashed before they can do anything about it. But when the dead girls mother is murdered, Harper and Tolliver are asked not to leave town--and the hostility grows ever greater. It isn't Harper's job to solver murders--that's for the police to do--but increasingly she is drawn into the mystery, turning up clues that no one had bothered looking for.Author Charlaine Harris really gets into the head of protagonist, Harper. As a reader, you can almost feel the tingle that Harper feels when she nears a body, almost hear the whispers in her head as she walks through a graveyard, each rotting corpse whispering the secrets of their death. Harper's (many) vulnerabilities make her more sympathetic, balancing her talent with a host of weaknesses. The story suffers a bit from a lack of a real story goal. Harper resists being drawn into the mystery (it isn't her job), and doesn't actively pursue its solution. As a result, Harris relies on tactical dangers to maintain a high level of suspense.GRAVE SIGHT isn't perfect as a story, but Harper's vivid character leaves an impression."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"_Grave Sight_ by Charlaine Harris was a very pleasant surprise. The story is about a woman named Harper Connelly who can sense the remains of a corpse and can relive the last moments before death of the person who became the corpse. She makes a living by this, and is accompanied by her step-brother Tolliver Lang. She & Tolliver grew up in a very fractured and dysfunctional household, and the early childhood traumas still affect them.Harper is hired to find the remains of a high-school girl who is missing in Sarne, Arkansas. Sarne is a small town and Harper and Tolliver run into the typical small-town politics. Everyone is related to everyone else; someone is dating, marrying, or just plain having sex below their social strata and someone else is upset about it; and there are high school kids and adults whose horizons are so limited they can't see beyond their own egos or their own need to maintain their status as the big fish (in a very SMALL pond).Harper does find the remains and also finds that no one is happy she found the remains. She finds other remains and people get even more unhappy. I'll leave it there so as not to spoil too much of the plot for those who haven't read the book yet.I liked _Grave Sight_ for the background story, the characters, the writing, and the plot. All around, it was a darned good book."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This is a darker series than Ms. Harris' others, and I really enjoyed it. The characters are fascinating; Harper is vulnerable, Tolliver, protective and, although some of their history is given, you know there's more to come. The characters in Sarne may not be likable, but they are realistic. Even though I figured out where the story was going; I enjoyed the journey and the suspense. I applaud Ms. Harris for creating a different, very interesting character, and look forward to seeing where the road takes them next."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Harper Connelly was struck by lightening when she was 15, she now has the power to find dead people. If there is a dead body nearby she can find it. Both Harper and her step-brother Tolliver travel around and find missing people, usually dead. She can't find the living only the dead. Coming from a very disfunctional family they are also searching for their lost sister, Cameron.Tolliver is a protective brother type. I kept wondering why they don't feel more than sybling love for each other. Maybe they do and just don't know it. Any way Harper is slightly needy and he takes care of her.This is a dark mystery and not quite what I expected after her other novels. Very few of these characters are likeable, Harper and Tolliver seem to just be led about by the need for their services. They are in town to find the body of a young girl who is believed to be a part of a murder/suicide. It turns out there are several murders and one happens while they are in town.I really feel this should have 3 and 1/2 stars. It is better than O K, but not good enough for I liked it. IT is somewhere in the middle.As I said this is a dark book but I did not find any humor in it. The only reason I would buy the next one is to see if a romance developes between the main characters. There is a very good mystery and I did have to get to the end and find out what was going on.I was somewhat disappointed but this series may become better as we go along. Ms Harris is a talented author and I am willing to give her another chance."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Dark? The Shakespeare series (which I love!)is one of the darkest series I have read. The Vampire series is not that dark to me, even though there are vampires, werewolves, etc., in the stories. I guess that is because the humor in those books makes them lighter.Grave Sight was a good book, not great, but entertaining to read. I knew the answer to the mystery early, but I still kept reading, because Ms. Harris writes well and her characters feel real to me. The main character tries hard not to let her affliction depress her; she wants to believe it helps the dead and their families find closure. She and her brother are treated as they would be in any small town in America where people don't like or accept strangers, especially strangers with special powers."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Given Harris' tremendously popular and enjoyable Sookie Stackhouse series, perhaps my expectations were too high when I picked up Grave Sight. This book is completely forgettable, unimaginative, and just one of the many hundreds of mediocre paranormal novels that have been published recently. Definitely not worth purchasing. Grave Sight was impossible to really \\"get into\\"; whereas a reader could lose him/herself in the Sookie Stackhouse series, this book was stilted and predictable with stereotypical characters. Three of the main characters (Tolliver, Harper, and Hollis) were just plain unlikable. The plot moved at a snail's pace and involved lots of extraneous and unnecessary scenes. While Ms. Harris had a difficult job trying to create a lead female character distinguishable from Sookie Stackhouse, her efforts fell flat. It is hard to identify with Harper Connelly, much less want to hear more about her. This is one series I won't be following.Bottom line: Grave Sight is an embarrassing flop for a writer with such raw talent- let's hope Ms. Harris will sweep this book under the rug and focus on her stellar Sookie Stackhouse series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Ms. Harris has a knack for writing these very interesting characters. This new series is no exception.In this series we once again have a heroine with some emotional baggage, but persevers with internal strength. Similiar to her Sookie Stackhouse series, our heroine does have an extra-sensory ability, but it is firmly placed in the real world which makes this book different again from her other successful series.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This is the start of another paranormal series for Harris. It is darker than her Aurora Teagarden series (which is one of her series not involving the paranormal--they are regular mystery stories). It is more comparable to her other two series, the Sookie Stackhouse southern vampire series (\\"Dead Until Dark\\"); and the Lily Bard series (also not involving the paranormal) set in the small town of Shakespeare (\\"Shakespeare's Landlord\\" being one of them, though not, I think, the first). I was not too disturbed by this \\"darkness,\\" as I discovered Ms. Harris's books via the southern vampire series, and the new series is thus far as enjoyable as that one.The emotional atmosphere here is somewhat comparable to a series by another author, Kelley Armstrong, who wrote \\"Dime Store Magic.\\" (I believe \\"Stolen\\" is actually the first of that series, but I haven't read that one yet.) The Armstrong novels, however, contain an entire paranormal heirarchy which does not appear (as yet) in \\"Grave Sight.\\" (There *is* a paranormal heirarchy in the southern vampire novels.)One of the things that I appreciated about the character of Harper Connelly is that her ability to locate dead people costs her emotional and physical energy. This makes sense and helps to make her character 3-dimensional, as she has to come up with ways to deal with the personal cost of using her talent.I also appreciated the difficult background that Harper and her brother, Tolliver, share. This adds additional dimension to both characters, and the real emotional problems stemming from their history helps to keep you interested in both them and their story.The fact that those who hire Harper are often not very kind to her is believable; many people, after all, would probably be very uncomfortable upon meeting with someone who actually was able to have any kind of contact with the dead, being worried, probably, that embarrassing things might be revealed. Such is human nature.If you are interested in a little realism mixed in with the paranormal, you'll probably enjoy this book--and much of the author's other work."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I have been a major Charlaine Harris fan and had looked forward to reading Grave Sight, a new mystery-slash-paranormal series. While Grave Sight has some clever moments that center on small town quirks and creepy back stories, the book in general was not as riveting to me as Harris's Southern Vampire mysteries. Harper has a very rare gift: she can sense and find the dead after an accident in which she gets struck by lightning. She makes a living using this particular gift (or curse, whichever way you look at it); however, people are wary and somewhat doubtful of her abilities, that is until they see her in action. Things take even more peculiar turns when Harper, along with her too-close-for-comfort stepbrother Tolliver, travel to a small town in Arkansas to help figure the death of a teenager. She tries to uncover the secret while someone tries very hard to throw them off. There are various twists throughout the novel.Charlaine Harris takes a darker approach with this offering, which is fine with me. She has taken a departure from the Sookie Stackhouse lighter style of writing and created the startup of a series that is strange and at times disturbing. Aside from Harper's peculiar abilities, the townspeople are downright unlikeable in this book. Charlaine has always written about the underbelly of rural America, but she takes things further with this book. Most of the characters here are unsympathetic and downright nasty at times. This in no way implies that all small-town folk are like this, but Harris merely illustrates a darker, more realistic side of small town life. I find Harper's closeness to Tolliver interesting if a bit unsettling. I have no doubt that we will learn more about the history between these two in future installments. All in all, Grave Sight is a good, promising startup for a new series. I like the fact that Harris uses a darker language for this particular offering, but I wasn't as riveted with this one as I was with all of the Sookie Stackhouse books. I will give this series a whirl because it does seem interesting and promising. Give this a whirl if you're a Charlaine Harris fan."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This is a good story, not a great one. I have to agree with the person that found the editing bad--it really was. There were some monster errors that should have been caught by the copy-editor.The concept is very good--I love the idea of someone sensing dead bodies. The mix of a \\"brother\\" helping her is kind of unique, but it is a bit awkward at times. I think in a future book she probably has some plans to solve that.This book is still a nice read, has some sassy parts and is a good mystery. It's just not a polished as some of her other work--in editing for certain and a tad bit in the development."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This book was a total surprise. What Ms. Harris has actually accomplished in this unassuming little story is an interesting piece of backwoods noir. Harper Connelly is a cynical, world-weary heroine whose unlikely vocation forces truth on a corrupted world. It's a supernatural mystery (that's not too difficult to figure out) turned into a not-too-pretty commentary on human nature.I'm impressed with the cinematic qualities of this story. I can see it as clearly as if it were a film (and it may be someday). But most of all I'm marveling at how perfectly suited Harper's unique ability is to uncover truth and reveal it to power - knowing where and how people die - and the inherent danger that would ensue. Although many reviewers are disappointed with the book's tone - it's not as light and entertaining as in her Sookie series - I think Harris makes her case on a more real level about human nature. This is murder and corruption, after all, and fate has placed Harper Connelly in the face of it everyday.I too like the Sookie series, although I think the first 3 books are better than the last ones in the series. This departure is more in the realm of Stephen King - I'm not certain this is a series or a one-off, but I applaud the departure. I see why Harris has been pushing this book. She's rightly proud of it."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I am an avid reader and enjoyed the Sookie Stackhouse series. Anxious to find another book or book series to read, I decided to give the Harper Connelly series a go.Wow.I will say that I read all three books with hopes that maybe it was a fluke that the first book was God awful. It was not a fluke. In all three books, the \\"bad guy\\" is so ridiculously obvious, I had the entire plot line figured out the first page said evil doer was introduced. I kept reading hoping that I was wrong, that it would have some sort of twist,some sort of anything....It didn't. By book 3, as painful as it was to keep reading, it was also amusing to see just how quicly and accurately I could sum up the plot line...since the only plot \\"twist\\" that we all saw coming from book one.If you want to repeatedly read about the effects of being struck by lightning, criticisms of her \\"brothers\\" bad complexion (perhaps related to the copious amounts of fast food and coke they indulge on?), the same traumatic childhood story over and over, and not have one surprise in an entire 3 book series, then this is for you!If you like your books to have a little meat, or if you don't want to basically read a trashy romance novel with a \\"bad guy, I see dead people\\" flair to it, then I would skip it!"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"From other reviews, I see that people who love the Sookie Stackhouse mysteries don't like these books. On the other hand, I love the Harper Connelly series and can't stand the vampire series. Possibly that's because the series are so different that they expect Harper to be more like Sookie whereas I was hoping for a character and book as interesting as the\\"grave\\" series. Doesn't mean one is better than that other--although Sookie far outsells Harper and, with the success of Sookie, there are no more books about Harper. Just four and I love them all.I suggest readers start reading these books with an open mind. These are NOT about Sookie and can be enjoyable if you read them as they are written."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Grave Sight introduces readers to a young woman named Harper Connelly, who gains the ability to find (and marginally communicate with) the deceased after being struck by lightening as a young teenager. In this first novel Harris places Harper in an inbred community in the Ozarks, where she runs into quite a bit of trouble after locating the body of a missing teenage girl.In comparison to early Sookie Stackhouse books, Grave Sight is very smartly written, and shows quite a bit of growth on the part of the author, Charlaine Harris. As a character, Harper is tragically flawed, which works to increase the reader's interest in her thoughts and actions. Unlike Sookie, there is quite a bit of depth and history to Harper, and the character is strongly developed before the plot of the novel itself even begins. Her weaknesses humanize her, and her narration reveals a deeply skeptical and cynical young woman that (perhaps sadly) fits much more easily into a modern landscape than Harris' vampire-loving waitress.One of the things I found most interesting about the book itself is the contempt Harper shows for the citizens of a small town in Arkansas. While the Stackhouse books criticize what is identified in the books as a Southern discontent with literal and figurative \\"outsiders\\", Grave Sight seems to illustrate the same kind of contempt for small Southern communities in general. Sarne is depicted as backward and corrupt from the very beginning, and is easily identified as an insincere - and often dangerous - place to be.Another detail that I found interesting in the novel is Harper's relationship with her stepbrother. While Harris overtly \\"hints\\" that their relationship raises eyebrows for more than just readers, there is a complexity to the pair that retains interest, and lays the groundwork for several possibilities as the series continues. While the desire to analyze their relationship in a Freudian sense is strong, I am attempting to withhold opinions until Harris herself develops something a bit more concrete.All in all, Grave Sight is a very interesting book, and I'm looking forward to reading the next installment in the series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Charlaine Harris has made me a fan. Not just a fan of her popular Southern Vampire Mysteries (Sookie Stackhouse novels), but a fan of her writing in general. She has a way of writing about very serious topics that concern death, lies, betrayal and suspicion and wrapping it all in a very funny and entertaining package. The first book in her Harper Connelly series is a wonderful example of that. Harper Connelly is the main character is this book/series and she finds dead people. After being struck by lightening when she was younger, she now has the ability to find dead bodies and know the cause of death. So, with this ability she and her step brother, Tolliver, make a living going where ever they are hired to go and find the body they've been hired to find. So starts Grave Sight. However, things start to look a little sour when not only does Harper find the bodies in question and how they died, but newly dead bodies start popping up all over town. Who is doing this? Why are they out to get Harper? What is going on? Harper and Tolliver are desperate to get out of town, but all these murders keep them stranded in town until the sheriff is satisfied that they aren't involved. Twists and turns abound as Charlaine Harris takes you on a ride through the Ozarks in search for the murderer and the \\"who, what, when, where, and whys\\" of this mystery.

Usually murder victims, but sometimes not.In \\"Grave Sight,\\" Harper is in Sarne, AR to find the body of a local dead girl. It seems straightforward enough but it isn't.

She is aided in her pursuits by her stepbrother, Tolliver Lang, who extends empathy and support as needed.The story of individuals who live through being struck by lightening is such an interesting topic; I had been unaware of the impact such an event can have on an individual. I found the mystery of the murders in this story to be well concealed in that I was not sure who the perpetrator(s) were until very close to the end. There are no red herrings; more like a large list of equally culpable suspects. It is much fun to read. Only one small complaint - the story could have used just a little bit of comic relief, macabre though it might have been, to lighten the grim load that Harper and Tolliver carry and the storyline in general.I am looking forward to Book 2 in the series, A Grave Surprise."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"After reading the Southern Vampire Novels, I was eager to try Ms. Harris' new series. I agree with another reviewer who felt the premise of the book was interesting, but the execution was lacking. Yes, Harper Connelly has the ability to find dead bodies since being struck by lightning at the age of 15. Yes, she makes her living with that talent and travels the country with her stepbrother Tolliver. However, this book didn't deliver the entertainment value I expected.The plot is dull - a mystery anyone could figure out half way through the book. This leaves the reader to slog through the rest of a story that lacks any entertaining characters or action.All we know about Harper Connelly by the end of this book is that she's sad, lonely, has an unusual talent and a rather creepy, co-dependent relationship with her stepbrother. Unlike Sookie Stackhouse, Ms. Harris gives us nothing about Harper to make her sympathetic or likeable. Harper and her brother spend too much time interacting with each other in the story and there are too few other characters to add much interest.I get the impression that Ms. Harris, like many popular writers, is under pressure to crank out books as fast as possible. It's a pity because she's capable of much better than the effort reflected in this story. She simply didn't do Harper Connelly justice."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This is a very dark book-even darker than the Lily Bard series. I have always enjoyed Ms. Harris' books-especially the humor and characterizations of the characters. None of that was present in this book-it was populated with deeply negative characters and the storyline itself was negative and depressing.I found the intense-and borderline psychotic-neediness and dependency of Harper to be very unattractive and unsettling. I, like previous reviewers, just don't like weak, needy women."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I am a huge fan of Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series and her Shakespere series. I bought this book expecting to be equally thrilled. I am pretty dissapointed in it.The book is good-it just isn't great, which is what I have come to expect from Mrs. Harris. The who-done-it is fairly easy to figure out early on and there really isn't much suspense in the book. I picked up on some possible sexual tension between the two main characters. Honestly they ARE step brother and sister...but it is still kind of creepy.All in all I was dissappointed with this book and don't reccommend it as a hardback buy."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"While this book about a woman who can sense dead bodies and see the how they died, is from one of my favorite authors, I have to agree that it didn't keep my attention like her \\"Dead\\" series. I agree with most reviewers, that I was uncomfortable with the relationship she has with her stepbrother. I know they depend on each other, but I thought at any minute they can jump each other and it gives me the creep out factor. The book was an easy read, but I wasn't sure I enjoyed the experience. If this is the beginning of a new series, I'll probably wait until it comes out on paperback before picking it up. I came away from this book not really caring about the main character, unlike Sookie ( who I can't get enough of!). Sorry, just not a great book overall."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Having read all the Southern Vampire Mystery Books, I considered myself a fan of Charlaine Harris's writing style. I needed something to fill the void after the latest SVM book, so I moved on to the first book of the Harper Connelly Mysteries.However, after the first five chapters, I found myself bored; it was obvious to me who the murderer(s) were going to be, and the characters seemed really one-dimensional. But, I decided to stick it out because I believe Grave Sight would get better, as the premise was interesting. In my opinion, the book did not.One of the things that I really disliked about the book was the main character, Harper Connelly. I found her manner curt and grating, and she appears weak. Harper's life just takes up space. I have no idea about her motivations, her hopes, etc. Also, it really rubbed me the wrong way how much she needed others. Reading about her shaking and crying and wanting to be next to her step-brother was just intolerable.Yes, I understand that Harper's manner was supposed to be the product of years of abuse and neglect (so therefore, I don't fault Ms. Harris for trying). But, the character herself was completely unlikable. She gives off so much negative energy, and consequently I could not enjoy the book. I like main characters that I can root for, but I didn't find one in Harper. I regret that I will not be continuing the series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed the dark tone of this book. I feel like the subtle affection between Harper and Tolliver is something that could really happen to two people in their positions.

Charlaine Harris does a great job keeping you guessing about the murderer until the very end."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I've read all of Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse books and although the first book was a little hard to get through, they continued to get much better and I loved the series as a whole. So I was excited to start on this series even after reading some not-so-great reviews. I was not impressed...at all. It started out good. I had high hopes. But the bad guy was soooooooooooo obvious right from the beginning. The jail time story line was a page filler at best. This book is not terribly long to begin with and it could have been cut in half without losing any important information. I enjoyed the two main characters, Harper and her brother. I plan to read the next book in this series hoping that they will improve like the sookie stackhouse series did. But this book was a disappointment."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I decided to read this book after reading some of the Sookie Stackhouse novels cause I liked them.

I really enjoy the Southern Vampire books, and this was no where near as entertaining. The story is plodding,even the action is monotone, the characters have lots of potential, but are dimly painted and i just couldn't care for them, the plot is predictable, the motives obvious but unrealistic, a blatant knockoff of Laurell K Hamilton's Anita Blake...all in all this was a sad attempt at mystery writing.

If you must read it, please borrow from the library."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Coming with great enthusiasm from the sookie books, I was hoping to find an equally as good series to start reading. Although the book is well-written and interesting to those who enjoy this stuff,this genre just doesn't do it for me. It's more detective story than I expected, and it was slow-goin' for me. This Sookie fan was disappointed. P.S.- there is nothing romantic about this book. At all. And no sexual tension between the two main characters."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I think Vicki nailed it in her 'great premise, bad execution' review. After I saw the story was spinning it's wheels I skipped to the end and did not miss much. What I did miss was rehashed and the ending was just to obvious."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I realize that America in general is not becoming a country of wisdom and intellect--our schools are a prime example of that as we focus more on being able to fill out a bubble sheet correctly than on actual learning. However, to assume that everyone in the country is ignorant really gets my blood boiling. One of the most recent examples of that is the lackadaisical editing found in most of today's modern novels. Do they really think we're not going to notice all the errors in the books we read?Case in point: I picked up Charlaine Harris's new book Grave Sight because I enjoy her Southern Vampire Series--they're a lot of fun if you're looking for a bit of light reading--lots of sass, attitude, interesting situations, and sexy vampires--what more could you ask for?This new series also contains paranormal aspects and the reviews I'd read seemed encouraging.That is, until I actually started reading the book.I was ready to put it down within the first dozen pages--not because of the story, but because of the seriously horrific editing. The choppy, detail by detail sentences are worthy of a high school freshman copying a bad crime novel. If the author was trying a new style, she failed, and seemed to realize this as the book moved along and the sentences began to flow more smoothly.However, it's not just the amateurish style that got to me, but the little details that any decent editor should have caught. A character's name, for example, that changes ON THE SAME PAGE ('Dale' and 'Dell' on page 117). Or this, on page 10, one of my favorite examples of bad writing, \\"The waitress had filled my coffee cup and taken my first swallow before the sheriff spoke.\\" What is the waitress doing drinking from the protagonist's coffee cup?I just want to know, how difficult is it to get someone to read a book before it is sent to the publisher? If they're having that much trouble finding people with a basic knowledge of the English language, I will gladly offer my services. As for now, I am thoroughly discouraged with this increasing trend in bad editing and I will not buy a hardback copy of a book again. I'm not going to waste that much money on a book I can get used for three bucks a couple of months later. That way, I won't feel bad for throwing it away in anger when reading another page becomes too painful to bear."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"What a bunch of drivel...the main character couldn't have a drier, more uninteresting personality if she were a soda cracker! Beyond being totally predictable as a mystery, the rude, dismissive, and completely cold and colorless attitudes of the two &#34;siblings&#34; made this book almost unreadable. Why should the reader care about anything in this book when the humorless main character barely can bring herself to care acout anything but herself? The characters in this book, with the possible exception of the policeman, are ridiculously flat and self absorbed. I've never felt the need to write a review before, but I couldn't let go of the irritation that felt reading this. The most irritating thing about it is that it could have been executed so much better by an author who even pretended to appreciate her readers by inserting even an ounce of personality into her characters. I felt like I needed to wash the dust off my hands after reading this formulaic and shallow piece of...work."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"One thing that I have to say is that it is a fast read. Besides that the book is a total letdown. First off, I kept reading it thinking it is going to get more interesting but sadly it did not. The characters are extremely uninteresting and undeveloped. The main character was hit by lightening at a young age and now can sense the dead. Besides that, that is truly all we learn about her. Oh and she has a strange fascination with her brother. Then the book takes place in the most boring town that sets the backdrop for the whole book. And lastly, you know who did it from the very beginning but you keep reading in order to find out why he did it. And the reason on why he did it is not even that plausible. I am truly sad to say that I read this book."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I love the fun and sexiness of Sookie, but I also loved the serious, no nonsense Harper!

She is great and so are her stories. Keep them coming!"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I am book worm in a readers block. I loved the Sookie Stackhouse Series and enjoyed Twilight. I am an avid reader and have been downloading sample of some books for the last 2 weeks. I decided to give a try to Charline Harries first book of the series Grave Sight. I must say that at the point I reached 50% exactly on my Kindle I started screaming in frustration. I figured out the answer to the obvious mystery. I would not recommend this book, if you are looking to continue after Sookie or Bella, it's a very fast pace book with a bunch of filling in between pages. Charlaine is a great writer it's a fast read and its not a heavy book, but honestly it's a very weak mystery."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading this book. I've read alot of mixed reviews for this series, but I wanted to give it a go and see what I thought for myself. I'm glad I did. Harper Connelly was struck by lightning when she was young, ever since she had been able to sense dead bodies. She finds them, and then she can see their last moments, find out how it was that they died.Harper gets called to Sarne to find a missing teenage girl, but when she gets there she finds that most in this small town don't want her there at all. So when she finds the girl she plans to get out as quickly as possible. Only problem is, the girl was murdered and there are more dead bodies showing up in town. Harper and her step-brother Tolliver are under suspision from the police and are asked not to leave.But, someone wants them out bad! And they're gunning for Harper and Tolliver. It looks like this time Harper may have to get involved more than she wants if she's going to get her and her brother out of this little town alive.Harper is a strange character, she brings up her crappy childhood alot, and after reading it a few times it does get kind of annoying, but she's also funny and loyal. The story kept you involved and trying to figure out what exactly was going on in this strange town. It wasn't the greatest book that I've read lately, but it was still good and I plan to pick up the next in the series soon."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Harper Connelly has the unusual job of finding dead people. Ever since she was struck by lightning as a teenager she's had the power to sense where dead bodies are located, and with the help of her stepbrother Tolliver they've put that power to good use.Harper is good about finding the body, collecting the money, and moving on, because when people (especially in small towns) treat you like a leper it's hard to stay in one place for too long. When they travel to Arkansas in search of a teenage girl's body, problems arise when Tolliver gets stuck in jail on false charges. Someone does not want Harper to solve the case, and they are doing everything to keep her scared and away. Dead bodies aren't the only issue in their lives, they also have a connection that goes beyond stepbrother and sister.Charlaine Harris has a knack for creating extremely likable characters. Harper is open, honest, caring, friendly, and stronger than she thinks. Tolliver's main goal is to keep Harper safe, and protect her from the people they run into daily. The cases are interesting and often gruesome, and I really enjoyed trying to figure out who did what to whom! There's always a mystery to solve and it's always fresh, never recycled. I look forward to reading more about Harper Connelly in future books. Also, because these are paperbacks they are a quick fun read. Perfect for busy folks! :)"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I love the premise of this book -- the fact that our heroine can see the dead -- all because she was struck by lightning when she was a teenager. As the character is developed, you can see that she is as mentally scarred by her special gift as she is about her life growing up. It will be interesting to see how the character develops as the series goes on and if she is able to conquer her past and have a \\"normal\\" life. All of this is woven into a whodunit of who killed Teeny, a local teenager, and the people of the town who have hired her to find out."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I'm a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse books, so I was skeptical that Harris could create another great character.

Everyone who loves mysteries needs to read this book and the following three!"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I liked this book because I had read all of Charlaine's Sookie stuff, even the Sookie-verse short stories. I wanted to keep reading her stuff, so I gave this one a chance first because it had a supernatural twist. I found it to be a good read, but it was a little simple in a childlike way and way too predictable at times. However, this is her first book in the series, so I knew it would take a while for Charlaine to get into her characters and flow. The books get better as they go, so give this one a chance so you can start the series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I came across this series after finishing the latest book in the True blood series. Charlene's talent of providing interesting characters is highlighted in the first book of this series. The tempo of the book is constant which is great because I didn't get bored awaiting for the next event to happen. Everyone in the book is flawed and has a more real to life feel than most murder mysteries.Harper Connelly has a unique gift which brings her to Sarne to find and determine the cause of death of a young woman. The questions come up quickly and the answers aren't always easy. Charlene's hero is a reluctant detective who only finally becomes determined to find out the who and why of this crime.I won't give anything away here. The writing is great and the ending is not as excepted and that in itself is wonderful."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I was enticed to read Grave Sight because I adore author Charlaine Harris' better-known Sookie Stackhouse Southern Vampire series, and hoped the fun might extend into Harris' new heroine, Harper Connelly. I don't seek out mysteries as a general rule, but I like Harris' characters and flip dialogue so much, I thought I'd give it a try.I wasn't disappointed, but I didn't love it as much as her other series. Harper Connelly is a unique kind of private investigator -- after being struck by lightning as a teenager, she can now sense the location of dead bodies and see their last moments on earth. Her first adventure takes place in a small Ozark town where a young girl has been murdered, and the strange tale of her demise. Of course, since its a mystery, lots of twists and turns abound.It's fun stuff, but I didn't leave the book with the \\"gotta get my hands on the next installment\\" feeling that I felt when Sookie's story was over. I will be seeking out Grave Suprise (book 2) but I don't have to make a special trip to Borders today to track it down in a frenzy."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I read this series backwards, since An Ice Cold Grave got the best reviews, and it really was the best. Still, I enjoyed all of the novels in this series immensely, and felt safe and comfortable in the hands of an expert writer. I loved how Harris gives Harper insight on her fellow Southerners. In one part of this book, Harper, very much an agnostic, is reading a corpse and sees that the person watching is giving her a certain look that she recognized, a witch-burning look, so she says something like, \\"Now she is in the hands of our dear Lord. She has passed on to the Paradise of Heaven and rests in the bosom of our sweet Lord.\\" Something like that.Very clever plotting, never done at the expense of action or character development. Where did she ever get the idea for the special gift this protagonist has? It's really quite brilliant. Who hasn't been to a graveyard and felt the pull of the bodies under the earth, as if you can almost feel them there? And who hasn't turned away from this sense in horror. Harris does what the best writers do, she writes right through that and to the interesting world that only arises when you've penetrated reflex, fear and looked clear-eyed at the world."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"As a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse novels, I am a big fan of Charlaine Harris. Though I'm not really a mystery book fan, I really enjoyed this book. Charlaine has a way to draw you into her books so that you can't put them down. She is a fantastic writer and I am so glad that I found her. It is because of writers like her that I got into reading in the first place."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"The characters are much more interesting than the plot of this mystery. Harper, the protagonist, was struck by lightening, which somehow gave her the ability to hear how people died when she is close to their corpses. She is now in business with her half-brother, Tolliver, helping people find out what happened to their loved ones. One of the strengths of the novel is the siblings' relationship--they are survivors of a very abusive childhood, and take care of each other. One of the weaknesses of the novel is its predictability--I caught on to some of the mysteries hundreds of pages before any of the characters did, and I am no Sherlock Holmes. Nonetheless, this was an entertaining read & I'll be sure to check out the next novel in the series. I do appreciate that this mystery was not too graphic."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoy the book but Harper just not the kind of character I like.. Being from the south I love being different but Harper cockyness get alittle annoying.. And sexual tension between her and Trolliver is already there, make you want scream \\" Get it over with! \\". Another wise a good book I prefer Sookie Stackhouse in the end."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This is my kind of mystery, family secrets and murder to keep them secret.Harper can find dead bodies and when she \\"touches\\" them she can tell what happened in their last minutes of life. She got this talent after being struck by lightening, you find out later she was using a curling iron to do her hair before she went out on a date and the lightening entered thru the open window beside her. Harper is scared of storms, who wouldn't be in her shoes, but the books make you wonder if it isn't because she's afraid if she is hit again that she will lose her talent and gain something worse. Harper's second is her step-brother Tolliver. Here they are the yin to the other's yang. Harper is a bit high-strung while Tolliver is cool calm and collected. She seems to be startled by every pothole she hits in life while he just lets it roll off his back. And unlike other reviews I really didn't see any romantic or sexual tension between them, but then again I wasn't looking for it either.This book took me on a rollercoaster ride with me hanging on by the seat of my pants, and I loved every minute. I don't know about you but it kept me guessing about who had done the murder until the very end."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This is my favourite of Charlaine Harris's series, after \`Southern Vampire: Sookie Stackhouse'.Fans of the Sookie books can appreciate that \`Harper Connelly' does have a supernatural bent. Harper's world is our world, real life in which there are no vampires, werewolves or fey. The \`Harper Connelly' series looks at the supernatural from a realist perspective - and Harper is a protagonist dealing with other people's pessimism and blatant distrust of her and her abilities. In this series Charlaine can explore the \`what if' aspects of the supernatural in everyday life.Like Sookie, Lily and Aurora, Harper is an ordinary woman living an extraordinary life. When she was younger Harper was struck by lightening. Ever since she has been able to \`sense' death. She turned her ability into a profession and tours the country, helping search for missing persons (for a price).You will feel conflicted about Harper's line of work - but Charlaine has written a very pragmatic character, and Harper doesn't mind defending her vocation and maintains that if she had to be lumped with a disability she may as well make money out of it. Fair enough. But there is more to Harper's working gift. For one thing, her little sister was abducted when they were children. After Harper was struck by lightening and gained her \`ability' she instantly recognized that it could be a way to find her sister - a way to finally have closure and put her guilt and worry to rest. Furthermore, there seems to be a certain connection between Harper and the spirits she feels;As much as Harper tries to maintain her pragmatism, readers will no doubt see through the armour she dons to shield herself from the weight of her gifts' responsibility.Harper is a tricky character. She does shield herself emotionally, and there is a contrast between her thoughts and actions, especially where romance is concerned. But it is clear that Harper has been burned in the past - aside from having an abusive childhood and less than stable home life growing up, her \`gift' has caused Harper to become a social pariah. People believe she is a charlatan, and those few who are convinced of her abilities believe she is a crook for not providing her services for free. So, Harper has developed a tough exterior. It makes her a fascinating woman to read. On the one hand, readers are privy to her biting wit, loyalty and compassionate nature - and we know that if people would only give her a chance they would come to see her for the amazing woman she is. But on the other hand we do see people's negative reactions to her and her gift - and as readers we want to shield her from further abuse and heartache. Unlike Sookie, Harper is living with her \`gift' without the crutch of a totally open supernatural community - and it is fascinating to see how people deal with her, and how she deals with her own uncertainties regarding her dubious \`abilities'.Like her other series, \`Harper Connelly' does have a love story at its centre. I can't give this massive spoiler away - but many fans expressed dismay when the romance came to the fore. It will throw some readers for a loop, be warned. But I personally thought Charlaine did such a wonderful job with characterisation and the slow burn of the romance that it was a natural and inevitable progression for the two characters.I love this series especially. There are moments when it is quite bleak; but that is to be expected when death is the subject matter. But the romance is definitely at the heart of the \`Harper Connelly' books, and that lightens the mood somewhat. Furthermore, Harper is a fascinating woman. For any fans of the \`Sookie' books who ever wondered what life would have been like for Sookie without the help of vampires, werewolves and fey - Charlaine is able to answer that \`what if' question through these books. It is supernatural in the real world and a completely compelling read.Unfortunately Charlaine has said the series will only go as far as 4 books. \`Grave Secret' came out October 27th 2009 and that ties up the series. What a shame. But just because it ends so quickly, that's no reason not to enjoy the hell out of it."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I finished this book last week and immediately bought the next three in the series and had them read in a few days. I could not put them down. All four books fit together to make a really riveting collection. Each of them stand alone in their ability to entertain mystery lovers, but together they complete a story of a family broken through drugs, death, and separation and how two of them remake the loving family they long for.Harper can feel corpses that are nearby and determine what caused their death, and since this is her only skill she and her step-brother,Tolliver, decide to use it to earn a living. He's her manager and handles all the money/payments portion of the business, and she is the \\"talent\\" that helps those left behind determine why their loved one died. Of course, law enforcement doesn't believe this is possible and the only way she could know how someone died is because she was somehow involved in the death. And since often she is called in by a family when there has been a suspicious death or a body can't be found run-ins with the law are inevitable.I really like Harper and Tolliver and rooted for them when they were surrounded by people who didn't believe them, wanted to kill them, and those who didn't want the truth to be known. I liked their strange friends who had their own \\"talents\\" and came to their rescue when \\"normal\\" people wouldn't help them. As Harper said, \\"the dead just want to be found\\" and all Harper wants is a house of her own. So she will use the skill she never wanted and sometimes wishes she didn't have to find the dead so someday she will get the home she longs for."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"\\"Grave Sight\\" is the first book in Harris' newest mystery series. After reading her Sookie Stackhouse books, I checked out all her other series. I am weirdly addicted to Charlaine's writing and her books will probably forever remain my guilty pleasure. I liked all Aurora Teagarden books (this librarian who lives in a tiny southern town sure finds herself in a middle of murder investigations quite often) and disliked Lily Bard series (too much pointless violence). I think I will like Harper Connelly.This series has a little paranormal element to it, but it's very far from being an outright urban fantasy (like Sookie books are). After being struck by lightning, Harper can \\"feel\\" dead bodies and their causes of death. This is the extent of \\"paranolmacy,\\" the rest is just straight mystery. In this book Harper and her step brother Tolliver are invited to Sarne, a small AR town, to help find body of a missing teenage girl. The body is found very quickly, but this discovery for some mysterious reason triggers a series of crimes, some against Harper and Tolliver. The two are forced to stay in town and eventually uncover who is behind these awful crimes.I enjoyed this book very much. I found the characters very interesting and vivid (Harris is at her best here), and mystery engaging. Even though I figured out who the perpetrator was early on, I still enjoyed the writing. I did find that Harper's back story was a bit of stretch - mother and stepfather attorneys who succumbed to their drug addiction, sister kidnapped, father in jail, the list goes on. Nevertheless, I am planning to continue reading about Harper, the 4th book in the series just came out."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"If you liked the Sookie Stackhouse series you'll like these. If the author's name was not splashed across the cover of this book you would still know it was a Charlaine Harris book. This is a very easy, and enjoyable read. I wouldn't say that this book is any darker than the Sookie series it just goes in another direction. Sort of super hero, meets, mind reader,X-files, and 6th sense all mixed into one book. What I liked about the main character Harper and her brother was that they seem like real people who have had a hard life. Not your run of the mill middle class family life that comes from the average suburban town. She seems like someone you would like to know. She spends a lot of time in the book doing what she does --which is find dead people and tell you how they died' which leads to a little bit of suspense in the end. This book made me want to buy the rest in the series, . . which by the way I also found enjoyable. Charlain Harris really has a talent for telling a story. I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Hopefully I won't offend the author when I say I had never heard of her before about a week ago, but now I'm very glad I have. I really found this first novel in the series a good read, it piqued my interest so much so that I had a hard time stopping reading. I purchased it for my Kindle and as soon as I finished it, went back and got book #2 and I haven't regretted either one."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Like many reviewers here, I got into the Harper Connelly book because of my love for the Sookie Stackhouse series and Charlaine Harris' writing. But this is a VERY different book. The tone is dark and practical, which is interesting considering the heroine helps find dead people for a living. There were times that the book was hard - again, this is a much darker view of the world compared to Sookie's sassy tenaciousness. And yet, I really loved Harper and her half-brother, Tolliver. They've fascinating people, and they've had it hard.Harper was struck by lightning as a teen and came out of that with the ability to sense the dead. \\"They want to be found, you know.\\" And Tolliver helps her through this as her agent and her emotional support. They're an interesting pair.When they're hired to find the bodies of a pair of teen lovers who supposedly ran away, they discover a lot more than they bargained for, and are inadvertently brought into trying to solve the mystery surrounding the dead lovers and the small town they came from.I was totally hooked on this book, I must confess. It's dark and moody, but the scenes are so well-rounded as Harper and Tolliver try to solve this mystery and get out of this town alive themselves! The supporting characters are great and the atmosphere is wonderfully charged. It was an intense ride, but very well done, and anyone who enjoys shows like CSI mingled with Medium or Ghost Whisperer ought to enjoy Harper Connelly's tale as well."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I've actually read all 3 books in this series but thought I would put a review here to help others pick up these books. I'm a HUGE Sookie Stackhouse fan and these books are not as amazing as the Southern Vampire Mysteries but they are good enough to get into. After reading book 3 I am definitely hooked for however many CH decides to write. Interesting characters and good plots. Give it at least 2 books and then you will want to read book 3 and soon 4 which comes out in October 09."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I had just finished the Sookie Stackhouse(Souther Vampire Series)also from Charlaine Harris(which I LOVED) and decided to try out different books from the same author. I am already on the third book and must agree with some other reviewers that the first one, GRAVE SIGHT is not the best and strongest one. I enjoy the light reading but had a hard time connecting with the main character Harper Connelly. She is a much darker version of Sookie Stackhouse which I like very much. The book center around the \\"gift\\" Harper developed after being hit by lightning. She can now locate corpses and find out their cause of death. The plot on this first book was quite predictable, even for someone like me who almost never solves a mistery. I still enjoy the reading and recommend the book. The two following titles on the series are better in my opinion though."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Charlaine Harris is a gifted writer, plain and simple. Her Sookie Stackhouse vampire novels have kept me well entertained, while my wife enjoys Harris's more straightforward mysteries. Now, this talented imagination has conjured up a new kind of heroine who straddles the line between mystery and contemporary fantasy: Harper Connelly.Harper is no action hero. She's not a brilliant detective or slayer of evil. She has no supernatural origins, nor does she have a relationship with any kind of undead creature. No, Harper's world is largely mundane, with one major difference. Ever since she was struck by lightning, she's been afraid of thunderstorms, she is weak in one leg ... and she can sense the location and final moments of the dead. That makes her a valuable commodity to those seeking answers, closure for a loss or the location of a missing (presumed dead) loved one. It also makes her somewhat unclean in the eyes of many, a ghoul who makes her living off the dead and, quite often, supplies answers no one is eager to hear. Still, she travels with her stepbrother, Tolliver Lang, and does what good she can -- for a profit -- without getting too involved in the lives (or deaths) of those she encounters.But then she and Tolliver roll into Sarne, a small town in the Arkansas Ozarks with a few big secrets. The job seems easy at first, just find a missing teenage girl. But answers to one disappearance lead to further questions about other deaths, and soon the siblings are wrapped up in a criminal case that could cost Harper her professional reputation -- or even her life.Harper is a darker protagonist than Sookie, and the tone of the book is more serious; there is humor, but it's painted with a much lighter brush. Also, while Harper's \\"power\\" is certainly fantastic, the novel otherwise is entirely grounded in reality. The characters, major and minor, seem so damn real, it's hard to believe they were just invented for this book.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(n e t) editor"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"What a great new series from Charlaine Harris! I can barely wait until the next installment.Heroine Harper Connelly can find dead people. She's kind of an energy sensing cadaver dog of a medium: able to feel the vibrations of the dead and discern how they died. In some ways Harper is reminiscent of Laurell K Hamilton's Anita Blake: she uses her paranormal skills in both private enterprise, and as part of police forensic investigations. And,like Anita, most of the time the people doing the hiring don't really like to hear what Harper has to tell them.Harper is assisted and protected by her stepbrother Tolliver. The relationship between these two is complex, to say the least, and it will be wonderful to watch them develop in coming volumes. Harris writes skillfully yet playfully, and develops her characters in a strong, appealing fashion. All of the groundwork for a fantastic series is beautifully established here in Grave Sight.In this first installment, Harper and Tolliver travel to the Ozarks to find a missing teenaged girl, presumed dead. They find her body deep in a wood, and plunge even deeper into small town intrigue, deception, secrecy, and murder. With conservative bigotry welling up around them, can Harper and Tolliver get away with their lives? Well, of course they can: there are many more books ahead, and I suspect we shall all of us buy them up like hotcakes. This new character is a winner."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"i pre-ordered this title because it was by charlaine harris. i expected a new volume in her roe teagarden series.i'm definitely not disappointed that it's the start of a new series. i enjoy her southern vampire series also. this book, however, is darker in tone and outlook than the others i've enjoyed(haven't read the shakespeare series yet).the main characters, harper and her brother, are interesting and well-drawn. the results of the family background are realistic. i can't agree with the comment that there is any sexual tension between the two.the experienced mystery reader will probably figure out who-dun-it fairly easily, but that doesn't detract all that much from the book.the least appealing part of the story was the townspeople. those involved with the mystery were almost completely unsympathetic. realistic, yes. but i can encounter enough unpleasant, selfish and repellent people going to the grocery store to want to spend my reading time with so many of them--not to mention that i try to control my impulse to complete cynicism when possible.i will definitely read the next book in this series. i have faith in harris. i just hope her next book is another sukey stackhouse."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Harper Connelly has many problems that she needs to deal with on a day to day basis but is a big believer in that when the world hands you lemons, you make yourself some lemonade. Harper and her step-brother Tolliver earn their living from Harper's ability to seek the dead, a \\"gift\\" she received as a result of being struck by lightning when she was young. It may not please everyone that the two profit from death as such, but Harper knows that the newly bereaved aren't always in the right place to be appreciative of her services. Drawn to where the dead lay, and receiving mental images of what brought them to their death is the limit of what Harper provides for her fee. It is never her wish to be drawn into what comes after, but on this latest job, it's unavoidable.The small community of Sarne in the Ozarks had accepted that one of the town's finest sons committed suicide out in the wilderness but there was still the question as to what became of his girlfriend, supposedly in his company that day. Harper locates the body of the missing girl and delivers to the disbelieving family the news that both Dell Teague and Teenie Hopkins were murdered. Sarne's small-minded sheriff and suspicious townsfolk turn on Harper and Tolliver, something they are sadly used to but not to this extent. There is hate and there is pain in all the relationships the two come across in this town, and they are sure that most of the hostility being shown to them emanates from the direction of whoever killed them. Dell and Teenie's killers still walk amongst their families and friends, a fact not lost on anyone involved.Harris has written an edgy little novel with numerous undercurrents running through that unsettle and have the reader rising more than a few questions of their own. No great pains have been taken with creating a plot of any intricacy but there is value in the strength of the stifling, flat-eyed air of menace that pervades throughout the whole read. It's easy to visualize the whole town and walls closing in on the two interlopers, who stand out in a crowd for other reasons than Harper's psychic connections to the dead.The narrative here is terse and unfriendly which suits perfectly both the characters and the oily facade of prosperity and normality that the town of Sarne, Arkansas is trying so desperately to project. There isn't much to like in Harper's character, and her relationship with her step-brother doesn't sit comfortably either. Harper does however come across as talented and damaged (always interesting); always keeping something of her true self in check, even given that this novel has been written in the first-person narrative. As common with a series read and a first entry at that, there are the threads of possible future plot lines in GRAVE SIGHT to compel the reader to seek out the next book.Author Charlaine Harris has written two other novels in the Harper Connelly series: GRAVE SIGHT (2005) and ICE COLD GRAVE (due for release September 2007). Harris is best known for her Southern Vampire (Sookie Stackhouse) novels and has written two other series, as well as several standalone works and short story collections."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Harper Connelly has a unique gift; she can feel/find dead people. She can locate a dead body, if given a general location of their where abouts, then she gets a buzzing in her body that leads her to the deceased. She can tell you how they died, heart attack, old age, murder, she just can't tell you if they died, whodunit.Harper's stepbrother Tolliver is her constant companion due to Harper's special gift and needs. Together they travel to a town called Sarne to locate the body of a young girl who was believed to have been with her boyfriend when he died. His body has been recovered, but hers hasn't. Usually Harper locates the body and then leaves, ASAP. This time in Sarne obstacles and circumstances keep making it impossible for Harper and Tolliver to leave.The relationship between the two siblings is a little unusual but once you figure out some of their background and learn more about Harper and her gift you can understand the closeness.After being introduced this past year to Charlaine Harris I have been enjoying the Southern Vampire series and decided to check out some of her other books. I was not at all disappointed in this book; in fact I enjoyed it tremendously. Charlaine Harris has quickly become one of my favorite authors; her books have an endless supply of amazing entertainment and never leave me unsatisfied. She has, book after book, made me a fanI am horrible at solving mysteries. I always think I know the who and sometimes the why, but in the end I am always wrong. In this case, I figured out pretty much everything early on, and turned out to right. Now I could attribute my sleuthing excellence to a bizarre alignment of the planets, a phase of the moon, or a stroke of temporary genius, but I am thinking the mystery was just a tad weak. Because of that I gave it 4 stars instead of the 5, although for me knowing didn't ruin any of the story, I still had a fabulous time reading. I can't wait to move on to the next."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Grave Sight (2005) is the first fantasy novel in the Harper Connelly series. Harper was struck by lightning as a girl and after that she was able to sense the presence of bodies. When she is close enough to the body, she also relives the death experience.In this novel, Harper and her stepbrother, Tolliver Lang, have come to Sarne -- a small town in the Ozarks -- to find a body. Dell Teague, a teenage boy, had been found dead six months ago, but his girlfriend Monteen Hopkins had not been missed until the next day and the body still hasn't been found. Dell's mother, Sybil Teague, hires Harper to find the missing girl.Harper finds Teeny's body and faints from the shock of reliving the youngster's murder. Then Harper and Tolliver have to stay in Sarne awaiting confirmation of identity by the state police lab before being paid. Harper finds out more about Teeny and Dell and even meets Helen Hopkins, Monteen's mother.Harper also meets a friendly policeman, Hollis Boxleitner, who had been married to Teeny's sister. Sally Boxleitner had died before Teeny and Harper soon finds out that she too had been murdered. Then another murder occurs and Harper is told to stay in town.In this story, the common people of Sarne are generally hospitable, but Sheriff Harvey Bransom is very hostile. His widowed sister Sybil and her lawyer Paul Edwards seem to be more antsy than usual. Other people associated with the principals are even more hostile than the sheriff. And then there are the state police investigators.Harper has a continuing problem with people who believe that her ability to find the dead is fraudulent or downright weird. Some even believe her to be an agent of the devil. She has been stoned as a witch and once she barely escaped from a mob. She suffers from a bad case of kill the messenger.Having this talent has made her life more difficult. Yet she also has the consolation of giving closure to the relatives of missing persons. Still, Harper is not always successful in finding the missing bodies, particularly when the victim has been taken far away from the scene of the crime. Her own sister is one such case.Harper and Tolliver are very close. Although they came from different families, her mother and his father were married when they were older children. Since these parents were alcoholics and drug users, their children were more neglected than parented. Harper and Tolliver raised their younger siblings with a little help from Mark, Tolliver's older brother.Having personal experience with such neglected and abused children, I find Harper's backstory to be fairly typical of such cases, even to the children trying to avoid the governmental authorities. Naturally, these two are very protective of -- and dependent upon -- each other.This story is an unusual variant on the murder mystery. As with the Southern Vampire series, the paranormal element introduces a wild card into the plot. Although Harper's rare talent is powerful, it also has strict limits; for example, she only perceives what the victim sees in the last few moments. Rarely does she know the identity of a killer.Highly recommended for Harris fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of mysterious murders, exceptional talents and unusual persons.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Well, ok, just like everyone else, I read \\"Grave Sight\\" because I was enamored with Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire Series. (I lovelove Sookie!) So of course I wanted to check out the author's other work. I rated this book with 3 stars because it was relatively weak for me. I will however keep reading the series... I think it was just a first book blues. You know, you're getting to know all the characters so not much is happening. I still recommend this book to anyone who loves Charlaine's other work and those looking for a good mystery novel.The world in the Harper Connolly series is like our world- no vampires, ghouls or the like. However, Harper has a paranormal ability. She can find dead people and see them, along with the last seconds of their death. She can see how they died, not who killed them. These limitations are what make the story so intense and thrilling. There is a lot of the \\"who did it?\\" going on here.Harper is our reluctant hero here. She travels all over the country offering her services (of seeing the dead) for a high price. She isn't very well received by people, even those that she tries to help, because most believe her to be a fraud. Harper finds herself stuck living her past and she admits that this needs to change. She is a depressed, dependent heroine and this makes her very unlikeable in my opinion. I think that she'll grow on me though as her character develops and becomes more independent. I have to say that I am glad that Harper is very- I am what I am. No excuses. She has a relationship with her brother- this is who she is so dependent on. Their relationship is a little weird, I can't imagine having a relationship with my stepbrother like this. Then again, we weren't struck by lightning and didn't have parents addicted to drugs. =)I have to say that even though I gave this book 3 stars, I couldn't wait to read the next. I was really intrigued by the progress both characters make and how they will be further 'developed.' I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes the Sookie series or Bard series by Harris... This is also a great filler while waiting for the next Sookie books to be released! I can also say that this series DOES get better if you keep reading. So read it, it is relatively fast paced and a great quick read."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I can understand both points of view which I have to date read in reviews here.Grave Sight is very well written book, also with a new twist on the familiar \\"small town murder\\"-esque mystery plots.No, it is not the best book I have ever read, but it is intruiging, and it is a book which you want to keep on turning the pages. So it certainly is NOT one of the worst books I have recently read either.The interaction between Tolliver and Harper is very interesting, and I do look forwards to reading more about their \\"relationship\\"...(in a number of senses of the word)I suppose this boils down to no, Grave Sight is not worth 5 stars. Yet I am comfortable giving it 4, simply because the book is indeed well written, the main characters keep your attention (ie, you don't want to drop the book and wash the cat instead of continuing to read...) and their \\"voices\\" are beilevable and comfortable.Add on to that this is the first book in the \\"series\\" and Charlaine Harris is obviously settling in to the flair of this particular series, and I am more than interested in the sequal, and will wait another book or two before making a more firm opinion."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I've been a big fan of Harris' Southern Vampire series from the moment they came out. I enjoy her vivid characters and the way she really makes you care about what happens to them. Now she has a new series and I love it just as much. While Harper is a slightly weaker character than Sookie from the SV series, it's easy to see that she has an inner strength and she's going to grow in the coming books. I love the matter-of-fact way she treats her power, making a living from it instead of hiding it away in shame.Another point that has people talking about this series is the fact that Harper travels with her step-brother, Tolliver. There is beyond a doubt, a deep though unspoken attraction between them and some people have complained that it is 'creepy.' I have to point out that they are in no way related by blood and I find their relationship fascinating and not creepy a bit. Often in romance books, the author has to go through a lot of drama to manufacture a reason why the hero and heroine can't get together. While not a romance, Harris' new book has an undercurrent of romance running through it. I'll be very interested to see in the next installment if Harper will recognize and act on her attraction to Tolliver and if their relationship will be treated as 'taboo' by the other people in their lives.Harris is one of those authors that make me wish I could write like her. I devoured this book in a single sitting and I'm already wishing for the next one."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Charlaine Harris' resilient new character, Harper Connelly, is a clairvoyant. Struck by lightning at an early age, Harper can now sense the whereabouts of dead people and once she finds the body, she \\"sees\\" how the person died. One would think that consulting with law enforcement to solve missing person cases and bring closure to families would be considered an honorable thing to do, but Harper's job tends to be a pretty thankless one. In this first installment, someone in a small town in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas doesn't want Harper to get too close to solving a mystery.On a personal note, I don't read many mysteries but I do read a lot of \\"otherworldly\\" fiction like Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire series. In Grave Sight, I enjoyed the character of the clairvoyant, but the \\"mystery\\" and \\"villain\\" elements were pretty obvious to me from about a third of the way into the story.Harper and the other characters definitely made this a fun and fast read, so five stars for Harper Connelly and three stars for the mystery plot = 4 stars."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Not as good as the Stackhouse books.Harper finds the body, people say why do you do this kind of work, she defends being paid for it, they (family and police) wish the body had never been found... Harper thinks she would be happier working in a Walmart or Starbucks (like, people who have those sort of undemanding but socially acceptable jobs don't have challenges and take insults, yikes) instead of being paid $5,000 per find... over and over... there is some story in it but not as lively and creative as the Stackhouse books. Harper's description of her life with her drug using alcoholic parents is realistic and, sure, it prepared her for the dangerous low class people she deals with now, but painful to read about over and over. As are the quick sexual events. It comes across as a sorry life she has not learned how to handle yet. Realistic yet, and perhaps based on some real characters, but not entertaining enough to make the unhappiness worth sharing.Interestingly, Harper gets psychic impressions and finds bodies, but seems to put down psychics and mediums.There are often funny contradictions."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Like many others, I am a Charlaine Harris fan who's come to this series after reading others by the author. I read all the Sookie Stackhouse books, a couple of the Aurora Teagarden mysteries, tore through the Shakespeare series, and now find myself with this last series -- the one that gets not as good reviews, and not as enthusiastic support, as the others, and I have to say I agree. While I enjoy Harris's ideas and writing, I was not enamored of the protagonist, Harper Connelly, a woman who earns her money by travelling to find bodies. Ever since she was struck by lightning at 15, Harper's been able to \\"receive\\" a body's last few seconds. The experience, along with a brutal childhood, has made her fragile, so she travels everywhere with her protective foster brother. I found all of this quite intriguing.What I didn't care for was Harper's dreary, serious-bordering-on-sour outlook. The character has no sense of humor, and the dialogue often falls flat, weighed down by Harper's earnest narration.HOWEVER, several others seem to think the second book improves on this, and based on my great admiration of Charlaine Harris, I will try the next book."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I came to this series from the Sookie Stackhouse books, which I'd really enjoyed, but had run out of.

The story is good and solid -- it gives a good introduction of the main characters and gives the reader little flashbacks of their past lives which lays the foundation for their characters and why they are the way they are.

She can find dead bodies and hear the last memories of the dead and know how they died! All she had to do was get hit by lightning at the age of 15 to gain this remarkable power. Harper would love to be normal but she knows she is not and as a result she tries to take advantage of her supernatural gift as best she can.Her and her stepbrother, Tolliver Lang, are investigators who team together to help people find their missing friends or family members for a fee. Her jobs come by word of mouth, references passed along by satisfied customers. (As if anyone is ever happy after finding a missing dead person) The trouble is that wherever they go, once they find the body they are suspects as no one believes that her powers exist. If you can find a missing body then you must be the one who put it there. In addition once they appear at a sight, strange things always occur that keep the police interested in the lady and her brother who seem to find dead bodies.They are hired to go to Arkansas to find the body of a missing woman. Harper's trip to Arkansas leads her to find out more than she wanted to know. She finds the woman and discovers that she was murdered and that her suspected boyfriend didn't commit suicide. Before they can leave another local murder happens and they are asked to stay in the area.Harper and Tolliver have to not only solve the mysteries of what is going on but they have to also prove there are guiltless of any crimes. This is not so easy and everybody involved seems to be trying to hide something about the past.In typical Charlaine Harris style she has spun a great mystery tale with interesting characters with supernatural gifts. This story is a good one and while Harper Connelly seems a bit of a whiner at times; the depth of the story and characters keep you reading on and on.

After being struck by lightning a decade earlier Harper developed an unusual ability - she can hear the dead, not much, a buzzing when she is near their bodies, just a glimpse into their last few minutes, and an awareness of their cause of death. Just enough to make Harper's life uncomfortable and to provide a career for her and her brother Tolliver. The pair travel across the country at the request of grieving families to locate missing loved ones or establish cause of death. Their business might bring comfort to their clients but it usually earned them the contempt of the local police and generally made everyone uncomfortable.Harper had been asked to a small town in the Ozarks to locate a missing teenager, a girl who most of the town assumed had been part of an adolescent romance gone terribly wrong. At first it seemed as though Harper would bring needed closure to everyone but instead of comfort her revelations only seemed to stir up animosity and lead to more death.This series is written by Charlaine Harris, who is much better known for her SOUTHERN VAMPIRE/SOOKIE STACKHOUSE series, which is the basis for the HBO series TRUEBLOOD. Although Sookie and Harper are both young women from the South they have little else in common. Sookie is feisty, and quite able to deal with the vampires, werewolves and other supernatural beings that populate her world. Harper on the other hand, is deeply scarred by her past, and quite dependent on her brother Tolliver for support. This series does not have as many comic touches as the SOUTHERN VAMPIRE series, although there are a few. The main attraction to this series is the ongoing story about Tolliver and Harper's relationship, both past and present. Since there is such a strong story arc to this series it would be best to read these novels in order."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I love the \\"Sookie\\" books so much I decided to branch out in the world of Ms. Harris.

Boring was the plot, boring were the characters. And the inconsistencies about drove me nuts! First Nell was \\"under age\\" but she was in her last year of highschool. Then the book said she was 16 and a few chapters later, she was 17 (but no birthday had taken place). I love Charlaine Harris but I am very detail oriented and her inconsistencies when she writes drive me crazy! Then, apparently, a man kills half the town because he finds out that his two kids were having a child together. Come on! When the book FINALLY ended and I found out the reason for the killings I could not believe how stupid this book was. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"A lighting strike survivor, Harper Connelly has the unusual ability to find dead people and read their cause of death. She and her partner Tolliver turned it into a business--traveling on the road as they work cases. Not everyone is accepting of her ability, some thinking her a fraud. The law enforcement cases are the worst--the cops are more skeptical of her power and the cause of death is more often a horrible foul play.I love the Sookie Sackhouse novels and thought I'd give Harris' other series a try. Boy, was I disappointed with this book. Grave Sight started well. At first I was interested and the story was moving along. But then as I got to know the main character Harper she completely got on my nerves. Yes, I understand she came from alcoholic parents so that is supposed to explain why she was so completely unable to do anything for herself and was completely dependent on her stepbrother. Then time and time again, she made ridiculous decisions putting her life in danger. I almost put the book down thinking nobody could be so dumb. But I kept slogging along hoping it would get better. And then wouldn't you know at the ending, the guy I figured was the bad guy from the very beginning turned out to be the bad guy. How's that for a mystery? Sheesh! I shouldn't be able to figure it out so quickly.***EDIT/ADDITION:I went out of town on a trip and someone loaned me book two as an audio book. I was very pleasantly surprised. Harper was much less annoying--I actually started to like her--and the book ended up being a good read. So then I went on to book three, which was GREAT! Tons of twists and turns and a great mystery. If you want to give this series a try, I suggest skipping book one and starting with book two. Book two gives you some catch up anyway, so you won't be lost."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit. I initially began with the Sookie Stackhouse novels, so naturally I wanted more. That said, I was hoping this would fit the bill. Though it is a fun and entertaining read, I'm certainly not addicted in the same way. Either way, if you're a fan of Charlaine Harris you should like this."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I have never found Ms. Harris' books particularly riveting, although typically well-written with an interesting story line. My problem was that I wasn't really able to relate to the main character, this is not true for this book.Ms. Harris does something that most authors have trouble by making a different character who does not strike you as exactly the same as every other book she has written. I actually like the main character of this book much better than Sookie, thus finding the entire book much more riveting. Also, the main man (romance?) in this one is much more likable than those in the Sookie Stackhouse series.If you maybe have read one of Ms. Harris' books already and found that they were interesting, but not one of your favorites. Try this one it really is a different and enjoyable change of pace."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Overall, I liked the book ok, but it certainly wasn't on of my favorites. I found myself pretty bored through most of the book until about the last quarter of the book. I never felt any connection to any of the characters in the book. I found Harper to be a little annoying and her personality was very flat. I felt the book really never got into their personalities enough to make me feel anything towards them whatsoever, which made it hard to really get into the book. I actually felt like I had started the series in the middle or something because it never gave any detail about the two main cahracters at all and I felt I was missing something most of the time. There was hardly any background at all.I thoguht I would give these a try after reading the Sookie Stackhouse series. The characters in that series were great and I felt for them, whether I liked them or not. In this book I really could care less about anyone in it. That is what made it not so good for me.I haven't decided yet whether I will read the second book or not."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"the owner of a murdering cat. Charlaine Harris has a positive talent for creating lines and situations like this that simply blow a reader away.I bought \\"GraveSight\\" simply because it was written by Harris. Have very much enjoyed both the Southern Vampire series and the Lily Bard books, so it wasn't much of a stretch that \\"Gravesight\\" would appeal.\\"Gravesight\\" is the first in what I suspect is going to be another long series of novels about Harper and Tolliver, brothers and sisters though not of actual blood, who travel around the country. You see, Harper has an odd occupation. Ever since she was struck by lightning as a teen, she can find dead bodies and determine their cause of death--but not their murderer.When Harper and Tolliver are called to Sarne, Arkansas to find the body of a missing teen, it seems like a quick in-and-out, but they quickly discover that neither the missing girl or her boyfriend, who supposedly killed her and then killed himself, are quite what they seem.Worse, Harper and Tolliver face a town of fundamentalists who suspect her gift might possibly be from the Devil. As the bodies pile up, the brother-and-sister team are also suspected of murder.This is a very fast-paced and easy read. I strongly suggest you give yourself 3-4 hours to read this book because you will want to finish in as close to one sitting as you can. Oh, and leave the lights on if you read at night. While the book isn't horror, per se, I ended up wanting more lights on as I read."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I read a LOT of books, and this is only the fourth book that has impressed me so strongly that I wanted to shout from the rooftops how much I loved it!I like good character development in my novels, and Charlaine's characters are always fully developed and likable people. I strongly reacted to the character of Harper---I felt like I had always known her and loved her. Sure, she has her flaws (who doesn't?) but she is honest, and has integrity, and cares about others. Some may find her weak, but with her history, I can understand her dependence on her brother. However, I sense that she has a strength within, she just hasn't come to realize it yet. She was able to do what she needed to do when she was without her brother. If she was truly weak-willed and fragile, she would just crawl into bed and pull the covers over her head!I highly recommend this book! I was so glad to see when I went to the author's website that this is only the first we hear from Harper, but not the last.Do yourself a favor: buy this book (or borrow it from a friend or the library)! You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I am 63% of the way through with Charlene Harris' Grave Sight and I have no interest in finishing the reading of this novel. There is no mystery here; there is no suspense, no drama, and no romantic interest. All of the characters are duds, just like the supposed heroine, except for her ability to find dead bodies and relive their final moments of life before death claims them. Obviously, Charlene Harris was not struck by lightening when she came up with this bad idea."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Kind of dissapointed. I love the Sookie Stackhouse series and I was hoping for more of that: an entertaining story with no deep meaning or anything to really think about, but fun and sexy.Didn't like the main character, one of those \\"Poor me, I've suffered so much and now my brother is tied to me and I can't be on my own...\\" It was too much.Also, I knew who the murderer was in Chapter 2 and the new clues the author kept introducing only confirmed it by Chapter 6.There are a couple of typos (I hope they were typos). And at some point she describes one of the characters as\\"blue-eyed\\", while a couple of pages later she says \\"she widened her brown eyes\\". I know it's not a big issue but it confused me. I went back and I am sure she's talking about the same character, not another one.Why 3 stars then? Because I've read worse and it just needed a bit of polishing. In my opinion it was a bad editing job for the most part."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Plot Summary: As if her childhood wasn't traumatic enough, Harper Connelly was literally struck by a bolt of lightening as a teenager. She carries the scars inside and out, and her body acts as a divining rod for dead bodies. Harper can stand over a grave and see an image of that person's last moments. With her stepbrother's help, Harper tries to use this skill to earn a living, traveling all over the country to locate missing persons. Harper is calm and stoic in the face of universal hostility, from law enforcement, to her own clients. Once she delivers the bad news, it's a classic case of shooting the messenger. Everyone wants her gone, but this time, someone wants her dead.Most of us romance fans are introduced to Harris's work via her Southern Vampire Mystery series, and once we've run out of Sookie stories, it's time to try her other fare. So, does this series have the same romantic entanglements that we enjoy in Sookie's life? I can attest that Harper has relationships in \\"Grave Sight,\\" but no, there isn't any romance attached. There is potential for that to change down the road, and I think this story is strong enough to lure romance fanatics who want to take a break and just read some high quality stuff.Harper and her stepbrother, Tolliver, travel to a small southern town to find a missing teenage girl. When she finds more than one body, surprise, surprise, the belligerent detectives force them to stay in town. The problem is, every single local wants them gone, from their hotel manager, to a group of bullies, and the parents of the dead teens. Harper would gladly comply, but then a malicious officer throws Tolliver in jail on trumped up charges, leaving Harper vulnerable to whoever is trying to put her in a grave. It's a chilling example of how much power the police can abuse and still stay true to the letter of the law. It reminds me of a line from the movie \\"The Long, Hot Summer,\\" where a southern land baron tells Paul Newman, \\"I think you ought to know that in my jail, we never heard of the words habeas corpus.\\"The relationship between stepsiblings Harper and Tolliver is very close, and some might say it's too close. I found their mutual clinginess natural given their awful childhood, but it's possible they might become romantically involved. Incest is so taboo most people shrink at the idea, regardless of the fact that they're not related in any biological way. I'm going to keep an open mind and see what happens."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"When I read that Harris had a new novel/new character I hoped she wasn't as sadly narrow as Sookie.....so this character was very disappointing. While I like her general style,I think Charlaine needs a kick-start for her endorphins. A sense of humor would be a welcome infusion."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I was looking forward to this beginning of a new series, as I thorougly enjoy the Sookie books - however I was disappointed.

I'm a big fan of the Southern Vampire Series. This series is darker with none of the laugh out loud humor of the Southern Vampire Series.

I will finish the series because I bought them, but won't buy anymore. Having lost my own child and a husband who deals with exploited/missing children professionally, brought back too many bad feelings."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I love Charlaine's Sookie Stackhouse series.

I read 3 books from this series and the last one made me yawn.Not that much fun."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Having read the Stackhouse series, which by the way are nothing like the Tv series they were made into, I was aware that Harris writes in a unique style. It is very calm and comfortable and she takes her time with the story and plot. This series focuses on Harper Connelly, who was struck by lightning as a teenager and since then she has an inner GPS for dead people and can see how they spent their last miniutes alive. It is a slow burner this one, but a good one. Charlaine Harris writes solid plots and I always enjoy her books."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Thank you for my books.

The books seemed like they were practically brand new...even though I bought them used."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I'm not happy about it, but I have just completed a Charlaine Harris book and what makes this book special is that I didn't like it. The start of this series has us meet up with Harper Connelly and her stepbrother Tolliver, on a \\"job assignment\\" to find a dead teenage girl in the Ozarks. Harper was left an exceptional talent as the result of being struck by lightning as a teenager in that she is able to locate dead people and \\"see\\" the last few minutes of their life. The mystery Ms. Harris wrote is pretty good and I give points for that but I just didn't enjoy Harper. Aurora Teagarden and Sookie Stackhouse are characters that you'd feel priviledged in sitting in their backseat while they picked up milk and bread in a convenience store. Sadly, I didn't get that feeling with Harper or Tolliver. So my review is, good story but characters I didn't care for. Maybe I should try the the next one in the series but right now can't figure out why."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"love this book. try the first book and you will not want to put it down. or the one after that"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"From the description and other reviews, I was picturing something somewhere between Agatha Christie and LKH. It fell WAY closer to Agatha Christie, however, and was a fairly predictable run of the mill mystery."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Like many other reviewers, I'm a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series. You get sexy vampires, violent murders, comedy, and Sookie. Sookie is the main reason to enjoy the series; she's just such a likable gal, despite everything.Not so Harper, the protagonist of this series. She's depressed (or seems to be), deeply cynical, and just plain negative. In real life I find these sorts of people draining. OK, so maybe it makes for a well-rounded character of depth, but really, is such a person enjoyable to be around?I think I'm going to skip the rest of the series and try one of Harris' other books."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Harper Connelly was struck by lightening as a child and has ever since been able to sense the dead. She can sense the final location and the final minutes of their life. So not having many other skills, she hires herself out to find missing persons, she see's it as helping, others see it as a way to take advantage of people at their most vulnerable moments.Harper travels from town to town with her step-brother Tolliver. They have a very strange relationship that left a funny feeling in me. He is supposed to be her bodyguard, but it plays off more incestuous then that. Harper is about 23, but is less than mature and quite incapable of taking care of herself while Tolliver appears to be the knight in shinning armour who saves her from the terrible fate of bad guys and lightening storms.This story was a bit twisted with Harper traveling to Sarne, Ark, to find the body of a missing girl. Finding the body is no problem, but being able to get back out of town still alive is the real challenge here. Too much seemed to be thrown into this book with who was related to whom and who was dating who and who sleeping with whom. Harpers relationship with the local cop seemed unnecessary and rather unbelievable. The whole book just didn't flow right.This is the first in the Harper Connolly series, but it left me a bit cold and I don't know if I will continue on."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"As a avid fan of Charlaine Harris, I grabbed this book and looked forward to being entertained. Well, yes I enjoyed the book; however, the story wasn't as adhesive as her novels usually are. This is understandable as she is beginning a new series, but I hope the sequel has more substance to it. Her characters are well shaped; but repeating the same ground very times was irrating. While I was disappointed by several parts of the story, I eagerly look forward to the sequel and hope Ms Harris is back to her old self next time."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Harris is known both for her straightforward murder mystery series featuring Lily Bard, set in the fictional town of Shakespeare, Arkansas, and for her humorous-vampire-fantasy mystery series featuring Sookie Stackhouse, telepath and acquaintance of far more vampires, shape-shifters, and weres than she ever planned on being. The vampire series is set in Louisiana. It's mostly humorous though there are dark moments and of course murders. The Lily Bard series is rather darker - for a \\"cozy\\" series, quite dark indeed.This book is not part of those series, and it's in between the two in tone. This is mostly the straightforward real world we know, except for our heroine and her peculiar talent, with only a small hint that there may be other similar strange talents held by a few people; there are no other fantasy elements, no supernatural beings. Except for Harper's ability to find the dead, the rest of the book is a regular mystery. Although there are no supernatural beings, we nonetheless can see some resemblance to early Anita Blake, in that many people in the bible-belt areas of southern states feel that a talent like Harper's must be due to witchcraft or the devil. Harper copes with a mixture of anxiety and sarcasm. The murder motive is a bit contorted, and the plot resolution a bit too fast and killer-blurts-it-all-out-during-final-fight, but it's not awful, just a bit too pat.The cops in the book are a mixture of good, bad, and indifferent, not all bumbling or all bad, but not all competent either. Since our heroine and her brother travel for a living, we don't get as much of a sense of one place as we do for Shakespeare or for Sookie's neck of Louisiana; the small town of Sarne where this takes place is pretty stereotypical, and it doesn't look like we'll be getting a lot of continuing background characters or background activity of any one place the way we do in Harris' other series.Overall, a good book, though not her best; I'll be looking forward to the next one in the series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Harris goes in a new direction, but does not stray from familiar territory with this new series. My biggest problem with the book is how obvious it is as the beginning of a new series. There is more background on the main characters than there is actual story. A nice quick read."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This book was a very fast read (I read it easily in two evenings). I liked the concept of Harper, a young woman who can find the dead and determine their cause of death. But, I found the story a little too familiar and predictable. I think if Charlaine Harris fleshes Harper out a little more, this could become a good series. I would like to see a little more emphasis on her unique abilities. I also feel that Harris needs to work on the relationship between Harper and her brother Tolliver. Although, Harris sells their relationship as tight and supportive, it stills comes off a little too incestuous. Over all, I like the main character and the book, therefore I gave this book an average rating."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"A fan of Charlaine Harris' early Southern Vampire mysteries, I thought I would begin another of her series, but by page 2, I realized I shouldn't have wasted my time. The characters in Grave Sight are unlikable, unmemorable and unbelievable - particularly the townspeople of Sarne, who are annoyingly one-sided in their negative reactions toward Harper and her brother. I did not engage with Harper, the narrator, because she lacked personality and willpower. Spunky Sookie Stackhouse, in contrast, was honest, ingratiating, charmingly stubborn and the perfect combination of innocence and sensuality.While the general idea - that the protagonist has a special insight into people's deaths - was intriguing, the plot quickly fizzled into a predictable and anticlimactic finish. The forced relationship between Harper and young cop Hollis had none of the appeal for me that Bill and Sookie's did - Harris seems to have included it only for convenience's sake, and as a welcome distraction from the strange (and at times, uncomfortably touchy-feely) relationship between Harper and her brother.Harris was obviously in a hurry to introduce a new series with a female protagonist, but Harper Connelly's first mystery wasn't worth the read. Stick with Sookie."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"For anyone who has read as many books of this genre as I have, they may find this book a bit predictable, cliche, and boring. There are a lot of moments where I couldn't help but roll my eyes as I'm sure a lot of other readers will do the same as the author's only purpose of writing this book was to somehow start a romance between a step-brother and step-sister. She might as well have made it more interesting and made it about a full brother and sister just so the book could be a bit more entertaining. The way the author makes the character feel and for what reason, and how she acts is inconsistent. Harper has a tough as nails exterior and a \\"been there/done\\" that attitude but she faints at the first murder she finds. She talks about how the way the person dies doesn't usually bother her and how she's seen so many murders, hardly anything surprises her anymore but she faints because she found a body that had been running from a murderer who shot her twice? Stupid. Wow...how exciting. And she wakes up to her step brother holding her close to his chest saying, \\"oh baby wake up!\\" whatever...charlaine harris tried way too hard in this book. i was about to keel over with boredom...i will not pick up another charlaine harris book. And I agree with another reviewer when they said her writing seemed amateur-ish. It's like she wrote it all in one day and didn't proof-read anything. Bland as white toast.

I started with the Sookie Stackhouse books, lllooooonngg before True Blood hit the TV. I've re-read most of the books in that series, several times! Expecially if there is a long delay before the next Sookie installment.I enjoy the Harper Connelly stories because they have a slight turn from \\"day to day\\" people. Paranormal romance is my interest. This is just a slight departure into the paranormal...but it's enough for me. I like the idea that someone could be out there who could find your loved one for you. The fact that Harper and Tolliver always get pulled in to the crime (when they would MUCH rather avoid it) is great. And I could see how easily that could happen, if this were real life. A person like Harper would always be under suspicion, so it makes sense that she would need to solve some of the crime before getting to go on her merry way. I also like the dynamic between Harper and Tolliver. Keeps the books intersting. I'm looking forward to finding out how things go with their little sisters, especially Grace. And where did Cameron go? I hope she pops up in later books and is not really dead.I'm waiting patiently for the next book in this series!As always, Charlaine Harris is one of my favorite. must-have authors (I found her from Christine Feehan and Angela Knight), two of my other must haves!

Nothing about her makes sense and I found myself not really caring what happens to her. I couldn't connect with her at all, she was dull and at times I thought that she was just plain stupid. Her relationship with her brother Tolliver was just not healthy, he is in the middle of getting it on with some chick and he kicks her out so that he can go sit with his sister during a storm. I know that Harper has problems with storms but really, that's just not normal. I couldn't connect to any of the other characters either and when I got done reading the book my response was what the hell this book was even about.

The general line was good; but the story telling didn't go deep enough."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Harper and her brother, Tolliver, are in an unusual business together. They provide a service, but in providing the service, makes them a target for distrust, scorn, and hate. At age 15, Harper was struck by lightning, giving her an unexpected talent, the ability to locate dead bodies and see their last moments alive and what killed them. In Grave Sight, Harper and Tolliver are drawn deeper into the mystery in the small Ozark town of Sarne.I so enjoyed her Sookie books, that I thought I'd check out some of her other books as well. This is the first in a different series. I might as well note that this is really the first time I've read such macabre fiction! I usually steer clear of such topics, but I've pulled on my big girl panties and found out just what I've been missing.Grave Sight is a decent read. The mood is so dark throughout, that it doesn't grab you. There really aren't any lighthearted scenes to balance out the gloom. Still, Harris is a talented writer and she keeps the pace and the story interesting. I read it in a day, between finishing The Hunger Games and until I could get to the library for the second in that series. An adequate time burner, a good airline read."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I got this book because my store did not have any \\"Sookie\\" books.

Along with her step brother Tolliver, Harper sets out to find a body and ends up nearly getting herself killed.Like many of Charlaine Harris' stories, this one is packed with funny characters, an interesting story plot and it's fair share of dry humor. Makes me want to read more in the series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Harper Connelly was struck by lightning as a teenager, and besides a weakness in her right leg and a paralyzing fear of storms, she has one other side effect: she can tell how a person died. Creepy as that sounds, Harper has made the best of the situation by deciding to use her \\"gift\\" to help those in need of answers. She and her stepbrother Tolliver travel to appointments where Harper can give her information and move on quickly, hoping to leave both the town and their abusive past behind. Unfortunately, in the little town of Sarne, Arkansas, neither the dead nor the living will let go.This is the first installment in Charlaine Harris's series featuring Harper's unique ability, and unlike Harris's Southern Vampire Mystery series, this one is decidedly darker in tone. Harper is a fragile soul and her reliance on her stepbrother is at times almost a bit odd. The mystery that Harper and Tolliver find themselves caught up in is fairly transparent and has a few sizeable holes. I did enjoy the characters but felt that more actual background, rather than generalities, would have helped me to understand them more and would have given them more depth. However, Harris has a very readable, engaging style, and I found the storyline picking up as the book moved along. The preview for the next title in the series certainly left me intrigued enough to want to move forward. This one can be recommended for those who are fans of Ms. Harris's and enjoy some paranormal elements in their mysteries."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"i loved this book.

I just can't get enough of Harper."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"If you like murder mysteries, see yourself as an ameteur slueth, and don't mind psychic abilities in book characters - this is a book for you!She finds dead people and can tell you how they died - were murdered, natural causes, accidents, etc... but not who might have killed them. For that she has to gather clues and have a great deal of good...um OK often BAD ... luck to figure it out.I enjoy a true mystery that is not sooo foreshadowed that you can figure out the end by the third chapter, don't you? That is why I really liked this book because it kept ya guessing! There are soooo many people that could be the killer and the clues point you one way then the other.And yes, this is a series, but it isn't the type of series that leaves you hanging in the middle of the action and then you have to wait for the next book - NOPE - the book actually ends! You know that Harper has more mysteries to solve scheduled in the future, but this case does end with this book. But it leaves you wanting to follow her future adventures --- I know I am reading the next book - A grave surprise - for sure."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"The books that Charlain Harris writes have been ending up on my keeper shelf for years. This new book seems to be keeping right up with her older series for entertainment value, so if you like your mysteries with a bit of paranormal spice, this one will fit right in. I enjoyed it very much and will be looking for more in the series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I read this because I like the Southern Vampire Series. This is totally different. The characters are unique. The feel of the book is more serious. But different is good and I enjoyed it. The characters are well created but with room for development. The concept of being able to see how people died is believably presented yet leaves enough unknown so that plots can develop. I'm looking forward to reading the next."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I have to admit...I LOVE Charlaine Harris comic vampire novels & when I saw that she was coming out with a new book I HAD to have it. Well...I read it in 3 days and I have to say that I did not like it as much as her other novels, but still...its worth reading. I love Ms. Harris's imagination and the premice for the book. A girl that can sense dead people and how they died...AWESOME!! What I felt lacking in this book, is how the plot worked itself out. I did not like the ending! She did keep me guessing most of the book as to who was the wrong doer...but still..I felt disappointed in the ending. I'm chalking this up to this being the first in the series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed this book and I can't wait for the next in the series. I like the darker tone of the book and the fact that there is a good mystery.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This is an intriguing new series. We all know the premise by now, since being struck by lightning our heroine can sense dead people, finding lost corpses and even seeing their last few seconds of life. The challenge is that for those who have been murdered she can't tell who did the dirty deed. I actually like this character better than Sookie Stackhouse in some ways. Harper's troubled childhood, relationship issues, and worldview are fascinating. Her gift/curse is pretty novel and an excellent basis for several books. The situation she finds herself involved in upon finding the murdered girl in the Ozarks is enthralling.Harris's writing is first rate, as usual. The mystery is fairly believable and the pacing is excellent. The real problem with this book is the formulaic ending where the bad guy spills his guts about all the whys and wherefores in front of our heroes. That part reads like a bad made-for-TV movie. There is enough good stuff in here to make it worth reading but I really hope the next one ends on a higher note.Five stars for the first 3/4 of the book. Two stars for the ending. Since I couldn't rate it 3 1/2 I'm rounding up to 4."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This series is definietly not as fun as the Sookie series, more like the Shakespeare series. Harper's ability is unique and has the potential for great stories. Unfortunately, I think the heroine spends too much time feeling sorry for herself, and is too emotionally dependent on her step-brother--she's not the independent, resourceful type that Harris' other three heroines are. Hopefully, she will become more fleshed out and three-dimensional in the next book."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"While lacking in the humor and warmth that the Southern Vampire series has, this first entry in Harris' potential new series was still a page-turner. At least after the first two chapters were over, that is. The heroine of the story has the power to 'listen to the dead' and finds bodies of deceased people by following their call. An interesting idea, and one that I wasn't sure could hold up over an entire novel. To Harris' credit, she pulled off the mystery, and was wise enough to keep it under 300 pages. I was intrigued enough to read the whole book, but found plenty of material skippable, especially near the end, which seemed padded with extra details.I will try another book in the series if one comes out, but won't be disappointed if it doesn't."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"After reading Harris' Sookie and Aurora series, I was excited to meet Harper. I will NOT be reading another Harper book. The plot was lame - through the entire book the reader finds themselves asking \\"WHY are you staying in this town???\\" Then, Harper and her brother finally decide to leave, only to agree to a last meeting with the townsfolk. The meeting is predictably a trap that Harper manages to escape from.If you are dimwitted you will like this book."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Harper is no Sookie.

Harper is whiney and moody and all she ever wants to do is \\"get out of this town\\". Tolliver, her brother is not any better.These characters definitely don't have much appeal. I read the 3rd book first and liked it better.

I tried to read Harris's other series with Sookie, where the HBO series True Bllod is based off of, but it was too strange. The character in this series, Harper Connolly, has the ability to find dead bodies and identify how they died. Harris's writing flows well and she can tell a great story. The ability this character has is almost believable and not as strange as her other books. I recommend this to other mystery readers."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"OK- I gave this new series by Harris a chance as I LOVE her Sookie Stackhouse series and I was surprised to really like Harper.

Best known for her Sookie Stackhouse series, Harris gives us a new tale about a woman who was struck by lightning and given the gift of sensing the dead. She uses this creepy power as her livelyhood, finding lost bodies, clarifying the last moments of the deceased and how they actually died.Harper, our main character, has travelled to Sarne, Missouri with her stepbrother, Tolliver, whom she seems to have a somewhat creepy attachment to. She does her job and tries to leave only to find herself drawn into Sarne's dramas. Tolliver is imprisoned on trumped up charges, her flings wifes death isn't solved, and some one keeps trying to kill her. Not you average work week but one that Harper will have to work through to solve the mystery of what's going on in small town Sarne and get on with her life with the afterlife."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I didn't care much for the book at all. Infact, I can't really think of anything I did like about it. I didn't care much for Harper's character. I found her annoying and her reaction towards her brother's one night stands are somewhat creepy. Tolliver wasn't much better. He travels all over with his sister and picks up waitresses. I got bored with Harper's story of being struck by lightening repeated again and again and again. I had a difficult time getting into it since I disliked the two main characters and found their overly close relationship rather creepy."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Length:: 1:39 MinsI liked it!"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Harper Cornell has an unusual gift. Corpses 'speak' to her and tell her how they died. Traveling the country with her best friend, stepbrother Tolliver, she uses her gift to make money.Initially I didn't like Harper. The author almost went too far to make sure we feel sorry for her: she was struck by lightning as a child, she has several physical ailments, her parents drank, her mother tried to pimp her out when she was a teenager, the world doesn't like her, doesn't understand her, and believes she is a kook, she has an abducted sibling, her sisters hate her, she had trouble in highschool, etc. Its almost a little much. But if you can ignore this obvious play to get us to feel sorry for her, I actually began to like this book. Harper is a tough, determined character. She has none of Sookie's airiness and I prefer it that way.Parts of the story were not to my liking, though: Such as: I found Tolliver to be a bit of an idiot. I felt he was mooching off of Harper, even though we hear every five minutes how much harper *needs* him. I felt at points the relationship was co-dependant and unhealthy. Also, I didn't find Tolliver (long hair and moustache) to be that sexy. I kept imaging this tall greasy guy with black hair, moustache and bad skin. Yuk.Overall, an enjoyable read, but I wouldn't call this a romance or a 'humorous' book. Its pretty dark even if its not explicit. 4 stars."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This new series by Charlaine Harris does not disapoint. Harper and her stepbrother live a very unusual lifestyle. When Harper was struck by lightenig it gave her the ability to feel when a dead body was near and to tell exactly how that person died. Since her gift has also made her extremely afraid of thunderstorms and a little on the fragile side in terms of temperment her stepbrother has taken over as her business manager and protector. They make a living by offering Harper's talents to anyone that needs to find a missing person that is believed dead. Sometimes Harper doesn't find what she is looking for, but instead turns up the unexpected and because her talent is often thought of as a hoax they can find themselves as the suspects. This first novel leaves you wanting to learn more about this unlikely team. Charlaine Harris does it again, a satisfying read with just enough paranormal intrigue and mystery to leave you wanting more."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"When Harper Connelly was a teen she was struck by lightening, ever since she has been able to find dead people and determine how they died. Harper along with her step brother Tolliver travel around the country to help families and the police find their missing loved ones.Grave Sight leads Harper and Tolliver to a small town in Arkansas to look for a missing teenager. What the encounter is the usual bias and skepticism for Harper's and gift and the unusual fact that someone is trying to stop Harper from finding the teenager at all costs.Fans of Harris' Sookie Stackhouse will appreciate this new series and find the paranormal mystery quite entertaining and good. Mystery fans may find it quite easy to figure out who the culprit is but will still be able to enjoy Harper's unusual talents. This is a great start for a new series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I am a fan of Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire series and when this new series finally came into paperback I thought I would give it a try. This was my first strictly mystery novel. It wasn't a bad start either. I may have been basing my opinion on her previous work with vampires and since I love vampires thats why I only gave the book 4 stars.Harper was struck by lightning when she was a teenager and after surviving the incident she gained a special talent. She is able to see how people died. When she stands near a dead body she is able to see how that person died, but in her case she is unable to see the murderer. Although not everyone is found of her special talent. Her and her stepbrother Tolliver travel the country getting calls to towns to see how a certain someone died, but then they usually have to run for it because after Harper performs her services, the customers react badly and think Harper is evil and all that stuff.So when Harper and Tolliver go to Sarne to find the body of a missing girl they get more then they bargained for. After discovering that there were previous deaths of people who were connected to the missing girl things get really bad. After Harper finds the body, the mother of the girl is murdered. Now Harper and her brother are unable to leave town because the sheriff and the rest of the deputies are looking at Harper and Tolliver for the murder.To top it off Harper is getting close with one of the deputies, who's wife who was murdered awhile back and who was the sister and daughter of the girl and mother who died.The plot is a little slow, but that's typically how mysteries go. At the end(which I don't want to spoil for you), everything gets tied together and you may have a hard time following it because there's more than one murderer.Overall the book is good, a lot different than the Soutern Vampire series' mysteries, but its still a good read. There isn't really any supernatural connections despite how it may seem. Good book though, buy it in paperback if you want to give it a try!"},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I don't like to give away plot details in my reviews as they may take away some of the enjoyment for the reader so I'll stick to generalities.I've read several of Charlaine Harris's books from her Sookie Stackhouse series and enjoyed them all. However, this newest series resonates so much more with me. Harper Connelly, her newest protagonist, is a young woman who can sense where a person has died and feel their last few moments on earth. There are similarities between Sookie and Harper Connelly: they are both young women, blessed - or cursed, depending on how you look at it - with rare gifts, and are loners for the most part.Harper's life has not been a very happy one, but she does share a close and supportive relationship with her protective older step-brother Tolliver. They are both survivors of a brutal upbringing. Their insular relationship is the key to this series - they're people you want to know more about and care about from the first page of the story. Everything about them and their lives is tinged with a sadness that goes bone deep.The one problem I had with the mystery itself was there were a few too many twists and turns at the conclusion - both a little confusing and difficult to believe. But I wouldn't let that detract you from giving this exceptional new series a try. I only hope we don't have to wait long for the next Harper & Tolliver installment."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This author is probably my favorite of the paranormal chick lit sort of genre that I've been introduced to in the last two years; her Sookie Stackhouse books are outstanding, well-written and genuine and fun. I love Sookie's strength and vulnerability, and the way nothing specific defines her; Sookie is a whole person, and the books explore her working life, her family life, her romantic life, her life as a psychic, as a homeowner, as a Southerner -- everything. No one facet is allowed to dominate, and I really like that. So I was excited about reading a whole new character with a whole new power, and exploring another well-rounded life.I was disappointed. The book wasn't bad, because Harris is just a good writer, but everything I liked about Sookie was lacking from Harper. Her vulnerability was annoying, her strength was haphazard and undefined, her relationships with everyone but her brother were shallow and one-dimensional. The story wasn't enough to carry me through, though it wasn't bad; it had an interesting twist, but the bad guy wasn't set up as bad enough before he started killing, so it felt unbelievable. For Harper, a woman who was struck by lightning and gained the ability to sense the dead and see their last moments, her power, while interesting, barely made an appearance in the story -- she finds the dead people in the town within the first hundred pages, and the rest of the book is sort of about her flailing around the town without much in the way of purpose. She depends on her brother to the point of psychosis, something that I couldn't relate to, and it wasn't explained enough for me to understand. She has a fling with a sheriff's deputy, but since it's basically a one-night stand, there wasn't much point to it.I didn't feel like there was much point to the whole thing. But maybe I'm being too hard on it. But there are a lot of other books I'm planning on reading before the second book of this series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"By now you know the lead in the story, Harper, was struck by lightening as a teen and can now sense the dead, along with a flash of how they died. She and her stepbrother, Tolliver, travel around using this talent to locate the deceased for their families/friends/law enforcement. For whatever reason, Publisher's Weekly states \\"her stepbrother, Tolliver, who acts as her manager and bodyguard and with whom she shares a thinly disguised physical attraction that they manage to keep at bay by engaging in casual sex with various partners.\\" There was absolutely no sexual tension, disguised or otherwise, between the two siblings and I don't know why this statement was even made unless in the next book something comes up.Anyway, they travel to an Arkansas town and locate a missing teenager, find out about several previously unknown murders, and get sucked into the nastiness of small town corruption. The characters, particularly Harper and Tolliver, are interesting if not well fleshed out. Being a voracious reader of Charlaine Harris I was suprised at the somber tone of this book. I'm used to a bit of humor in her writing but this book is (you'll pardon me for saying) deadly serious.Perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised as the last Sookie book was a lot darker than the previous ones. Maybe this is the direction in which she is now choosing to go.An interesting book, well worth the read."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"********************spoiler Alert***********************I purchased Grave Sight because I love Charlaine Harris' writing. I have all of her other series. Harper is completely different from any other of CH's characters. Harper is dark. But there is a reason for her darkness. Harper was stuck by lightning as a teenager. It stopped her heart. Her step brother Tolliver has to do CPR until an ambulance arrived. When Harper was brought back to life she had a gift. She can feel and hear the dead. Harper can feel where the dead are buried under the ground or where a body is left. She knows what they died from and sees the last few seconds of their life. I love this idea, and I love the mysteries CH creates with Harper's gift.Harper has a terrible childhood. Her Mother and stepfather are drug addicts and do not take care of their children. They live in a trailer, two children from the mother's first marriage, two children from the father's first marriage, and two babies born after the second marriage. Harper, her sister, and her step brothers must take care of the family and sometimes even their parents. Their family is ripped apart when her older sister in kidnapped and never found. The two babies are taken away and Harper and Tolliver are sent away. Tolliver's brother is able to go on his own.Harper and Tolliver have no way to earn an income other than using Harper's gift. They use a Lap Top to get potential customers and word of mouth. People are afraid of Harper, many think she is a fraud and some think she is a witch or physic. Harper and Tolliver travel to a small town in Arkansas to help the police discover how two teenagers died. No one likes the answer.I love the book because I find Harper's gift is exciting to read about. When Harper takes off her shoes and walks barefoot in a grave yard, she knows who is beneath her feet. She feels them. They want to be heard. Harper speaks for the dead. When she walks in the woods she can feel them under the ground. The long dead reach out to her too.I have read all the reviews posted to date and many people are upset because Harper is not like Sookie. Harper is the opposite of Sookie so don't expect another Sookie novel. People are uncomfortable with Harper's ability with the dead, because she is comfortable with them. Harper doesn't hate the dead, she speaks for them. She gives brokenhearted parents answers and closure. Sometimes when she speaks for the dead, the living don't like the answer.Also Harper is very close with Tolliver. Their parents did marry when Harper and Tolliver were teenagers. They depended on each other to take care of the younger siblings and survive in their dysfunctional family. People see them as brother and sister but they are not. They are not related by blood, only by the marriage of their parents. They are more like close friends with a hint of sexual tension. Harper is very dependent on Tolliver. She is from a train wreak of a family, her sister was kidnapped and missing, and Tolliver is all she has. I did not find this relationship creepy or disturbing. Anyone who had a bad childhood with step-siblings knows strong bonds are formed to survive. CH likes to take us to places where we are not comfortable. And Harper does not make us comfortable in anyway. Harper is a survivor. She communicates with the dead. I don't expect her to be \\"normal\\".I would recommend this book to a friend. I enjoyed it and did order the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"This one is an easy five stars from me.My introduction to Ms. Harris' works was in a book club discussion of Dead Until Dark three or four years ago. After reading everything she had done in that series, I eventually branched out to her other series. One thing I've noticed through all of them, whether it's in the True Blood series, Lily Bard series (Shakespeare titles), or Aurora Teagarden, and her non-series works, is that she is first and foremost a mystery writer. Everything else is secondary.Grave Sight is the first in her Harper Connelly series. Harper is a troubled young woman from a broken home. She has more step- and half-siblings than you can shake a stick at. A few years before the book begins, she was struck by lightning. This changes her life. See, it gave her a \\"gift\\" ... She can sort of communicate with the dead. She gets a feeling for dead bodies nearby, and when she is close to them, she can tell how they died, through their eyes. It's as though it's happening to her.And this is now her job. With her step-brother Tolliver (also her business manager, partner, and bodyguard), she gets calls from police and others to come to their towns to help search for bodies, confirm causes of death, and the like.In Grave Sight, she is called to a small Southern town called Sarne, where a pair of teenagers has disappeared. The boy has been found, shot to death in what they believe is a suicide, while the girl is still missing. The police - who almost never believe her when she first enters a town - ask her to go ahead and give it a try. What she finds surprises them all. Unfortunately, it also puts her own life in danger.Every town has secrets, and this one has a doozie. She's just there to do one job, but keeps getting dragged back in, and things go from bad to worse the longer she stays.The book is probably her best-written to date, with fully formed characters and a setting that cannot help but draw the reader in. I enjoyed the heck out of it and look forward to the second book in the series, Grave Surprise."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"OK, OK, I recognize futility when I see it and 80 plus reviews are a substantial number for this book. But I could not let the injustice go of less than 4 stars! Come on, what are you all reading? This novel excellently blends the top three genres in mass market writing today (paranormal, romance, and mystery) with a plot rich in both brains and heart. The mystery is well written with enough clues to keep you intrigued right to the end. And the romance!!!--it was light on sensuality but very touching and poignant bringing together the best of two people who found each other and then....As soon as I finished this one I went out and got the second one and it promises to be a goodie too. Take a risk and you will be rewarded."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I enjoy reading Charlaine Harris at different times in my life. Her books are good light entertaining fare but she missed the mark on her new series featuring Harper Connelly. As stated in the synopsis she was hit by lightning which gave her the ability to locate corpses and know their last moments on earth. The idea of the book is brilliant but Harper and her step-brother Tolliver just don't pull the reader into their world. Harper is semi-likeable whereas Tolliver is likeable but he's not the main character here. Of course, by reading the book we all understand Harper has had a tough life. By choosing to get paid for what she does (find corpses), her life has only become tougher. Still there is something about her that put me off. It's not her abilities so much as her attitude. She has a lot of neurosis and she is always on guard and unfriendly. She doesn't seem to enjoy her work all that much.In this book they go to a small town in Arkansas named Sarne. This town has the nastiest people in the world living in it. Very few, if any, in this town have any redeeming qualities. If it were not a fictional place I would advise getting rid of it and its inhabitants.I still think Charlaine Harris is a talented writer but she can do much better than this book. It lacks humor, which I usually love in Harris's works, and it is especially dark. The mystery part of the story is intriguing and Harris does a good job not giving it away before the end. In fact the mystery aspect of the book is the reason I gave this a 3; however, I would not recommend that anyone who has not previously read Harris start with this book. Her other series are by far superior."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I was borrowing a coworkers Kindle and this was on her list so i decided to give it a go.

Me, being a die hard all around adult paranormal romance fanatic in every way, had a hard time putting down the book by chapter 3. I always read reviews on a series before buying, because lets face it, 9 bucks or more a book can add up when buying a set series. I tend to focus more on the dislikes of the book to make sure i can handle what others cant. some of these reviews included:* Complaints about the brother/sister relation ship-which honestly isn't even evident until book 3, and by then you love the main characters and what they stand for and are past the step brother sister facade. Book one concentrates more on where Harper came from and how she got to where she was. The brother sister relationship, that some people say is gross and perverted honestly stems as a security blanket because they have only had each other most of their lives.* The complaints that all she talks about is how she got hit by lighting- this annoys me to the tenth degree. Of course she mentions it alot, because thats the only explanation available to give people as to why she has this certain talent and contributes to serious side affects that make her job a little more complicated. She cant just say, \\"it just came to me\\", because she was hit by lightening and then she could channel the dead. what else would she say? Harper is an honest person and it is evident when confronted with the hostile close minded characters in the book.* Complaints that you know who the killer is and there is no suspense- dont know what they were reading but there were so many key factors at play i couldn't pin down exactly who it was until the conclusion. There of course the group of suspects but it is not evident who exactly it is until the end. Kinda wanna sympathize with the wrong doers, but they are crazy enough that you know better!If your hearts not dedicated to experiencing a fine and different piece of work from an amazing author, maybe you should just stick to children's books, its safer that way."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I was ran out of Sookie books to read and was so sad, I just had to try another Charlaine Harris series. I LOVE Harper Connelly! Charlaine Harris has an amazing ability to create characters who are both way out-there and 100% believable. Ok, so Harper has the ability to find dead people, kind of out-there; but I still feel like she is the neighbor I would love to sit on the porch and drink tea with... Oh, and I love the story, too."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"For those of you familiar with the wildly popular TrueBlood HBO series which revolves around a psychic and her vampire friends, this is another great series by the same author with a different twist.If you like mysteries, this is a great set of books that touch on family dysfunction, the frailty of human emotion while showcasing internal fortitude, all in one book. Harris does a well done, hard-boiled mystery, but has not received enough credit in this area with all the hype surrounding the vampire series. Not so with these \\"undiscovered\\" books about a young woman that can determine the cause of death from a corpse through clairvoyant visions.Harper Connelly and her stepbrother Tolliver travel (for hire) town-to-town helping the local police and others seek answers for unexplained death(s). Connelly is a resolute young woman that through various life hardships, is both fragile and strong ( a paradox to be sure). Oftentimes disbelieved, the pair obligate proving themselves throughout the story.A strong plot line and detailed characterization make this an entertaining read for mystery lovers and paranormal junkies. Not as \\"far-out\\" as the terrific, Sookie Stackhouse series, it still has the paranormal angle that is currently such a sought-after read but will not phase the non-paranormal reader. This is perfect read for someone \\"breaking into\\" the paranormal genres and their various forms.The fourth book in this series will be released in November under the title, Grave Secret. Books two and three are as follows: Grave Surprise and An Ice Cold Grave."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"Reviewed for [...]I adore Charlaine Harris' quirky writing, and Harper Connelly is about as quirky as they come. You're probably never going to come across another book where, thanks to being struck by lightning, the protagonist can find dead bodies. And you're unlikely to find another author who can make such a ridiculous idea work. Harris is best known for her Sookie Stackhouse series, and Harper isn't as popular or as loved, but I think she's fantastic.Harris' speciality is in grounding her paranormal stories in mundane, day to day life. People work minimum wage jobs, do their housework, save for renovations, look like regular people. Harper is just an average young woman - apart from the fact she still has health problems connected to the lightning strike. Her \`brother' (who's actually a stepbrother she didn't know until her teens) is an average guy with physical flaws. The two of them are doing the best they can after their unhappy, poor upbringing forced them to grow up too early and see too much. They're quietly saving the world, one corpse at a time.I really like the paranormal aspect of this one, but it does not rule the story. Grave Sight isn't anywhere near as grounded in the supernatural as the Sookie series. This is small town Arkansas, with one woman who sees, hears and knows things other people never will. The insanity comes from the \`regular' people, and one of my favourite things about the author's books is that she can take a regular situation and make it explode. One minute everything's fine, and the next the town's most upstanding citizen has turned into a murdering maniac.This series is somewhat controversial - and becomes more so in later books - with Harper and Tolliver's unconventional relationship. They are not blood relations and did not live through their childhoods together. In this first book there is no romantic relationship between them, and it's the way they have always worked together and depend on each other that was so interesting. Men and women come and go out of their lives, but their loyalty is first and foremost to each other. Harris is able to convey the strength of their connection with just a few words, by showing a few small actions, and it has a powerful effect.I've read and liked many of Charlaine Harris' mysteries - both real-world and paranormal. The concept of a woman who can find dead bodies is interesting, but the strongest aspect of this book for me was the connection and unswerving loyalty between the lead characters.VERDICT:This was a very good start to the series. Charlaine Harris' writing is - as always - witty, quirky and heartfelt. Harper is a wonderful protagonist and the secondary characters were extremely well-written. Recommended both for fans of cosy mysteries and paranormal stories."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this new series by Charlaine Harris. My friends and I have loved the Sookie Stackhouse books, and when I saw Grave Secret at the library (gasp!), I was intrigued.And pleasantly surprised! Not the same genre, but a well told story, a mystery whose ending I was unable to guess by page 30 (yay!), and characters who I like. Now I'm going to have to retrace my steps and read the first three novels! Thanks Charlaine for another winning series....."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"I did not really know what to expect with this series. After reading the Twilight Series and the Sookie Stackhouse Series, I thought I would never come to like another series. While this series is not nearly as good, it was still pretty entertaining. Charlaine Harris has a great imagination! I would have never expected a sixth sense as finding dead people. Good read overall."},{"Title":"Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)","review":"After reading Charlaine Harris' Sookie series, I wasn't sure she could keep me interested in another heroine. Harper is interestingly portrayed and I was anxious to get back to my book. Since I love to read about vampires,paranormal activity, and any super powers on the common person, this book fit the bill. I think Charlaine is an exceptional writer. I like how her mind works."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"Okay. Let me get somethin' straight here. Why does everyone think these new books are so bad? Maybe I like the old ones better, but these new ones are good. I really liked this and Camp Saddlebrook. But, hey, give all these authors credit: it's hard to write a book! Believe me, I'm writing three horse books right now titled: Dream Horses, A Horse With Justice, and the third one isn't titled yet."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"I did like this book, and I loved the first books in the series( the ones with Wonder, Pride, Shining, Sierra, and Ashleigh, Samantha, Tor and those guys.) But personally I think the books should go back to RACING! That's why I started reading them. The jumping stuff is okay, but Christina is a little brat! And what ever happened to Cindy?! She was a bit obsessive with being a jockey, but still. I mean, she wasn't even mentioned in Ashleigh's X-mas Miracle, or any of the ones after that. And also- what happened to Mandy? I want to know if she went on to bigger and better things. I wish Joanne would come back to this series, the new writer doesn't even know what the horses' names are. She called Wonder's Pride Townsend Pride in one of the books. I loved the &quot;on the edge of your seat&quot; kind of suspence you got in the books on racing. I'm missing a few of the books in the series, but I'm planning to get them and keep reading. But I feel the books should go back to racing. I hope Melanie does. I will keep reading the books with Cristina in them though, just to keep up with the series. I think Cristina should be second next to Melanie in the future books, at least for a while. In this book I like the way Melanie got in trouble a lot, but still found a way to pull together, since she didn't do anything wrong."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"I just wanted to say that I really like Melony and she has a lot of promise in future books!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"Okay...here's the situation in my case. I am 15, in 10th grade...i first got the books in 4th grade. My dad gave me the first two books as a gift for some holiday...from then on i would get two more books until i caught up w/ the pace that joanna campbell was writing them. I was hooked on these books from the first line of the first book, and i own all of them...that is all of them until i got fed up w/ the changing story. I am so sick of the different authors, the shallower content, and the ever changing plot. yeah that may sound fine, because i am too old to find the books challenging, but who doesnt like to read books just for the fun of it. I also dont like that they are coming out so fast that there are typos and grammatical errors. where are the editors???? I even found that once Campbell stopped writing them, the other authors would get the facts of the story mixed up in their later books. Ugh!!!! i'm tired of it....i was hoping to collect the whole series....well now i have no intention of collecting this series that has changed so drastically!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"I have a question. In this book it says Trib is a buckskin. But the cover, and parts of the book, has him as a paint. I hope that the series will come back. Sammy, Cindy, Max, Heather, Tor, Mandy, and Asheigh. You're proboly thinking, hey, Ash is in the book? She isn't! This is not the same Ash! Joanna, please oh please come back and make the series about racing!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"This book is okay. Melanie is a lot better than Christina who is a real brat."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"I don't particually enjoy the latest books either but look at it from the authors point of view:joanna campbell did really great things with the series and the characters, then she turned over to the other writers, so naturally, after one great writer readers will be very critical of the author's way of writing. The advice given to writers is &quot;write what you know&quot; that's what these people did. They know jumping so that's what they write. Maybe they don't know the first thing about racing, think about how upset you would be if somebody who didn't know racing starting writing a whole series based on something they knew nothing about. I'm a dressage rider and if started writing about racing people would laugh at me. So try and approach these new books as if you never read Joanna's work and don't even think of them as the same series. If you were writing the new books you wouldn't want people trashing your work. You'd want them to try and enjoy your books and not always be compared to Joanna Campbell's. If my riding skills were always compared to a fellow competitors, it might discourage me from riding altogether. surely you don't want to ruin a writer's career by your bad opinions?"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"Ok, look I totally LOVED the book Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle because besides that book just being all around great, I really admired Christina in that book.....she was brave, nice and not bratty. I liked her attitude in that book. So then I heard about these books coming out in the series about her and I was really excited and I started reading them and really DISLIKING them. Christina has SUCH a bad attitude and she's so bratty, stuck-up and spoiled. So either they change Christina's attitude or get the books back to racing....and if they don't then the TB series has just lost another customer! So change the series so your readers can enjoy the books again!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"Ok, I know what y'all mean by the series is changing a lot but I like what has happened...well kinda. Melanie is my fav character because Christina whines WAY too much... and I hope what the other girl said was true, that Melanie goes to racing!!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"Okay, so I haven't read this book yet but I wanted o say something. I think the new charachters are cool and everything, but what happened to the old ones? Especially Cindy???She wasn't exactly my favourite charachter but all of a sudden in number 24 she had suddenly dissapered!So had Len, the old barn manager. What happened to him??? Did he die??? I'd like to know. What happened to Cindy??? And what about Sammy??? Did she ever marry Tor???"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"I just read this book and its not that bad! I like the racing ones better, but face it, these are more realistic. How many young girls train RACEHORSES the way Ashleigh, Samantha, and Cindy did. I think Joanna is really smart to alternate books between jumping and racing. GREAT idea and a GOOD book!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"I think it's a good book. I like how Melanie is becoming better and now has a good friend in Christina. I wish the books went back to Samantha,Tor,Cindy,Max, and all of the old horses. Possibly even follow up on Glory's and Champion's offspring."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"Okay so maybe the books have gone down hill. But still that is no reason to critisize Joanna Campbell last week I looked up Camp Saddlebrook and found a review by Joanna campbell in it she said: 1)she didn't write the book 2)no one consulted her before turning the series to eventing 3)she is angry too 4)In one of the upcomming books the series Melanie will become hooked on racing and Sammanta will come back from Ireland and become Melanies mentor after that the series will alternate 1 book about racing 1 book about eventing. So anyway if people want to stop reading the series then go ahead but hang in there loyal fans Joanna says it will get better and Im going to belive her. As for everyone putting down Melanie stop I agree with the reader from New Mexico she's had a hard time and is trying to mend her ways. I also agree with the reader from Bountiful the series was more exciting when it was about racing but its all in the love of horses. And the person who wonders why we all like Joanna campbell so much and says that the series wasn't good even when she wrote probably isn't truely horse crazy because the series was wonderful before no it's good. so please stop putting it down. THE END"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"I haven't read this book, and I don't plan to! What has happened to this series? It was set up perfectly when Glory's Joy was born, and I thought Honor Bright was going to make a good star. But it didn't get far enough to reach full potential! Is this series up for sale, and whatever crappy &quot;author&quot; wants it can buy it and write a few books, until they are booed down from their pedistol by their &quot;adoring&quot; fans? The series used to be mediocre, in my opinion, but it has progressed to downright INSULTING! Don't expect me to waste over four dollars on what is worth only the paper its printed on! The awful &quot;Thoroughbred&quot; series has just lost yet another customer!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"I have loved reading these books since I was in 2nd grade. The racing has always been exciting and I could never put them down. I admit that the jumping isn't as exciting but it's all about love for horses! And I think that the people that are writing nasty things are being unreasonable. I'll admit that Joanna needs to come back and get back into racing. By the way, what ever happened to Cindy?"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"Why do we have so many books about camp? It's boring and all the same. I don't think the writer is very inspired. I'm not reading these. I refuse to because they are stupid. I might read a few of the racing books in the future, but as far as the jumping stuff, I'm not going to read pointless babble. And if the future racing books are just as petty and unrealistic, I'll quit reading those too. Just because it has some races in it doesn't make it wonderful. May the writer remember that. It has to be more than a few races. Research won't kill you. Your readers aren't stupid, they're unhappy."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"In this book, Melanie has to win the last show of the session at Camp Saddlebrook.

Can Melanie prove to her dad that she has changed before he takes her back to New York for good?"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"Reading about Ashleigh has been great!! I enjoy reading about all her racing problems and victories. Her daughter Christina is cooltoo. The only thing I don't like about the books about her is that she is having trouble with someone or her mom. I wish that for just 2 or 3 books she won't have any problems. I want Dylan to finally ask Christina out on a date too. It's obvious that he likes her. I really enjoy reading these books though."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"Man! I wish that they would speed up theses books! I mean, with Ashleigh she went from 12 to 16 years old and it only took 5 books to do THAT(and I liked that compared to the new generation of the series.)! Now with Christina and all these other kids its taken 5 books just to get them about one month, it seems like, into the future. Gosh!! An then there is the problem with Sterling. I mean, with the horses I've worked with in the past once we've solved their problem they usually don't do that anymore. But in these books Chritina is ALWAYS having problems. To me it just to unrealistic."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"Although we all know what a gift Ms. Campbell has, we should remember how challenging it is to pick up where someone else left off. That is not saying that I prefer Allison Estes' books, but I think we should be fair. Camp Saddlebrook, which was not written by AE was, I think, the best so far of the &quot;Christina books.&quot; And I just thought of something: The character Max Smith, who I, personally think is a sweetheart, was not created by Joanna. Karen Bently developed him........"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"This book was OKay. I like the tint of mystery to it. I think it adds spark. But it's kind of slow and easy to put down. That's why I didn't give it five stars like I usually do. Don't get me wrong, I still recommend reading it because if you skip it you might get confused in Dylan's Choice, the next one. I'm just saying it isn't as great as it should be."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"I have been reading this series since the forst book-A Horse Called Wonder- was published. I am now 18 years old and although the reading level of the books have not changed, I still read them. I have every book written in the series and reread them all the time. I agree that I love the racing more than the eventing but the books are still great. I'va always been fascinated by horseracing but I do not own a horse. I ride at my aunt and uncles farm,which is the reason I got interested in horses in the first place. If anyone has the e-mail address of Joanna Campbell please let me know. I really want to e-mail her about how fantastic her creation is. Don't criticize the books please. They are wonderful and I hope they never stop coming!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"I have to agree with everyone, the books are hard to write. I have written 3 short stories, titled- &quot;The Black Colt&quot;, &quot;You Killed My Sister, the Devil Shall Kill You&quot;, and the third isn't titled yet.Also, these books do haev some mistakes in them. Like when Princess got hurt and in book #16, page38 and 39, last line on pg 38 and 1st 3 paragraphs on 93 were saying that Ashleigh didn't want to ride another horse in the Derby except for Princess, but Ashleigh was NOT Princess's jockey. There were a lot of mistakes in all of the &quot;new&quot; books, expecially the &quot;newer&quot; ones- like 23 and up.all in all this book was ok, though very predictialbe. The only charater that I don't like is Christina- but only at times.hopefully the books will get better. If anyone wants to talk bout them e-mail me at LuvTBracin@aol.com (love thoroughbred racing)"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"I see that everyone agree's about most of these books. It is very true that some of the facts are getting mixed up. Example (21, I think said that a filly hadn't won the Belmont stakes in over a century.) Ashleigh must be a 110 years old. And what did Wonder do then. I disagree with most of the other readers though on Cindy and Glory. I loved the two of them. When I read about them I got all warm inside, because they were such a good team.Christina is another story, I like her but she dosn't belong in this series. This series is about racing after all. They could write that Christina has a younger sister whom loves racing, or maybe Samantha and Tor could have a kid. BUT NOOOOO more show jumping! I'm glad that Joanna Campbell has a new series on Ashleigh and I will read it faithfully! Keep up the good work Joanna!"},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"All of you stupid people who are dissin' Melanie should look at this more closely. Melanie is a girl who was bad just to get attention since she got so little at home with her father. As you can see if you really read these books she is trying to clean up her act. I only gave this book 2 stars because I haven't read it yet. I miss Joanna as much or more than the rest of you but I believe that we need to give these books a chance. I really loved the books about Cindy and Max and I want to know exactly how their relationship turned out. I would love it if either Joanna Cambell or Karen Bently came back they were both extremely good writers, well the more I think about it I liked Karen Bently better 'cause she gave the books more feeling and emotion. I actually cried when Cindy and Max fought, that's how good she was. Okay I just wanted to say to stop dissin' Melanie. Good-Bye."},{"Title":"Melanie's Last Ride (Thoroughbred)","review":"gggrrr!!!

Cristina is really getting on my nerves. She thinks she is so good and she pushes Sterling WAY to hard.

I am 16 years old, but I still read this series because I love horses and I compete in jumping. In my opinion, jumping is more fun and more exciting than racing, so I really enjoy reading about Christina. But, these books don't focus as much on horses as they used to. Now the books are only about personal problems, like this book, # 28, and # 30. But because I like jumping, I'll continue to read this series, and hope it will get better.

In an answer to a reader who asked why I love Joanna Campbell so much: I don't like Karen Bently because her writing was too happy and the horses were always wining. Cindy was obessed with wining. I don't like this new series of authors, not because they are bad writers, but because they failed to follow the story line and added a whole set of new characters without telling us what happened to the new ones.

The two main characters are Makar Devushkin, a wretched, 40ish, impoverished scribe in the Tsar's civil service, and, Verenka Alexeyevna, an intelligent, sickly, orphaned teenager. In \\"Poor People\\" the desperate struggles of that the poor are psychological laid bare. They have no safety net, no patron to keep them from tumbling over the edge of despair.Dostoevsky does not romanticize the poor. He shows their dysfunctional idiosyncracies: \\"Poor people are capricious - that's the way nature arranges it.\\" Makar is an unreliable, self-deprecating, yet vain man. Throughout the story Dostoevsky makes Makar's boots an analogy of both Makar personality and his situation in life.The young, vulnerable Verenka holds on to life by a thin thread. Her sacred memories of her beautiful childhood long gone sustain her. She carries these memories as one would carry a mystical crystal, tightly clutched to her heart. Her memories are her elixirs of life. These two protagonists, though embedded in the same poverty, go different ways. One is carried by the fickleness of fate, and the other makes a desperate choice for change.I confess, to my chagrin, I have never read Dostoevsky. I was chided by a well-read friend, who, during a discussion about the world's greatest novelist, stated \\"You must read Dostoevsky because of his grasp of the human psyche. Dostoevsky's characters have profoundly influenced world literature.\\" So, I chose to start with \\"Poor People\\"; it was Dostoevsky's first novel, and one of his shortest (130 pages, verses \`The Brothers Karamazov' at 900+ pages).If you're going to start reading Dostoevsky then \`Poor People' is a great book to commence with. You will get a glimpse of Dostoevsky's unique insight into the nature of humankind and about the extremes of life. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Poor people, (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"What a beautiful and tragic work. I am a lifelong fan of Dostoevsky's work and this is no exception. While \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" and \\"Crime and Puhishment\\" are his most noted achievements, and rightfully so, it is a wonder to me how much insight he had into the human condition at such an early age.This work demonstrates his understanding of the human condition: our need for love and basic necessities of life. What are these basic needs? Respect, honor, love. But these are diminished in the face of abject poverty, which are lost when basic needs cannot be met. Despite human pride and an ability to work to provide home and hearth, it is not always possible to do so.And so, in the midst of the squalor and dreariness of St. Petersberg, two souls are joined together, an aging man and a young woman, through a series of letters and brief innocent encounters . There is a deep reverence and joy in this relationship which can never be more than a desperate attempt to find warmth in the bleakest of conditions. And this is the beauty of the work. They sacrifice all they have to help each other, until at last, the final sacrifice cannot be made and their paths are determined once and for all.For those that have read Dostoevsky's great works, do not miss this one.

A typical city administrative clerk struggling through his 40's with love and employment. Falls in love with a sickly, young women with some personality. Together they fall in love and the clerk sells his everything to help her with needs for medicine and the like. We soon see that his dedication to her ends with her marrying a rich individual but at least thanking him for his help and generosity. This was Dostoyevsky's first novel and first critical success which made him an overnight sensation in St Petersburg and the rest of Russia. Soon at a party ater the novels release he gets up and states his opinion of the current Czarist administration. It leads to a trial and Dostoyevsky being found guilty of treason and is sentenced to death by a firing squad. He then is later led to a firing squad and has his blindfold placed and the squad is given the order to take sight of the individual. Then before saying \\"Fire\\" Dostoyevsky is informed that his death sentence by orders of the Czar is reprieved in favor of 10 years in a working prison in Siberia. The Czar later acknowledges his decision based on having read his novel Poor Folk and found it very promising so he spared his life. Once he serves his sentence he soon writes The House of the Dead, an almost autobiographical account of his experiences in prison.

Its geographic diversity is especially impressive, from the nation's largest metropolitan regions to small rural towns.

The authors provide 35 inspiring examples of smart growth - development in cities and suburbs, along with green space preserved - all over the country, while disussing the relevant environmental and social issues.Too often, environmentalists are criticized (and rightly so) for being too negative, pointing out problems without presenting solutions that work for the economy and for people's convenience. This book takes a most refreshing opposite approach, and backs it up with color photos and project data. The authors know what they are talking about, too: these are the same folks who wrote Once There Were Greenfields, the meticulously documented handbook on the problems associated with sprawl development. Solving Sprawl is the best thing I've seen yet on smart growth, and it should be a boon for anyone concerned with these issues.

I beleive it may be one of Jane Austen's best novels. It is a more clear and accurate portrayal of the sensibilities of the time. It goes more into human nature especially about the heart and why people fall in love.It is a simple story about a girl ,Fanny, who is taken in by her rich Aunt and Uncle. Fanny is an incredibly nervous person. Only her cousin Edmund can make her feel at home. She is raised very properly, although stiltedly because her uncle wants to be sure she realizes she is below their family. The entire family grows dependent on her. Fanny falls in love with Edmund who falls in love with another. I won't ruin anymore of the story. Read it!"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park might indeed be the crowning novel of Jane Austen's cannon; in which all of her authorial merits are present and paramount. Where Pride and Prejudice sparkles, Mansfield Park is solid gold. Pride and Prejudice can pass as a whimsy, an entertaining story, but Mansfield Park has pure heart. It ventures slightly deeper into the human condition and emerges slightly higher, ringing slightly truer than what is often considered to be Austen's most popular novel.For reasons already mentioned, Pride and Prejudice is still my favorite of Austen's books, though Mansfield Park is right up there with it. It would be like comparing the two heroines of each novel; Elizabeth Bennet and Fanny Price. Elizabeth is witty and beautiful and idependent; Fanny is good and wholesome and always considerable of what is right. We, the readers, have more fun tailing after the sparkling Elizabeth, but we admire and advocate Fanny.In short, Mansfield Park is arguably Jane Austen's best and definitely a must-read for Austen and Victorian fans. And although the cousin-love thing is slightly unnerving to our modern sensibilities, Edmund's final confession can't be rivaled by either Darcy's or Knightly's at all."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I am an avid reader of Jane Austen and the main reason is her use of wit and empowered female characters. Unfortunately, Mansfield Park has neither of these. It is touted as one of Austen's most &quot;complex&quot; and &quot;intricately plotted&quot; works. I enjoy the sense of fun that is so evident in most of her novels, and perhaps, I simply find Mansfield Park to dark for my taste. I could not relate to the main character, Fanny, who, in my opinion, was an extremely naive ninny.While I pleasurably breeze through Austen's other novels in an afternoon, I found Mansfield Park took me several days to read, because of the breaks I took when I became bored with the story. (Something which has never happened to me with any other of her books.) This novel is not a style I find appealing, but, who knows, you just might enjoy it."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield is a leisurely tale following the Bertram family and its Price transplant through marital negotiations and trips to the country and financial threats no one seems to grasp the true dangers of. If the Antigua estates really had failed or been lost, it seems there would have been drastic repercussions; also, an ocean voyage in the 1800's was never anything to take lightly, much less travel in the third world. There was a strong underlying tone of menace to the Messrs. Bertram while they were away, but the at-home family seemed to continue perfectly sanguine. Except for Fanny, who is as gifted at Worrying as my mother, and that's pretty extraordinarily gifted.Fanny. Oh, Fanny. She's just so ... nice. She's so nice I want to throw an expletival qualifier in there, and I can't; this is Jane Austen I'm talking about. She's timid and fragile and sweet, and obliging and not as delicate as she seems, and sweet. And meek, and ... when I right-click on \\"meek\\", Word gives me synonyms: humble, submissive, gentle, docile, modest, compliant, and mild. And sweet. Far from a backbone, there isn't a vertebra in the girl's entire body. Her entire skeletal system seems to be made of cartilage. Jane Bennet is sweet and modest and docile too, but by golly she can stand up for herself or someone she loves if need be. I think in a confrontation Fanny might simply cry, and then faint. Not a character much admired in this day and age.But she's so sweet.I saw someone's Goodreads status update for P&P; commenting on how much he appreciated the writing and the characters, but he was on such and such page and ... nothing ... was ... happening. I have never found that with P&P.; Mansfield Park, however ... oh my. Fanny comes to Mansfield ... nothing ... Mr. Bertram and Tom go away ... nothing ... the Crawfords move in ... nothing ... Tom comes back ... protracted space of nothing ... Lovers' Vows and things happen for a few chapters and then Mr. Bertram comes home and everything comes to a screeching halt and ... nothing ... That, combined with the extreme meekness of Fanny, makes for a surprisingly leisurely and ... well, dull story. For the most part we share no one's thoughts but Fanny's, and hers are so very athletically self-effacing and charitable - even to Mrs. Norris, one of the people least deserving of charity in this novel, if not ever - that events are not exactly moved along. It's a jolt when, briefly and rarely, we are made privy to conversations between Mary and Henry Crawford, laced with languorous malice.Perhaps the purpose of this day-to-day gentle unfolding of story is to focus the reader on the small things that do happen. In a modern setting, the concerns which beset Fanny would be almost nothing. Certainly the drama surrounding the play would be non-existent; it would trouble no one that a group of upper class young folk would do an amateur play, even if it was a bit racy. But given the placid pond that rock dropped into, there is a very real tension and concern about the morality of it all.And perhaps the intent in making Fanny so stunningly selfless was to make it so very ironic when Mr. Bertram berates her for selfishness. Her reasons for doing what she does are partly selfish, but only a very small part; she can't explain without telling him things he doesn't want to know, which she would consider a betrayal of others. From that moment on Fanny's life becomes a nightmare. The wrong interpretation is put on her actions, and every word she says to Edmund or her uncle is contradicted or ignored. Every. Single. Word.\\"I don't believe I can love him.\\" \\"Certainly you can.\\"\\"We are so very different.\\" \\"No you're not.\\"\\"I don't want to talk to you.\\" \\"You say that, but what exactly do you mean?

To put it quite bluntly, Mansfield Park is boring. The number one cause is the weak heroine Fanny Price, who doesn't measure up to Elizabeth Bennett or Emma Woodhouse. The spark and vivacity that Austen's other protagonists have simply isn't there. Austen still wields the English language like a true master, but the plot isn't vibrant enough. Austen only published six novels so Mansfield Park is worth reading for an Austen fan, but I wouldn't recommend it to the casual reader."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"It seems that Jane Austen liked \\"Mansfield Park\\" better than anything she had done before. With all due respect to her many excellent qualities, I can't agree with that judgment. That's the advantage of the formalist approach, in which the author's opinion of the work carries no more weight than anyone else's - guilt-free disagreement with Miss Jane. I suspect that would be just fine with her; she was no conformist.Indeed, as with most of her work, \\"Mansfield Park\\" concerns itself very closely with the dangers of conformity. In this case, the Bertram family, and their friends and relatives, get into trouble because of conformity not such much with social rules, but with fashion, peer pressure, or even each other. As our story begins, the aristocratic Bertrams have had their poor cousin Fanny Price in their home for several years. She's far too conscious of her station to rebuke her relations, but she sees them stumble into inappropriate and sometimes immoral activity and is not fooled.So far, for you Austen fans, Fanny Price is the Mr. Darcy, Lady Russell, Elinor Dashwood or Mr. Knightley of \\"Mansfield Park\\" - that is, the keen and practical observer of what's really going on. Unlike the keen and practical observers of other Austeniana, however, Fanny rarely speaks up. Then again, she has a lot more to lose. Even the best-intentioned people in this story behave with insensitivity at best, and some seem to genuinely hate her.As a matter of fact, for the first several chapters of \\"Mansfield Park,\\" there's no one at all to root for. Even Fanny herself is far too wimpy to sympathize with, at least to the modern reader. Her uncle Bertram, though generous, is unthinkingly cruel in his manner. Her aunt Bertram can barely rouse herself to anything but her own comfort. Cousins Maria and Julia are vain and condescending, cousin Thomas devotes himself to wild living, cousin Edmund the future clergyman is too busy moralizing to notice that Fanny is in love with him. Henry and Mary Crawford, the Bertrams' neighbors, are a couple of hypocrites at best, and the less said about Aunt Norris, the better.So you have to slog through page after page of nasty behavior, presented under the guise of propriety and standards, and it's really enough to make you sick. It's all backstory, of course - the story proper doesn't begin until the setup's complete - but that just makes it drag all the more. And to top it all off, because she had taken up a serious theme this time, Jane Austen restrained her delicious sense of irony and wrote the whole thing straight. She recovered her lightness of touch toward the finale, but the damage is done.If there's any irony in \\"Mansfield Park\\" at all, it has to do with values and virtue. Far more obviously than in most of her other work (where it was pretty obvious nevertheless), characters in this novel pay lip service to things like loving your neighbor as yourself while behaving in exactly the opposite manner. Several of these people constantly lecture Fanny about how grateful she ought to be to the Bertrams for all they've done - lecture her in such a tone that you'd think she'd just cursed them all roundly. Others loudly sermonize about things they hold dear and proceed to chase after romantic partners who value exactly the opposite things. Or they just assure everyone \\"I can make do with very little\\" while subtly demanding huge accommodations to their comfort. In short, they value appearances over substance. Meanwhile, Fanny goes about in virtual silence, doing all that virtue demands and never complaining that people don't notice.Since Austen began \\"Mansfield Park\\" with the intention of considering the clergy, it's worth noting that Fanny seems to value ancient Biblical principle over contemporary devotion to appearances - the gospel of Matthew does, after all, say something about praying in your room with the door shut so no one can see you. It's all constructed beautifully, but as I said, I wish that Miss Jane had really let these people have it, as she did elsewhere. I've said before that novels have plenty of room for moral examination, but you can get the same thing from a sermon. If it's to be a novel, it needs more. And \\"Mansfield Park\\" does not lack for entertainment value, but Austen did not play to her strengths here.This, then, is the lament of a Jane Austen fan who admires the author for stretching out into unfamiliar territory, but will soon return to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" with a sigh of relief. If Miss Jane, who completed only six novels, had lived longer, she would very likely have polished up her ability to treat serious subjects seriously (as well as treating serious subject lightly, which she was brilliant at). She certainly had the talent and the chops. And when it comes to admiring those with the courage of their convictions, like Fanny Price, Austen did at least have time to return to that theme in \\"Persuasion\\", maybe her best piece. Yes, although I didn't enjoy \\"Mansfield Park\\" all that much, I admire Austen for aiming high and missing, rather than staying in her comfort zone. For that and other reasons, I agree that (as someone else once put it) Jane Austen was probably better than we deserve.Benshlomo says, You don't have to enjoy noble failures, but you have to admire the willingness to fail."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Austen's Mansfield Park is perhaps one of the most derided of Austen's books, while Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Emma are considered her best. To modern readers, the heroine Fanny Price is too perfect and too inaccessible to be really sympathetic. Earlier readers once thought Mansfield Park vied with Pride and Prejudice as her best work. So do I.Austen was at the peak of her work, and while Fanny Price is not Elizabeth Bennett, she is a well written character in her own right. While admittedly she has no 'flaw,' she does have moments of weakness, such as during the play and in Portsmouth. But her main attribute is her resolve and accurate judgment of character. Also intriguing is Edmund Bertram, the hero, who is the greatest clergyman in all Austen, far superior to Elton or Collins.Further, with Mansfield Park Austen creates some truly interesting characters. Tom Bertram, Maria and Julia Bertram, Henry and Mary Crawford, Aunt Norris, Mr. Rushworth, the Price family and Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram. In my opinion, Sir Thomas is the best father-figure in all Austen. After he sees his flaw in raising his children, he at least repents and sees his error better than any other.The plot is magnetic and draws us into the events of these characters with an exciting payoff at the end which leaves the reader hungry for more. Austen was adept at drawing normal characters in normal settings. In Mansfield Park, the normal is what is really important."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards. For Jane Austen, that book was \\"Mansfield Park\\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?The biggest problem with \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \\"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.\\"Mansfield Park\\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Ok, I'll admit it right here. I skipped to the end of the book. But how could I help it? Between Edmund's confused love-life and Fanny's martyrdom, we were getting no where. It's like in one of those movies where you yell at the characters &quot;Just TALK to each other!&quot;Do you like the tv show Felicity? Then this is the book for you. Here you have two people who totally understand each other. They're soul mates. Yet they just can't seem to get together. The very characteristics that make them so right for each other are the walls that separate them. I have a feeling that Jane Austen was tired of being so nice and then getting the bad end of the bargain. Maybe writing this book was some kind of outlet for her. And she must have had LOTS of free time on her hands when she wrote this.So if you have lots of free time on your hands, and you're a die-hard Austen fan like me, go ahead. Take the challenge. See if you can make it all the way through Mansfield Park!"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"In MANSFIELD PARK, Jane Austen expands her sphere of moral vision. In her earlier novels, she focused on the relationships between marriage partners that were framed in a comedic context of how the typical English society of the late 18th century might complicate the likelihood of a series of happy marriages. In this novel, however, she abandons the world of light and trifling romantic comedy for one in which she shows the unpleasant underside of the genteel society that was so noticeably lacking in say, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. This dark underside includes a number of troubling aspects, all of which are antithetical to the world of light comedy.First, Austen relentlessly considers the impact of the lack of moral values as a result of inadequate education of children. The patriarch of the Bertram family, Sir Thomas, dearly loves his four children but he has given them a profligate style of life without teaching them how to live that life without being corrupted by its debilitating disadvantage of conspicuous consumption. Second, for the first time in her writing career, Austen boldly places the theme of good versus evil squarely on the interaction of several of her characters. The virtuous Edmund, who is as priestly as the collar that he wears on his neck, is tempted by the lascivious charms of the amoral Mary, who sees in Edmund only a fleeting diversion. Further, Austen places London itself as a den of urban iniquity, the source of the theatrical evil that threatens the pastoral innocence of Mansfield Park. Third, she calls into question some basic paradoxes about the nature of character itself. Are peoples' characters fixed at birth or are they molded by environment? And when character is fixed, is it capable of change, and if so, by what, by whom, and to what extant? These latter questions come into play mostly in the person of Fanny, the outcast relative of the Bertram family who loves Edmund. She is presented as impossibly virtuous, but in the face of her open defiance to marry the rich Henry Crawford, she is labeled as an ingrate and worse. No one in that group perceives her virtue, but the readers certainly do. From where does this virtue spring? It cannot be genetic since several others of her family are woefully deficient in virtue. It cannot be solely the result of environment since, except for the equally virtuous Edmund, the others treat her as uniformly unwanted and unloved.The answers to the above questions are raised, but only partially answered. Part of the problem in seeking answers to such eternal questions as love versus honor, duty versus obedience, and heredity versus environment in a novel is that this is a novel, and for Austen, a didactic one at that. Since she chooses to use a number of flat characters to represent allegorical archetypes of good and evil, their responses to their encounters cannot convey the full spectrum of thought that a more fully fleshed person might. Further the many plots--the love affair between Fanny and Edmund, the plots of the Bertram sisters, and the interweaving of the many strands of plot between the Bertram children--combine to cause the reader to zero in on these many threads rather than ponder their potentially more universal significances. What is lacking in MANSFIELD PARK is a pleasing balance and harmony among the many snipped strands of plot and theme which cry out for a splicing that does not occur even at the happy marriage of Edmund and Fanny. This imbalance, combined with Austen's atypical use of realism and pressing social concerns, and her lack of a truly engaging heroine along the lines of Elizabeth Bennett, make MANSFIELD PARK a dutiful slog rather than a joyous read."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Generally a fan of Austin's writing, I was surprised at the dullness and ineptness of the text. The story dragged on leading the frustrated reader in no direction. Do not recommend this as a first Austin read."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"While this book touches upon the society of English countryside gentry and their sexist, classist and patriarchical lives, it is quite dull. The plot drags and the characters, though their personalities are developed, don't do much. Nothing interesting happens until the last 50 pages or so. Overall, a good book to fall asleep with."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park is a classic. Again, it is not the easiest read to follow but it is a good story."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park, a novel of Austen, focuses on love in soceity. Austen proves that love certainly overcomes all. Fanny, the protagonist, faces many barriers that affect her life and overall existence. She is from a poor family and is now living with her wealthy aunt. She is in love with her cousin, Edmund, and is faced with a dilemma of making him happy while not trying to be with him. The status of wealth and poverty places one's position in society. Austen, on this rare occasion, adds a divorce to add more drama to this romantic plot. The novel is a long tedious one but it has a signficant impact to all those who read it.

But the Crawfords are shameless and lead various members of the family into ruin.I read this book for the first time in either high school or college. I found Fanny so preachy and pallid as to be unpalatable.

Instead of a blistering diatribe, she gives meek little Fanny Price--and indignation on every page. Fanny is not in chains, but enslaved none the less. Her life is taken away from her.At age 10 she's taken from her parents and siblings to Mansfield Park. Her aunt and uncle Bertram will take on the expense of her upbringing and raise her with their own children. Fanny gets a beautiful home, her own (unheated) bedroom, nice clothes, rich food and the best education an Englishwoman could hope for. In return she has no friends, possessions or autonomy. She must do everything she's told, be always acquiescent and grateful, wait on her exquisitely inert Aunt Bertram and thank Aunt Norris for her insults. She's considered beneath the value of firewood and isn't even given credit for being pretty! Someone else did it for her. When she dares to display independence she's shipped back to her impoverished family in Portsmouth to teach her a lesson. (The phrase \\"Sold down the river,\\" comes to mind. Mark Twain uses it inPudd'nhead Wilson (Dover Thrift Editions)to mean \\"put to hard labor as a field slave.\\" Fanny's trouble is nothing compared to that).Mansfield Park is about sexual imperialism and the enslavement of women.The luxurious and languid lifestyle at Mansfield is supported by slave-raised sugar. This fact is raised exactly once and instantly dropped. That 75% of the Bertram children are morally bankrupt Austen ascribes to bad parenting.Fanny is one of many examples in the Austen canon of women whose lives are not their own: Anne Elliot (Persuasion), Jane Fairfax (Emma (by Jane Austen)), all 4 Dashwood women (Sense and Sensibility (Dover Thrift Editions)). Not to mention Charlotte Collins (nee Lucas) (Pride and Prejudice) who lands a pompous boob for a husband and has to spend the rest of life sucking up to insufferable Lady Catherine DeBurgh.Marriage, dear reader, was the only career for gentlewomen. The dread of failure to make a match is the subtext to all Austen's works.It's not loneliness these young women fear-- To be a lady with no husband (or son) meant destitution. This fear is ever-present and palpable in all Austen's novels. It is even in Emma. Although Miss Woodhouse doesn't have any worries, the fate of the unmarried has its starkest example there in the characters of shabby genteel Mrs. Bates and her too too chatty spinster daughter.One of the few times Fanny Price shows gumption is when she talks on the stress of finding a husband. In addition to making a match there's the pressure of making a good one; that is finding a man who will respect and like you as well as keep you. Imagine gambling your whole life's happiness on a few weeks acquaintance? A woman was expected to be grateful to any man who shows attention and jump at any marriage proposal. A proper English lady goes from one master to the next (father to husband) without a peep and with tears of joy.Fanny Price's life on bondage is infinitely superior to slave labor. IN many ways she's better off that she would have been with the Prices--her home-bound sister, Susan, has no outlets for her natural talents. Austen points out the contradictions in Fanny's situation to acknowledge her and her culture's dividuality on issues that are black-and-white to us.You can read Jane Austen for entertainment and escape. She is an outstanding writer. But when you understand the context of her times--the imperialism she lived under, the role she was enslaved to--you understand why she is a supreme artist. She converted a frightening reality into wondrous novels. From could, rough straw she spins gold, bright, lively and joyous."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I am very happy with this seller. The book arrived quickly as well as the condition it was described as."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Not Jane Austin's best work. I've read this one for the first time this year, and understand why it is not as famous as Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility. Still, it has memorable characters and an interesting plot. Is it really that shocking for a group of young people to entertain themselves by putting on a play? Or was Austen simply poking fun at the morals of the time? Anyway, it is worth reading just to vicariously experience a cleaner, simpler English countryside with privileged people who have entirely too much time on their hands (not counting the absent pappa who at least has some kind of occupation). Also -- it was free! Who can beat that? Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I loved this book. You really get invested in the characters. Too bad there isn't a decent film version available for download."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"The story line was captivating and I was completely taken with the book. I did find it somewhat difficult to read in some places as Ms Austin did not differentiate women or men with first names but addressed them as As Miss ? or Mr ?. It took some rereading to try to figure out who was actually speaking or being addressed, especially when there were several characters in that particular section."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I love Jane Austen so much that I think I'm too adoring to really qualify to write a review. That said, Mansfield Park is excellent. Austen is always strong at pacing her drama, letting events unfurl at the right moment, all while coloring in the characters. The heroine takes her time becoming the heroine--to a modern reader, her meekness is at first irksome, almost causes her to come off as trifling, but then you see it develop into a modest but firm and very adult sense of observation. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This was an easy read and the characters were great. I do love Jane austen. The book in its description of places and people make it come to life. It would make a great movie."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I just cannot believe I haven't read this Austen novel before this year! I went through a Jane Austen phase in my early 20&#8242;s and have re-read my favorites a couple of times each since then. But I never ever read Mansfield Park! And my goodness, I adored this book! Fanny is such a wonderful character. A bit stodgy but she knows who she is and what she wants and she stands by her convictions throughout the book.One of the amazing things about Jane Austen is that while her books are set in the late 18th/early 19th centuries, her themes and humor are still relevant today. I actually laughed out loud a few times while reading Mansfield Park. I love Fanny....I want to be Fanny!"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This is one of my least favorite austen novels however it is still very well written. It's merely the unspeakable way that Fanny Price is treated for the majority of this novel. The Crawfords make this truly memorable. Fanny does have a happy ending."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"It was a really captivating story, and I could not put the book aside. By the middle of it I had a sensation that the story was rounding in circles and getting nowhere, but it still held my attention. Then, things start to happen and I could see that all that had a purpose, which didn't justifies the lenght of it however. In the last pages everything I was almost forced to like and accept is trown away and so fast concluded that I felt like Austen had got tired of her writting and hastily put an and to it. With all the faults it is still wanderfull and worth reading."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I finished this one many weeks back now and have struggled to find something to say about it. If you are looking for a book by Austen, I think you can skip this one unless you must read all of it. Here, Jane's characters reach their most insipid form and the author has them expending their time and energy in search of minutia. The book could have lost 1/3 of its size and the story would not have suffered.At the same time, the novel's back story might contain her best example of the worst parts in Regency gentry life. So, if you read Austen was as a critic or satirist primarily, you might find something here. Just look past the main character and her interests to find it.Her language is, as always, wonderful."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park is my fourth Jane Austen novel (Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Persuasion being the others read). For two thirds of the story, I thought to myself that Mansfield Park was going to be my favorite Jane Austen novel. It is longer than the other three novels I have read with various plot lines that kept me interested in what was going to happen next. But then it seemed to me that Jane Austen decided it was time to bring her long story to an end. I was uncomfortable with the speed with which she resolved the many problems that had kept the reader wondering how everything would turn out.Fanny Price is our main character and she is much like Cinderella. Taken at ten years old from her poor home to live with rich relatives, she is given an unheated attic bedroom and then treated as little better than a servant by her adopted family, except for her beloved cousin Edmond who realizes Fanny's true worth. Eight years later when the main action of the story begins, Fanny is now a beautiful and demure young woman who genuinely cares for her family and friends and serves them as best she can. She seems almost too good to be true, but from time to time her humanity reveals it self when she shows herself to be a harsh critic who expects others to be perfect, like herself. Her cousin Edmond is her male counterpart. The two cousins sit in judgment on the people in their little world who do not live up to their high standards.Fortunately for the reader, the rest of the characters in the novel have faults and failings. Henry and Mary Crawford are the two foils for Fanny and Edmond and both are living, breathing human beings who do not live up to the high expectations of Fanny and Edmond. Henry proposes marriage to Fanny and she rejects him utterly. His proposal itself is an affront to her because she thinks him a shallow flirt. Edmond wants to propose to Mary, but he thinks she will not accept him because he intends to become a clergyman and he she has contempt for men of the cloth. These are two major plot lines in the novel and Austen resolves them with dispatch, disposes of other loose ends, and then ends her story.Critics rate Jane Austen at the top of the list of great English novelists. She continues to be read and admired and many films have been made of her work. Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth as D'Arcy is the best of them, in my opinion, and Mansfield Park, with Frances O'Connor as Fanny Price, takes so many liberties with the original story that most Jane Austen fans will resent this retelling of the novel.Each of us has our own favorites when it comes to English novelists and I must confess that Anthony Trollope and Charles Dickens are at the top of my list. That said, I agree with the critics that Jane Austen's work continues to deserve an audience and I recommend Mansfield Park as representative of her work."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"If you're looking to read an Austen novel for the first time, this one isn't it. Mansfield Park is neither typical for Austen, nor her best work. Unlike several of her more well-known books, Mansfield Park does not feature a strong and spunky heroine. Fanny Price is compassionate, smart, and morally spotless, but she isn't the most exciting character to read about. Though many of her emotions are relatable, I sometimes found myself becoming annoyed with her total inability to stand up for herself. Her happiness is entirely dependent on the whims of others from start to finish, and she was too submissive to stand out in comparison to Pride and Prejudice's Elizabeth or Emma's Emma Woodhouse. In typical Austen style, the writing was beautiful and flawless. However the plot dragged. This is primarily because the protagonist did absolutely nothing to advance it herself, and so all of the development had to be carried by the other characters. Additionally, though the romantic opposite of Fanny is repeatedly praised as kind and level-headed, his actions show him to be easily blinded and to lack a deal of the taste that he is credited with. Austen had an excellent chance to depart from her usual plot formulation in the existence of the character Henry Crawford, but in failing to follow through made the ending entirely anti-climactic.In my opinion, the one real strength in this piece was Austen's characterization. Unlike prior novels in which she was content to attribute the actions of certain characters to pure rottenness of character (Wickham comes to mind), in Mansfield Park we see Austen exploring the motivations and justifications of all her characters, good and bad. As a result they were all more real and relatable and the distinctions between bad and good were less clearly cut, leading to a more subtle and complex read. Overall, it is definitely worth a look, particularly for long-standing Austen fans, but it wouldn't be my first recommendation. Read Pride and Prejudice or Emma first."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Three sisters got married. The first married a baronet, the second a clergyman, and the third one married a penniless soldier. Which one of the three is banished from the family? A no-brainer here. But in a misguided effort to help out Mrs. Price, Lady Bertram and Mrs. Norris agree to care for Fanny, the only daughter from seven children. Fanny Price is shy and awkward with a weak disposition. She misses her family horribly, especially her brother William. Mansfield Park, her new home, is a cold place where she is treated like nothing more than a charity case. Edmund Bertram is the only exception. He has treated Fanny with kindness since her arrival, and he reminds her a great deal of William. But as Fancy gets older, and her two female cousins begin to court, she develops other feelings for Edmund. And now that the Crawfords have come to visit, and Edmund develops a crush on Mary Crawford, it seems that Fanny will no longer be a priority in his life. She is lonelier than ever. Maybe, just maybe, the charming Henry Crawford will be able to make things better...Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors. Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion and Sense and Sensibility are on the top of my \\"to be read every couple of years\\" list. Mansfield Park, however, has never sparked my interest and attention quite the same way as the aforementioned three. I thought I'd feel differently about it now, but I still think Fanny Price is dull, Edmund is fickle, Mary the liveliest character in the book (no wonder Edmund likes her) and Henry a little too suspiciously charming. Even though the novel opens with a rather hilarious first chapter (Austen had a wonderful way with irony), the story sort of goes downhill from there, going from boring to worse. The book is not terrible, but it's not Austen's best effort either -- at least not by my measure. But don't let me stop Mansfield Park fans from loving it, or from those of you who haven't read it from trying it. Anything written by Austen is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"If all the Austen books were sisters, Mansfield Park would be the quiet, pensively courageous sibling of the six. Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion all seem to glow like ladies at a ball. (Northanger Abbey would, I guess, be the sister who plays piano and can't really sing...although she tries...)I felt this novel to have a wonderfully theatrical feel, a closet drama of sorts. The above novels are like social epics whereas Mansfield Park appears stately, stoic and unto itself, thoughtful in a way the others aren't. I still think the other novels are excellent but there is something reserved about this one in particular. I am not a dedicated Austen lover but I would chose this one over the others simply because it is the less popular and to me, the most fascinating. The social-relationship dynamics are similar to the other novels - i.e. learning that the pretty face doesn't always have a pretty soul.Let's put it this way, I'll probably read this novel again before the others. This is the sister I would like to know, to talk with and share philosophy with. The other sisters, in my opinion are great to dance with and they'll certainly entertain you. Nothing wrong in that."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I am not really a Jane Austen fan per-se but I have to admit Mansfield Park is a top ten classic read and this particular edition has pride of place on my bookshelf.Welcome to the world of Fanny Price, the impoverished niece of a English Baronet, Sir Thomas Bertram who is taken from her squalid overcrowded family home in Portsmouth and raised in abject gentility amongst her four cousins, Tom the heir to his father's estate, Edwin the spare to the heir and the two girls, the spiteful but spirited Maria and the air headed Julia.Add to this brood, their mother, the indolent Lady Bertram who can only sit on a sofa with her pugs and look pretty (how she had four children in the first place is beyond me!), her sister, the social climbing Mrs Norris who endeavors to put across a show of piety and and humility but is in fact and out and out snob who has no love for the gentle but surprisingly shrewd Fanny who fools everyone in the household and gets her man in the end.This is what I love about Mansfield Park, on one level it is a love story in which the deserving heroine gets her man in the end after much trial and tribulation and even saves the day after a fashion. On another level it is darkly clever, with sharp portrayals of human nature in alls its prickly glory. The Crawfords are a brother and sister enjoying their personal fortunes by living recklessly and fashionably.In turn another character Mr Rushworth is a buffoon who owns a manor house which turns a good income and with whom Julia marries not out of love but from avarice, her desire to \\"be someone\\" blinds her to her real passion, Mr Crawford who is happy to take what she offers him but not marry her even when they elope together, causing a terrible scandal in the family.Comic distraction comes in the form of the aforesaid Mrs Norris who is wonderfully grotesque, she fawns over Lady Bertrams children, not one of them worth their salt, even Edwin who is likable but lets be honest he is just a milksop, puts Fanny down whenever she gets the chance, and sees her as the \\"lowest and the last\\" not even family really though she is her younger sister's daughter and also the niece of the indolent and worthless Lady Bertram.All in all Mansfield Park is a very satisfying book, it has a few cliches but I would like to think that Austen has put these in her novel on purpose, deliciously witty, sparkling and full of intelligent humor, this is a book well worth its five stars and more."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"The present novel is about a young girl, Fanny Price, who comes from a poor family of ten children in Portsmouth. At the age of 10, she is adopted by a wealthy family, the Bertrams, who live at Mansfield Park. Mrs. Bertram is Fanny's aunt on her mother's side, and the aunt has had the good fortune of marrying into wealth. The novel follows Fanny's life from age 10 until she marries and the interaction between the Bertrams and another family in Mansfield Park. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read the present book \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version.After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Emma\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" are on my \\"to read list.\\"Based on the two novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.Based on what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a mature Jane Austen and many think it is her best work, and likely one of the most sophisticated from a viewpoint of style and structure."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"After recently viewing a film based on a Jane Austen novel, I was left wanting the real thing, not a lightweight, fluffy adaptation that only slightly resembled the original. I wanted something beautifully written with some meat! I have read my beloved Jane Austen's other books many, many times; P & P doesn't even have a kiss yet to me, is the most romantic book I have ever read. But I had not, I'm ashamed to say ever read MANSFIELD PARK. I saw the wonderful movie when it came out several years ago and really enjoyed it. Of course, after having read the book, there are some major differences--see the movie first so you have nothing to compare it to!The reviews that have been written preceding this one are all astounding-- written poignantly and exquisitely by my fellow Jane Austen aficionados. Some of you all could be authors yourselves. But I will try to write some of my own musings about this wonderful book.MANSFIELD PARK is not a romance although it does have my 'happily ever after' ending. It is really a biography of Miss Fanny Price, a young girl who is fortuitously taken in by her wealthy Aunt and Uncle, Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram to their large estate, Mansfield Park. The ten year-old child has left her poor, low class ineffectual parents and their large brood of children in a small, unorganized and filthy home. Fanny never felt love at home (with the exception of her beloved older brother William) and she has been transplanted to a place that is the polar opposite. Her new home is magnificent and everything is quiet and orderly. Fanny is miserable but is saved by the attentions of her adored moral, sanctimonious but very kind cousin, Edmund. Since Fanny is so painfully shy, she spends most of her day observing everyone else's behavior. And, with Edmund's influence, Fanny, although very sweet and innocent does have a tendency to be 'holier than thou!' Miss Price becomes the sole companion to her Aunt Bertram, a sweet, but shallow woman who has to ask her husband if she is hungry. Fanny's other Aunt Norris is cruel and really contributes to her low self-esteem (as we call it today).Austen always paints pictures of the most quirky and delicious characters. There is the superficial developmentally delayed Mr. Rushworth who is engaged to Fanny's cousin, Maria. I laughed out loud reading about this man trying to learn even one line for the play. There are the Crawford siblings who are not only attractive but seem to always be the life of the party with their charming personalities. I could go on and on but just know that Jane Austen does a wonderful job with her character development. Each person has such distinctive qualities that we all know people like that in real life, today, two hundred years later!I really think of Fanny as a duckling who turns into a beautiful swan. She starts her life as a shy, mousy, introverted little girl who never feels quite at home. Her face is rarely seen without a blush. She then grows into a lovely, confident young lady who develops quite a backbone. During her three months at Plymouth she realizes that her home and all the people she dearly loves are part of her beloved Mansfield ParkI agree with the other reviewers when they say that this book is a little more difficult to get into. For people just starting Austen, read her other novels first and then go to this one. Give it a few chapters and I promise that you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"As many have said, this book is not Austen's most celebrated, but the main character, Fanny Price, is one of her best. Austen is a champion of the disadvantaged female and in this story, much like Bronte's Jane Eyre, Fanny, our heroine, goes to live with another family as a child and is kept from the enjoyments of others. Not to say she is misused or treated like a servant, but is prohibited from the enjoyments of her adopted familys' life. Because of her inferior birth she is no more than a bystander, watching the enjoyments of others from a distance. But, through the course of events, each of her immediate family and a few neighboring friends, come to value her each in their own way. Though not overtly accomplished like the ladies around her she is a self-made woman. It is frustrating to be the reader at times, knowing what is in Fanny's mind, especially of her desires. If she would but speak, react, defend herself we know she would be more noticed and would have more of a chance with those she wishes would notice her. What is interesting is why she doesn't make those choices. Her personal discipline and conscience are, at times, her biggest enemies. The only reason this novel fell short for me was it's ending. As per usual with Austen's heroines, they eventually get what the want, which really can be said for any of her characters. For a character like Fanny, who we've been rooting for the entire time, who we want to succeed, who we want to have the man she's wanted all her life, and who has never been able to communicate her wants or desires to anyone, the ending felt like an empty victory. She is this sad, simple, smart, incredibly deserving woman and we can only expect that her lifetime of waiting will pay off. It does, but not as she deserves. Not to say she doesn't get exactly what she wants, but I don't feel that we get to share in her triumph."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Jane Austen is one of the best storytellers I have had the pleasure of reading. My favorite aspect of Austen's writing is her characterization; She acquaints the reader with her characters through the most ingenious and subtle techniques. My favorite denizen of Mansfield Park is the irritating and repulsive Mrs. Norris, who is a preeminent example of masterful characterization. For an illuminating artistic look at this novel read Vladimir Nabokov's wonderful and incomparable &quot;Lectures on Literature&quot;, which includes a detailed study of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;---don't miss it, it's a real treat.While I have enjoyed other books by Austen, this one is unique among them in that the plot structure is, for the most part, quite complicated; and, what singles &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; out artistically is its style, as opposed to its story. Some passages are exceptional; for example, the scene where the main characters stroll about Sotherton Court approximates the scene at the county fair in Flaubert's &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; in its complexity, orchestration, and execution. Parts of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; are simply exquisite.Unfortunately, the denouement is something like a train wreck. The last 1/3-1/4 of the book is stylistically dull, though structurally sound, and the last twenty or so pages read like Cliff Notes. The ending should have been much longer in order to resolve the various, complicated elements of the plot with the stylistic grace of the first 2/3s of the novel. The uneven execution sets &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; a step below the best of Austen's (approximate) contemporaries (Flaubert and Dickens, for example), but &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; still makes the short list of my favorite novels."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Austen's ability to switch heroines from spoiled, pampered ones like Emma Woodhouse, likeable, witty ones like Elizabeth Bennet, to such a quiet, unassuming, modest-beyond-belief one such as Fanny Price is fantastic. Most writers of present-day tend to stereotype their heroines after a certain style, but the heroines Austen has are diverse and each not without a certain charm. Fanny is certainly very different, more after the style of Anne Elliot in 'Persuasion' and a symbol of her later, more intense works.The plot itself can appear boring at first, but don't be deceived by impatient readers who think so. There's a gulf between dull and profound, and an even bigger gap between priggish and principled. Fanny is the latter, and Mansfield Park is the latter of the former comparison. The characters are vividly sketched, and each of them represents something very deep--Henry the actor is the 'improver' who would persuade Maria Bertram into climbing over the ha-ha instead of waiting for her intended Mr Rushworth; Mrs Norris the manager who assumes herself important in Mansfield and thinks everything managed by her could not be managed better by anybody else, and who makes her own bad decisions look good until the true consequences of them emerge. Even 'Pride and Prejudice''s excellently portrayed Lady de Bourgh pales beside the realistic villainy of Mrs. Norris. This story is also a personal representation of the rural quietude of England being slowly but surely industrialized, and old values and traditions were being overwhelmed; Jane Austen's Regency world was being lost at that time to changes, and this book is also a reflection of her opinions of that time and period.This book echoes the theme of the tortoise and the hare--the slow and steady win the race. The Cinderella theme is there too, with the ugly sisters' true beauty marred by a bad upbringing, and the stepmother really the way I'd always imagined her to be--presumptively taking over the inert real mother. See if you can identify who I mean in the story.What else is there to say? Fascinating."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Published first in 1814, this work is often compared unfavorably with Austen's brighter novels. The heroine, Frances (Fanny) Price, is humble, shy and retiring. The hero, Edmund Bertram, is for most of the novel unaware of the charms of the heroine, drawn instead to a very different creature, Mary Crawford. Bertram himself is upstaged for a very long time by dashing Henry Crawford, Mary's brother.Fanny Price is, at ten years old, brought from her necessitous family in Portsmouth to live at her uncle's country manor, Mansfield Park. Her childhood, while privileged, is also flawed. She is viewed as an inferior by her cousins Maria and Julia, teased by her oldest cousin Tom, and terrorized by her other aunt Mrs. Norris, who takes a sadistic delight in making Fanny miserable. She has one friend in the entire household: Edmund, second son of Sir Thomas Bertram, who by simply displaying some basic human feeling towards a frightened little girl, earns her wholehearted devotion. The infusion of the London-bred Crawfords, devilishly charming Henry and effervescent Mary, throw Fanny's world into confusion again.For me, the charm of this novel lies in its complexity. On the surface it is a story about a little community in rural England. Scratch that surface and you find a layer about morality, in which Fanny reigns supreme. She is retiring, but she is observant, and her constant observations and deductions lead her right in every circumstance. Further beneath that is a study of the sexes. Henry Crawford plays a dangerous game that ends ultimately in the ruin of a woman, for which she is held wholly accountable. The helplessness of women during that era is pretty well portrayed.Delving even deeper you discover that Mansfield Park takes on the appearance of paradise. Sir Thomas may be its proprietor, but its real guardian and caretaker is Fanny herself, who opposes any change that is not beneficial to the estate. Outsiders are not welcome until they have proven their worth, though they are often given more chances than they deserve. Worldly wisdom and town polish have no place at Mansfield, and eventually are eradicated.I have read this novel five times, and each time I have discovered something new. If you like reading books with some depth and complexity, this one is for you."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This is the story of a young girl, who goes to live with her richer cousins. They don't treat her very well, but she prevails. This is a short summary of a rich plot, which Jane Austen conjures up out of her characters, and the social rules of the world that they live in. What is amazing is that there is little in the way of plot tricks - everything arises organically from the characters. Most of the books you read these days rely on all kinds of devices, from war to interplanetary invasion, and Jane Austen shows that you don't need these to create a compelling story.I was interested by the character of Fanny Price - yes, she is stubborn, but only to be true to herself, even though everyone thinks that she is denying herself happiness. She chooses not to be a hypocrite, and actually play by the rules that everyone else lectures her about. She is in wonderful contrast to Mrs Norris, a classic Austen villainness, who does nothing bad, but just is a nasty selfish hypocrite.I loved the way that there are changes in the way that the characters think about each other, and about the world. In other words, the people in this book are really alive, and you don't think of them as representations at all.True, Miss Bennett in Pride and Prejudice is a more attractive character, but I think that the way that the characters are made to work for the plot in this book makes Mansfield Park a better book. Perhaps one wouldn't want to live there, but this is a book that can be read and re-read, and there is always something new. The balance of this book is perfect."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park is a complex book with situations that cause one to sit back and think about what has been presented to her/him. I found the first half to be a bit slow and was wondering where the charatcter development and plot line would all lead. However, I was rewarded as I read the second half and saw how the character development and siutations of the first half led to each character's fate. This book is definitely not for everyone, since it is darker, more serious (and subversive) compared to Austen's other works. especially if you are uncomfortable with subversive situations."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I'm surprised that so many people found this book boring or hard to get through---I enjoyed it immensely and couldn't put it down! Fanny might disappoint if you're hoping for a vivacious, witty heroine like Elizabeth Bennet, but she and her story are interesting in their own right and the book is full of realistic people and situations that held my attention completely. To be fair, though, I can see how a person who found the plot horribly boring would begin to resent Fanny. As to it being &quot;darker&quot; than Austen's other work, my feeling is that although MP deals with serious issues (adultery, religion, etc.) it's still done by way of the entertaining social gatherings, gossip exchanges, and family snafus that happen in her other books, so the tone didn't strike me as different from her others. By the way, if you're interested in this book I'd recommend reading it soon, before the upcoming movie version comes out!"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"The Norton Critical Edition of Mansfield Park is a gem as and edition. Claudia L. Johnson's footnotes are extremely informative and (and are actually footnotes on the same page, praise be) and her selections in the critical apparatus are very solid. Read this edition of Austen's most challenging work before any other--but read Pride and Prejudice before you read Mansfield! This one is too dark and subdued for many Austen fans."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I must admit that the first half of this book is somewhat slow and at times quite difficult to hold attention to. I understand that the setting, personalities, and situations must be established in the first half. Even so, the story is a gem well worth reading. It has quite a different feel from the other Jane Austen books and the characters stick to your mind as people you will never forget. A few characters are quite tragic yet do not deserve sympathy, which provides an interest in the reader's mind. Fanny Price, the main character of the book, is an admirable and intelligent person whom I would not mind modeling myself after. This is a GREAT book, so don't miss your chance to read it."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Wrapping up a littl too neatly and quickly at the end after dragging a bit in the middle, this novel is lovely Austin, preaching duty and honor as the path to love and contentment."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park was a novel written by Jane Austen in 1814. Although it was not as popular as Pride and Prejudice, it is still regarded as the profoundest novel Austen had written.The setting of the novel was in the nineteenth century world of the gentry, as revealed through the eyes of Fanny Price. As she was a \\"poor relation\\" of the wealthy Bertram family, Fanny was invited to live with them in their family estate, Mansfield Park. Through Fanny's insight, the admirable but corrupted world of the upper class was seen. At first, Fanny was seen as an inferior person to everyone except Edmund, a cousin whom she befriended. Later, the Bertrams realized that Fanny \\"was useful\\" (p. 331) She held a secret affection for Edmund, and it remained unrequited until the end of the novel. Through narratives and detailed scenes, the novel was able to evolve into a beautiful Victorian \\"Cinderella\\" tale. In general, Mansfield Park was well-developed, and contained numerous descriptive passages. However, there were some minor demerits to the style and presentation of the novel.The chief fault found within the novel was the way the characters were portrayed. They were two-dimensional in that the characters seemed to be categorized into specific stereotypes. For example, the character of Henry Crawford was portrayed as a promiscuous young man who had no thoughts for others; Mrs Norris, an aunt of Fanny's, was seen as an unbearably condescending woman who belittled Fanny and trampled on her dignity. On the other end of the spectrum, Fanny became the heroine of the novel with her virtuous ways: \\"she had never played [card] game[s] nor seen it played in her life\\" (p.171) Although Jane Austen tried to alter their images near the end of the novel, it became increasingly hard to picture the characters as real human beings. Another flaw was that: compared to the entire novel, the denouement was too abrupt. This can be seen in the altered personality of Edmund Bertram. Throughout the novel, he remained faithful to his \\"infatuation\\" with Mary Crawford. He overlooked her imperfections, but that seemed reasonable, as he appeared to be quite fond of her. Yet, in the last few paragraphs of Mansfield Park, he changed his mind and decided that it was actually Fanny who had gained his affection: \\"Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford, and became as anxious to marry Fanny, a Fanny herself could desire.\\" (p. 338) Edmund was never seen as one who has a fickle mind. Therefore, this sudden change of heart in him might befuddle the reader. Another unsuspecting transformation was Tom Bertram, heir of Mansfield Park. He was depicted as a \\"careless and extravagant\\" young man, and was a \\"source of much uneasiness to his father, Sir Thomas\\" (p.17). Yet, he was converted in the end: he did not regain \\"the thoughtlessness and selfishness of his previous habits\\". (p. 332) Instead of the abrupt finale of the novel, the ending should have been much longer in order to resolve the various complicated elements of the plot, with the use of the stylistic grace of the first two-thirds of the novel. This uneven execution set back the novel, when it had the potential to be a nineteenth century classic.As opposed to the demerits, many worthy aspects could be seen in the novel. A variety of narrative styles could be found, such as the use of the author's and protagonist's point of views. In addition, the use of letters as a means to reveal the plot played an important role in Mansfield Park: the climax of the novel was revealed through letters. Another note-worthy facet was that the theme of morality permeated through the entire novel. Because this long novel had a copious amount of events occurring, a common theme would be able to weave the story together. Jane Austen was thus successful in creating a unified novel using the theme. As well, the plot was extremely interesting, and it was able to engage the reader's attention.A significant aspect of the novel was the topic of religion. The Anglican church and its ministries were discussed several times in the course of the novel: Edmund Bertram was ordained in spite of Ms. Crawford's insistence that a career as a clergyman was uninteresting and unworthy of Edmund. Ordination was stressed, probably because of the fact that Austen had a large number of relations and friends in Holy Orders: her father and two of her brothers were clergymen, and her sister was engaged to a clergyman. Another reason why the topic was emphasized was that Jane Austen wanted to use it as a spiritual dimension to the novel. She also used it to add a sense of moral righteousness to the main characters (Fanny and Edmund).Mansfield Park was intended to be a didactic novel, with its characters representing virtue and impiety. However, the storyline was compelling enough for the reader to overlook the heavy tone of the book. Thus, Jane Austen was able to create a light atmosphere in the novel, allowing modern readers to appreciate her arguably \\"best work\\" by far."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I've read \\"Mansfield Park\\" three times so far in a desperate attempt to like it as much as Jane Austen's other books (I even love Northanger Abbey, which NO ONE likes anymore), but it seems to get a little worse each time. While it's still worth sitting down and enjoying once, it's a lot more dependant on the tastes and principles of Austen's period than any of her other works, and it seems like on re-reading the good points don't get much stronger while its flaws glare out more and more.There is much to enjoy in Mansfield Park. Austen's stock characters (the dominating but foolish old woman, the wise but emotionally absent father, the charming young man who does not quite deserve the main character in spite of his attractions), appear in sharper relief than any of her other novels. Mrs. Norris is too horrible for me personally to laugh at most of the time, but her blindness to her own hypocrosy and the sheer absurdity of her judgement will be appreciated by most other Austen fans. The Crawfords are two of her most intricately created and fascinating characters, and truly steal any scene either of them is included in. This novel has been called her \\"most autobiographical\\" work, and though I don't see any similarities between the personality revealed in her letters and that of her main character, Fanny's position as the poor dependant on a rich family is much closer to Austen's own than any of her other heroines, and the amount of sympathy for this Cinderella-type heroine will be appreciated even by readers who are not very interested in Jane Austen herself.But I can't help but feeling that while her other novels have a transcendant universality (Pride and Prejudice will always work no matter how much our culture changes), Mansfield Park is very wedded to one time and place. To a modern reader, the main character, Fanny Price, is almost unlikable for at least the first half of the book. You pity her, definitely, but she's so timid and such a wet blanket that it's hard to feel any real identification. She is the wisest and kindest character in the book, but spends most of the early chapters in a state of guilt-ridden terror from her assumed inferiority and her inability to live with the fact that she cannot love an aunt who has been nothing but nasty to her her entire life. In the latter half of the novel, she gets better as she grows enough of a backbone to at least trust her own judgement, but she's still really an example of a dead feminine ideal that a modern woman just can't admire. While we still value common sense, moral fiber, and a generous and forgiving heart, conviction of one's own inferiority is not really a desirable trait.This is the most consistant flaw of the book, but there are others almost equally troubling. Without revealing whom she ends up with, Fanny's early revealed crush on her cousin Edmund, whom she meets when he is sixteen and she is nine, gets more disturbing by the year. Not only is love between first cousins considered incestuous now (at least in the US), but the way he considers her his adopted sister, and actually calls her his favorite sister, adds a whole new level of creepiness for anyone raised in a culture in which adoptive family ties are looked at in the same way as blood ties. Then the often-cited fact that he \\"shaped her mind\\" by being the only member of the family who seriously talked to her and recommended all her reading material makes it still worse for me, because there's something about Pygmalion-type relationships that really freaks me out. Anyone who joins me in this is sure to be disturbed.The sole remaining flaw is that three readings in, I can't make any sense of what it's supposed to mean that Sir Thomas makes his living as a slave trader. Though we're suspicious early on because of his frequent business trips to Antigua, when it finally is confirmed that this is what he does, none of the characters attatches any moral stigma to it, not even Fanny. Nor does the narrator weigh in on his profession during any of the frequent asides that judge the members of this family more harshly than her protagonist. It made even less sense when I learned that Jane Austen herself was a confirmed abolitionist in real life. Can it really be that its only purpose is to draw a comparison with Fanny's situation? Maybe even an abolitionist of that time could be ill-informed enough about what the slave trade actually entailed to use it as a metaphor without much thought, but no one picking it up today has the luxury of that kind of ignorance.In conclusion, it's a must read for anyone scholarly interested in Jane Austen, and still enjoyable enough to be worth reading for any casual fan of her other books. But save your money and use your library card. It's not something you're going to want to read again."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This was a very intertaining book. I love reading it.

While of course P&P; is one of the great works of literature and certainly deserves its place in the Western canon, I am inclined to think that Mansfield Park, which in my mind is rivalled only by Persuasion, is just as deserving of that title.There are quite a few people that seem to think that Fanny and Edmund are much too dull to make a good hero and heroine, but I would beg to differ. Fanny is to me a very real character and not as woodenly perfect as she is sometimes made out to be- she can become angry, jealous and even occasionally depressed and the fact that she does not have the freedom to vent these negative emotions doesn't mean that she doesn't have the capacity or wish to. I have also heard it said that she doesn't have the courage to stand up for herself, but I would point out that she did so at the time that it was really important, even though it would have been much easier to go along with what her relations felt was best instead.Edmund also should be given the credit that he deserves- it is true that he spends much of the novel under the delusion of his love interest being what she really never was, but when he finally understands it, his anger at himself for not recognising it sooner and his strong desire to make amends for it was enough to make me immediately forgive him for his past mistakes.Many of the other characters also deserve some notice as well- Fanny's brother William is one of my very favorites in any Austen novel, and her horrible aunt Mrs. Norris is arguably one of her cruelest villains. Really, I can't think of any weak links- every character is deliniated in a strinking and lifelike way, and none seem to be one-dimensional, even when they are minor and not integral to the main story.In closing, I would point out that while a reader in the mood for something \\"light, bright and sparkling\\" might not really appreciate Mansfield Park as much, anyone in need of a good, solid and fascinating novel should not pass it up."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I'm 14 and I've recently read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" after seeing most of the movies (or TV shows, specifically for Pride and Prejudice).

The first thing I had read was \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" but it was slower, it was still good, but \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the best. After reading those I bought \\"Mansfield Park\\" and \\"Persuasion\\". I have recently finished \\"Mansfield Park\\" and I thought it was very good, but it wasn't her best.

Since I saw the movie first I kept wondering \\"when will Henry Crawford start to like Fanny?\\" and during about half the book, he wasn't even interested in her.

At this time in society, wealth, or the appearance of wealth, controlled people's lives. If you were not of high social background, you tried to appear that you were. This is the case of the main female character, Fanny. After being sent by her mother to live with her wealthy uncle, Fanny learns the ways of sophisticated, well-learned people.

This one took me a MONTH! I found the beginning to be extremely slow, but the book did pick up in the end. I can't really decide whether or not I liked Fanny, but she did need a little self-confidence. Edmund seemed a little too good to be true, and Aunt Norris was a total witch. I had a hard time believing the character relationships in this book as they seemed impossible because the people were HORRIBLE to eachother. Also, Uncle Bertram seemed to have a complete reformation that was a little unbelievable. I dragged through this book until it picked up at the end. I was sad to see it end, and I think Austen could have devoted more than 2 pages to Fanny and Edmund's romance at the end because it took so long to happen, though who am I to be a critic, I could never write anything close to Jane Austen!

This book was not up to the standard I expected of the author.On the plus side, the characters are engaging. Austen does a good job of helping the reader understand who everyone is and has a clear grasp of their motivations. I found it interesting that I liked all the main characters. I really empathized with Fanny's unrequited love for Edmund, and I understood why she was so passive, even though I often didn't like her passivity. The chapters were short and the book was easy to read.The big problem was the book was far too long. Some sections could have clearly been shortened. The play was a necessary part of the plot, but it shouldn't have taken so long. I did find myself getting bored and frustrated at times. As I have found to be common with classical literature, the last half of the book was better the first. There were some characters who were underdeveloped to the point that I wish they hadn't been there - specifically Tom. Also found the section of Fanny's return to her family in Portsmouth a bit long. I found that I got confused at times; I needed to go back and read the introduction. The introduction, in my version, was only 2 pages, which was far too short.In summary, this is a good book for anyone who enjoys the classis.

It tells of Fanny Price, who at the age of 10 was sent to live with her uncle, Sir Bertram (her family is very poor.) She found friendship only in Edmund, Sir Bertram's second son. Maria and Julia, her two cousins, have always meant well but been condescending, and the eldest son didn't have much to do with her. When Fanny is eighteen, the Crawfords, Henry and his sister Mary arrive. Henry is the epitome of a fickle young suitor, while Miss Crawford is trying to catch Edmund. Fanny, who is secretly loves Edmund, is forced to watch all of this.Mansfield Park is full of interesting character studies, and all of the characters are well-drawn. Unlike many people, I didn't hate Frank Churchill from Emma, and I didn't hate Henry Crawford either. He's just...well, fickle. Edmund was rather dull, but he is extremely kind.This definitely wasn't one of my favorite Jane Austen's. Pride and Prejudice and Emma I liked a lot more, though it was better than Persuasion and Northanger Abbey. I just have Sense and Sensibility (and Lady Susan) to go!The relationships between the characters were really interesting; I felt for Fanny a lot, when she is ignored by her cousins and excluded from outings. And at the beginning, when at the age of 10, she has to leave behind everyone she loves at home. Mansfield Park is less witty than Pride and Prejudice and Emma, but I did like it.My blog is located at novareviews.blogspot.com.

Fanny Price has barely enough integrity to keep her attraction to cousin Edmund under wraps; Edmund, meanwhile, is so utterly transformed by his desire for Miss Crawford that he pretty much pimps Fanny out to Miss Crawford's licentious brother.Austen's bleakest work, Mansfield Park is a meditation on both the demonic power of sexual desire, and the fragility of any morality that simultaneously celebrates physical beauty AND tries to regulate the bewitching effects that beauty has upon all of us.And if you're paying attention, you won't be fooled by the all's-right-with-the-world, David Lynch-like ending, either.

It was a book that you look forward to getting back to all day."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Jane Austen's writing, in my opinion, allowed woman to speak their mind. Her writing of society and balls being drab and the heroine wanting to break away from what a woman should be is feminism. The heroine enjoyed taking longer walks than they \\"should.\\" They didn't succumb to petty giggling and gossips.Fanny Price is all this and more in \\"Mansfield Park.\\" She isn't afraid to talk about politics and slavery. Something woman at this time didn't discuss with men. But Fanny does.Fanny's family is of middle class with a large family. Too large a family (9 children - Fanny is 2nd eldest) that the parents had to send Fanny away at age 10 to relatives for her reception into a society lifestyle. The 8 years that Fanny lives with the Bertrams, she shows to be more responsible and intelligent.The Bertrams are very wealthy because of a slavery business they own. Tom and Edward Bertram are complete opposites. Tom is a free spirit with some drinking and gambling problems. Edward wants to become a clergyman. Their sister, Maria, is a romantic. She marries Mr. Rushworth for his money but is still hopelessly involved with the rake Henry Crawford. No surprise that the youngest sister, Julia, is jealous of Maria. But she learns from Maria and uses the sister's mistakes to her own advantages (marries a man her father doesn't approve of).The Bertram children (except for Edward) are all spoiled and selfish. The father, Sir Thomas, is rightfully ashamed of their actions. The eldest son, Tom, however is the only one who changes his life for the better. The two daughters still remain selfish and spoiled (Mrs. Norris, the aunt, encourages this behavior).This is a well written Austen book. I would very much recommend."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"The beauty of reading the classics again in life is a joy and a gift of wisdom/Lee Lee Applin"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I have been revisiting many of the classics on my Kindle recently, but \\"Mansfield Park\\" was not one of Austin's that was familiar to me.

Ironically, as I was reading it, a movie version appeared on TV and I questioned whether or not to watch it since I had not as yet finished the book.

While the story takes place during the same era of her other novels, this novel was not as exciting. It was an effort to read through to the end. I found it a rather laborious read, in that, friendship between Fanny and Bertram was the only emotion with no undertones that give Jane's other novels more depth and romance. The other characters were colorful and/or eccentric, however,the story was rather dull. The ending is also underwhelming. I just didn't find it as engaging as Pride and Prejudice and Emma."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I'm quite amazed at the absolute loathing Fanny Price awakens in so many readers - why do people despise the one truly virtuous character, describe her as weak, insipid, boring and all the rest, whereas Maria and Julia, snooty, self-absorbed, conceited ... who consistently treat Fanny as a doormat, are deemed interesting? As well as Mary Crawford, who may be nice to her, but in an unbearably condescending way? Why is virtue so suspicious to modern readers? Why do we prefer sparkling froth (Mary Crawford) to quiet depth (Fanny)? Fanny is not living in 21st century America and has a right to her values - she is a child of her time. She also has her reasons for being the way she is - quiet, shy, humble, sincere. Why do readers hate these qualities, why is there no empathy for Fanny after the way she has been treated? As for Fanny being weak - are these people crazy? Is it weak to resist the enormous pressure that Fanny was up against to marry Henry Crawford? To escape her position of dependency to become a highly respected woman of stature? What a wonderful revenge it would have been to all those who looked down at her previously: Maria, Julia, Mrs Norris! What freedom, at last! And yet Fanny resists: her love for Edmund is stronger. Is this weakness? She does not fall prey to Henry's Casanova charms, as so many society belles have done. Is this weakness? She sees through his character, recognises him for what he is - a frivolous womanizer. (How many modern-day so-called emancipated woman have fallen for such types! ) She has the strength to stand to her own opinions, and upholds her moral strength in spite of her lowly position. I call that admirable! That is genuine self-esteem, not the shallow self-infatuation readers seem to demand in a heroine.. She is not swayed by Henry's professions of eternal love - for someone who has never known a man's - or anybody's - love, who has no hopes of ever winning the man she loves - this is extraordinary. A lesser woman would have been so hungry for love she'd have melted at such devotion! But Fanny knows what she wants, and finally her quiet strength shines through and wins. This novel is a masterpiece, Fanny is wise, strong, deep, Austen's strongest and most interesting heroine by far."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"As a fairly big Jane Austen fan I came into this masterful novel (after the first fifty pages) expecting a great love story put off by the lowly financial means of the protagonist. However, the central figure, Fanny, has many qualities that make her an ulikely figure for the role of seductress. She is quiet, shy, and completely unsure of herself. She indeed has very few qualities that make the reader expectant that she will be able to marry above her means. Instead of an enthralling love story I found the novel full of subtle but interesting social commentary and excellent characterization of the protagonist. While not quite a Pride and Prejudice style page turner, Mansfield Park is worthwhile for its character development and carefully crafted, mature writing."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"In this somewhat atypical Jane Austen novel, Austen abandons her precise characterization and carefully constructed plots, usually designed to illustrate specific ethical and social dilemmas, and presents a much broader, more complex picture of early nineteenth century life. Though the polite behavior of the middle and upper classes is always a focus of Austen, and this novel is no exception, she is more analytical of society as a whole here, casting a critical eye on moral issues which allow the upper class to perpetuate itself. Fanny Price, the main character, is the daughter of a genteel woman who married for love but soon found herself in poverty. When Fanny's aunt and uncle, the wealthy owners of Mansfield Park, invite Fanny alone, of all the children, to live with them, Fanny enters a new world, where she is educated, clothed, and housed, but always regarded as an \\"outsider.\\"Through Fanny's two cousins, Maria and Julia, Austen shows the complex interactions of the upper class as they negotiate marriages, try to maintain the family's reputation and wealth, and react to those \\"beneath\\" them socially. Fanny, having experienced both poverty and plenty, comments on what she sees, and though she lacks the witty charm of some of Austen's other characters (such as Elizabeth Bennett), she shows an intelligence and conscience lacking among her cousins. Only Edmund, the youngest of the Bertram sons, pays genuine attention to her, and her love for him is real, though secret.This is a darker novel than Austen's others, showing conflicts between late eighteenth century rationalism and the growing romanticism of the nineteenth century. Sir Thomas maintains his wealth through his possible participation in the slave trade, a business which created fortunes for a number of his contemporaries. Often unfeeling toward his own family, Sir Thomas also shows cruelty toward Fanny when she rejects a marriage he has negotiated for her to a man she does not love. Cousin Maria chooses to marry Rushworth for his fortune, but she succumbs to her passion for someone else, and introduces a romantic, new sexuality into the novel. Unfortunately, Fanny, though sweet and reasonable, is also quiet and predictable, while Edmund, the only other potentially empathetic character, is nave and often appears to be weak. Austen's light touch and quiet humor, which make her other novels vibrate with life and come to a satisfying ending, are less obvious here, and the abrupt conclusion leaves many questions unanswered. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"It's been more than a year since I originally reviewed this book, and since then it's been fun to read the war of words between Fanny-defenders and Fanny-bashers; one reviewer says she can't understand this &quot;hate&quot; of Fanny, while another is amazed at the &quot;loathing&quot; Fanny engenders in some readers, and a third admonishes that appreciating Fanny's saintliness takes time and harrumphs, &quot;Fanny upholds what is right, how not to love her?&quot; I have read and reread &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; (it's one of my all-time favorites) and my response regarding Fanny is, &quot;what's to love?&quot;The reviewer who described Fanny as an &quot;odious little priss&quot; hit the nail slam-bang on the head; Fanny is an impossible killjoy. She is a case of conscience run amok, without any of the tempering graces of understanding or acceptance. Whatever emotions Fanny engenders, hatred or loathing doesn't come into it; there is not enough in Fanny's character to loathe. What she engenders in this reader is more like a profound sense of irritation; one wants to grab her by the shoulders, give her a good shake and tell her to lighten up. Jane Austen's other heroines know how to leaven virtue with common sense and a dash of humor, none more so than Elizabeth Bennet in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;; Fanny acts like she never cracked a joke in her life and wouldn't understand a joke if she heard one, let alone appreciate it. She is thus a perfect match for her cousin Edmund, who is the most puzzling character in this excellent book.I have never yet come across a sympathetic character in a novel who becomes so thoroughly unsympathetic as Edmund Bertram. He certainly starts out as likeable enough, as Fanny's champion and protector from her obnoxious aunt Norris. We can understand and sympathize when he falls in love with Mary Crawford, whose worldly upbringing makes her despise his vocation as a minister. But Mary is torn between her materialistic ambitions and her genuine affection for Edmund. She really loves him and appreciates his good qualities, as he is able to love her for hers; he realizes she is shallow and superficial, but she is also loving, kind, generous, open-hearted, and doesn't have a mean bone in her body. She is &quot;the only woman he could ever want or accept for a wife.&quot;So what happens to blow this whole scenario to bits? In Edmund's eyes, Mary is insufficiently outraged by the adulterous relationship between her brother and Edmund's married sister. Edmund is in anguish when Mary says she is disgusted by their stupidity in carrying on the affair. For him, this proves she is totally without virtue. But is she really? Mary may have been as outraged as Edmund was; but where Edmund can only think of retribution, Mary is more concerned with damage control. Where Edmund insists on divine and temporal punishment and damnation, Mary prefers to try to make the best of a bad situation. For Edmund, Mary's common sense translates into vice. From a paragon of virtue, she suddenly becomes a monster of licentiousness. Edmund drops poor Mary like a hot potato. He may thus endear himself further to Fanny Price, but he certainly doesn't endear himself to this reader. Edmund comes across as a sanctimonious prig, more interested in judging people than in trying to understand and forgive.So let the debate continue. I'm looking forward to reading more opinions pro and con about Fanny Price &amp; Co.; the fundamental fact remains that, whatever you may think of Fanny and the other characters, Jane Austen is one of the greatest writers of all time in any language, and Mansfield Park is her greatest book."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I don't know what book the other reviewer read, but it couldn't have been &quot;Mansfield Park.&quot; &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; is a political satire according to some, and I think there's reason to believe this assessment. According to Jane Austen, &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; is about ordination (some dispute here, but she wrote it in a letter). Ordination comes from the word &quot;order&quot; and given the events in Europe at the time order was a major issue.Jane Austen's father had 'interests' in the West Indies from which he derived income, and he was very pleased the British Government (Tories) defended these colonies and kept them from joining in the American Revolotion. Jane Austen had two naval brothers who served as part of the effort to keep the English interests en tact. In &quot;Persuasion&quot; a discussion at dinner one evening centers around the West Indies--and the talk is not about slavery. Like it or not, Jane Austen's conscience about slavery did become manifest until she wrote &quot;Emma&quot; and even then she barely touched on the subject. Jane Austen's main concerns involved the lives of women and their place in society. And we have no right to judge her from our perspective 200 years later.Jane Austen was a Tory at the time she wrote &quot;Mansfield Park.&quot; The Tories were a conservative party that backed the English king and he had no interest in seeing English colonies in the West Indies--from which he derived income--disappear. The Tories were landed gentry (country aristocrats) and did not want their old agrarian way of life abolished. It was under threat from the Industrial Revolution, and other social change. The Tory opposition party was Whig. Whigs supported the American and French Revolutions, and wanted change (the Abolutionists were mostly Whig).Jane Austen's &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; symbolizes the old agrarian landed gentry way of life. Portsmouth (where Fanny's mother lives) represents the chaos of the masses. London (home of the Crawfords) is an interesting but dangerous way of life.Fanny is a very moral girl. My only complaint of Fanny is that I wanted her to stand up for herself--which she does. She always did, she just didn't do it the way we women who have been emancipated would. Critics from Lionel Trilling to Tony Tanner have defended Fanny's right to be Fanny--i.e. a moral and good girl of her times. We who are caught up in the modern world may not appreciate Fanny, but there she is--and who dares judge her?Fanny holds the course (like the Tories). She is the voice of morality who objects to the London stage play the other youngsters at Mansfield Park stage in the absence of Mr. Bertram (the lord of the manor and the upholder of virtue). Fanny will not be coerced into violating her principles. She will not marry Mr. Crawford because she can see he is immoral. She chides Edmund to stay on the straight and narrow. She facilitates Edmund's remaining on the path to ordination. Say what you will, Fanny gets her man, and she gets him the way she wants him. Was Janie spoofing us all along? Was Fanny right?"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I adore audio books and always have one playing away in my car during my commute to work; -- so when I went hunting to purchase a new unabridged audio edition on CD of Jane Austen's novel Mansfield Park, I was quite surprised to learn that my choices were very few at exactly two; a Blackstone AudioBooks, Inc (2008) read by Johanna Ward and a Naxos AudioBooks (2007) read by Juliet Stevenson. My first choice was of course the Juliet Stevenson version, for what Janeite could ever forget her outrageous performance as Mrs. Elton in the 1996 movie adaptation of Emma? My abject apologies to Johanna Ward, who I am sure must be a very fine reader since she has several audio books to her credit, but the thought of listening to Mansfield Park read by Mrs. Elton just intrigued me and gave me the giggles. If anyone could liven up Mansfield Park, reputed to be Jane Austen's most complex and dark novel, she could!Being a reader for an audio book is not an easy task since so many different \`performances' are required to distinguish each of the characters for the listener. I have found through a course of trial and error that I enjoy audio books read by classically trained actors. Juliet Stevenson fills this qualification perfectly for me using every inch of her Royal Shakespearean Company training. Her understanding of Jane Austen's use of language and her true British accent added greatly to my enjoyment of this fine production.Naxos AudioBooks has made quite a solid commitment to present quality productions of all of Jane Austen's six major novels in unabridged and abridged formats. You can read about all of their recordings on their excellent web site and listen to a PodCast of an interview of Juliet Stevenson as she discusses her involvement in the audio recordings and her affinity to Jane Austen. Of note is the free download for this month of Milton's L'Allegro read by Samantha Bond (Maria Bertram in Mansfield Park 1983 and Mrs. Weston in Emma 1996)It has been said that Jane Austen often read her writings to her family as entertainments. Her beautiful use of language which just flows effortlessly is completely suited for the spoken word. When you add to perfection an accomplished actress with a keen sensitivity to Jane Austen's particular style, the results truly are remarkable."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"As soon as I finished reading Mansfield Park, I quickly had to see the movie, hoping that it would be as great as other Jane Austen movie adaptations. I was wrong! None of it compares to this wonderful book.I agree that Fanny Price is not as dynamic or bubbly or as engaging as other Austen heroines, but I do not think her weak or uninteresting. Why should all Austen heroines be the same? She has a quiet inner strenth and sensibility that plays off well to her vain aquaintances. All of her years at Mansfield Park only one person, Edmund, valued her for her true personality and qualities. Day after day she was made to feel inferior, unworthy and ungrateful by her relations, yet she was none of these things. I loved when other characters started to appreciate Fanny's good qualities and give her the praise she was due.The other character developments in this novel are wonderful, and I especially like the parts where Henry Crawford is changing and professing his love to Fanny. Although he is vain and has his faults, I agree with Edmund that it improves Crawford's character by the mere fact that he fell in love with Fanny of all people. I partly wished that Crawford would fall more into Fanny's good opinion and I regret his ruin in the end.If you are a fan of this book, do not watch the movie adaptation! Of course there is not enough time for all the great details in the book and it is terrible and completely distorts the story of Mansfield Park . Fanny is a completely different person in the movie, and it has made me appreciate the real Fanny in the novel even more. Don't bother with it because if you are a fan of the book the movie will make you angry with the liberties it took."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I enjoyed this book because I love Jane Austen's style and eloquence.

The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands. Besides the main text of Austen's novel itself, it has added features - a brief chronology of the world of Jane Austen & Mansfield Park, an introduction, the main text, as well as useful endnotes, a list of adaptations of the novel [in both film and book format],comments, as well as a list of resources for further reading [biographies and letters of Austen] and criticisms.

I could usually feel for the main character, Fanny Price, and relate to her. By loving her cousin Edmund so completely, she suffered greatly when Mary Crawford drew his attention and admiration. I would have been rather angry if I were Fanny been left sitting alone for a whole hour while they walked through the woods. Mr. Crawford's love of Fanny rather surprised me, because he didn't deserve her after flirting so mercilessly with her cousins. I was a glad that there was a happy ending. I believe the most satisfying reads (like those by Jane Austen) always have happy endings."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"The protagonist of Mansfield Park, Fanny Price, was one very near and dear Jane Austen's heart, but did not win a great deal of favor with the reading public. Fanny seemingly emulates the standards of moral feminine behavior for the time period, and unlike other Austen heroines, is not obviously spunky. However, her spunk is evident in her intelligence and unwillingness to sacrifice her principles in any circumstance, even circumstances that would elevate her into high society. I can see why Mansfield Park was Austen's favorite novel. There is an illusion of decorum on the surface, like all her work, but the undercurrent in this particular work is much darker than her other novels. The West Indian slave trade, sexual jealousy, infidelity, and the question of human worth all pervade the novel and instill the reader with the sense of discomfort that Fanny feels throughout. My only critique is the ending, a rather cursory tying up of the intricate story that does not match the complexity of the novel's body. A first rate novel, though, for those who want to take the time to unravel Austen's meaning and give Fanny Price a deeper look."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park is the work of a mature Austen. Compared to her earlier book, Pride and Prejudice, it features a particularly complex plot structure (complex for Austen, anyway) that works especially well in the first volume, and somewhat less well in the second. The book also features Austen's characteristic nicety of interior character description, her really superior ability to follow the subtle nuances of thought and feeling. This ability is raised to a whole new level, however, in Mansfield Park since the heroine, Fanny Price, is a particularly sensitive, selfless, and considerate girl. Austen is up to the challenge, though, and develops stylistic techniques uniquely and perfectly suited to evoking all of Fanny's moral and emotional struggles. It is simply a joy to follow Fanny through all her travails.The weakness of the book is the structure of the third and last volume. Here, Austen falls back a little to much on the technique of letter writing to move her story forward. This weakness IS offset somewhat by the wonderful scenes in Fanny's hometown of Portsmouth - scenes that evoke one of Dickens' favorite themes, the impoverished family - but overall, the structure here is not up to the standards of the first two volumes.Another weakness, though this is more a comment on Austen's style than on this book in particular, is the paucity of vivid imagery, of truly original metaphors or similes. Compared to Dickens or Flaubert, two of her near contemporaries, Austen is decidedly inferior on this score. Her strength really lies in her ability to describe the subtleties of the emotional and intellectual lives of her characters with a fidelity and clarity that I think is superior to Dickens and the equal of Flaubert.Finally, a comment on Fanny's 'likeability'. While I don't want to deny that a character's likeability can influence our enjoyment of a book, I also think that it should not be a consideration in our judgement of the book's merit as a work of art. Madame Bovary, the book by Flaubert, is populated by unlikeable people and there isn't any one we can 'identify' with (or so we hope), yet that book is certainly a great work of art. In the same way, our gut reaction to Fanny may not be favorable, but this should have nothing to do with our assessment of Fanny as a character or the book as a work of art. The only consideration should be, 'did Austen succeed in creating the kind of character she set out to create?'; NOT, 'did I like Fanny Price as a person?', or, 'would I like to have Fanny Price as a friend?'.Anyway, a good book, flawed only by the somewhat weak final volume. Certainly one of Austen's best."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Ask twenty booklovers which is their favorite work by Jane Austen, and eighteen will probably say \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". I love \\"P&P;\\" myself; I've read it umpteen zillion times and can quote whole paragraphs by heart; but as charming as it is, it's not Austen's best book. That honor belongs to \\"Mansfield Park\\", a much deeper, more thoughtful work, written at least a decade later, at a time when rural England was beginning to feel the first effects of the Industrial Revolution; and Austen, classicist as she was, stood firm in the trenches holding onto the timeless values of stability, morality and old-fashioned uprightness. These values are thoroughly realized in Fanny Price, and perhaps it attests to Austen's genius that the \\"heroine\\" of such a great work is such a totally exasperating individual.Fanny is a royal pain in the butt. She is so irritating at times that the reader wants to slap her upside the head. She's a loathsome little moralizing, sanctimonious goody-goody, sitting timidly in her corner passing judgments on everybody according to her own stringent, narrow-minded standards, secretly pining for her handsome cousin Edmund who, of course, is after a young woman Fanny deems unworthy of him. She is totally humorless, an impossible killjoy, and seems to think she is the final arbitor on every moral question. In fact, once you take away all the judging and moralizing, there doesn't seem to be much to Fanny at all.Austen has created some interesting characters in this book, and three of them present a problem. The first, of course, is Fanny herself. Then there is her horrible Aunt Norris, who is so much a caricature of evil that she seems to be a prototype for Cinderella's wicked stepmother. In fact, many readers have compared Fanny to Cinderella, but this is not the case. Although Fanny comes to Mansfield Park as a poor relation, she is not mistreated by anyone in the house except for Aunt Norris. And then there is her cousin Edmund Bertram, Fanny's champion and protector, who is one of the most puzzling characters in \\"Mansfield Park\\".I've never seen a sympathetic character become so thoroughly unsympathetic as Edmund Bertram. We certainly like him a lot in the beginning; he keeps Fanny from feeling lonely and neglected, and shields her from the constant badgering of their loathsome aunt. He's warm and open-hearted where Fanny seems cold and unyielding. When he falls in love with Mary Crawford, the reader can sense they are hopelessly mismatched, but she's a much more appealing character than Fanny. There's not a mean or moralizing bone in her body; she's generous and kind, and if she's also shallow and materialistic, well, nobody's perfect. But when Edmund's sister Maria drops the bomb that blows the family apart and runs away from a loveless marriage to elope with Mary's brother Henry, who has declared himself in love with Fanny, Edmund turns into a block of ice. He not only can't understand Mary wanting to limit the damage, he decides Mary is corrupt herself for attempting to do so. Edmund drops poor Mary like a hot potato. From being a sympathetic and likeable character, Edmund now appears as a sanctimonious prig; unable to understand and forgive, concerned only with passing judgment. He and Fanny are made for each other.The biggest problem of all with this book is the ending. After thoroughly developing the plot and the characters, Austen all of a sudden decides to wrap it up as expeditiously as possible. So in three chapters she dispenses with Maria's adultery and its devastating effects on both the Bertram and Crawford families, Edmund dumping Mary and marrying Fanny, Maria's banishment, Julia's elopement, and ties everything up in a neat little package. Convenient, except that it feels hurried and contrived. This is no way to end a great book.What does Mansfield Park itself finally stand for? Like its owner, Sir Thomas Bertram, it's a bastion of stability in a rapidly changing world, rolling up the barricades against the forces that threaten it. But Mansfield Park is flawed itself, built and maintained as it is on the hellish cruelty of West Indian slave labor,and we come to realize that both Mansfield Park, and Fanny herself, represent a last stand against the forces of a rapidly changing world that, for better or worse, will sooner or later render them obsolete. Perhaps Jane Austen saw it coming herself, which would account for the dark undertone of the book. It's the most profound of her six novels, and for this reader, her best book.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This is a great annotated edition. Very few redundent notations. The only reason it did not get five stars is because in two spots the annotator comments on Mary Crawford speaking unusual views for women at the time. Which would be fine except in one instance it isn't her speaking and in another instance she's not even in the room and really it is Edmund speaking. Other than that it was very interesting. Especially for the price which is very reasonable compared to the ten dollar and up annotated editions. Another thing that I liked about it was that next to the annotation links he had letters indicating if it was an opinion, word, or historical note which made it much nicer to be able to skip words that I already know the meaning of."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park seems to appear quite frequently on people's \\"least favourite Austen book\\" lists, but over the years I've come to think more and more highly of it. I've become very fond of timid, frail little Fanny, whose heart is a good deal warmer than those of the more flamboyant female characters. She's affectionate, loyal, and prepared to stick to what she feels to be right even though she suffers all the more for it because she's so powerless.But Fanny is not a beguiling heroine to hang a whole novel on, and Austen does not attempt to. Mansfield Park is a rich and complex work, with ambiguous characters, plots within plots, and layers of symbolism that aren't what I usually associate with Jane. Her use of the play \\"Lovers' Vows\\" is sheer brilliance in what it shows us of the characters and their entwined relationships, even down to the fate of the performance itself. On a smaller scale, the game of \\"Speculation\\" does something similar.Mary Crawford can be seen as a portrait of what Elizabeth Bennet might be if she had all the wit and liveliness we love, but without solid virtue at her core. Mrs Norris is, I think, Austen's nastiest female character (in the six novels, at least; I'm not counting Lady Susan). She makes Lady Catherine seem like a cuddly granny. Edmund is very silly for most of the book, but it's (mostly) convincing, and it's forgivable, because he gets there in the end. Henry Crawford plays the villain, but he had a very good chance of being the hero.The editor of my edition says he considers Mansfield Park \\"one of the most profound novels of the nineteenth century\\", which is high praise indeed. I'll content myself with saying I like it very much."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park is the story of Fanny Price, who at ten years old is taken away from her indigent family to live with her rich cousins, the Bertrams of Mansfield Park. Both Fanny's uncle, Sir Thomas Bertram, and her Aunt Norris, his sister-in-law, want the distinction of rank preserved between Fanny and her richer cousins. Consequently, Fanny suffers under the tyranny of her Aunt Norris and the neglect of most everyone else at Mansfield Park. The only real exception is her cousin Edmund, who, as Fanny grows older, becomes both friend and counselor to her. The monotony of Mansfield Park is upset when brother and sister, Henry and Mary Crawford, visit their sister at the parsonage of Mansfield. Henry Crawford toys with the affections of Fanny's cousins, Maria and Julia, while Mary Crawford earnestly seeks the affections of Edmund. Fanny quietly observes all.Mansfield Park is a complex and sometimes disturbing novel, and its conclusion has a tendency to feel less than satisfactory. Jane Austen contrasts the very moral Fanny Price and her cousin Edmund Bertram with the very charming but amoral Mary Crawford and her brother Henry Crawford. While doing this, Jane Austen never actually tells her readers what to think about her characters. She presents their thoughts, words, and actions in an almost unbiased manner and leaves judgment up to the reader. The novel is definitely food for thought, and every time I read it, I find myself feeling differently about both it and its characters than I did the time before. I appreciate both the storyline and its thought-provoking complexity.The Oxford Illustrated edition of Mansfield Park contains a copy of the play Lovers' Vows referred to in the novel, which is such a treat. After reading both the novel and the play, one cannot help but be struck by the parallels between the two. I recommend this edition to anyone curious about the controversial play in the novel."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"In this somewhat atypical Jane Austen novel, Austen abandons her precise characterization and carefully constructed plots, usually designed to illustrate specific ethical and social dilemmas, and presents a much broader, more complex picture of early nineteenth century life. Though the polite behavior of the middle and upper classes is always a focus of Austen, and this novel is no exception, she is more analytical of society as a whole here, casting a critical eye on moral issues which allow the upper class to perpetuate itself. Fanny Price, the main character, is the daughter of a genteel woman who married for love but soon found herself in poverty. When Fanny's aunt and uncle, the wealthy owners of Mansfield Park, invite Fanny alone, of all the children, to live with them, Fanny enters a new world, where she is educated, clothed, and housed, but always regarded as an \\"outsider.\\"Through Fanny's two cousins, Maria and Julia, Austen shows the complex interactions of the upper class as they negotiate marriages, try to maintain the family's reputation and wealth, and react to those \\"beneath\\" them socially. Fanny, having experienced both poverty and plenty, comments on what she sees, and though she lacks the witty charm of some of Austen's other characters (such as Elizabeth Bennett), she shows an intelligence and conscience lacking among her cousins. Only Edmund, the youngest of the Bertram sons, pays genuine attention to her, and her love for him is real, though secret.This is a darker novel than Austen's others, showing conflicts between late eighteenth century rationalism and the growing romanticism of the nineteenth century. Sir Thomas maintains his wealth through his expedient participation in the slave trade, a business that his sons Thomas and Edmund abhor. Often unfeeling toward his own family, Sir Thomas also shows cruelty toward Fanny when she rejects a marriage he has negotiated for her to a man she does not love. Cousin Maria chooses to marry Rushworth for his fortune, but she succumbs to her passion for someone else, and introduces a romantic, new sexuality into the novel. Unfortunately, Fanny, though sweet and reasonable, is also quiet and predictable, while Edmund, the only other potentially empathetic character, is nave and often appears to be weak. Austen's light touch and quiet humor, which make her other novels vibrate with life and come to a satisfying ending, are less obvious here, and the abrupt conclusion leaves many questions unanswered. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Fanny Price, the central character of Mansfield Park is less loveable than Jane Austin's other heroines, but she acts as the pivot point of a far more mature and serious work than her others. In this critique of 18th century morals and values, Austin attacks society's sacrifice of depth of feeling and honesty to hedonism and personal gain. In short, anything is acceptable providing the neighbors don't find out. Despite this, the story moves more slowly than the others and is less a joyful look at society's foibles.Austin has gone to considerable effort to illustrate that over indulgence, lack of responsibility, and a sense of entitlement can ruin a young person's life. While each of her sponsor's children have been given a superior education and introduced into a society that values wealth, beauty and rank to exclusion of all else, Fanny herself has learned the value of devotion, honesty, and service to others. It is only with the disastrous behavior of her cousins that the Bertrum family learns how \\"poor\\" they are compared to their young ward.Far more central to the story are the characters of Mary Crawford and her brother, Henry. Their talents and social abilities encapsulate the essence of what was considered \\"desireable\\" among the upper classes of the 18th century. Musically inclined, able to carry on a witty conversation, eager to engage in romantic games, mindless of repercussions, they involve themselves in the lives of the Bertrams and their ward, ruining Maria's marriage, almost ruining Edmund's happiness and career, and bringing Tom to physical collapse. To all of this Fanny's character is the antithesis. She steadfastly refuses Henry's advances, is not taken in by his clever sister Mary, and grieves over Edmund's ultimate loss of innocence.To some extent, Fanny is a \\"Cinderella\\" figure. She has even been assigned to an attic room. Aunt Norris, constantly reminding the girl how lucky she has been to be given the advantages she has been by the Bertrums, also reminds her that she must remember she must always be the last and the least. Although cousin Edmund is a somewhat dull prince charming, he shares much in common with Fanny, and one can well believe they will live happily-ever-after, once all the hurtles between them have been leaped. And as always, the \\"bad guys\\" get their cumupence.The book has a lot to say for itself, and despite it's almost 200 years, it has a lot to say to us."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"The character of Fanny Price is so easy to fall in love with.

Jane is really boring in this one. I have read her books over and over, especially &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; hoping that I would appreciate it more, but to no avail. I purchased the BBC video not too long ago and that was boring also. I recently purchased the EIGHT cassette version read by a Maureen O'Brien. This was the WORST. Miss O'Brien speaks so rapidly, she cannot be understood half of the time! I had to keep re-running the tape to grasp what she was saying! This certainly has not made &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; more appealing. It's still down at the bottom of my list!"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I really couldn't get into this one for some reason. Maybe I'll pick it up later and give it another try, I just found it so boring.."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This book is not good at all. I usually have no problem getting into a story, no matter what period it is written from, but the Author rambled on & on for the first 15 or so pages, that I finally gave up on reading anymore.

I also found the writer using excessively long sentances, and drawing out passages which could have easily been put in many less words.I also found that the story seemingly goes nowhere. There is little or no character change, and there really is no conflict in the story line.So if you want a dro pdead boring story with no action whatsoever, read on, dear reader, read on."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"It's true that Fanny Price, the heroine, is different than most of the main characters of Jane Austen's books. She is timid, not energetic, not witty, and fearful for the first few chapters. Elizabeth Bennett she is not. The story, though, is more about how others discover and come to appreciate her many good qualities: loyalty, intelligence, gentleness, excellent listening skills, and capable of feeling sympathy for almost anyone. Although many people think she doesn't notice what goes on at Mansfield Park - which include scandalous flirtations, lack of respect for authority, and a particularily nasty aunt who berates Fanny into submission - Fanny sees all. This is especially important when her dear cousin Edmund falls in love with the witty, vivacious Mary Crawford, whose morals are questionable at best and views of life is superficial and materialistic.Meanwhile, Fanny has to deal with Mary's wealthy brother Henry, who switches from toying with Fanny's cousins' affections to declaring passionate love to Fanny herself. Fanny's big problem - and one that frustrates most readers - is that she is almost never in the position of speaking her own mind, being a young unmarried woman who originally comes from a poor family. It's not so much about Fanny finding her voice as it is about others learning that to listen to it. This is most evident in Sir Thomas, her uncle, who is very much used to do things his own way, and with whom Fanny is not in a position to share, to warn him, about the troubling Crawfords.This is Austen's most conservative book, so I understand why it may not be her most popular. But for readers looking for a challenge, who don't mind a sublte protaganist, and who can be very patient, I highly reccommend this title. It was the second Austen book I've ever read and is now one of my absolute favorite books of all time. I'll leave with one last word - for anyone who's ever spent a Saturday night alone, wishing to have friends who understood them, this is for you."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Had never read Jane Austin before. Read this for my book club, very enjoyable, will read Jane Austin again."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors. I've seen various movie releases for her books but it's rare to find anything that are as good as the books. It's no surprise that Ms. Austen still delivers a great story with great writing in Mansfield Park."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This is my favourite Jane Austen book which I first read in my early teen years. It may be my favourite because it was my first Austen book but after re-reading it after other Austen books, I continued to think the same.Although this lacks some of the truly clever twists and plots of her other books, it excels at following the child Fanny through her childhood to adulthood and her changing emotions and development.As always, Jane Austen excels at her characters and they are very believable as well as romantic, realistic, and hilarious!I do hope that this book is used more in schools and that children are encouraged to read this as well as the more popular and more popularised Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility.I would recommend this book for young teenagers and upwards. It probably favours girls rather than boys but is a fun and yet challenging read for all."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"In Mansfield Park, \\"All the world's a stage/And all the men and women merely players.\\" The cast of characters of both the novel and the play within it is drawn from three families and their social circles: the Bertrams of Mansfield Park, the Grants/Crawfords of the parsonage, and the Prices of Portsmouth. Even as she refuses to participate in her cousins' staging of Lovers' Vows, Fanny Price is at center stage as the observer we observe in Austen's social and familial drama.As the poor relation of the Bertrams, Fanny is a natural outsider. Lacking social or financial aspirations, she is free to see the folly of those around her and bound by what seems to have become a quaint form of honor from warning Edmund about his. For all her acquiescence to fate, however, Fanny is not weak. Just as she takes a firm stand about not appearing in the ill-fated Lovers' Vows with its ill-fated cast, she stays on her moral high road even when it requires her to assert herself to Sir Thomas, to whom she is beholden and whose own daughters dare not defy him so directly.Marriage is central to Mansfield Park. Maria Ward \\"had the good luck . . . to be thereby raised to the rank of a baronet's lady, with all the comforts and consequences of an handsome house and large income.\\" Despite the narrator's cynicism, the Bertrams have what seems to be an effective marriage; Sir Thomas is the domineering household head, while his decorative lady provides the services of her busybody widowed sister and her niece Fanny. Lady Bertram's passivity complements Sir Thomas's active nature; she is \\"guided in everything important by Sir Thomas, and in smaller concerns by her sister.\\" She can do without companionship, but only if Sir Thomas reassures her.Motivated by his money and status and her good looks, the Bertrams have established a solid marriage, but its sons and daughters are not its pride. Restrained by and resentful of Sir Thomas's patriarchal hand, his elder son and daughter rebel against and eventually flout his authority and threaten the family's good name. His younger daughter seeks escape through the closest means possible, and even his younger son is spared from his poor judgment only by fate.Unlike Lady Bertram, her youngest sister marries for love, or at least on impulse, and suffers the consequences of ignoring what matters most--money and social standing. Self-condemned to a life of poverty and negligence, Mrs. Price cannot depend on either husband or servants to manage day-to-day life so she can indulge in her natural laziness, as Lady Bertram does. Even as her family lives in filthy squalor, Mrs. Price, could, if she were capable of noticing, take pride in Fanny's personal growth and moral fortitude, William's accomplishments and career, and Susan's promise. Like the Bertrams on their extensive estate, she is trapped in the narrow drama she has written for herself. Those who exit--Fanny, William, Susan--are able, it seems, to craft a more positive narrative for themselves.Like a proscenium arch, the trip to Sotherton and the use of Lovers' Vows frame Fanny's view of the relationships around her. Much of the action takes place out of her sight (to her dismay), but Fanny sees enough to disturb her sense of propriety and to bring to light her own desires. Fanny, and the reader, can only guess what is happening offstage and how it may affect her.Relationships founded solely on money (Rushworths), rebellion or love (Prices, presumably), and lust (Henry/Maria) fare poorly, as does the Crawfords' sister's second marriage (to the admiral). Austen's narrator does not give up on the institution, however. \\"With so much true merit and true love, and no want of fortune or friends . . . happiness . . . must appear as secure as earthly happiness can be,\\" the omnipotent stage director steps in to say after having dispensed justice and wisdom to those characters who require one or the other, just before before the curtain falls on Mansfield Park and environs. In the end and with a heavy hand, the narrator redeems marriage, at least for the deserving (Fanny) and the enduring (the Bertrams).Readers who prefer strong, attractive women may not appreciate Fanny, her apparently rigid morality, and her seeming weakness of will. As a perceptive outsider who understands what she observes, Fanny is a complex character. She knows and respects how Sir Thomas would feel about Lovers' Vows and participates to the extent she can so she can keep an eye on Edmund. She knows where his future unhappiness lies, yet does not deter him although it is in her power. She may be judgmental, as people are, but she asserts herself strongly only when she is herself affected, for example, when she is wanted for the play and when Henry pays his attentions. She is true to herself and allows others the same freedom, succeed or fail, with her real feelings hidden within her inner emotional life.Set in a time of war and slave-supported prosperity that seems remote, Mansfield Park can still reach across the years. In spite of the antiquated social and moral codes that rule their lives, the out-of-touch adults, the rebellious children, and the lonely and unconventional heroine still hold interest today."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"The first half of the book was kind of slow, but by the middle I couldn't put it down! It was wonderful and had a few surprises. I am trying to read all of Jane Austen's books...so far I have only read this, Pride and Prejudice, and Emma. I would have to say I like both P&P and Emma better than Mansfield Park, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This is one in the Cambridge University Press series of all of Austen's novels.

In this story Jane Austen developes a character in Fanny Price that is so very pathetic. I felt sorry for her from the beginning and at times wondered why she didn't just committ suicide! There seemed no place where she could find joy, and no people with whom she could be happy. When Fanny finally started to make her own mark in the world the book came to a screeching halt. I felt that the last 20 pages in the book were like a deflated balloon. The style of naration changed. The characterizations changed. I wondered: Did the publisher force Jane to change an original ending to this supposed happy one? Did she succumb to the opinions of others that Fanny must connect with Edmund? I saw no good reason for that ending. It seemed forced, contrived and choppy."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This is my favorite of Jane Austen's books due to that plot that some people find so difficult and boring to follow. Well it's not at all, and is quite fun. The heroine, Fanny Price, can get on you, but the lively Crawfords make up for that. The poor things: they get bashed for being attractive, witty, and charming. Maybe their behaviour is a little risque, but Henry Crawford is one-hundred times more interesting than that prig, Edmund."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I got this because my wife loves all Jane Austen's books. This one arrived in great quality in like four or five days."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards. For Jane Austen, that book was \\"Mansfield Park\\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?The biggest problem with \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \\"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.\\"Mansfield Park\\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park is Jane Austen's third novel. Dr Ian Littlewood describes it in his introduction as her first \\"fully mature work\\". The novel centres around Fanny Price, who, from the age of nine, is raised by her aunt and uncle, Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram, in the company of her cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia, and her aunt Norris. Austen's prose gives us a clear snapshot of what life was like for the well-to-do and also the less well-off in Regency England. In this novel, Austen deals, as usual, with morality and, in this case, also with adultry. Austen's characters are well portrayed and it is easy to see why her novels are still popular today."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Unike her other novels there was no one really to hate or to love. Fanny was sort of a dull lead character so I think the other people in the story were writen in such a way as to not overshadow her. The book was well writen but did not envoke much emotion like Jane's other books."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park is probably my least favorite of Austen's works. I disliked or felt indifferent about most of the characters in the book for most of the story, and while it does have some themes which could be considered important for the times, I felt that those same themes were treated better in some of Austen's other novels."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Having a hard time with this book.

I had to read Pride &amp; Prejudice for English Lit in high school and I've been hooked ever since. I've read several of Austen's novels and I had trouble making to the end of this one. I felt like throwing the book down in frustration several times because it was so slow and hard to follow. Fanny was too quiet for my taste and I never understood Edmund's interest in Miss Crawford. If you're a fan of Jane Austen, go ahead and read this book, but make sure your wide awake, otherwise you might just fall asleep due to boredom."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I have no right to review Jane Austen. I give this book 4.5 billion stars."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Jane Austen's Mansfield Park is more Dickensian than her other novels. Our herione, Fanny Price, is treated abyssmally by her adoptive family, especially her horrible Aunt Mrs Norris. But, being an Austen herione, she is plucky and lives to have all her dreams of marriage come true. My only complaint is with how horribly pious and self-righteous Fanny is. The other characters are alive with complexities....Fanny, however, is portrayed as saintly."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I love Jane Austen and would actually give this book 4 1/2 stars. It's a little slow in parts but like all of her characters, I loved getting to know Fanny Price. Fannie is a quiet girl who is sent to live with her wealthy uncle. She has a very kind heart and is very patient with her Aunt Norris who loves to \\"put her in her place\\". She is often reminding her that she is in a different class than her cousins that she is so fortunate to live with. It is wonderful to watch as Fannie grows into a young woman, how she learns to speak her mind and not allow others to manipulate her as they once did. It is definitely one of my very favorite books."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"If anyone reads this novel and forgets who Mrs. Norris and Mr. Rushworth are--I am amazed. Jane Austen is a nearly perfect story-teller. Always there are unexpected twists in lovers and even in marriage. Mansfield Park takes it's place by Emma as my favorite Ms. Austen novel. Mansfield Park takes you through the morals of classes, and lets you heighten yourself right along with Fanny Price. No matter what Aunt Norris has to say. Mr. Rushworth was my favorite character among them all, he doesn't make many appearances--when he does they were all rather humorous to me. A highly recommended read for a cozy night."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Fanny Price, the heroine from this novel, is the biggest drawback to the story in my view. She is the sort of woman with whom I have never had much in common. She is insufferably sweet, eternally turning cheeks, and almost totally incapable of speaking her mind if she is in disagreement with others. In short...she is the ultimate in &quot;goodness.&quot; It felt plastic to me.For whatever criticisms I have of Fanny Price, I cannot deny that the reader is forced, throughout the novel, to wish her well. I truly yearned with my full heart for Fanny to get the life and love and attention that she so heartily deserved.The story, though not as funny as Pride &amp; Prejudice, is quite entertaining with little twists in the plot that one doesn't necessarily see coming and with an ending that really could've gone either way.I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I'll probably read it again, and I would definitely recommend it to any true Austen fan."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"&quot;The nonsense and folly of people's stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves, makes me think it right to give you a hint Fanny, now that you are going into company without any of us.&quot; Fanny's Aunt Norris said this and it resembles how Fanny was treated when she first moved from her low-classed home, to her uncle's high classed home. Because of this, Fanny was mistreated and looked down upon by most for a great deal of the book, until a few finally saw what a wonderful person she was, and the views of her family members slowly began to change. The story takes place in England during the Victorian age. Fanny is a ten-year-old girl that goes to live with her uncle, and aunt, and cousins. Fanny spends the whole story trying to live up to the standards that have been produced for her at her new home at Mansfield Park. Because she went from a lower classed home to a higher classed home, she had to learn the ways of a high classed young lady, which entitled her becoming educated, learning to be a proper lady, and learning proper manners and class. Fanny spends the novel seeking happiness and love, which she had been missing throughout her life. Austen does a wonderful job of making it a point that a person that was not born in a low classed family could experience as much, if not more happiness as one that was born into a high classed family. Fanny had two female cousins, Julia and Maria, who were both somewhat cruel to her when they were younger. They looked down on Fanny, as if she did not deserve to live in the house as them. They did not feel that Fanny would ever have the chance to experience the love and happiness that they were to experience because she was of a lower social class. However in the end, Fanny found the most happiness of all, and Maria had done something that was unacceptable of such a high classed young woman, and was never to have respect of dignity again. Austen wrote this novel beautifully in a way that many could enjoy it, however there are some objections. There are times in the novel when Austen goes into great detail, which you might find unnecessary at first, however she does this for a reason. The information that is given to you is always important, because an author doesn't write anything for no reason, there is always a purpose. These details are crucial in making everything fit together in the end, which Austen does very well. Also, the characters get very confusing at times, and paying attention to the details will make it a lot easier to understand. To overcome these difficulties, just keep in mind that if you skim past the details, the best part of the book will have been lost. The names of the characters get confusing at times, so to keep from the confusion, write down all the characters and their full names and who they are married to. This will give you a good reference to look at. Austen does a wonderful job of making Fanny make somewhat of a difference in everyone's life. Fanny proved to everyone that happiness could be found without doing what was socially expected of people. She followed her heart instead of doing what was expected of her, which brought her great happiness. She proved to people that happiness is about love, not what you have or whom you are married to. She became so happy because she grew up in both and upper and lower classed homes, so she knows what both are like. She was taught to enjoy what she had because it may be gone someday."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"'Mansfield Park' is a strange one to review having not the strength of a central heroine as in P&amp;P or the eponymous Emma but I think it is in many ways more charming and captivating than any of her other works simply because of the richness and variety in the other characters in the novel. Mrs Norris, Mary and her brother Henry are an entertainment in their own right and while the plot winds along a la all Austen's novels and Fanny's reward is never in serious doubt (and by gum the girl has suffered for this reward) there seems to be more interaction between the characters in MP which I believe makes it an easier read than some of the others, not,as some have said, more laboured. Certainly the Year 9 class that I'm teaching the novel to wouldn't agree but hopefully at least one of them will go on to be an avid Janeite!

Mansfield Park had me on the edge of my seat for the final third of the book--Jane Austen is a timeless author and a breath of fresh air to those of us who are tired of the sex, violence and lack of originality so prevalent in today's &quot;literature.&quot; Three cheers for Jane!!!"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"No matter how many times you read Mansfield Park, it just keeps getting better.

While perhaps Austen's darkest novel, in that she appears to discuss the issue of morality to agreater degree than in any other novel, it still sparkles with some brilliant satire and humour. Perhaps her greatest work."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This is Jane Austen's most difficult and least sparkling book. It is also, however, very possibly her best. Nowhere else do we see Austen treat immorality and its consequences as she does here. Her &quot;villians&quot; are usually laughable. Here, they are pitiable and deceitful. Fanny Price is certainly not a very entertaining character, but she is a very compelling one. As for those people who say that she is weak, they are correct. She uses all of her strength, however, to her advantage. Yet, she never does anything which would violate her strict moral code. Nowhere is Austen's keen insight into English social structure moral visible than in this ambiguous and moving tale. A wonderful, yet very difficult, book. Read her others first, then, when you think you know who Jane Austen was, read this. You'll be amazed."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park is more than a simplistic domestic Drama - to read it as such is to severely limit the meaning of the novel. There were many underlying themes in this novel - Austen was incapable of writing a mere romance. Her novels were her only voice in the patriarchal society of her time, and in Mansfield Park we can see veiled references to the slavery debate that was raging at the time this novel was written. There are other meanings to be found in Mansfield Park - Jane Austen herself told her sister that her new novel would be of 'a complete change of subject - ordination'. Although this comment was made while the novel was still in progress, if we read Mansfield Park with this intention, the novel contains a complex discussion of the changing role of the church. This is intrinscially linked to the change in popular morality, a movement which is clearly illustrated by the action surrounding the play, Lover's Vows. Even without straying far from the superficial 'domestic drama', Mansfield Park cotains a complex and often witty representation of the contradictions and ironies of human behaviour. These themes must all be considered when attempting to read Mansfield Park for the deeper meaning no doubt intended by Austen.Mansfield Park is undoubtedly more than a mere 'domestic drama'. To read it as boring just because Henry Crawford and Edmund Bertram are not as sexy as Darcy, is to miss out on a bloody interesting read!!"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This book is one of my favorites along with Pride and Prejudice.

Avoid it."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"From \\"Mansfield Park\\" by Jane Austen: \\"I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever, agreeable man...\\" Every young lady except Fanny Price, that is.I thought \\"Mansfield Park\\" was different from Jane Austen's other, more popular novels. For this reason, many readers do not like the story as well, but I truly enjoyed it. Instead of desperately searching for a wealthy husband, the main character searches for her own values and true, non-financially-advancing love.The main character, Fanny Price, is adopted by her wealthy aunt and uncle in order to ease the financial burden of her poor parents. Here she is given a proper, upper-class education, but does not receive equal treatment with her female cousins. She is casually disregarded and mistreated by her aunts and is ignored by her uncle. However, she finds solace in the friendship of her cousin, Edmund, who goes out of his way to comfort and protect her in his capricious home, Mansfield Park. Years later, Fanny finds herself in love with him, but Edmund still treats her like a little sister. When a \\"worldly\\" young lady catches his eye, Fanny believes that all hope is lost. However, as time goes by, she becomes more beautiful and people start to notice her. A rich young gentleman suddenly proposes to her, but she refuses him, still holding out for Edmund's love. Everyone around her is frustrated that she won't accept the gentleman, who is more than socially worthy of her. Even Edmund tries to persuade her, but she cannot bring herself to marry a man who she doesn't love and whose values she is uncertain of.Though Fanny Price's character seemed flat to me in the beginning of the story, I soon grew to like her for all her shyness and modesty. She is not as \\"strong\\" as most of Jane Austen's other heroines, but she displays a faithfulness and honesty that I could not help but admire (although it seemed inconvenient to the story at times). Overall, I liked \\"Mansfield Park\\" very well and would read it again. The ending was not as satisfying as I hoped it would be, but I was pleased with the strong message that some of Austen's other novels seem to lack."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"The main characters Fanny and Edmund are probably the most heart warming and enviable characters I have ever read. I absolutely adore this book. I could hardly put it down. I would often stay up until 2am reading. Definitely a book you will re-read again and again."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"and she uses that mastery with style and grace to tell, in a compelling manner, an engaging story peopled with interesting characters."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"this book is weird because it made me dislike fanny, but overall this is probably my favorite jane austen book next to pride and prejudice. regardless of my annoyances with her, i was able to enjoy it. other characters in mansfield park made it amusing and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"MANSFIELD PARK is one of my favorites; this is not the first time I have read it nor will it be the last. Austin's last three novels, MANSFIELD PARK, EMMA, and PERSUASION, are by far her best, the work of a mature genius. They are not for the intellectually lazy as they demand some effort of the reader, but the enjoyment is far worth it. The Collector's Library edition is well-printed, well-bound, lightweight, and small enough to carry around in a pocket or purse. It is also a very pretty volume, making it a pleasure for the bibliophile to handle. One caution, though. The print is on the small side, so if you have problems with your eyesight you might prefer something with larger print."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park is the story of Fanny Price. She is born to poor parents and is whisked off as a young girl to live with her wealthy aunt, uncle, and cousins - the Bertrams.She is miserable at first. Shy and timid by nature, frightened, homesick, and continually lectured by her Aunt Norris about how she should be grateful, life is not pleasant for Fanny. But things begin to change when her cousin Edmund shows kindness to her. His friendship helps her adjust to her new home, broaden her mind, and become a lady.Their peaceful family life comes to an end when their father goes away on a lengthy business trip. About the same time, Mary Crawford and her brother move to the area. The young people strike up a friendship, and without the stabilizing influence of their father the Bertrams start to go down the wrong path. Fanny is the only one who seems to realize the Crawfords are a bad influence. But no one pays any attention to her.I won't mention how things turn out because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read this.This is not my favorite Austen, but I liked it very much. In the beginning the treatment of Fanny both annoyed and depressed me. However, as she begins to grow and become more confident, the book really took off for me and I couldn't stop reading.There are a lot of sections in this book that sound like sermons - probably because a main character becomes a clergyman - and I can see how that would be hard going for some. It's not as light and fun as other Austen novels. But it is still a very good book and a must read for Austen fans."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park is not one of the more popular Austen novels, and I must confess, it's not my favorite either. In fact, it's probably my second to last favorite before Northanger Abbey. It's much more serious than her other books. There's not as much light humor. It's really not very romantic. Many people find the heroine, Fanny Price, insipid. So much so that the two latest adaptations of it totally changed her personality.Even though MP is low on my list of Austen novels, I think it's far from being a bad or boring book. True, it's focus seems to be more on morality rather than romance or comedy but I still enjoy it. While Edmund Bertram is admittedly low on my list of Austen heroes, I do like and admire Fanny Price, both as a character and as a person. Many readers may find her dull but I just don't think so. Yes, she is weak and has low confidence in the beginning. But who can blame her? She wasn't brought up in good conditions and then was taken away from her family at a young age. And Mrs. Norris has pretty much made her life hell. She has a strong set of morals in spite of this. She is able to see through the outwardly charming but inwardly ugly Crawfords (who even fool Edmund!) and will not back down in her refusal to marry Henry. This means so much more coming from her than it would from an outspoken girl, like Elizabeth Bennet. It took a lot more courage for the timid Fanny to stand up for herself and say no to Henry than for Lizzy, who always speaks her mind, to refuse Mr. Collins or Darcy, that's for sure!The Crawfords are pretty popular among some readers from what I've seen, so they've charmed more than the book characters, apparently! I've seen comparisons of Mary to Elizabeth Bennet, which surprises and irritates me. Yes, they are both witty, but that's as far as I'd take it. Elizabeth, while immature in the beginning of the book, is still a compassionate and pretty much unselfish person. Mary Crawford is very selfish (she doesn't even try to hide it) and is only after rank and fortune. She falls for Edmund in spite of herself but still tries to constantly persuade him not to be a clergyman because that is apparently not good enough of a profession for her. She really shows her ugly side in a letter to Fanny near the end in which she expresses her hopes that Tom will die so that Edmund will become heir to Mansfield Park and the baronetcy! Edmund finally opens his eyes to Mary's true nature after Henry and Maria's elopement. She doesn't seem to have any awareness that their adultery is wrong, only that they were not discreet about it and got caught! Really, can you picture Elizabeth Bennet saying these things? I've never understood Henry's popularity either. Yes, he's charming. Yes, he did fall in love with Fanny. But do people really think she could have been happy with him or reformed him? He would have probably been back to his rakish ways in a short time if she did marry him. Fanny saw him toying with both Maria and Julia's affections (despite Maria being engaged) and knew this. He ran off with Maria when things were looking up for his case! And he only started the whole affair with Fanny because he wanted to put a \\"hole in her heart.\\" Yeah, what a catch...I think the only thing I really find lacking in this book is the romance between Edmund and Fanny. I know that Austen didn't intend that as her focus and I am happy that Fanny got what she always wanted, but it still would have been nice to see some romantic scenes between them at the end. In spite of this I can safely call myself a fan of both Mansfield Park and Fanny Price."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park is an excellent novel written by Jane Austen. Her story resolves around a society based solely on material possessions. The family is a very wealthy and illustrates a world where wealth defines all. The main Character, Fanny, comes to live with her wealthy Uncle and Aunt . Previously, her lifestyle was placed in an impoverished environment. Her situation has changed thus allowing her to focus on other thing such as her own personal desires. Although, powerless in a male dominated world she perseveres against the odds and at the very end achieves what she wants. Her dramatic change is witnessed through \\"Mansfield Park\\". The novel argues against how much power a woman actually wields despite her hindrance of society against it.Unlike her previous novels Austen does not completely end the story as a happy ending. Her novel includes a divorce that affects the very fabric of society. Her introduction of numerous characters is very overwhelming. I personally had to reread the first chapter multiple times. The conflict in the novels are condescending and diverse much like modern day House wives. Austen attacks society as she explores adultery, male dominance, primogeniture, and affection through the texts of her novel \\"Mansfield Park\\"."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"1st this review pertains ONLY to the Everman's Library edition only.The story is great, although anyone used to reading this genre can tell way in advance how the story will end up. Even so, it is well-written w/o lots of susperfluous dialogue that is found in JA's other books.The problem with this edition is that the introduction represents the worst of academic English department trash I have read in years. Almost indecipherable, it adds nothing to the experience and shows in full color why academic English professors (and the depts. that support them) are a laughing stock. Skip the intro, and maybe even buy a cheaper edition of this title as well."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park is Austen's third,least popular,and my second favorite of her novels.It is the least popular because like most of her relatives,most readers do not understand the heroine Fanny Price.Fanny's high sense of morals,duty,honor and gentleness are uncommon in our society today.Today society doesn't have a moral code.I am very fond of Fanny and she is one of my favorite heroines.I dislike Henry and Mary Crawford,who most other readers seem to like.Henry Crawford is the kind of man who leads you on,gets sick of you,or gets what he wants or both then skips out on you.Leaving you with a brokenheart.Henry Crawford is the best actor of all the young people(in play they almost put on in the book).It's because his whole life is that an act.He cannot be himself because he doesn't know himself.His sister Mary is not much better.She values money over character.Henry charms Fanny's female cousins Maria and Julia.While Mary bewitches Fanny's best friend,cousin,and true love Edmund.Fanny is the only one who doesn't fall under the Crawfords charms.She sees them for who they are all charm,no substance.Fanny Price may not be as lively or witty as some of Austen's other heroines like Elizabeth and Emma but everyone is differnt.I hope when you read Mansfield Park you love Fanny Price for who she is and not who she isn't."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Jane Austen once mused that her novels are like a miniature mural painted on a two-inch square of ivory. While that's a lovely image, and while Austen was a master of deep character and thoroughly explored emotion, her books have important political elements that should not be overlooked. I'm surprised that more people haven't picked up on this, but Mansfield Park is certainly a defense of feminism and a profound statement on the importance of women's education. It is also, perhaps, a response to people's reactions to the heroines in her earlier works Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice.At the time, women of a certain class were expected to be \\"accomplished,\\" but not necessarily educated. We see this also in \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" when Mr. Darcy chides Miss Bingley on being so very accomplished in such vital arts as table painting though not well-read. Here, the heroine of Mansfield Park, Fanny Price, reads a great deal, but her older cousins the Misses Maria and Julia Bertrams are more accomplished in needlework and playing the pianoforte, as befits the daughters of a baronet. The middle set-piece of the book, the theatricals (they put on a play!), we see how each of the girls reacts when presented with an opportunity to do something fun that is perhaps a tad disreputable and, more importantly, something they know will piss off their father. In the latter part of the book, the three girls are offered various marriages and situations in life. Maria makes disastrous choices that still draw gasps (or at least rolled eyes) today. Julia's choices are hasty and panic-driven, though not as deplorable as her elder sister's. Only Fanny Price is patient, makes the correct moral choices that are not mercenary, and marries for love and honor.Sir Thomas Bertrams muses that, \\"...the most direful mistake in his plan of education [of Maria and Julia]. Something must have been wanting within, or time would have worn away much of its ill effect. He feared that principle, active principle, had been wanting; that they had never been properly taught to govern their inclinations and tempers by that sense of duty which alone can suffice. They had been instructed theoretically in their religion, but never required to bring it into daily practice. To be distinguished for elegance and accomplishments - the authorized subject of their youth - could have had no useful influence that way, no moral effect on the mind. He had meant them to be good, but his cares had been directed to the understanding and manners, not the disposition; and the necessity of self-denial and humility, he feared, they had never heard from any lips that could profit them. Bitterly did he deplore a deficiency which now he could scarcely comprehend to have been possible. Wretchedly did he feel, that with all the cost and care of an anxious and expensive education, he had brought up his daughters without their understanding their first duties, or his being acquainted with their character and temper.\\"Sir Thomas's sentiments and even vocabulary are astonishingly similar to those of Mary Wollstonecraft in \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Women\\": that \\"The conduct and manners of women...prove that their minds are not in a healthy state ... one cause of this ... I attribute to a false system of education, ...more anxious to make them alluring mistresses than affectionate wives and rational mothers; and the understanding of the sex has been so [deluded] by this specious homage, that the civilized women of the present century ... are only anxious to inspire love, when they ought to cherish a nobler ambition, and by their abilities and virtues exact respect. ... It is acknowledged that they spend many of the first years of their lives in acquiring a smattering of accomplishments; meanwhile strength of body and mind are sacrificed to libertine notions of beauty, to the desire of establishing themselves, --the only way women can rise in the world, --by marriage. And this desire making mere animals of them, when they marry they act as such children may be expected to act: they dress; they paint, and nickname God's creatures [TK: a reference to Hamlet.] Surely these weak beings are only fit for a seraglio! ... Women are told from their infancy, and taught by the example of their mothers, that a little knowledge of human weakness, justly termed cunning, softness of temper, outward obedience, and a scrupulous attention to a puerile kind of propriety, will obtain for them the protection of a man; and should they be beautiful, everything else is needless, for at least, twenty years.\\" Wollstonecraft's ultimate point is that if women have immortal souls, the only way that women can save them is to be educated, for without education, women are merely animals of habit and beasts of fashion.Ultimately, Fanny Price is the central figure of this novel. Others vilify her as passive and puritanical. Indeed, when asked to join the theatrical production, Fanny insists several times, \\"I cannot act!\\" and this repeated statement has more meaning as a metaphor than as a statement of a lack of thespian abilities.Fanny is, however, good and moral. She does the right thing. She does not marry for money, though everyone urges her to, and even though it means she may end up a spinster and a burden to her cousins and uncle. She finally does marry for love, and one is again reminded of Wollstonecraft's statement that, \\"the woman who strengthens her body and exercises her mind will ... become the friend, and not the humble dependent of her husband.\\" Fanny gets a happy marriage.Fanny's erstwhile friend, Mary Crawford, (who some people like but who I think is horrible) is obviously an answer to those people who liked Elizabeth Bennet (of P&P;) a little too much. While Elizabeth Bennet is smart and witty, Mary Crawford has a sparkling but superficial wit. Mary Crawford does not think deeply upon anything but pops off whatever witticism (even ribald ones) that rise to the top of her head. Mary urges Fanny to go to Everingham, the country house that Fanny would live in if she married the wrong man, in a reflection of Elizabeth Bennet's comment in P&P; that she started to love Mr. Darcy when she saw the grounds of his house (Pemberly.) In the end, when confronted with a moral fiasco, Mary refuses to consider how the perpetrator has wounded those around her and offended God by breaking a sacrament, and only laments that so many people know about it.TK KenyonAuthor ofRabid: A NovelandCallous: A Novel"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park has it all. Of course it has Austin's dexterous English, but it also has the social commentary of class and gender which we also expect from her. It has all the feel of a retrospective, and it is remarkable in the extreme that Austin saw her own world with eyes so very like our own. If the quintessence of the creative writer's craft is the development and maintenance of tension, then this is the quintessential Austin novel, and possibly her best. We ache for Fanny when she is transported from her home as a young girl and fails to find either comfort or happiness in the manor house of her aunt and uncle. We are as edgy as the characters themselves as they mount a home theatrical production which places in relief each of their deficiencies, and foretells the guileless decency of our young protagonist. Our nerves are as knotted as hers when the scheming and fabulously wealthy Crawford stalks her, brandishing matrimony as a weapon. And even as we are turning the final dozen pages, the faulty judgment of Fanny's love interest, her cousin Edmond, instills lingering doubts as to whether a satisfying outcome is achievable. Let me provide a preview of Austin's delicious language and the underlying tension it conveys: \\"The evening passed with external smoothness, though almost every mind was ruffled, and the music which Sir Thomas called for from his daughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony.\\" And here Austin portrays the controlling male mindset in dealing with their female marionettes: \\"In thus sending her away, Sir Thomas perhaps might not be thinking merely of her health...he might mean to recommend her as a wife by showing her persuadableness.\\" And just how depraved is Mr. Crawford? \\"Curiosity and vanity were both engaged, and the temptation of immediate pleasure was too strong for a mind unused to make any sacrifice to right...he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose smiles had been so wholly at his command; he must exert himself to subdue so proud a display of resentment; it was anger on Fanny's account [for rebuffing him]; he must get the better of it, and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram [her maiden name] again in her treatment of himself.\\" In Mansfield Park, we have pure evil in a position of commanding power, pitted against a powerless angel. And one by one, the angel's natural allies line up against her. There are a hundred paths to disaster, and only one to the sweetest victory."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I've read that Mansfield Park was Jane Austen's favorite of her marvelous works. The heroine, Fanny Price, is virtually flawless. Fanny Price is not boring, even in a quiet country setting. The exciting circumstances around her keeps the novel flowing and her strength under pressure and integrity makes her likable. Austen also puts in the regular amusing characters as she does in all her novels (i.e. Mr. Collins, Miss Bates, Lucy Steele, etc.) In Mansfield Park, a thoughtless aunt and guardian, vain and competitive cousins, an indolent aunt, and so forth test the character's goodness. It is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"As Jane Austen's most controversial novel, Mansfield Park continues to occupy an inveterate place in literature for its dark charm, its slow yet steady rhythm, its dry yet sharp and ironic humor, and of course fabulous charaterization built on extensive description all within a country challenged by progress.Readers become acquainted with Fanny Price, a victorian era Cinderella so it appeared--plucked from her family in destitude to be allowed to blossom at her wealthy uncle's house, Mansfield Park. Of course being passive, steadfast, timid...certainlly lacking the very fierce which makes Emma and Marrianne among other Austen heroine memorable. Yet withstanding the seductive charm of fortune and of consequence, Fanny Price resists the wooing of a stranger Mr. CRawford who puzzles everyone with his light gallantry and dark desires. A soulmate since childhood, Fanny's cousin Edmund yields in to Miss Crawford, who is all but a nonessential part of Mr. Crawford's scheme of stolen pleasure. Henry Crawford, certainlly one of the darknest characters ever portrayed, more so then Willoughbe (excuse the sp.) is too caught up in the sensual delights of his incessant conquests (including Fanny's 2 pretty cousins) that even though he ackowledges the good influence Fanny's purity has on his heart, he is too deeply sunken in his web of &quot;play&quot; to rise and face truth of love. Yes, Henry Crawford did love Fanny with his heart, at least the pure part of it, unlike Edmund who loves Fanny only out of brotherly affection. But Fanny, whose steady character makes her an unlikely candidate to Crawford's actual reformation, refuses Crawford's sincerity and thus almost pushes him back into his bottomless hold of scheme. The storm thus takes place in the heart of London's upper society, casting its shadow on the peaceful Mansfield Park community and shattering everything Sir Thomas has persevered in building up--with fortune, and with consequence...a mention of slave trade as well.Mary Crawford is a complex player, tainted by a society blindly wooing money and status, that even Edmund is not able to save the good side of her. Apart from Henry's scheme, Edmund is forced to refocus and, voila, there is Fanny (no matter how distasteful cousin-courtship is to many).The movie adaptation of this tale certainlly emphasizes the fighting nature of Fanny which is rarely detected on pages. Yet what IS acknowledged and admired in the quiet little herione, is the perseverance so rare in a world on the verge of revolution."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"How wonderful to live in a small town in Asia! And how wonderful to belong to a small sect, and to spend much of my life performing two-thousand-year-old rituals!What has all of this to do with Mansfield Park? Very little. But it has a lot to do with the modern criticisms of Mansfield Park.People living in the First World, especially in the United States, often forget that there are societies and ways of thinking different from their own. They forget to the extent that they can no longer even imagine such a possibility.In the Western world today, moral absolutism is treated with suspicion, and as something dirty. Maybe rightly, maybe not. But there's no point in reading every novel as if the author shared your point of view, and then staring in bewilderment when you thus find contradictions in it.Fanny Price is morally perfect. She is modest, truthful, and certain of nothing but the difference between right and wrong. She is &quot;a loathsome little priss&quot;. So how could Jane Austen have made her her heroine? And if she decided to create a revolting heroine, why didn't she express her opinion of her, as she frequently does in her novels? Did Jane Austen like prissy little Fanny? This is the question which is really bothering the critics. Well, maybe she did.Maybe Jane Austen herself believed in moral absolutes. There's nothing in her letters or novels to make me think that this is impossible. 'But how could an intelligent, sensitive woman think like that?' Why not? I've spent my life studying moral philosophy, and have not yet seen a logical proof for the impossibility of moral absolutes.It would be unusual for an intelligent, sensitive woman who grew up in Twentieth-Century America to believe in such things. Intelligent people in the United States today are taught to look at many sides of moral issues. But Jane Austen didn't grow up in the United States today. She grew up in a family outwardly very similar to the Bertrams, in a town much like theirs. It is not even clear that Jane Austen herself placed a high value on deep thought and fine moral distinctions. The fact that she enjoyed using them herself is neither here nor there. She may have liked and admired Fanny Price.I like and admire Fanny Price, too. (According to hearsay adduced by Claire Tomalin, so did Cassandra Austen. Tomalin also quotes some words of Jane Austen which point in the same direction, but I don't know the source.) I wouldn't like to have Fanny Price around, because I wouldn't want my every move supervised by the morals-police. But at a great distance, as a character in a novel, I like her. Because I can imagine a different world, where absolute goodness is absolutely good.I have no problem with Jane Austen's attitude toward Fanny Price. It's quite possible that Jane Austen could also imagine absolute good. It would be strange if an associate professor from Palo Alto thought in such terms. But Miss Austen wasn't an associate professor from Palo Alto. She was a clergyman's daughter from Hampshire. And she is allowed to think differently from the associate professor. Or from me.Like many of the critics, I'm not too fond of Mansfield Park. Without Miss Austen's habitual biting wit, her view of society is oppressive. And I can't make any sense of the business with the theatricals. Which annoys me.But I have no complaints against Fanny Price."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards. For Jane Austen, that book was \\"Mansfield Park\\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?The biggest problem with \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \\"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.\\"Mansfield Park\\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I cannot agree with Christine from Ohio. I have read all of Austen's books, and while they are all wonderfully well-written (she does weave an alluring web), Mansfield Park falls a little short of what I have grown to love about Austen's writing. I could not grow to like the character of Fanny Price. In past books, I have empathized and loved Lizzie Bennett, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, and all the rest, but Fanny Price lacked that spark which makes Austen's other characters so very real. Fanny is full of her own moral superiority, and never seems to have any fun. As I read, I grew to like (and Fanny would despise me) the character of Mary Crawford more than any other, as the character who was the most real. Mary had her flaws, and knew she did. She did not deserve the censure she received from Fanny and eventually Edmund. Edmund is another case. Throughout the entire book he pays court to Mary, and though they do not seem particularly suited to one another, it is easy to see their affection. Meanwhile, Fanny is forced to watch as the man she loves loves another. But Edmund soon sees that Mary lacks &quot;good principles&quot; and turns to his cousin for moral fiber. I prefer the fictional worlds of Austin where characters (Lizzie Bennet comes to mind--she eventually realizes she has been mistakenly prejudiced) make mistakes and know they are not perfect. Fanny Price, in all her moralistic glory, seems more suited to a convent of holy sisters than an Austen novel."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"As reviewers remark, Jane Austen likes to set up a tension between \\"opposing\\" forces, in the form of protagonists' ruling traits, and let this tension play out through the denouement of each novel. The best known example is the embodiment of \\"Pride\\" vs. \\"Prejudice\\", in the two main characters of that named book. Another is showcased via the two sisters Elinor and Marianne embodyingSense And Sensibility. In Mansfield Park, the two contrasting characteristics are to my reading, a steadfast \\"purity\\" vs. \\"corruptibility\\" of character as the latter is exposed to life experience.Fanny Price, the heroine, is a paragon of unyielding virtue, embodying the ideal of early 19th century maidenly womanhood. She is kind, keenly sensitive to others' feelings, and quite intelligent, but modest, indeed self-effacing. She is happy and fulfilled by a life of domestic harmony and predictability, in the splendid but peaceful countryside of rural England. In contrast is Mary Crawford(who befriends a reluctant Fanny), a stylish wealthy import to the country from \\"town\\" (London), who is portrayed as having internalized the \\"flaws\\" of modern style and tastes, and who is the queen of ironic wit and self satisfaction.On the male side of the aisle are country cousin Edmund, the second son of Lord Bertram (Fanny's benefactor) destined to be a country parson, vs. his father's annointed heir, his dissolute older brother Thomas, and Mary's brother, the enigmatic charming Henry. Edmund is the male parallel to Fanny, though unlike her, he's born among the rich and privileged.One must of course now ask why Austen goes to the trouble of setting up a lovely choreography of these contrasting characters--their meeting, \\"playing\\" together, falling in love, competing, clashing, and ultimately settling into their adult fates. Well, there are many lessons to be conveyed, mostly moral.That this moral edification of the reader is done in a way that is sufferable, is to my jaded mind a real feat. I attribute this to the genius of Jane Austen's beautiful prose, alternately satirical vs. romantic, (itself a feat of writing), and to the subtlety with which the morals are driven home. The \\"lessons\\" themselves, (e.g. that privilege confers a huge but by no means decisive advantage in the pursuit of happiness, and how character and fate combine to determine the result), are conveyed via the brilliant choreography of her plot, which marches with that rare blend of inexorability and suspense, that is in my view Austen's greatest claim to greatness."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"A very enjoyable listen. It was well read, well recorded, the reader has a great voice. It listened like the book read - that is it was very hard to \\"put it down\\". I highly recommend this product."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Give Jane Austen credit for not recycling heroines: Fanny Price, the shy, wallflower-ish protagonist of \\"Mansfield Park,\\" is the complete opposite of her counterpart, the outgoing and self-confident Emma Woodhouse, in Austen's later novel. Given her innocence and purity, it is not difficult to guess from the outset that, no matter what obstacles are thrust in her way, Fanny will ultimately triumph and enjoy the Austenian reward for personal virtue, a blissful marriage.Fanny, a little girl from a poor family, is invited to live with her wealthy uncle and aunt, the Bertrams, and grow up with her cousins at their estate which gives the novel its title. Her reticence and plainness immediately alienate her from her socially active and radiant cousins Maria and Julia, and she shows no special mental aptitude, as her other aunt, Mrs. Norris, a parson's widow who now lives at Mansfield Park, smugly notices. Fortunately, her cousin Edmund, who is studying to be a clergyman, is sympathetic to her and tries to make her feel like one of the family.A brother and sister, Henry and Mary Crawford, enter and catalyze the plot as they quickly befriend the Bertrams. Cheerful, carefree, and irresponsible, Henry flirts egregiously with the Bertram girls, even though Maria is engaged to marry a rich young man named Rushworth. Mary, a talented harpist, is far from angelic--she is tactless, irreverent, scheming, and selfish, but she wears it all with a bright smile. Deriding the presence of a chapel in a private home, she is sternly reproached by Edmund, to whom she has taken a liking and of whose vocational goal she was previously unaware; whereupon she pressures him to pursue instead the more lucrative and prestigious profession of law.After a ball in which Fanny sheds her ugly duckling feathers for those of a graceful swan, Henry casts his attention towards her and professes his love; but she spurns him, finding their personalities incompatible. She feels some guilt over this because Henry has helped her brother William get a promotion in the Navy; and her uncle Sir Thomas, stunned by her refusal and believing that Henry would make an honorable and desirable husband, tries to persuade her to accept. The persistence of an unwanted suitor--a motif that recurs in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Emma\\"--must have struck Austen as an amusingly dire predicament for a young lady.The novel has an interesting antagonist in the form of Mrs. Norris, who thinks of Fanny as the redheaded stepchild in the otherwise beautiful Bertram household. The humor in this situation is that everybody (except Fanny, who won't defend herself) is apparently oblivious to this woman's insidiousness, which allows her to go about spreading her sourness at will without fear of reproof. Every time she opens her mouth, it is to disparage Fanny with some surreptitiously hurtful remark that backhandedly praises her pretty cousins. One gets the sense that Austen was projecting somebody she particularly disliked into the character of Mrs. Norris.Like Austen's other major novels, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is a grandly designed drama about the interrelationship of love, marriage, money, and society in nineteenth-century England, in this case with a likeable heroine who doesn't try to be cute and is perhaps a little too passive for her own good. All the other Austen elements are in place, including her patented sarcasm and the happy ending which she justifies by \\"let[ting] other pens dwell on guilt and misery,\\" but regardless of predictability her expertise in constructing monumental fictions cannot be denied."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"All of Jane's books are excellent but few show the moral \\"right\\" as strongly as this and Northanger Abbey. I love all of her books."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I am reviewing the Kindle edition of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, created from the World's Classics edition published by Oxford University Press. Although there are editions of this work and collected editions of all of Austen's novels available for low prices or even for free, I highly recommend spending the few dollars to get this World's Classics edition, which was $4.28 when I purchased it. First of all, you get a carefully edited and accurate text, prepared by Oxford University Press, which has been publishing Jane Austen for longer than most publishers have been in existence. Within the text, there are footnotes, easily clickable on any touch-screen Kindle, giving background information on elements possibly unfamiliar to the modern reader, such as conveyances; it does add to the book's value to know the difference between a barouche and a curricle, for example. There are notes on occupations, landscaping, theater, and many other elements. There is a substantial introduction, exploring the creation of this novel and interpreting some of its themes. You also get an appendix of essays on rank and social status, dancing, and \\"Austen and the navy\\". In sum, if you are interested in this work, pay a few dollars and get a well-prepared edition.As for the work itself, I very much like all six of Jane Austen's novels, but I think Mansfield Park is especially fine. She has a firm grasp of her characters and the way they interact with one another, as well as a marvelous and detailed picture of all of the different locales where things take place. There are scene after scene, and even line after line, which are as memorable as the wonderful parts of the better-known novels (Pride and Prejudice, Emma, and Sense and Sensibility). All of her novels are wonderful, but I feel this is a work of her maturity, by which I mean at the peak of her powers.

Of them all, only righteous Cousin Edmund has any idea of her loneliness amidst the splendours of Mansfield Park and he sets out to befriend her. His kindness has the inevitable result and Fanny grows evermore attached to him as she grows into her subservient position in the household.As she reached young adulthood, Sir Thomas is called over to the West Indies to investigate problems on the plantation which is the source of the family's riches and at this point Dr and Mrs Grantley (the clergyman who has the local living) introduce Mrs Grantley's sister and brother to the neighbourhood. Mary and Henry Crawford are irreverent, socially sophisticated and captivatingly good company. Edmund falls in love with the unsuitable Mary and Henry causes havoc with the hearts of the Bertram sisters, Julia and Maria. Fanny watches with a stern and judgemental eye.This is a wonderful book - full of grotesques : the horrid, mean, bullying Aunt Norris, Lady Bertram who never has the energy to move off her sofa or Sir Thomas Bertram, full of rectitude but unable to see how his parenting is stunting the growth of his daughters.We see more of the dark side of early nineteenth century life than is usual in Jane Austen's novels - Sir Thomas's association with the slave trade, the shocking poverty of Fanny's family in Portsmouth (her description of the milk which is served there (\\"motes floating in blue liquid\\") seems to sum up the whole ill-managed and depressing household or the seaman who is brutally whipped on one of William Price's ships.Fanny may not be a heroine the reader can fall in love with but she is the heroine of a multi-layered book which can be read again and again."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"It was very good but it's not as charming or engaging as Pride and Predujice., but a very good read especially for someone like me that is starting to read in english (it's my second language) as a way to improve it."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Well, it's not as popular as Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but it's still a jolly good read. Fanny is a rather insipid heroine, that's for sure, but all the nice little bitchy social details give a great insight into ordinary (if upper class) English life of the time. These well-observed and honestly recorded details are what takes Jane Austen in general out of the realm of silly women's romances into that of books of lasting interest and widespread acclaim.This might be my 8th or 9th reading of this book - can't be quite sure, but I have loved it since I first read it as a teenager, and I get something a little bit different every time I read it."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Austen's prose is never less than excellent, but, as a story meant to engage, Mansfield Park falls short. Fanny Price is at the center of an intrigue about family, class, money and marriage that strives to teach us a lesson about the importance of character. There is a Cinderella plot, wherein Fanny is the neglected and often maligned niece living among wealthier and more socially prominent relatives. Her female cousins, Maria and Julia, and her dreaded Aunt Norris, are particularly unloving. As Fanny matures in this environment, she becomes extremely attached to her cousin Edmund, who, in showing a modicum of kindness to Fanny, wins her undying devotion. Edmund, who, as second son, is headed for the clergy, acts as a brother/moral mentor to Fanny. The two of them must become an ethical bulwark against the many evils that begin to swirl around the family with the arrival in Mansfield of the questionable Crawford siblings, Mary and Henry, at the same time that the family patriarch, the only hope for a general guidance towards good behavior, is called away on business. As long as it takes Austen to set up this scenario, the novel does have promise at this point.I won't detail the rest of the plot, as many other reviewers have already done, but I will note that the promise of interest embodied by the ill-fated play and the intrigue-laden trip to Sotherton are never really delivered upon. What eventually drags the novel down is the attenuated beating taken by both Fanny and reader, before we are mercifully led to the (somewhat obvious) conclusion of the story. Fanny's morality seems to be tightly bound up with being humorless, tearful, miserable, physically and verbally weak, and basically a martyr. For the herione, duty and familial love trump all else, and any shortfall of her ideal is viewed with shock and horror. The immorality of the villains, on the other hand, is associated with wit, playfulness, sexual attractions, and fun, as well as the usual avarice and deception. The sheer dogged, unrelenting goodness, of Fanny especially, starts to feel like a prison, from which others' soulless frolicking looks quite enjoyable. Fanny and Edmund are punished for their stronger characters throughout, until about the last fifty pages of the novel, when all is turned around a bit too quickly, and goodness is rewarded while badness is banished. But the rewards, such as they are, are so perfunctory and late-coming, that they hardly seem worth it."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards. For Jane Austen, that book was \\"Mansfield Park\\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?The biggest problem with \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \\"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.\\"Mansfield Park\\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"First of all, the heroine's name is Fanny. I'm sorry but I can't get past the name. I know it was probably a very popular & fashionable name back when the book was published but for me, names are very important, & this is a horrible one.Other than her name, I like Fanny. She is very quiet & kind, despite being treated exactly like the unwanted relation that she was. She has an enormous amount of patience to put up with all the idiocy that surrounds her. She always does what she believes to be right even when it seems like the whole world is trying to push her in the opposite direction.Fanny has two love interests. Her first love is her cousin that she's grown up with, almost as brother & sister, which makes it even more weird to our modern world. But I suppose it's not so unusual for their time & it's understandable since she probably didn't know that many young men & no one was as kind to her as Edmund was. He was basically her only friend.Her second love interest is the charming Henry Crawford, a new neighbor to Mansfield Park. He & his sister have moved to the country from London. They are everything that is fashionable & turn the Bertram family upsidedown. At first he does not really like Fanny, she is just something to help him pass the time while his sister flirts with Edmund. He notices how quiet & reserved she is & his first goal is to make her attach herself to him. As he persists & gets to know her, he actually starts to genuinely care for her (as genuinely as a man like him can care, anyway).Will Fanny hold on to her love for Edmund or will she fall for the charms of Henry. Will Edmund continue to be blinded by Mary Crawford's beauty & wit? You'll have to read the book to find out...or, I suppose, you could watch one of the films.This story is somewhat different than Austen's other books. Most Austen fans will say that this is not their favorite & I agree. I do still enjoy it, though, & have read it several times because I just can't get enough of her storytelling."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"In a popularity poll of Jane Austen's six major novels, Mansfield Park may come close to the bottom, but what a distinction that is in comparison to the rest of classic literature! Even though many find fault with its hero and heroine, its love story (or more accurately the lack of one), its dark subtext of abuse, neglect and oppression, and its overly moralistic tone, it is still Jane Austen; with her beautiful language, witty social observations and intriguing plot lines. Given the overruling benefits, I can still place it in my top ten all-time favorite classic books.Considering the difficulty that some readers have understanding Mansfield Park, the added benefit of good supplemental material is an even more important consideration in purchasing the novel. Recently I evaluated several editions of the novel currently in print which you can view here. For readers seeking a medium level of supplemental material, one solid candidate is the new reissue of Oxford World's Classics (2008) which offers a useful combination of topics to expand on the text, place it in context to when it was written, and an insightful introduction by Jane Stabler, a Senior Lecturer in English at the University of Dundee, Scotland and Lord Byron scholar.Understanding all the important nuances and inner-meanings in Mansfield Park can be akin to \`visiting Pemberley', the extensive estate of the wealthy Mr. Darcy in Jane Austen's more famous novel Pride and Prejudice. One is intrigued by its renown but hard pressed to take it all in on short acquaintance. The greatest benefit of the Oxford World's Classics edition to the reader who seeks clarification is Jan Stabler's thirty page introduction which is thoughtfully broken down into six sub categories by theme; The Politics of Home, Actors and Audiences, The Drama of Conscience, Stagecraft and Psychology, Possession, Restoration and Rebellion, and Disorder and Dynamism. Written at a level accessible to the novice and veteran alike, I particularly appreciate this type of thematic format when I am seeking an answer or explanation on one subject and do not have the time to wade through the entire essay at that moment. Her concluding lines seemed to sum up my recent feelings on the novel.\\"The brisk restoration of order at Mansfield Park and healing of the breach between parent and child is underwritten by the same doubt that lingers around the last scene of Shakespeare's King Lear: \`Is this the promis'd end? (v. iii 262). Recreating the urge to defy parental authority while teaching us to sit still, and pitting unruly energy against patient submission to the rule of law, Mansfield Park is an enthralling performance of the competitive forces which governed early nineteenth-century politics, society and art.\\"For me, Mansfield Park is about Jane Austen teaching this unruly child to sit still and enjoy the performance! With patience, I have come to cherish Fanny Price, the most virtuous and under-rated heroine in classic literature! Re-reading the novel and supplemental material was well worth the extra effort, expanding my appreciation of Austen's skills as a story teller and the understanding of the social workings in rural Regency England. I am never disappointed in her delivery of great quips such as\\"But there certainly are not so many men of large fortune in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them.\\" The Narrator, Chapter 1Also included in this edition are four appendixes; the first two on Rank and Social Status and Dancing which are included in all six of the Oxford World's Classics Jane Austen editions and have been previously reviewed, followed by; Lovers' Vows (the theatrical that the young people attempt to produce in the novel), and Austen and the Navy which helps the reader understand Jane Austen's connection to the Royal Navy through her brothers James and Francis and its influence on her writing. The extensive Explanatory Notes to the text help place the novel in context for the modern reader while offering helpful and insightful nuggets of Regency information.Mansfield Park may have the dubious distinction of being Jane Austen's most challenging novel, but I have come to appreciate her characters and plot by better understanding of the subtext through supplemental material and further re-readings of the novel. It is now one of my favorite Austen novels. Readers who hesitate to read Mansfield Park because of the \`bad rap' that it has received over the years are reminded of heroine Fanny Price's excellent observation to the unprincipled character Henry Crawford, \\"We have all a better guide in ourselves, if we would attend to it, than any other person can be\\". The Oxford World's Classics Mansfield Park is certainly a fine edition to help you discover your own better inner-guide to the novel!Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Don't get me wrong- I love Jane Austen.

The country house, the park, the fireside, the ballroom - within the confines of these what a universe of emotions, of meaningful gestures and movements she creates. As well as being a master of language, here Jane Austen displays her mastery of the art of the novel; she teases the reader along one path, only to startle him in the end with an another. This novel confirms view I have long held : There may be novelists greater than Austen, but none so perfect."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"It's hard to review this book in the way that I prefer to: subjectively and unselfconsciously. I don't want to be particularly conscious of the fact that I'll be reviewing a book while I'm reading it - the reading should be for its own sake. Moreover since I'm not writing under any commission or compunction I should be unconcerned about reactions. I don't have the time for lots of rewrites, and if most of the point of the exercise is personal pleasure it's absurd if I'm writing as a chore.However ... I can't shake the knowledge of approaching Austen as part of the canon of English Literature. Her sacrosanct words have been praised and pored over unreservedly for centuries and her fans are legion (a sister of mine could virtually site you chapter and verse of any sentence you read her). Offering an opinion of anything she's written places you in the sights of a whole genre - as opposed to, say, mentioning that you didn't enjoy the last Clancy thriller. It's like that old line about responding to a da Vinci: it's not the painting that's being judged.So with all that baggage, onto the review.It was refreshing to spend some time in a book so different to most others I read. Once you've got your 19th century language \`sea-legs' (something that generally settles after a few chapters) the novelty is no longer an obstacle to enjoyment - quite the opposite. Moreover the structure of the book felt different: Austen has no problem having major characters suddenly virtually disappear, as with the Miss Bertrams. Also there's the usual pleasure of stepping outside the assumed values of your own century - there's nothing that quite highlights your own assumptions as reading those contrary ones of different times.That being said, this book is quite didactic, stiflingly so in the first half where I was growing weary of the sheer volume of gratification I was supposed to gather by the constant belabouring of Mrs Norris' abundant shortcomings - or rather of her single, if major, shortcoming. I wasn't at all clear on whether we were meant to wryly smile at (the now unfortunately named) Fanny's nave blanket moral condemnations of just about everyone except Edmund, or rather to similarly look down upon the characters with the assured condescension of the author herself. Did Austen so blithely judge, rank and dismiss those of her own acquaintance with the regal arrogance she did with these fictional characters? The right way to interact with society it appears is to almost instantly decide the quality of the character of the person you meet, and to not be swayed from your initial assessment: Fanny's severe and almost universal moral condemnations are utterly vindicated at the novel's unambiguous conclusion.I suppose I found the ubiquitous censure uncomfortable: Wodehouse could poke fun at languid, self-indulgent aristocrats without requiring our contempt. To relish this Austen I feel you have to relish your smug superiority over most everyone.Yeah, I suppose it's the smugness that dilutes the pleasure of this highly developed morality tale. Along the way we get an ably narrated window on two lifestyles of the early 19th Century. For all of Austen's theme that virtue overrides wealth (and, indeed, that wealth and indolence are a great danger for the young), class is massive: probably the first thing you need to know about a person, even before you know their character, is what they're worth. Have we changed all that much since then? I suspect so: at least now it's somewhat bad form to inquire about and discuss the relative incomes of your friends and acquaintances - here it's the very first thing that must be established.Interesting to have as your heroine a shy, relatively inarticulate girl whose only assets are her high moral standards and personal integrity (oh, and she looks OK - but by no means the belle). Others fall by the wayside who show much greater sparkle, wit, verve, passion, good humour, talent, beauty or wealth. Austen really hammers home the condemnation of shallow worldliness, the nominalism that plays at virtue as merely an aspect of social point scoring. That being said, there's no room for Scarlet Letter development of personality or awareness of hypocrisy: you make one mistake of a publicly sexual nature and you are rightly tagged for life; you maintain your marriage - on whatever terms - and you're essentially OK.The conclusion of the novel felt pretty sudden, and I was surprised, along with the rest of the characters, to find that young uncompromising Fanny was right to dismiss the charming Mr Crawford all along (always an actor). It's a fairy tale for good girls, and she gets her man, despite all circumstances and the fact that she never had the pride to seriously hope for him. Holier-than-thou squares are more commonly a target for fiction, even if, as in other Austens, they may only be affectionately pilloried. Here we don't get to smirk at her unconscious jealousy of Miss Crawford: when it came down to it, Edmund was being a fool after all.I did love the single sentence where Austen pops in personally, as authors were far more prone to do back then:\\"Let other pens dwell on guilt an misery. I quit such odious subjects as soon as I can, impatient to restore everybody, not greatly in fault themselves, to tolerable comfort, and to have done with the rest.\\"It's like your little DVD extra, where the author explains their approach. Not to be overused, likewise I liked Lodge popping in just for a few words in 'How Far Can You Go'.So, an interesting and non-formulaic read, but without a lot of the humour and wit that established Austen's popularity. Austen herself said of it:\\"I hope on the credit of P. & P. [it] will sell well, tho' not half so entertaining.\\"My sister tells me that it's not the Austen she'd recommend anyone start with."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"\\"Mansfield Park\\" is a great book, and no one reviewing here has claimed otherwise. (Well, there are a few exceptions, but they're better left unmentioned.) But there has been a great clamor over the quality of its protagonist, Fanny Price. One camp has her a valiant heroine full of moral rectitude and therefore admirable. The other paints Fanny as prig, passive and odious.I fall into the latter camp.There are several common defensive positions taken no behalf of Fanny Price (who, I dare say, is used to having people do all the fighting for her). I've taken these positions and constructed rebuttals to them:1) \\"Fanny had to be passive. She was penniless, without strong family connections, and living in a precarious position at the mercy of her guardian, Sir Thomas.\\"The novelist is god of her creation. Austen created Sir Thomas and Mansfield Park, took Fanny's father and turned him into a drunk, her mother into a slattern, leaving her at the mercy of the world. Fanny's passivity and helpless situation was manufactured by the author. It did not have to be so, as evidenced by Austen's other books.2) \\"Fanny's morals are virtuous and to be admired, not to be discredited. She was a strong character, as evidenced by her staying true to her principles.\\"What are Fanny's principles? She talks bad about no one, unless someone she likes talks bad about them first. She does not laugh, speak on her own behalf, or like to be the center of attention. She is content with small things. She dislikes flirting. Basically, she disdains action, which she considers pushy and rude. And, indeed, she exhibited a constant stream of passivity throughout the book.First, there's a literary reason why passivity fails to hold the reader. Action reveals character. A character's thoughts and speech are unreliable. It's only in the crucible of conflict we see what a character is made of - we see her make a decision and act on it. Fanny doesn't act. Or rather, her action is not to act. In literature, passivity creates a gap between a reader and a character. We don't care as much.Then there's a socio-political reason, too. In a society where women could not hold office, vote, or own property, women were at the mercy of men. The Taliban would feel right at home in 1810s England, surrounded by women swaddled under petticoats and dresses, who had no rights of citizenship. Women were expected to be demure, passive, and pretty, like baubles. It is no wonder that modern-day sensibilities object to Fanny, who embodies that time's feminine ideal. Nowadays women can survive on their own. Who would want to go back? Fanny is in this light an ugly reminder of how things could be and, in some places, still are.Most importantly, Fanny's passivity bogs down the narrative itself. The ending of \\"Mansfield Park\\" relies on a series of serendipitous events, none of which Fanny drives herself. First, Sir Thomas is a decent, moral character, and eventually recognizes Fanny's value, but only after a family crisis. Edmund, Fanny's love, almost marries her rival, Mary Crawford, but decides not to only after Mary botches a five-minute conversation. And none of these things happen if Sir Thomas' eldest daughter never abandons her husband on an adulterous fling. Think of the string of events that take place to create the ending! If only one of these events or characters are different, Fanny's in deep trouble! If Sir Thomas had the character of Mrs. Norris, Fanny would be on the street in no time. And while Austen constructed her book to ensure Fanny's happiness, she jumps the plot through so many flaming hoops that the end feels lame and forced.3) \\"We must judge Fanny's morals in proper perspective; that is, from 1819, when Jane Austen wrote 'Mansfield Park.'\\"A difficult statement that makes us question that very way we read. Should we bring our modern sensibilities to a reading of a book written almost 300 years ago? Should interpretation be based on our personal experience of the text? Yech and double yech.But fortunately, Austen wrote other books, and we can judge her characters' morality not with our modern-day morals, but against her own.And Fanny Price comes through like a prig.One neat thing (among many) about Austen's books is the struggle in her women between security versus spirit. (Security to Austen means money.) Which only makes sense if we imagine how uncomfortable 1810s England was for a woman of Austen's intellect and profession, a woman who no doubt wrote novels desite its impropriety.In \\"Persuasion,\\" for example, this conflict is embodied in Anne Elliot, who loves a man her social circle disapproves of. She turned down his first marriage proposal on the advice of a family friend, but spends her life regretting the decision. And that's what the novel is about. Regret for not marrying Wentworth, for not loving, and for choosing convention over emotion. Now this is a conflict we understand. Who among us has no regrets?In \\"Mansfield Park,\\" convention and emotion agree. Which is pretty easy, actually, because Fanny exhibits so little of the latter. Fanny is spiritless. She passively watches the outcome of her life unfold before her. She does nothing to aid events along. She never laughs, jokes, or exhibits joy. I can only think that Fanny Price would be the object of disdain and pity by the other Austen heroines. And has anyone realized that Fanny resembles her aunt, Mrs. Norris? Can anyone doubt that after 30 years married to a parson, Fanny, too, will be sanctimonious and self-righteous?Love Fanny or hate her, \\"Mansfield Park\\" still earns 5 stars."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"It's rare when the film version triumphs over the novel original; however, that's the case with Jane Austen's \\"Mansfield Park.\\" Unlike the clever Elizabeth Bennett of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" or the lovely and lively Emma, Fanny Price is moralizing and priggish to a fault. Even Austen's own mother declared Fanny \\"insipid\\"! I love the other novels, even the underrated \\"Lady Susan,\\" but I could not finish this one.Instead of reading the novel, enjoy the 1999 film version:Mansfield Park (1999). Frances O'Connor creates a spunky, witty version of Fanny Price that deviates from the novel and is all the better for it."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This is my least favorite of Jane Austen's novels. I am glad that I read it of course and I would be tempted to pick it up someday again and see if I think differently of it. It's strange because you never fully connect or actually like the heroine. It's the only book I've ever read where I was hoping the main male character ended up with the heroine's competition! Likeable book, unlikeable heroine would be my way of summing it up."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Ok, Austen is a good writer, and her creation of some of the characters, especially Mrs. Norris, is superb, but I must say I found Fanny totally unrealistic and therefore unrewarding. Austen's attempts to make Fanny seem more human, for example through showing her jealousy of Mary Crawford, were too few and far between and could not dispel the strong image of her, as an unbelievable, pathetic creature, given at the beginning of the novel.The story is slow to progress and I was not satisfied with the out-come at all. Is everyone completely blind to the fact that Edmund is Fanny's cousin? I gave it such a generous mark because of the expert way Austen manipulates her words."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"During the long winter of 2009-10 I found a haven.Rereading all of Jane Austen ,after the Bush appointed presidencyI reread the Rings trilogy,instead of drugs or etc. a good book can always instill hope to fight another day.Now my fellow readers what can we read while our knights slay the bankers and finanical wizards?"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I'm so upset with this book. The entire novel read much too slowly despite the fact that all these things were occuring. The author would take up an entire chapter just to say how Fanny did ONE thing, it was frustrating. Then to top it off the climax, falling point, and resolution literally all happened in the span of the last paragraph of the book as if it was a side note or something. Nonetheless, I did enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Since Edward Said wrote his foolish piece on Mansfield Park it has become de rigeur to attach agendas that reflect the intramural (ie bogus) leftism of the academy to novels (sorry texts) Even so this effort to do so in Mansfield Park is particularly outlandish. In fact the question \\"What is Mansfield Park about\\" is less interesting than the question \\"what is it like to read Mansfield Park\\" To answer that question one has to explore the LANGUAGE of the novel and see where it leads. The plot of Mansfield Park is off-putting--the verbal architecture of the novel is unsurpassed. Trust me--delight in the language, the layers of irony in a sentence or scene. Ignore current opinion which is both intellectually lazy as well as dishonest. Jane Austen made her feelings clear about the slave trade in EMMA. That A \\"political\\" intereprative industry should have grown up about this book testifies to the reigning stupidities of English Studies-- well an English Professor has got to make a living.Since writing the first part of this review I have revised my opinion. I had ignored the Book's title--Lord Mansfield--to whom the title surely must refer takes us to the famous Somerset case 0f 1772 (a land mark decision about slavery) and indirectly to the Gordon riots.I still believe Said overextends himself but I now think Slavery is a concern of this novel.Austen was a great admirer of the abolitionist Thomas Clarkson as her letters tell us. Austen's concerns were wide ranging but she is no pamphleteer--it was a mistake on my part to neglect the range and depth of her perception."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"After reading both Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, Mansfield Park takes on a different persona.Austen introduces a family of three sisters split due to different consequences (wealth) in life.Fanny Price is the eldest daughter of a large family sent to live with her wealthier relations.

On leaving Mansfield to attend business dealings abroad, Sir Thomas\` children Tom,Edmund,Maria and Julia experience many gaities, especially in the form of the neighbouring family.Their frivolity soon ends with the return of their father.Fanny soon finds herself the center of unwanted attention, when the beau of her cousin begins to divert his attentions to her, and unknown to him ,she is in love with her cousin Edmund.This novel delves into the social morals of it\`s time,social morals that still plague us today.

I quit 3 pages before the ending positive that Fanny would never get married.

Her female characters are very well thought out and today's women can associate with their thoughts and feelings."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I first read Mansfield Park as a lit major in the 1970s and hated it. How could anyone who loved Miss Jane's Elizabeth Bennett or Emma Woodhouse find anything to like in dull and virtuous Fanny Price? Recently I saw the book on a Top Ten list by another writer and thought I'd give it another go. Alas, I found the novel just as dreary the second time around, but because I've written nine novels of my own in the meantime, this time I think I know why Mansfield Park is such an outlier. Austen wrote her first three novels -- Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Northanger Abbey -- between the ages of 20 and 24. She wrote her last three novels -- Mansfield Park, Emma, and Persuasion -- between the ages of 39 and 41. Thus, for all intents and purposes, Miss Jane was starting her writing career over with Mansfield Park, and viewed through that prism -- as a first novel -- I realized that many of the novels failings are classic first-novel problems. Fanny's character is so good that she's a bad character for a novel -- we want some human failings in those fictional characters we give our hearts to -- at least one! -- but Fanny has none, which makes her very hard to like. The male character we're supposed to like -- Edmund, her only nice cousin -- is similarly good but dumb enough to overlook Fanny and prefer the racy Mary Crawford until the revelation of her true worldliness, all of which makes him a prig. Failing to offer a likeable character early on is a failing of many first-novel. Plotwise, Mansfield Park has two big problems. The first is the fact that for long stretches, Austen simply tells us what's going on, failing to show us the unfolding scenes so that we can \\"see\\" the story. In addition to telling the story rather than showing the story, Austen takes much too long to set things up -- the back story of Fanny's mother and her sisters and Fanny's early years at Mansfield Park, the introduction of the key secondary characters as they arrive in the neighborhood, and the interminable back-and-forth over staging a play. Everything in the novel that precedes the return of Sir Thomas from Antigua is set-up and it takes too damn long -- another first novel failing. As a result, the second half of Mansfield Park is MUCH better -- another hallmark of first novels. The novel was Austen's first fiction after a fifteen-year hiatus, and it shows. But in a way, she offers us a Fanny 2.0 in Anne Elliot, the main character of her final novel, Persuasion. Like Fanny, Anne is good and much put upon by her relations, but an almost hidden spark of spunk, which enabled her to turn down the suitor who married her younger sister and see through another who is unworthy of of any alliance, makes her a likeable from the start."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"a great book and its greatness is commensurate with its ability to offend (or something pretty much like that) - Lionel TrillingWhat does the book tell us that offends some?For one, traditional authority (in the form of Sir Thomas) is nearly always correct and should be obeyed. It is not perfect and can err, as Sir Thomas did in the upbringing of his daughters. Nethertheless, it demands and should receive respect and even reverence.Two, sincerity, honesty, seriousness, and earnestness are always to be preferred to wit, frivolity, charm, and cleverness. In particular, wit that mocks traditional values and religion is wrong. Somethings are beyond wit. Better to be quiet than to joke about serious topics.Three, self control and restraint are very important. People should not do what is wrong, even if they really want to do it. People should do what is right, even if they don't feel like it and should do it gladly. There is a scene where Julia is trapped in conversation with a rather boring older character. Julia is polite but inwardly impatient. Austen tells us that it is not enough that Julia is outwardly polite. She should restrain her inward impatience because she is doing the right thing.Four, order, method, regularity, and calmness are very important. Disorder, mess, lack of planning are bad. Impetuosity and impulsiveness should be avoided.Five, doing one's duty is very important. Duty comes before almost everything else.Many readers find Fanny to be priggish and intolerant, overly critical of others' conduct, and narrow minded. Such as she is, she is the heroine of the book. Unlike the heroines of Emma and Pride and Prejudice, Fanny does not change from what she is at the start. She is right and others learn to conform to her views. All Fanny needs is more self confidence and less diffidence. Otherwise she is beyond reproach.The book also prizes intelligence, bravery, consideration for others' feelings, honesty, and kindness. Fanny has all these qualities. But what strikes readers is the puritan aspect of her character and that the author, Fanny's creator, approves of it and endorses it.Many have attempted to make this book mean something different from what Austen wrote. They have striven to show that Austen does not like her creation, Fanny, or that Fanny is wrong in this way or that or that the book shows that Austen is a feminist. The book does not show any of these things.The book annoys because Austen is very successful in endorsing a particular world view that is contrary to modern philosophy. Austen succeeds because she is a brilliant writer. Her success in championing what seems to many of us very bad values is irksome.Personally, the book does not bother me. I love its heroine."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Reading this is the perfect way to spend a summer afternoon...so much mystery and intrigue."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Jane Austen describes Mansfield park to have happened in the first two decades of 1800's. The uniqueness in the novel is the fact that Jane remains consistently and continuously truthful to the story. The story is about Fanny Price, the heroine, who happens to be Lord & Lady Bertram's niece. Fanny's parents are on the lower end of the economy, and therefore Fanny gets taken in by her uncle and aunt at the age of 10. Over the years of Fanny's stay at Mansfield Estate, she becomes more open, intellectual, virtuous and graceful. She grows into a beautiful woman who is genuinely liked by everybody. Like any great story, Mansfield Park has a good guy (Edmund & Sir Thomas Bertram), a bad guy (Mrs. Norris), the temptress (Mary Crawford) and the trickster (Henry Crawford).Over the years, Fanny falls in love with Edmund (her first cousin) who reminds her of the comfort she received by her biological brother - William. Whether or not Fanny and Edmund will end up together is the constant question that keeps the novel engaging. In terms of the love complex of the novel, it is more like an open-ended square than a triangle. Henry loves Fanny, who loves Edmund, who loves Mary Crawford. Other than the obvious incestuous implication in Fanny affection towards Edmund and Edmund's obsession w/ Fanny's disposition - the novel is socially very truthful to the materialism of then England. Jane throws in a harsh comparison between Fanny's mother and aunt's households towards the last part of the novel when Fanny returns to her family for a few months. Jane also draws contrasts between Mansfield and London cultures by showing changes in personalities of Mary & Henry Crawford.Fanny practices about Edmund, what Jane says in Emma - \\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more.\\""},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park got better as I read on...The characterizations are typical of Jane Austen: alive, distinct and vivid. Sir Thomas Bertram as Fanny Price's father is vindicated especially when compared to Mr. Price (Mansfield vs. Portsmouth is a part of this distinction). Mrs. Norris's treatment of Fanny is deplorable; her move to the morally banckrupt permanently cements her personality. Fanny herself is not my ideal heroine. Her timidity and repression could use a good dose of Elizabeth Bennet's wit and Emma Woodhouse's confidence.

There is a character who is like that but who lacks integrity, thus sealing her character as no good. But though this book was different I think it was my favorite of hers.

I am an avid Austen fan, and have enjoyed all of her books, except this one. I had two main complaints with this book.One, Fanny Price is the most annoying heroine. She is far too complacent. She accepts the bad treatment she recieves from her cousins and aunts with no complaints. It's as if she feels it is all she deserves! Also annoying is the fact that she is so delicate and ill all of the time. To have such a colourless creature as the central character of a book is a mistake.Second, the ending was horrible. It's as if Austen suddenly realized the book was way too long, and she had a deadline to meet. After torturing the reader for so long, she sums up Edmund and Fanny's relationship in just one chapter!

Not only are the chapters leading up to these scandals dull but when they occur they happen to people who have been so far removed from the plot that one cannot sympathize with them.

Unfortunately, however, I compare Mansfield Park with the rest of Jane Austen's oeuvre, namely P&amp;P, Emma, Persuasion, Sense &amp; Sensibility, etc. Against that kind of competition, Mansfield Park is weak. Fanny Price is an insipid wimp who watches life pass her by. I have always found it hard to believe that the woman who gave us Lizzy Bennet, Emma Woodhouse and Elinor Dashwood could have given us Fanny Price. The former do not suffer fools lightly, and Fanny is a fool who enjoys suffering.I do recommend that people read this, but only AFTER reading Austen's other books because Jane Austen at her weakest is superior to most authors at their best."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This is one of the dullest works by Austen.

I know enough about Jane Austen to know that Fanny Price, this novel's main character, is quite different from other Austen leading ladies. Quiet, shy, introspective, a wallflower exhibiting no real drive, Fanny seems to serve merely as the pair of eyes through which we are to observe the ridiculous happenings at Mansfield Park.Coming from a humbler, living in the seediness of London background, a young Fanny Price is taken under the wing of a well-to-do, better off Aunt, who resides in the country at Mansfield Park. Fanny never really feels at home with this adopted family, and her only real friendship exists with Edmund, her cousin who is studying to enter the seminary. Through the lens that Fanny's muted observations grant us, we discover that this wealthy half of her family- by society's then standards, the better half- we discover that this group of cousins, aunts and uncles, parents and children- essentially do nothing but ride horses, take walks, put on plays, flirt, and eat. In one hilarious conversation, the younger generation is caught putting on a play by the elder statesman when he suddenly returns home from a trip. Apologizing profusely, Edmund, who seems to represents the more rational side of the family, admits that they would have been better off doing nothing, because that is what they are good at.Austen paints a breathing and vibrant picture of this family and despite all their obvious flaws, eventually gets Fanny, and in a way the reader, to feel warmth toward them and their selfish eccentrities. When Fanny eventually gets the chance to return to London and spend time with her own family, who she has not seen in years, their rudeness and roughness turns her off, and makes her long even more for the Mansfield Park to which she never really felt a part.Romance, seductions, deceit, manipulation- the story is filled with enough plot and intrigue to keep the novel breathing apart from its more satirical elements. Without revealing too much, Austen keeps a surprise or two in her back pocket and whips them out towards the end of the book, in a way subverting everything you think she may have been trying to accomplish thus far.Great characters, lots of story, and an ending that illustrates how well thought out every page of this book was. Well deserving of (from what I have been told) the Austen Brand!"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards.

But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are.

Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?The biggest problem with \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \\"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.\\"Mansfield Park\\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Another wonderful novel by Jane Austen containing her penetrating, acute observations about the foibles of human nature."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This may be the best Austen reading I've come across so far. Frances Barber has a lovely voice and she never gets bogged down in the long sentences, navigating them with dexterity and lively rhythm while never allowing them to peter out.

My only criticism is that she takes time to warm up to the author's own voice. Austen's authorial persona is charged with gentle satirical point and Frances Barber sometimes fails to articulate the barbs in the early chapters but as she moves through the novel she becomes more and more responsive to the Austen idiom. In the last half she is nigh on perfect.The novel itself doesn't have the romantic allure of \\"Pride\\" or \\"Sense\\". It's a more sensible, \\"classical\\" work than either of those and may even seem boring by comparison.

Unlike Jane Austens other books this one wasn't very predictable, at least not for me. I wasn't very sure if it would be a happy ending until I finally read the last page. This book is much better written than Jane's earlier works, she develops the characters much more thoroughly. A drawback of this book must be the character of the main character, she is extremely naive, it was rather difficult for me ( as a feminist-like person ) to relate to her.I was also quite a bit disappointed by the last two pages, I thought the book ended quite abrupt.Still I think this is one of Jane Austens best creations. It gave me a nice look into the past."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This is one of the first real &quot;classics&quot; that I read on my own--without having it forced on me by a teacher.

Frances Barber is the perfect narrator. She is a distinguished British theater and TV actress, and a singer. Her accent is lovely and easy for an American to understand.Barber makes the audio book shine. Mansfield Park features many diverse characters. It is impossible to have a totally separate voice for each, but some do have one. Barber's portrayal of Fanny Price, Lady Bertram and Mrs. Norris in particular are masterful. Fanny sounds quiet and timid, Lady Bertram's voice is wispy, vague and unfocused, while Mrs. Norris is loud, annoying and officious. Other characters, lacking a separate accent of their own, are well distinguished by Barber's fine intonation. She conveys emotion very nicely, bringing them alive. This is difficult to do in a book with so very many characters to portray.As to my opinion of the story...Well, in some places, mostly in the beginning, the story drags. Austen could have pared down those boring, drawn out sections without losing the point she is making. One example of this is the extended arguments and discussions about whether to stage a play, what play to perform, and who gets which part.(By the way...\\"Lovers' Vows\\", the play in question, is a REAL play. Austen assumes the reader of MP will be familiar with the play and understand why it is an unsuitable choice for the young people to stage. I was delighted to discover it was real, as no part of the play is actually spoken in MP. The play is available online. One will also wish to investigate what a ha-ha is before reading the book.)Many seem to find Fanny particularly annoying. I would have to agree that she can be so. However, Fanny is like the center of a wheel in this story. The spokes - everyone else - revolve around her and provide the main action. One must judge Fanny by the times and her personal situation. She came from a family where her parents and all but one sibling cared nothing about her, and moved in at 10 years old with her rich relations. There, she again finds but one real friend. Her adoptive family grinds down her already poor self-esteem. One cannot expect her to be like Austin's spunky heroines. Indeed, were that so, she would be thoroughly unbelievable. Fanny is a product of her situation and her own disposition. Any show of strength on her part would have been met with a further and harsher pounding down by the Bertrams. She is an interesting character study, and I for one appreciate her being of a different type than Austen's usual. I don't like to read the same thing over and over.If you are inclined to \\"read\\" this story, this audio set is highly recommended.

As others have mentioned, it is very dark in nature, and not nearly as amusing as some of her more light-hearted novels. I'm not sure what Ms. Austen had in mind when she wrote this book, perhaps it was a social commentary showing what the world could be like if nobody ever took action like Fanny Price, but if you're going to make a social commentary at least be witty about it! \\"Mansfield Park\\" is a very droll read and I had to force myself to finish it which is rare; this more than likely had to do with the fact that I wanted to throttle Fanny for being such a dull, goody-goody priss. How she could possibly be the author's favorite lead character I'll never know because by the end of the book I despised her. If I were Edmund I'd have to take up drinking because my wife was such a bore. Even Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre was more interesting than Fanny and she had a similar disposition in preferring a quieter life, but she was genuinely likable because at least she didn't look down at people and act totally like a nun. I'll openly admit that I don't always see the deeper meaning to a lot of novels, but as far as I'm concerned they are there to be throught-provoking, yes, but also to provide a different world for the reader to slip into. Elizabeth Bennet's world I would have enjoyed immensely, but Fanny Price can keep Mansfield Park and every other boring element about it. I give the novel three stars because I did like the characters of Mary and Henry Crawford who were supposed to be the \\"bad\\" people. Well, forgive me, but as far as I was concerned they were the only ones having anything remotely close to fun and so their souls and mine should righfully be banished to the under world for it. For to have fun is wrong and to be truly happy we must never say a wrong word or think a wrong thought about anyone. At least this is what Fanny Price would have us believe.

Fanny, the book's heroine, is bland and boring in the beginning but becomes increasingly interesting as the book moves along. There are two obvious couples in this book that the reader can cheer for, Henry with Fanny and Mary with Edmund. Just when it seems that Jane Austen would transform Henry from an arrogant gentleman into a thoughtful and sensitive suitor for Fanny (like Mr. Darcy in P&amp;B) and Mary from a money-hungry woman to someone succumbing to the power of love, she drops the bomb on all of us with a scandal that leaves everyone in the end not completely happy. Sure, Fanny eventually marries someone she loves, but do we really want our heroine to marry someone who only thinks of her as a sister and loves her only after another woman breaks his heart? If it's a tragic ending that Jane Austen wants, then make it tragic. If it's supposed to be a happy ending, then please make it all-out happy. This middle-of-the-road kind of happy ending is most unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Its amusing to read all the opinions about good, little Fanny Price. Although many people would love her to be more assertive and lively, thankfully Jane Austen decided it otherwise. Characters just like in reality, come in all shapes and sizes. Like it or not, there are Miss Prices running about the world today- the champions of morals and manners.Fanny is the result of her raising, although shy and complying in temperament, she was taught what became her zealous moral character. Fanny in the end represents the manners and values of the ideal women at the time.In the end though, it doesn't mean that the character itself is likable. I was quite fine with Fanny, although one aspect annoyed me greatly, and that was her delicate constitution. She could only handle horseriding as walking exerted her. What a load of rubbish!In the end though, Mansfield Park is a great book. The characters are engaging, and the storyline is solid.

And how better to do that than on my Kindle?"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"*Mansfield Park* is somewhat quixotic. It is at the same time one of my favorite, and one of my least favorite, books of all time. It is a beautifully-written tale of love, kindness, and strength of character, rising above adversity and winning the day for the heroine. It is also a tale of unspeakable emotional abuse of the heroine by nearly everyone else for some half of the book, and most others for nearly the entire story.The book begins with the tale of three sisters who had a falling-out. Two of them married well enough that the one after her husband's death was still upper-middle class, while the other was quite wealthy. The third sister married a lower-class man whose inability to provide much economically for his new wife, lead to a furious disagreement that never quite heals. Eventually, the poorer sister, Mrs. Price, after having a large number of children, appealed to her sisters desperately for help.The help came in the form of an offer to take one of the daughters into the family of the wealthier sister as a ward. While this may seem ideal to most folks to be removed for near-poverty to opulence, it had a serious drawback for the young girl named Fanny Price. She spent her days either being ignored by most of her relations, or outright abused by others. Particularly, the widowed sister was a bitter woman who clearly hated her other sister still, for her treatment of Fanny is horrendous.And trust me, I really *do* mean *horrendous*. I found myself shocked and angered as I read, though I am aware that these are just literary characters. Shocked and outraged because I know this almost certainly happened in real life to these children. What the wealthy clan, the Bertrams, did for Fanny seems to have been common practice at the time, as probably was the abuse in all too many situations.This is the strength and weakness both of the novel. Jane Austen takes her same skill at wit and satire that she employed to write the bantering romance of Darcy and Lizzie in *Pride and Prejudice*, and uses it to tell a story of triumph over incredible adversity. I found myself simultaneously drawn into the narrative and wanting to put the book down because of how vivid the world of young Fanny was, with all of it's attendant triumphs and horrors, pleasures and abuses.There seems to be a rather large, and quite sickeningly stunning to me, number of people who don't like the character of Fanny, because of her perceived \\"weakness\\". They seem to view the fact that Fanny is not assertive and takes the abuse as evidence of her unlikable \\"wimpiness\\". To be sure, they have *might* have a point, but for the fact that they obviously had not paid attention to the overall narrative of the story.What I mean by this is that it was not just Fanny's more gentle nature that lead to her lack of assertiveness, but her treatment at the hands of her relations, especially the complete monster of an aunt that she had in the abusive Mrs. Norris. She was a girl who knew and was constantly told her place, and she was certainly too scared to cross that line in the sand. She pretty much did what she was told to do, including being treated like the servant of her aunts and daughters, and accepted being told how worthless she was.Despite all of this, however, she had the strength of character to refuse to do anything that may have compromised her principles. She had a clearly developed worldview and sense of right and wrong. This enabled her to make the correct decisions while most of her family made horrible decisions that caused much harm. In the end, Fanny became the apple of her wealthy uncle (Sir Thomas Bertram) and aunt's eye. As well she was the apple of the eye all along of her future husband.For those who wonder, yes I'm being vague. Given the status of the story as a novel of romance and manners, too much more detail may literally give the entire plot away from the start, which I do not wish to do. I do wish to say what is good in this story. And what is bad.To be honest, there is hardly anything bad to be told. The book is hard to read for the sorrow and abuse of the heroine, but that is part of the plot that weaves together a story of ultimate triumph over adversity. The one and only drawback that I can put to the plot is how the heroine has a long tale of tumult and adversity with most of the novel's length dedicated to that, but only a few pages dedicated to her triumph and happiness. Do not get me wrong, I am happy about the ending and it did not disappoint. It was truly and deeply satisfying. I just would have liked a longer ending with more happiness explored. It would have been even *more* satisfying.Nevertheless, the story is a compelling novel that teaches the reader an important lesson. You see, outside strength does not matter as much as inner character. Give the most fearless man or woman who lack a moral core (which I believe they can only obtain if they trust in the Lord Jesus Christ) enough time, and they *will* cause far, *far* more problems than the less stellar (from the outside) acting or appearing man or woman who have strong moral convictions. Me? I trust those of strong character more. For strong character really is the greatest strength of all.Read this book, even if you have to occasionally put it down because of the intense content, as I had to do. You will not regret it. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Re-reading Jane Austen is one of the most rewarding things in life. I thought I knew Mansfield Park, having read it years ago. But the novel surprised and enthralled me all over again.In Mansfield Park, first published in 1814, everyone pretty much gets what he or she deserves. And there's something tremendously satisfying about that.The timid heroine, Fanny Price, is brought to Mansfield Park at age ten to relieve her struggling parents of a mouth to feed. She's destined to be the invisible, insignificant, useful, poor relation living by charity in the grand household of her uncle Sir Thomas Bertram, his wife and their two sons and two daughters.As the lowest and least among them, Fanny becomes a keen observer of human nature. And while her own feelings are constantly getting trampled upon or ignored, she develops tremendous compassion for everyone, even those who despise her.All the wrong people fall in love with each other, and Fanny is no exception. Mansfield Park is a feast of love tangles, power struggles and shocking behavior over money and position.I won't say anything about the plot, except that it's complex and utterly engrossing - or the characters, except that they're a wonderful mix of witty, worldly, nave, infuriating, endearing and absurd.The introduction (best read last) more than fulfilled my desire for scholarly insights. Among other things, June Sturrock draws a compelling parallel between Sir Thomas's domestic tyranny and his slave plantation, uncovers depths of character in Fanny beneath her quiet exterior - and cleverly analyzes the curious prose style of the novel's ending.Whether you're reading this novel for the first time or replacing a tattered old copy, I'd definitely recommend the Broadview edition of Mansfield Park."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I suppose that this being an Austen novel makes what I'm about to write less of a review and more of a \\"here's my thoughts on a classic novel\\" bit.The thing is, I love me some Austen and therefore...I liked Mansfield Park just fine. I liked it the way I liked Emma...that being, I'm glad I read it, I may read it again, but it didn't hold sway with me the way Sense & Sensibility (by far my favorite Austen novel) did.Part of my problem was, I think, that I read the introduction included in my version of the novel before I read the novel itself--and this particular introduction basically revealed the entire plot! Had it not been for reading this, I think I may have liked this novel more because I would have maybe been a bit surprised at the goings-on in the last 100-150 pages. Hence why I thought about giving this novel three stars, but instead gave it four (can't fault Austen because some modern-day person wrote a spoiler-filled intro!)As is, I do feel that the ending of Mansfield Park was a bit of a cop-out. I have to admit that I wish this particular Austen novel had taken a different road. At the risk of putting a spoiler out there for anyone who hasn't read this novel or seen the movies based on it--I really was hoping that in this case, a rake wasn't always a rake and that for once Austen would go a different way with some of her characters.

But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times.

However, I am liking it more and more. If you are inclined to try for greater appreciation, I suggest reading Richard Jenkyns' A Fine Brush on Ivory.A Fine Brush on Ivory: An Appreciation of Jane AustenBut enough of that. This edition is lovely, small and beautifully made. It is easy to carry with you and comes with its own ribbon book mark. The red cloth binding makes it difficult to decide whether to remove the dust jacket or not. The edges of the lightweight pages are gilded. Very nice! My only complaint is that the chapters are numbered continuously instead of preserving the distinct volumes and the chapter numbering within each volume. But then, this is the modern way."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park has been called Jane Austen's most controversial novel. Modern readers may wonder what in the world could possibly be controversial about what some people call Austen's most boring novel. The Bertram's family slavery based fortune caused a bit of a sensation when the novel was first published. Other than the reference to slavery, Mansfield Park is most Austen readers least favorite novel due to the timid disposition of the book's main protagonist, Fanny Price.When Fanny was only ten years old, her aunt, Lady Bertram, decided to help her destitute sister who had the misfortune to fall in love with a lowly sailor with no fortune, by taking in one of her many children. The idea of removing Fanny from Portsmouth to Mansfield came not from Lady Bertram, but from her meddlesome sister, Mrs Norris, who is probably the most annoying character in this book. Fanny is brought to Mansfield under the suggestion of Mrs Norris, who believed removing the child from the oppressive conditions of her family, would bring her advantages her family could never possibly provide. Mrs Norris, however, takes every opportunity to humiliate Fanny. Her presence becomes a constant reminder to Fanny that she is not an equal to her spoiled cousins, Maria and Julia.The only person Fanny develops a deep bond with at Mansfield is with her cousin Edmund. As a child, he consoles her when she is removed from the only home she has ever known, but as they grow into adults, Fanny falls in love with him.Fanny's love for Edmund is dashed with the entrance of Miss Mary Crawford and Mr Henry Crawford. Mary and Henry are the half brother and sister of Mrs Grant, the wife of Mansfield's parson. Maria and Julia are in awe of Mr Crawford good looks and manners. Edmund, however, begins to fall in love with Mary.I did not find this novel as boring as some people, but it did seem that Fanny was hardly noticed by any characters until the middle of the novel. She is just lurking in the background watching her cousins making questionable decisions. Out of all the Mansfield household, Fanny is the only one not completely enraptured by the Crawfords. She realizes Henry's intentions with her cousins are not good, and she knows that Mary is not the person Edmund believes she is.Besides, Mrs Norris, who I found absolutely annoying, Edmund was also not my favorite character. He knows Mary's values are entirely different than his own, yet he persists in hoping Mary will someday accept him. Mary ridicules Edmund's decision to become a clergyman, yet he still hopes they will someday have a future together. Why? I enjoyed the novel, but I did not enjoy the romance between Fanny and Edmund. The ending made it seem like Edmund picked Fanny because he couldn't have who he really wanted the entire novel. Fanny's dream only came true when Mary made it impossible and I do mean impossible for Edmund to make excuses for her. Only in the end did Edmund Bertram realize that the woman he has been seeking all his life has been right under his nose."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I have read all of Jane Austen's novels and while I like Mansfield Park, it's my least favorite. Mansfield Park is more out of line with her others because the heroine is not a spunky, witty girl but rather shy and reserved. But I don't think that was my issue with the book so much as the pace. This is a longer book and is so not because of more action or intrigue but because some of the scenes (like the preparation for a play) drag on and on. Perhaps more frustrating is that while fairly pointless scenes are expanded too much the resolution to the love games is very brief and I wished she'd played up the eventual falling in love more. I would recommend the book but not as an Austen first because I don't think it does justice to her ability."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I just finished this novel after having read Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion. It took me a while to get pulled into this novel because I really was not expecting that much from reading other opinions. Slowly I became absorbed by the personality of Fanny. She was doing an incredible job of turning Fanny gradually toward Henry Crawford and you were starting to like him when all of a sudden it was like she just got tired of the story and decided to contrive an ending. It did not fit into the ending she was developing. Edmund was starting to look like milk toast and Crawford and Fanny's relationship was starting to warm up. I think it was by far her best writing but how disappointing an ending. Someone should rewrite it."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Miss Jane Austen (1775-1817) the spinster daughter of a Church of England clergyman wrote only six novels. Of that number \\"Mansfield Park\\" is not as well known as such hits as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"; \\"Sense and Sensibility\\"; \\"Emma\\" \\"Persuasion\\" and Northanger Abbey.\\" It is, however one of Austen's finest works; a true class of English Regency fiction which will always live in the annals of great literature.Austen's novels all deal with courtship and social mores in small English villages among upper middle class folks. No one ever works! This novel has fascinating characters such as :Fanny Price: The poor daughter of the feckless Mr and Mrs Price (nine children) who live in a chaotic household in the English seaport of Portsmouth. Fanny is farmed out at the age of 10 to Mrs. Price's wealthy sister Mrs.Thomas Bertram who is wed to Sir Thomas Bertram of Mansfield Park. Fanny is the gentlest, most taciturn, socially conservative and physically weakest of Austen's heroines. She is adept at listening and observing the actions of others in her social circle.Mary and Henry Crawford: These two less than admirable siblings stay at their sister Mrs. Grant's home in the Mansfield parsonage. Mary flirts with Edmuind Bertram; Henry courts Maria Bertram but has his eyes on Fanny. They are both somewhat wild and Austen does not like them. These two bring the amorality of London's fast society to the small bucolic world of Mansfield with disaster ensuing.Mrs. Norris-One of the most despicable, self-serving, greedy old harridan's in fiction. Mrs. Norris is the sister of Mrs Price and Betram. She coddles Maria and Julia Betram the spoiled daughters of Sir Thomas; she does not care for Fanny. Mrs. Norris could have come out of the pages of Dickens and is odious and unforgettable!Tom Bertram is the oldest somewhat worthless son of the Bertrams.Julia Bertram falls in love with Mr. Yates who was instrumental in organizing a play at Mansfield while Sir Thomas is away from home. Sir Thomas owns slaves in Antigua. Austen uses the play as a test of character. She disapproves of such frivolity and sees it as an intrusion into the orderly rural life of Mansfield. Fanny is the only character among the young people who opposes it's production.Austen is a subtle writer who uses such ordinary events as card parties, strolls in gardens and quiet conversation to reveal character to the reader. Unlike many great novelist she was a Christian woman who demanded high moral standards in her heroines and heroes. This novel ends well with wedding bells for the good and suitable misery for the evil characters.Austen is not everyone's cup of tea! Her novels are long and there is little overt action. It is true that you often have to skim back over an earlier section to remember who is speaking to whom! Her language is formal but she also relishes a good pun or turn of phrase.Austen is working in a small area of the human story but in that baliwick of young love and romance she stands unsurpassed. Mansfield Park is a novel to savor. The introduction by Tony Tanner is a brilliant piece of literary commentary as he sees the novel as a clash between the order of Mansfield Park and the disorder of modern life exhibited in the disorderly household of Fanny's family in Portsmouth. Austen found virtue in country living; vice in the big city of London. She lived in an age of frivolity under George IV the Prince Regent (1811-182)so her call for moral behavior was a trumpet which needed blowing."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I am a new reader of Jane Austen and after reading the other reviews of this book, I was a little scared to read this one so I saved it for last. I was so surprised how much I liked it. Fanny, the main character, is someone I could relate to in ways that many other readers apparently have not been able to. Unless you grow up in a home where you are made to feel unwanted, and have a Mrs. Norris as an aunt in Fanny's case or a stepmom in my case, it would be hard to understand Fanny. Take it from me,the character is very real in many ways and not the wimp or doormat that many other reviewers find her. Alot of people said this book of Jane Austen's is her deepest because of the social issues she tackles. I will have to read it again to pick up on more of that, I was so busy focusing on Fanny's situation and understanding her feelings, knowing how her situation affected her responses, that I missed things. I look forward to reading it again. I think others will enjoy it too,don't be put off by the other reviewers. Of course, I look forward to rereading all my Jane Austens."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"&quot;Mansfield Park&quot; has always been Jane Austen's most controversial novel.The heroine of the book is Fanny Price, a powerless and socially marginal young woman. To almost everyone she knows, she barely exists. As a child, she is sent to live with the family of her wealthy uncle. Her parents give her up without regret, and her uncle only takes her in because he is deceived into doing so. Fanny's wealthy relations, when they deign to notice her at all, generally do so only to make sure she knows of her inferiority and keeps in her place. Fanny is thus almost completely alone, the only kindness she receives coming from her cousin Edmund. Forced by circumstances to be an observer, Fanny is a faultlessly acute one, as well as the owner of a moral compass that always points true north.Those who dislike &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; almost invariably cite Fanny as the novel's central fault. She is generally accused of being two things: (1) too passive, and (2) too moral.The charge of passivity is perplexing. Surely it is evident that for her to challenge those in power over her is extremely dangerous - in fact, when she finally does challenge them, on a matter of the greatest importance to her and of next to no importance to them, she is swiftly reminded of the weakness of her situation by being deported back to the impoverished family of her parents, who receive her with indifference.The charge of morality is easier to understand - many readers feel themselves being silently accused by Fanny, and they don't like it. The interesting thing is that those same readers often enjoy &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, even though it is evident that the same moral standards are in place in both books. So, why do readers feel the prick of criticism in one and not the other?Part of the answer is that in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; the stakes are higher, which squeezes out the levity of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, can afford to smile at the follies of others - they are not dangerous to her (at least she thinks not - she comes to think differently before the book is over). Fanny, however, can seldom afford to laugh. Vices that are funny in the powerless can be frightening in the powerful. Fanny's vulnerability to the faults of others is clear to her, and she suffers for it throughout &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;.Another part of the answer is that attractions that are combined in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; are split in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;. In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Mr. Darcy is both rich and good; in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, Henry Crawford is only rich. In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Elizabeth Bennet is both witty and good; in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, Fanny Price is only good. Readers who liked &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; because it had a rich man attracted to a witty woman, will either find nothing in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; to engage their enthusiasms, or, as is not uncommon, they will actually find themselves drawn to the book's sometimes-antagonists, the Crawfords.Having dealt with why some people dislike &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, it remains to deal with why other people like it. Its central attraction is the skillful blending of the story of Fanny Price herself, which is the Jane Austen's adaptation of the &quot;Cinderella&quot; archetype, and the story of the other characters, which are of the great Christian themes of fall and redemption.&quot;Cinderella&quot;, is of course the story of hope for the powerless. It has been subject to a certain amount of well-intended misreading in recent decades, but the motive for that misreading really concerns an accident of the eponymous story - the sex of the main character - rather than its real theme, which is universal. &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, for example, shows how easily and successfully the Cinderella archetype can be applied to a male protagonist.Fall and redemption is the other story of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;. At the start, the characters other than Fanny are fallen or falling. Some are so corrupt that we are have no hope for them; their presence is purely malign, endangering those not so badly off as themselves. Others have fallen far, but are not quite so far gone that we do not have hope for them as well as fear of them. Finally, there are those who are only beginning to fall, whose danger is all the more alarming for it.In &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, these stories are not just side by side, they are interwoven. Jane Austen's Cinderella saves not only herself, but also saves - and almost saves - others as well. All but the worst characters in the book are drawn to the goodness in Fanny, even while they yield to the temptations that threaten them. The book has real tension in that we don't know who will make it and who will not. Those who feel sympathy for the Crawfords are not entirely misreading the story - we are not wrong when we sympathize with a drowning man clutching at a rope thrown to him. Where we can go wrong is not when we wish not for the drowning man to be pulled to shore, but when we wish for the person at the other end of the rope to be pulled in after him."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"After having read (and loved) Jane Austen's more famous novels EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, I found MANSFIELD PARK a true delight. Fanny Price is taken in by her wealthy aunt and uncle as charity to her more lowly-married mother, and is raised with her cousins with the idea she needs refinement and education to become as good a woman as her lesser social standing will allow. Fanny is nervous and self-effacing, struggling with her new situation until her cousin Edmund makes her feel more at home. Gradually, she feels like a part of the family, although the nagging sense of unworthiness always asserts itself. As cousins marry and suitors appear, as scandals arise and emotions become known, Fanny finds herself in the equivalent of a Victorian soap opera.Fanny is undoubtedly one of Austen's less assertive characters, although she does mature into a woman who knows what she wants and will accept no less. I loved Fanny and her honesty, the little girl who fears the stars in her eyes and still manages to grow up into a respectable - and respected - woman. Her complexities are subtle and understated, making the reader work at times to understand her motivation, although anyone who has felt like an outcast even once, or anyone who respects honesty, will identify with her. In true Austen fashion, the observations are witty, with pointed social analysis and cynicism dressed up in sly humor. Fanny's aunts in particular are skewered, but no one, not even Fanny, is spared.Readers picking up this novel for the sheer delight of it will find it difficult to put down, as its language is accessible and free-flowing. Students and book club members who must pay closer attention to themes and other literary issues may want to consider the role social standing and money play; the evolution of Fanny's character (and whether she is sympathetic); the techniques Austen uses to evoke humor; and the courtship protocol for Victorian England and how the characters both work within, and violate, the social rules.I highly recommend this book for teenagers and adults alike, especially those whose literary tastes run toward the classics."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Out of all Jane Austen's wonderful novels \\"Mansfield Park\\" is perhaps her most widely-debated. With a heroine who triumphs through her utter passivity, uncomfortable themes of familial power and corruption, and sub-text on slavery, it is rightfully described as \\"Austen's most complex and profound *and* her least likeable novel.\\" As well as this is Austen's own declaration that \\"Mansfield Park\\" was her favourite work. To say it is unique is an understatement.Fanny Price is only a child when she is sent from her impoverished home to live with her aunt at the grand Mansfield Park. A quiet child, Fanny is overwhelmed by her wealthy and privileged family and is painfully homesick - a condition that the Bertrams cannot possibly understand. Hasn't she been removed from a life of near-squalor and no prospects? But the noble-yet-cold Sir Thomas Bertram, his child-like wife Lady Bertram, his self-centred eldest son Tom and his daughters Maria and Julia are not cruel to Fanny in the way that the evil step-family was cruel to Cinderella - simply misguided and so removed from her situation as to not understand the first thing about her. But from her second aunt, the loathsome Mrs Norris, Fanny receives only criticism and thinly-veiled scorn. Only the youngest son Edmund, with ambitions to become a quiet country clergyman, shows genuine compassion and sympathy to her, and soon the cousins are as close as siblings.Fanny grows into a young woman, but keeps her timidity - which hides a bright mind and a clear sense of right and wrong. From London come the glamorous Crawford siblings - the rakish Henry Crawford who shamelessly flirts with Maria, even though she is engaged to one Mr Rushmore, and the witty Mary Crawford, who soon captivates Edmund. This is much to Fanny's heartbreak since she has been secretly in love with Edmund for years, and she cannot help but distrust the dazzling Crawfords.It is not an understatement to say disaster strikes when Mr Crawford proposes to Fanny, as for her the attentions of such a man are utterly unwelcome. Unwelcome suitors are standard fare in Austen's previous novels, such as Mr Collins to Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Elton to Emma Woodhouse, but here the situation takes on a darker tone. Firstly, because Austen's previous uses of this plot-turn are usually played for laughs with the suitor as a comical buffoon, and second because her heroines are well able enough to reject such men. For Fanny however, the experience terrifies her and one can feel her distress and conflict as her family pressure her into marriage against the utter conviction of her heart. Like a bird in a cage, Fanny is completely helpless.Austen is renowned for poking fun at contemporary issues with her ingenious wit, and \\"Mansfield Park\\" is concerned with the disillusions of the upper-class: the belief that superior educations, convenient marriages, good manners and breeding and sparkling wit automatically make a morally good person. As such, whilst the Bertram family live their lives with the complete assumption that they are decent people, Fanny's modesty and self-discipline ensures that her character is superior to each and every one of them. The saying \\"the moment you believe you are a worthy person is the moment you cease to be one\\" caters nicely to Austen's ideal, and her general themes of conservatism, modesty and quiet reflection.All of Austen's heroines are diverse in a central, particular way. For instance, Emma of \\"Emma\\" is the only one removed from the pressure of making a financially secure marriage, whilst Anne of \\"Persuasion\\" is the only one who is at a more mature age than the others. In this way, all of Austen's novels have a unique individual young woman as its protagonist. And so what is Fanny Price's particular trait? You may think that it is her timidity, but more surprising is the fact that Fanny is completely infallible. Throughout the course of the story Fanny's judgement never falters, nor is she ever once proved incorrect. She is a positive angel, and as Edmund says at one point: \\"We have all been more or less to blame... every one of us, excepting Fanny.\\"As well as this, Austen turns her eye onto the topic of family and home-life, in a particularly bittersweet way. Fanny continually suffers from displacement - first at Mansfield Park, and later in the novel when she returns to her family home in Portsmouth to find it is not the idealistic family home she half-remembers. It is a poignant, but too-often true sensation that many contemporary readers may relate to: the return to your childhood home only to find that it isn't really \\"home\\" anymore.In this Penguin Classics edition, Kathyrn Sutherland and Tony Tanner provide excellent Introductions/Appendixes to the work. Even if you usually skip over these sorts of things, I highly recommend taking the time to read them, as Tanner in particular sheds new light over several episodes in the novel: for example the metaphorical connotations in the family's walk through Rushmore's gardens, and the foreshadowing prevalent in what appears to be a simple game of cards.Despite its controversy, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is perhaps my favourite Austen novel (I still haven't read \\"Northanger Abbey\\", so I can't truthfully make that claim yet) and though Fanny is not as spunky or spirited as many readers would like or are used to, it is actually quite refreshing to have a shy and introverted protagonist who wins the game of life; who advocates the real importance of morals and goodness. You don't need to be a strong feminine role-model to be a good person."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I think this is my favorite Jane Austen book so far, although I still have Persuasion and Northanger Abbey to read. Most Austen fans would not count Mansfield Park as a favorite, though, at least from what I've heard. It's not that it's a profoundly different book from the more popular Pride & Prejudice or Sense & Sensibility, but many people seem to dislike the main character, or at least are not as impressed by her, as by P&P;'s Elizabeth Bennet or Emma's Emma Woodhouse. It's true that Fanny Price is a very different heroine than Lizzy or Emma, but her circumstances are profoundly different, too. She doesn't have Lizzy's spunk or Emma's forthrightness, but Lizzy and Emma both have the advantage of being more secure in their surroundings, both financially and emotionally. Fanny has a lot working against her from the start.A generation before Fanny's birth, three sisters chose their paths of marriage: one to a respectable parson, one to a wealthy landowner, and the other to a basically worthless sloth. Fanny had the misfortune to be one of the numerous products of the latter. Her aunt, Mrs. Norris (married to the parson), convinces their other sister, the wealthy Mrs. Bertram, to take Fanny in as a ward. While this sounds like a kindness, it's really only an ego booster for Mrs. Norris. She has no love for Fanny and from the day the poor girl comes to live with the Bertrams at Mansfield Park, she is never allowed to forget that she is the beneficiary of charity and should grovel, beg and prove her gratitude every waking second. Not only are there constant verbal reminders from her aunts, uncle and cousins, but Fanny's status as a poor relation is made clear by her clothing, her rooms, the social functions she's allowed to attend (or not), and even whether or not she has a horse to ride. It's not that anyone is outwardly unkind to Fanny (except Mrs. Norris, at times) per se; she's just a non-entity entirely dependent on the whims of her superior relations, and she's always painfully aware of it.The main event is the arrival of Henry and Mary Crawford, a brother and sister who proceed to turn things topsy-turvy in the circle of families around Mansfield Park with their somewhat laissez-faire, urban view on the rituals of courtship. The bittersweet backdrop to all this entanglement and game-playing is Fanny's genuine, unrequited love for her cousin Edmund, one of the few people who treat her as an equal. Other reviewers have expressed disdain and frustration with Fanny, labeling her a boring, moralistic, judgmental prig, but I didn't feel that way about her at all. I felt she handled herself and her situation the best she could, and the fact that she's a plain, ordinary girl with none of Elizabeth Bennet's wit or Emma Woodhouse's beauty only makes her more human to me. I enjoyed it and will definitely read it again."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"After having read (and loved) Jane Austen's more famous novels EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, I found MANSFIELD PARK a true delight.

Students and book club members who must pay closer attention to themes and other literary issues may want to consider the role social standing and money play; the evolution of Fanny's character (and whether she is sympathetic); the techniques Austen uses to evoke humor; and the courtship protocol for Victorian England and how the characters both work within, and violate, the social rules.I highly recommend this book for teenagers and adults alike, especially those whose literary tastes run toward the classics."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"While this isn't the greatest of Jane Austen's novels and is somewhat light on external action, it is certainly a fine example of characterization, by which I mean that the action takes place inside the heads of the main characters, especially Fanny Price, the heroine. Fanny is 10 years old when she comes to live with her mean-spirited relatives at Mansfield Park, and grows to womanhood in an environment full of condescension and personal challenge. Her story, and her resulting triumph over prejudice and emotional greed, was an inspiration to women when it was written, and continues to be so today.If you are not familiar with Jane Austen's work, don't be put off by the comments of others. Start with one of her more well-known novels, such as Pride and Prejudice or Emma, and then work up to Mansfield Park after you've come to love Austen.If you are one of those women who, like me, devoured Austen's more well-known novels and are now searching for the lesser known work, will enjoy Mansfield Park as well. I give it five stars just for the simple fact that it was written by Austen, arguably one of the greatest writers in the English language, male or female."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"After reading all of her other works beforehand, 'Mansfield Park' struck me, like many readers, as almost told by a different person from the Austen we know. It is darker, much more humourless (the scenes of comedy are much less evenly spread, and even then they are tainted despairingly sarcastic rather than her usual warm irony), and with a very different heroine. It would appear a quieter, if more intelligent version of Harriet Smith from 'Emma' has taken centre stage here--that is, meek little Fanny Price.Don't despair. It's brilliant as always.To begin with, this time Austen's novel contains much more 'action'--what I mean by that is her prose actually describes her characters doing things, even with a touch of ! dramatic climax! to them, something she'd never done before. (Apart from a few scenes of Lydia's wedding in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Austen's novels usually just contain large blocks of dialogue between characters with the occasioanl longer expositional block detailing the passage of time.) The arrival of Sir Thomas, for example, at the end of volume one, is, surprisingly, thrillingly done with no small amount of adrenaline shocked into the reader, knowing what exploits he will catch his children in the middle of.The humour is a sad loss, but then in this novel Austen deals with more 'racy' topics than her usual, which she probably felt deserved even more severe treatment than she would normally dispense to her characters through her razor-sharp tools of irony. The moral quotent, therefore, is much higher than normal--then again Austen never featured a married woman's affair before, did she?The last thing other readers complain about is the lack of any attractive characters in the novel, save Fanny's older brother, William Price (I'd agree there--he was delicious!). Many people dislike and even detest little fanny, after the 'spirited' and 'lively' exploits of Elizabeth Bennet and her kin.Notice how often the word 'lively' is linked to the poisonous Miss Crawford in this novel, and I think you'll see she was trying to make no small point about how dangerous an over-'spirited' girl could get!I don't understand this hate of Fanny. Is it just because she's a disappointment from Eliza? Because she's morally invincible? Because she turns down the dashing hero (Henry Crawford) to marry boring but steadfast old Edmund? I can't find sufficient evidence to hate her in ANY of the above. She's a pleasant, intelligent, charmingly emotional little girl--certainly a pleasant change from that spoiled brat Emma Woodhouse.My concluding statement is this: MP is a very enjoyable novel, if somewhat different from Austen's other works. Even if you come away wishing Fanny Price would drop dead on her pious little head, you should still read it. It's moral lessons are important, it's characters are vital additions to Austen's repetoire, and it reveals a very important shift in Austen's attitude in later life. Read it, please."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I saw a preview about two months ago for an intriguing-looking film called Mansfield Park, later that day I went to the library and saw the book by Jane Austen there on the shelves. I decided I should read the book before I saw the movie, I started the book on a Monday night and through school and choir practice finished it that Thursday. I was enthralled, Austen had captured me as I reader, I loved Fanny's unassuming gentle qualities, she was a complex character, so very different from any other heroine I'd encountered. I have since gone through Austen's other novels and with the exception of Persuasion and Northanger Abbey have found them to be a disappointment after Mansfield Park. I think Mansfield was/is Austen at her finest."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Like all devoted lovers of Jane Austen, I have long pondered why she chose to write this, of all books, at time she was experiencing the intoxicating success of Pride and Prejudice.The protagonist is a loathesome little priss. Austen herself says so in her letters. Fanny Price is neurotic and oversensitive where Austen's other heroines are brash and healthy. Even Austen's own family found the ending as odd and disappointing as do subsequent generations of readers.So there's a puzzle to be solved here. The answer may lie in the fact that this book was written when, after a lifetime of obscurity, Austen found herself, briefly, a huge success. As is so often the case with writers, the success of her earlier book may have given her the courage to decided write about something that REALLY mattered to her--and what that was was her own very complex feelings about the intensely sexual appeal of a morally unworthy person.This topic, the charm of the scoundrel, is one that flirts through all her other books, usually in a side plot. However, the constraints of Austen's day made it impossible for her to write the story of a woman who falls for a scoundrel with a sympathetic viewpoint character.So what I think Austen may have decided to do was to write this story using Edmund--a male--as the sympathetic character who experiences the devastating sexual love of someone unworthy. Then, through a strange slight of hand, she gives us a decoy protagonist--Fanny Price, who if she is anything, is really the judgemental, punishing Joy Defeating inner voice--the inner voice that probably kept Jane from indulging her own very obvious interest in scoundrels in real life!In defense of this theory, consider these points:1. Jane herself loved family theatricals. Fanny's horror of them and of the flirting that took place is the sort of thing she made fun of in others. Jane also loved her cousin, Eliza, a married woman of the scoundrelly type, who flirted outrageously with Jane's brother Henry when Jane was young--very much like Mary Crawford. The fact is, and this bleeds through the book continuously, Austen doesn't at all like Fanny Price!To make it more complex, Fanny's relationship with Henry Crawford is an echo of the Edmund-Mary theme, but Austen makes Henry so appealing that few readers have forgiven Austen for not letting Fanny liven up a little and marry him! No. Austen is trying to make a case for resisting temptation, but in this book she most egregiously fails.2. Austen is famous for never showing us a scene or dialogue which she hadn't personally observed in real life, hence the off-stage proposals in her other books.Does this not make it all the more curious that the final scene between Edmund and Mary Crawford in which he suffers his final disillusionment and realizes the depths of her moral decay comes to us with some very convincing dialogue? Is it possible that Jane lived out just such a scene herself? That she too was forced by her inner knowlege of what was right to turn away from a sexually appealing scoundrel of her own?3. Fanny gets Edmund in the end, but it is a joyless ending for most readers because it is so clear that he is in love with Mary. Can it be that Austen here was suggesting the grim fate that awaits those who do turn away from temptations--a lifetime of listening to that dull, upstanding, morally correct but oh so joyless voice of reason?We'll never know. Cassandra Austen burnt several years' worth of her sister's letters--letters written in the years before she prematurely donned her spinster's cap and gave up all thoughts of finding love herself. Her secrets whatever they were, were kept within the family.But one has to wonder about what was really going on inside the curious teenaged girl who loved Samual Richardson's rape saga and wrote the sexually explicit oddity that comes to us as Lady Susan. Perhaps in Mansfield Park we get a dim echo of the trauma that turned the joyous outrageous rebel who penned Pride and Prejudice in her late teens into the staid, sad woman when she was dying wrote Persuasion--a novel about a recaptured young love.So with that in mind, why not go and have another look at Mansfield Park!"},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Wow. That was the one word that popped into my mind when I put this novel down at its close. There is nothing else to describe it so perfectly. This, after Pride and Prejudice, is my favorite Jane Austen novel. It has a faster pace than her other books and is easier to read without tiring. This book is about a young girl, Fanny Price, who is a poor relation, sent off to live with her wealthy aunt and uncle. Once there, she is befriended by her cousin, Edmund, and falls in love with him. He is her greatest friend and the only one who truely appreciates her. All around her is high society, courtships, heartbreaks, and scandals. Fanny thinks all is lost until the final scandal and the realization by her cousin of what is truelly important to him, and to all. This is a very, very, very enjoyable book, and one of the best ever written."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I must admit that the first half of this book is somewhat slow and at times quite difficult to hold attention to. I understand that the setting, personalities, and situations must be established in the first half. Even so, the story is a gem well worth reading. It has quite a different feel from the other Jane Austen books and the characters stick to your mind as people you will never forget. A few characters are quite tragic yet do not deserve sympathy, which provides an interest in the reader's mind. Fanny Price, the main character of the book, is an admirable and intelligent person whom I would not mind modeling myself after. This is a GREAT book, so don't miss your chance to read it."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Mansfield Park, by Jane Austen (whose death at an early age was a tragedy for literature), was an intriguing window into the life of English families in the late 1700s and early 1800s. The arrogance and pomposity of the land holding families, the invisibility of servants, the status of women, class consciousness, and the self-centeredness of those who didn't have to work for a living all come out in this novel.The story focuses on Fanny, the daughter of a sister who didn't marry as well as another sister. In a fit of compassion (loosely defined), the wealthier sister takes on Fanny as a companion to use and a project to make. Over the next decade, Fanny evolves from a homesick and chronically shy girl into a most balanced character. Surrounding this story are the highs and lows of the other characters, her aunts, uncle, and her cousins and their friends.As a story, Mansfield Park is rather tedious and sleep-inducing. The detail is almost overwhelming. The insight into this period, however, is fascinating. Jane Austin clearly was a very astute observer of the life and times of people around her."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I wanted to love this book - of course I wanted to - I wanted it to have the magic of Austen's other work. Sadly, I was disappointed. It is absolutely not a bad book - just not a phenomenal one as I had expected. The plot and the characters come across as far too didactic and judgmental and perhaps even (gulp) a tad anti-feminist. I'm trying to rethink the book so that I can reach any other conclusion - I'm trying to remember it was a product of its times - yet, I haven't been able to come around yet.Would I recommend this book for you? Are you hoping for another Pride & Prejudice or Sense & Sensibility? Well, then no. Are you looking to enjoy Austen's lavish prose, intricately developed characters, and an accurate depiction of what women realistically could strive for in the early 19th century? Then absolutely, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I became a Jane Austen fan as an adult, never having been required to read her as a student. I'm glad, because I have been able to enjoy her works thoroughly without having to take examinations on them.Although I delight in all the books, my favorite might well be MANSFIELD PARK - the one many other Austen fans love to hate. Yes, Fanny Price is an unlikely heroine. Heroines should be spunky, outspoken, captivating, and confident (though not perfect). Fanny is timid, nervous, self-effacing, unambitious, and well nigh invisible! One might think the heroine really ought to be Mary Crawford, or even Maria Rushworth; they're the ones with all the qualities. Yet they fall short. What does Fanny have that they haven't? That's the point.Human society is a complicated thing, and many factors make a person think, act, and believe the way he or she does. It is said of Fanny's situation from the beginning that \\"nobody meant to be unkind, but nobody put themselves out of their way to secure her comfort.\\" Perhaps precisely because Fanny is not considered highly - because she is given little attention (except from Edmund) and isn't pressured or persuaded into self-importance and desire for \\"success\\" - she is able to be a moral compass for those around her, although not in a repugnant way. Her uncle, Sir Thomas, is hampered by aristocratic tradition; the neighbors, Mary and Henry Crawford, bring with them all the charm, ambition, and moral ambiguity of cosmopolitan values; three of her cousins, trained up for social success by their family status and (in the cases of Maria and Julia) the efforts of their self-serving aunt, are captured by the same sophisticated glitter. Even Edmund, whose sincere desire for a career in the church cuts him out of fashionable living, is misled by the sparkle and shine. Fanny sees things clearly, and though she hasn't the confidence to promote herself or persuade the others, she has the trembling courage not to bend.The characters may not be painted in the colors some readers would like, but they're painted well, with lovely shadings and subtleties. I enjoy Miss Austen's mature writing - the tale flows and the humor in the telling is delightfully subtle and sharp.I also love Juliet Stevenson's performance of this unabridged audio book. She gives wonderful characterizations, from the timid Fanny to the stable but love-struck Edmund to the nearly-wicked Mrs. Norris. The production is done very well and, if you already enjoy MANSFIELD PARK and intend to listen to it quite a few times, is worth the cost."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Jane Austen finished \\"Mansfield Park\\" in 1813, after \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" It is a more complex novel than either of its precedessors or its successors (\\"Emma\\", \\"Persuasion\\", and \\"Northanger Abbey\\"). Its heroine, Fanny Price, is rather the middle child in Austen's sisterhood, often overlooked when compared to her more attractive older sisters or more interesting younger sisters. Still, Fanny Price is worth getting to know.One of a growing brood of children in a lower middle class family in Portsmouth, Fanny is placed for raising with her much wealthier Aunt and Uncle Bertram at Mansfield Park in the English countryside. The ten year-old Fanny is painfully shy, physically sickly, and less educated than her Bertram cousins, who mostly ignore or make subtle fun of her. Her Aunt Norris, responsible for the day-to-day raising of her cousins, thrives on tormenting Fanny. Only her cousin Edmund takes an interest in her. Under his guidance, she begins to catch up to her cousins as she matures into an attractive young woman. Most importantly, she fortifies a strong sense of morality.The prolonged absence of Fanny's Uncle, Sir Thomas Bertram, to tend to his estates in Antigua, leaves the household under the uncertain leadership of Aunt Norris, just as the wealthy Mary and Henry Crawford arrive from London. Mary and Henry are the same age as the older Bertram children, but worldly, manipulative, and less grounded in solid values. Henry flirts shamelessly with Fanny's engaged cousin Maria and trifles with Maria's younger sister Julia, while Mary flaunts her considerable charms at Edmund. The Bertrams are tempted into inappropriate behavior, which only Fanny resists.Sir Thomas re-imposes order upon his return from the Caribbean. Maria is married off to a wealthy if rather stupid neighbor. Edmund courts Mary Crawford, to the distress of Fanny, who has an interes in Edmund and who sees Mary for the shallow manipulator she is. Fanny herself is courted by Henry Crawford, who starts by trifling with her emotions but comes to seek her as a wife. Great pressure is placed on Fanny by Sir Thomas, by Edmund, and by Mary to accept Henry as an advantageous match.The anguished Fanny holds her ground, and is effectively exiled to Portsmouth, where she finds little to love in her vulgar birth family except a promising younger sister. In her absence, the Bertram family falls to pieces in sickness and scandal. Fanny will be summoned back to Mansfield Park, with a final opportunity for personal happiness.As Tony Tanner's excellent introduction makes clear, Fanny is unique among Austen heroines in her invariably good moral sense. Her attraction as a character is based less on the personal growth and maturation we expect in a Austen heroine and more on her perseverence in the face of very attractive temptations and seemingly reasonable pressures. It is Austen's genius to insert complex characters into the subtle relationships between four families in the story. The story provides a fascinating venue for social commentary and compelling domestic drama. The witty and enthusiastic but morally flawed Crawfords, for example, seem more attractive than the shy, vulnerable, and withdrawn Fanny or the understated Edmund.\\"Mansfield Park\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen's romances. Its complex characters and storyline may ultimately be as rewarding to the reader as the more popular novels."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This audiocassette is one of the best books on tape I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Maureen O'Brien just brings every character to life--even Mr. Rushworth, something of a blockheaded cipher in the novel, has a personality all his own! I cherished every word, every turn of phrase, so brilliantly written by Jane Austen, of course, but so delightfully emphasized by the amazing voice, diction and acting ability of Ms. O'Brien. Forgo that horrible movie made of Mansfield Park a couple years ago, and listen to this cassette instead, if you want a dramatic presentation."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"Jane Austen wrote a whole lot of good novels, but Mansfield Park is arguably the greatest. It is darker in tone than the rest of her works. It has a somewhat dark humor to it. The protagonist is put through the emotional wringer (as her protagonists often do, but more so here). There is a depth here that is lacking in works like Emma or Sense and Sensibility. This makes the ending that much more gratifying."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"darker and unromantic as it is. It surpasses all of her other novels because of its depth, and attention given to the psychology of the characters.Among important issues touched upon are religion, slavery (tho' not mentioned directly), incest, adultery, even landscaping. Austen entertained me with Pride and Prejudice, and Northanger Abbey, but has never before impressed me so as in MP. The Norton ed. is the best (Claudia Johnson)and includes many valuable commentaries, related essays, and a copy of &quot;Lovers' Vows&quot; which plays a central part in the book. Be forewarned, however, the heroine is by no means likeable."},{"Title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I find it rather disappointing that people dislike the heroine Fanny for being too weak and sainted. I somehow feel for her shyness, her predicaments and for the moral dilemmas she finds herself in. Let's face it -- not everyone can be an Elizabeth Bennet or an Emma Wodehouse, and it is creditable that Austen decided to make so unprepossessing a girl the heroine of the novel. For all her docility and her weakness, Fanny is an extremely strong character, who is not cowed by peer-pressure into submitting to things that she feels are morally wrong. In fact, for those who care about such things, Fanny is a feminist in her own quiet way. At any rate, the thrust of the novel is primarily moral; to put it rather simplistically, it is country, religious values versus the decadent, immoral city (i.e. London) values.Of course, any book by Jane Austen is incomplete without her trademark irony and wit. It is all there in this book, just a little subdued.My all time favourite character in this book has to be Mrs. Norris -- she's really a nasty, hateful woman and is superly portrayed."},{"Title":"Microsoft Publisher 2003 Training Quick Start Cards - 6 Total Pages (Microsoft Office 2003 Quick Reference Cards)","review":"MS-ACCESS 2003 Quick Reference Card - All Good!

Candy Christian, a beautiful girl who just happened to be born on Valentine's Day, writes a paper on Contemporary Human Love for her instructor, Professor Mephesto, saying that \\"to give of oneself--fully--is not merely a duty prescribed by an outmoded superstition, it is a beautiful and thrilling privilege.\\"And things go really cockeyed from there. A tryst with Manuel, the Mexican gardener, in full application of her paper, leads to the hospitalization of her father, and her voyage into the wide, weird, world. It isn't that she's missing much. Her father's a stodgy conservative businessman, her aunt Livia is a vulgar hussy who uses sexual innuendos as regularly as one blinks. However, her adventures lead her into meeting people who want nothing more than to rip the wrapper off and have a bite of that... candy. Oops! Candy, I mean. Others downright hate her. The poor girl has the best of intentions and doesn't want to rock the boat for the sake of preserving her credo, and hence lets them take advantage of her without knowing that they are.Written as it was in 1958, I can see how it shocked America and Europe. Dr. Krankeit's assertion that self-gratification is actually healthy is a message to the repressed people of the world: \\"This mechanism you've contrived to keep your sexual lust a secret from the world, and from you yourself, is causing you more trouble than you realize.\\" It makes sense--keep something bottled or under pressure for too long and KA-BLAM!! Of course, involving another party complicates things, because consent is becomes issue. But is it healthy and okay to look at adult magazines, videos, or computer CD-ROMs? Heck yeah!Southern's writing is brash, profanely funny, and will cause cause conservatives hairs to stand on end even today, but his choice of words, be they adjectives, nouns, and slang, in describing sexual things is creative to say the least. It's what keeps this book afloat. What also helps Candy is the hapless but lovable title character-face it, there's only one decent character in this book other than her--and I can't help but roll my eyes at her gullibility. But I also feel attached to my heroine too."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"Southern's tour-de-force follows the innocent, beautifulCandy Christian as she runs sexually afoul of a whole bunchof scheming, horny men.

Southern and MasonHoffenburg, an American poet, admitted that they had writtenthe book primarily to make money, since churn-'em-uppornography was what Olympia Press chef Maurice Girodias waspaying for. Of course, the book became so much more than acutesy best-seller: it was the satire of the century, throwingwide-eyed, white-skinned Miss America into a den of thegreat bugaboos of the time (including a Jewish doctor, ahunchback, and Daddy!). Read it till its thunderous andpulsating conclusion."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"Having read Candide first, reading Candy was purely accidental, a fluke, or perhaps a dare, but part way into the book I recognized its inspiration, and enjoyed it immensely from then on. It is truly hysterical, as was the original Voltaire. Candy, however, includes snippets of ideas from other Classics: read it for yourself to see if you can guess each chapter's parent story. I have enrolled in a course that requires the reading of Candide - I am recommending Candy to the instructor who has never read it!"},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"This is one of the cleverest satires I have read in a long time. In this wickedly funny and provocative novel, Candy chronicles her pursuit of normalcy when she abandons her eccentric family. What follows is a hilarious twist after another as Candy encounters doctors, sexual analysts, yoga gurus and relatives. The sexual implications and content in this novel (too explicit to describe) are thought provoking, funny and disturbing at the same time. It is no surprise that Candy was banned from various countries. Terry Southern writes with irony and unsentimental prose -- a force to be reckoned with. Are you in the bargain for a satirical and dark read? Pick up Candy!"},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"This is the best parody yet of a woman's ability to rationalize her own behavior - no matter how absurd the circumstances. I count at least 10 taboos broken in this book. The funny/sad thing is I've actually met girls like Candy. The scene with the Hunchback is a classic, as is the shocker ending! It also seemed to me that the authors started off trying to tell a good story and (somewhere in the middle) decided to hurry up and finish. As a result, in last quarter of the book the absurdity quotient starts to increase exponentially. It would have been better to stick with the original style."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"It has been over 35 years since I read this, but I do recall that once started, I couldn't put it down and even cut classes that a.m. to finish it. I recall also that my eyes were popping as I read of the increasingly weird adventures of this girl who back then seemed utterly stupid and unbelievable. Today, I'm not so sure what message I would receive from Candy - - will have to try a re-read. I also remember feeling physically ill after finishing it and skipped lunch too that day."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"I read this when it first appeared, then again, for only the second time, just recently. It's still frankly hilarious, if not quite as shocking as it was then. It was written in the 1950s before the loose-limbed values of the 1960s governed our aesthetic tastes. What seemed sexy, and even dirty, then, seems less breathtakingly smutty but equally outrageous.Terry Southern, we have to presume, is responsible for most of it, including the somewhat nebulous allusions to Voltaire's \\"Candide.\\" (\\"Candy\\" is a parody of a parody.) His fingerprints are all over the jokes. Even his invented metathesis -- \\"prevert\\" -- appears here, before it showed up in his screenplays for \\"The Loved One\\" and, most notably, \\"Doctor Strangelove.\\"In some of his other writings, the intended humor could become offensive, at least to me. Jokes about President Lyndon B. Johnson's manhandling of the body of the recently assassinated John F. Kennedy went too far.But nothing to worry about in \\"Candy.\\" A gorgeous, sexy, blond college girl is convinced by one of her professors that people need to learn to GIVE to others, to share their warmth. (Remember, this is before Flower Power.) Here's a description of how Candy Christian's debauchery begins. I've deliberately picked the first, most \\"decent\\" example. I've had to substitute caps for the italics in the original text. And Mephisto, an allusion to Goethe, is one of many winks in the direction of high-brow fatuousness.Professor Mephisto paced about the office intoning:\\"To give of oneself -- FULLY -- is not merely a duty prescribed by an outmoded superstition, it is a beautiful and THRILLING privilege.\\"He sat down again, and put a hand out to the girl, as though in an effort to express some extremely abstract feeling, but then finding it ineffable, let it drop, as though it were useless to try, onto her knee.\\"And the burdens -- the needs of man,\\" he said with soft directness to her, \\"are so DEEP and so -- ACHING.\\"Candy involuntarily shuddered just slightly and looked down at the big fat hand on her leg -- though, of course, she did not see it as that.....Professor Mephisto gave her knee a little squeeze before withdrawing his hand.It gets much worse. Or, if your taste in comedy is as warped as my own, better. Southern sets up situations -- and these truly made me laugh out loud -- in which ordinary middle-class conventions are violated, not by violence as in the films of Alfred Hitchcock, but by eruptions of the most foul vulgarity. And one of the most amusing conceits of these episodes is the reaction of the proper people standing by and observing. If a young woman at a table in a fancy restaurant gaily asks the astonished waiter for a serving of piping hot male organ, the other diners may look slightly uneasy and remonstrate in the mildest manner -- \\"Now, Livia, I do wish you'd watch yourself.\\" Thorne Smith used a similar comic device in dealing with invisible spirits. When the rear half of an otherwise invisible dog shows up at a restaurant in \\"Topper\\" the other customers grow a little nervous and try to avoid staring at the lone wagging tail.There's no point in describing the plot. It's made up of episodes related to one another only by the presence of Candy's naive hero -- she probably belongs in the same category as Candide and Huckleberry Finn, according to Northrop Frye -- and by the increasingly surrealistic events in which she finds herself. She winds up on her belly in a collapsing Tibetan temple with her father violating her from below and the shiny nose of a giant statue of the Buddha nudging its way into her derriere. I'm not afraid of giving too much away because, once you've grasped where Southern is headed, there's not much to give away.I also got a kind of kick out of it the first time around because Candy visits a couple of real bars in Greenwich Village that I was familiar with at the time, including the San Remo, described in the text as containing some 275 homosexuals when a police car crashes in through the window. It wasn't entirely gay when I knew it. A large oil portrait hung behind the bar and the grinning subject, holding a big cigar, looked exactly like Ernest J. Lubitsch.It's not a masterpiece. It moves recklessly from one episode to the next. Of course \\"Ulysses\\" is episodic too, but Joyce had more on his mind than skinning the phony intellectual pretensions of the time while they were still alive and spastically kicking."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"I read this extraordinary novel about 20 years ago and still thinking it is five stars.

The one I got was edited - I wish there had been a warning"},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"When this book is funny, it's rolling on the floor funny. But, as seems to be typical with Southern's books, it's uneven. After the first chapter (the praying mantis in the eye thing), I was prepared for this to be the funniest book I had ever read. Alas! It only made me really laugh in about 4-5 places.I had never heard of this book until I read Michael Dirda, in his \\"An Open Book,\\" recount how he drooled over this as a sex-starved adolescent. Since then I've discovered that virtually everybody's heard of this but me. I hate when that happens. How did this escape my radar?Anyhow, I read it. Southern is a masterful prose stylist, but it's unfortunate that this book is not unified by any coherent theme. At times his insight into female psychology is frightening, but at other times he doesn't seem to know what to do with it. Several characters (e.g., Aunt Livia) and events (the janitor mother in the service closet) should have suffered deletion, but they were kept in, resulting in a final product that seems a mismatch of tone, theme, and authorial intention. From what I read about this book, Southern was riffing on the devices of pornographic novels. But this genre is virtually extinct by now, so unless you are familiar with them from their heyday, the wit of many of his literary antics, I imagine, will be lost on you.Sure made me laugh a couple of times, though.I have heard it said, incidentally, that the book is a spin-off of Candide. Hmmmm. I think that's a bit of an overstatement. It's certainly not a re-doing of Candide. We have a good-hearted main character in the beginning who studies under a philosophizing and randy professor, and whose antics result in her expulsion from her beloved home, but the similarity pretty much ends there."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"For some of the most outrageous writing and set pieces ever devised, look no further than this bizarre romp through the sexual deliriums of several characters, including the ripe and whifty heroine, some perverse academics and MD's, her older relatives, especially her aunt, and some far eastern gurus digging in a Tibetan Coal Mine. I dare anyone to read this with a straight face throughout, as I laughed practically through the whole book. And to think this was written almost 50 years ago. Forget Henry Miller, Nabokav and all the rest, until you've breezed through this wild and crazy romp!"},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"This book was the most detailed, and yet explicit book I've ever read in my life! I enjoyed reading it, and couldn't put it down. Candy is this beautiful young teengage girl who attracts men everywhere, even her own relatives! In a way Candy was sort of &quot;clueless&quot;, but overall, I still enjoyed the story."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"Read this in college and again recently. Still wicked, and who can forget that last page. A satire that is as revevant now as it was when first published"},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"I had to get this book as it was the first book on sexuality that I read as a young teen when these kinds of books were very hard to get. In fact this book was banned shortly after it was introduced around the early 60's.It is very funny and sensual at the same time."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"The Eisenhower era is something like the American version of the Victorian era. At least in the sense that they were both times noted for their straight-laced sexuality which encouraged writers of a certain bent toward the production of erotica. Unfortunately, most writing done to shock Puritanical readers is mainly mediocre. I would place this novel right square in the mediocre category.Writing during the late fifties and early sixties does have one quality that Victorian erotica doesn't: pretentions of significance. Supposedly a take-off on Voltaire's Candide, this novel has little of Voltaire's wit and insight. Granted, Southern and Hoffenberg hit a number of the right notes: taking Candy from the clutches of a lecherous college professor, through the quackery of a medical doctor, to single life in New York City, to a rural commune, into the hands of a spiritual guide in India. These are all low-hanging fruit of the era ripe for the plucking of a good satirist. The problem is, they very rarely give us anything really funny or clever.There are some good moments, particularly early on when Candy's indestructible navet&eacute; is still pleasant, a few chuckles. But as the events get more outrageous, it is difficult to maintain any sort of sympathy with our protagonist since she just seems more stupid than nave by the end. And, in this day and age, the sex in the novel is basically tame and has little shock value. That means the actual story has to hold us, and this one does not.To be honest, in my opinion, literature was really damaged in the fifties. With a few exceptions, I have found very few American novels to enjoy written between, say, 1952 - 1962. In their push to shock and break away from the expectations of the time, too many authors produced works of their time rather than timeless works. I would say the same about this one. Perhaps it spoke to people in its day, but it does not speak to me now."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"This e-book was far too short to warrant the price of TEN DOLLARS. I read it all in one evening. I realized that this was the edited version, but I never thought they'd actually edit out as much as they did. It really does affect the book's story to leave out those parts. Some of the main character's thoughts and actions just don't make sense, etc,.The book is good, though. Cute, even. And if an unabridged version is released for the same price (or less would be MUCH better, considering it's an e-book that costs you next to nothing past obtaining the original copy.) then it would be much more worth it. I wish I could take it back, even as a trade-in or something, but I guess that's not how e-books work. Just rent it from the library if you're lucky enough to have that option."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"What in the world was this book about? I'm all confused. Indeed it held my interest, but what a bizarre way of doing it. I don't remember recognizing a plot, only lots of sex. I can't say it was either a good or bad read, because honestly I have no idea. It was definitely different and unlike anything I have ever read. But, if you're interested in a quick journey down Weird Street, this novel will absolutely take you there."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"A truly remarkable and very modern rendition of Voltair's Candide served in a form that bored lit students might appreciate. First published in Paris by the Olympia Press as Lollipop, the name was changed to allow its continued publication when the first title appeared on the French Banned List. I read it in Paris in the mid fifties before attending college and came to appreciate its message denouncing philosophical optimism even before I had even heard of Voltair. Hilarious. Illuminating. Still a good read in this time of socially enforced political correctness"},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"It said that Southern brought on Hoffenberg because he couldn't figure out an ending and it really shows. It starts with classic Southern writing but falls off. Its like the movies me and my friends made in middle school when we couldn't figure out an ending and everyone died in the end. I don't want to spoil the end, but it's not great. The first half is essential for any hardcore hipster of the day."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"I think the only real ironic thing about this famous Terry Southern book from the fifties is just how much time has changed. What seemed dirty and perverted then seems tame and absurd now. While I enjoy Southern's quick jumpy narrative style, getting us from one strange situation to another, the main character (the oh-so-tragic Candy) is a non-entity in the fiction. Her character is the satire, I suppose. She seems to worried about the men who \\"need\\" her that she doesn't recognize when she's being abused. I'm not sure what the satire is there? The stupid self-image of females of the fifties, the male-monster driven by the libido, or both?All in all, its worth a read and leaves you wondering what it was all about (much like many of Candy's sordid experiences)."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"Perhaps it was because I have yet to read Voltaire's Candide, but Southern's Candy was completely lost on me. There was enough perversity and bizarreness to keep me reading until the end but I was left feeling that it was a bit incomplete and a bit pointless. Nevertheless, I get the feeling that Southern is a talented writer, and perhaps this just wasn't one of his better works."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"I'm sure this book was once considered shocking (shocking!), now it seems simply dated and puerile. Writen in see-the-cat English, you won't need a dictionary for this one. There is one saving grace though, I now know where the ending for the movie &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; comes from. It's on page 60 of &quot;Candy.&quot; Dr. Strangelove said: &quot;Mine fuhrer ... I can WALK!&quot; and Candy said: &quot;Look, Doctor, I can ... COME!&quot; So it might be worth a quick read for that, but I don't recommend paying full price for it."},{"Title":"CANDY","review":"I didn't read the book but I saw the movie and it's stayed with me all these years.

It has no more than one instance of a woman enjoying sex (and I can't be sure about that one) with sex on nearly every page. It is racist and sexist and boring. If you want 80 variations on what to call a woman's sexual organs, this is the book for you (honey pot, lamb-pit, sugar scoop, ever-sweeting, etc).

To tell an unconverted man, dead in sins, to \\"grow in grace\\" would doubtless be absurd. To tell a believer, who is quickened and alive to God, to grow is only summoning him to a plain scriptural duty. He has a new principle within him, and it is a solemn duty not to quench it. Neglect of growth robs him of privileges, grieves the Spirit, and makes the chariot wheels of his soul move heavily. Whose fault is it if a believer does not grow in grace?

The chapter on Sin is a great eye opener and reminder of how far we are fallen from a Holy God and how wonderfully great our need for a Savior really is.

If you really are serious about delving into what it means to be a citizen of heaven and being made 'fit' and ready for your arrival there, then this is a must read book. It will crush you but restore you."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"J. C. Ryle is quickly becoming one of my favorite Christian writers. This book is, quite simply, THE BEST single work on the Christian life I have ever read. Ryle's insight is phenomenal, his exegesis is impecable and his humility is stunning--and all of this while maintaining one of the simplest, most approachable, most readable styles of any theologian ever. I was hesitant to pick up a book written by an 18th century Anglican (particularly one I knew virtually nothing about), but my hesitance was by no means merited.Ryle speaks to the heart and soul of every man. He wields the sword of the Spirit like a skillful surgeon, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow. He addresses hard and trying subjects which most modern evangelicals have chosen to ignore: the power and depth of indwelling sin, the necessity of a holy life, the struggle and fight of faith, counting the cost of following Christ... and that's only in the first 5 chapters! 'Holiness' is one of four volumes of what has been called Ryle's body of 'Practical Theology.' Each of these volumes is infinitely worthy in its own right, but 'Holiness' stands just a little taller than the rest. It is unique, not in its content--for Ryle's message is the message of scripture--but in its simplicity and singleness of focus.Ryle just plain makes sense. His treatment of the texts which head the chapters is based on plain interpretation, common-sense exegesis and practical application. As he is fond of saying when interpreting plain-as-day passages which are often twisted and confounded by scholars and skeptics, 'If words have any meaning at all, then this is what the passage says.' But what is more astounding is that he does not side-step the difficult issues. Instead he takes them head on, making Christian theology and the principles of holy living seem so simple and obvious and straight-forward that I sometimes wonder what Bible I've been reading all these years to have missed so many beautiful truths. Christian, read J. C. Ryle. You will not regret it. He is a man who first and foremost loves the Lord Jesus Christ. This is the vital center of all his teaching and writing and the sole reason for his great power in ministry. Whether you are an erudite scholar or a hard-laboring farmer, a pastor or a layman, a spiritual elder or a babe in Christ--no matter where you are--Ryle's writings are for you. The love of Christ and the faith of this great 18th century saint cling to every page like an aromatic perfume.To whet your appetite here is a quote from one of my favorite chapters, 'The Fight': 'There are thousands of men and women who go to churches and chapels every Sunday, and call themselves Christians. Their names are in the baptismal register. They are reckoned Christians while they live. They are married with a Christian marriage service. They mean to be buried as Christians when they die. But you never see any \\"fight\\" about their religion! Of spiritual strife, and exertion, and conflict, and self-denial, and watching, and warring, they know literally nothing at all. Such Christianity may satisfy man... but it certainly is not the Christianity of the Bible. It is it not the religion which the Lord Jesus founded, and His apostles preached. It is not the religion which produces real holiness. True Christianity is \\"a fight\\"' (p. 63)."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"J. C. Ryle's classic calls Christians to the hard and happy work of growing through grit in the grace of Christ. With a double-edged sword, Ryle cuts through the errors of both perfectionism and antinomianism, legalism and license, sinless perfection and carnal Christianity. He exhorts us to run with perserverance the race set before us and fight the good fight of faith and strive to enter the kingdom, yet keeps before us the grace of God which alone enables such holy soul-effort. The book begins by examining sin, sanctification, holiness, the fight, the cost, growth, and assurance, and then goes on to explore other related themes including an excellent chapter called &quot;A woman to be remembered&quot; on Lot's wife and her tragic backward glance. The chapters are more expository than topical, yet full of application. Many extracts from old English Puritans are included, as well. This is a great classic that I hope gets many readings and rereadings in my generation."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"This was one of the first books by J. C. Ryle I ever read. Ryle's introduction alone was worth the price of the book. One by one Ryle pokes holes in many of the popular evangelical presumptions of his time; presumptions that haunt the evangelical church to this very day. &quot;Holiness&quot; is a call to serious Biblical Christianity that avoids the traps and snares of popular evangelical cliches."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"I highly recommend this book by JC Ryle. Ryle comes as close to finding that necessary balance of truthfulness, yet compassion of any writer I have read. His main points in this book are that you must be called by the Father, justified by the Son and sanctified by the Holy Spirit to be saved. It is a terrific biblical account of conversion. This is an account that many professing Christians would find shocking today.Ryle says that any true Christian must hate the world, Satan and sin to be a child of God. Without this inward warfare, there is no faith. Ryle has become my favorite author. After reading Holiness, I have ordered all of his other writings. His commentaries on the gospels are superb. I recommend Knots Untied as well. He was a plain speaking man whose heart burned with a holy passion for God.Ashley Hodge"},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"Holiness, by J. C. Ryle is the best book on Christian living I have read to date. In an age of easy-believism that talks of a gospel free from a commitment to God, this book shows what it takes to have a satisfying and saving relationship with Christ in the way that the Scriptures teach. As the work of sancitification is largely ignored on the bookshelves of Christian libraries, this is a much needed addition. With the debate over Lordship salvation still running its course, this book gives a perspective from over 100 years ago that easily fits our situation today. Ryle expounds the Scriptures in such a way that you can not put this book down without heartily agreeing with Hebrews 12:14 \\"holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.\\"Ryle has been called a theological vertebrae, and rightly so. This work will leave you examining your walk with Christ with a desire to live for Him like never before."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"This is the first book that I have read by JC Ryle and it will not be the last! Next to the Bible it is probably the most important book that I have read. Ryle takes the subject of Christian holiness and breaks it down into twenty one chapters. Each chapter delves into a particular aspect of holiness using quotes from scripture and his excellent insights into each of the aspects. He has ways of looking into the sacred scriptures that make you think and want to learn how to apply this aspect to your own life. He pulls no punches on the way we should be living out our Christian faith. Even though this book was written over a hundred years ago, all the topics are still very relevant. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about growing in the holiness of God."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"An excellent and thorough book, covering our situation before God before we were Christians, our state in Christ now we are Christians and how we should live in light of Christ's imminent return. A challenging read for us to be more concerned about our holiness, it is full of practical applications to help us in obedience to the Holy Spirit's work in us. It seems near the close of the book that he advocates works, but in the last chapter makes it clear we should look to the cross, not only for conversion but also for sanctification."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"What can I say... Thank God for the reformers, for the preachers of old like Ryle, whose Scripture-saturated thoughts, warnings and exhortations are sharp, profound, unashamed and candid. This volume starts with some definitions, and expositions of Biblical doctrines of justification and sancitification; the similarities and differences between the two, and why and how the latter is to be pursued seriously. This is a serious matter indeed because Hebrews 12:14 solemnly warns without holiness no one will see the LORD. It is then followed by expositions on several examples and warnings, like the life of Moses, Lot and his wife. I enjoy the sermon about Moses, who when he grew up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter, chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time, and regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt because he was looking ahead to his reward. It ends with some encouraging sermons; the one I like best is entitled, \\"Want of the times\\", which seems to be a stand-alone sermon but was included in the text unlike the first few chapters that sound highly convergent. Don't miss this, a must-read christian classic."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"This book is very detailed and covers the subject very well.

This is good, though I do think at times it may seem he believes otherwise. The book sometimes explains something in a thousand words that some may explain in two hundred. It is interesting read considering the book was written some hundred twenty years ago. He complains about easy conversersion without counting the cost of departing from your oldways (sins). That giving life to Christ is not a simple prayer but athoughtful process where you stand before God. He expresses the difference between having more Christians and having less Christians but more devoted. He also disdusses the visible and invisible Church. Those who are members of a local body of Christ but have not truly repented for sins and seek Jesus as God, Savior, and Lord. I found the exposition very interesting at times. A few times I wish he get to the point."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"The bible is surely the most important work a Christian can read. Other important works would include this one by Ryle.

We should seek to be Holy as God is Holy and by doing so we will be a fantastic testimony to the name of Christ Jesus. I highly recommend this to all"},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"J.C. Ryle was one of the most brilliant nineteenth century Bible scholars. His commentary on the nature and practical workings of holiness is unsurpassed. Ryle got at the very heart of what holiness is. He revealed that a true believer is empowered by The Holy Spirit to live a righteous life that is pleasing to God.Ryle wrote from a Reformed Anglican perspective. He valued tradition and the sacraments. However, he did not believe that a person is saved by the processes of Baptism, Communion, or Cathechism. He greatly valued these as being essential to a life pleasing to God. Ryle warns that a person is only a true Christian if he or she has been regenerated by the Holy Spirit.Ryle believed in a lordship view of Salvation. He agreed with Calvin's classic statement that a \\"man is saved by faith alone, but a faith that saves is not alone.\\" Ryle warned of the watering down of Christianity by modern antinomian errors in theology. Ryle had a demanding view of Christianity, but a reasonable one that is backed by Scripture. He knew that a Christian will battle the flesh until death. He would have looked unfavorably on the legalist theology of John MacArthur who teaches that a Christian no longer possesses a carnal nature at war with the spirit.Ryle was prophetic in seeing the spiritual decline the world faces today. People water down the Gospel to gain popularity and to avoid conflict. Mega-churches often abandon sound doctrine to preach a message of therapeutic self-help drivel. Ryle was balanced in his teachings and gave equal coverage to grace and God's judgment of sin. Ryle's commentaries are theologically sound. His writings are still as relevant as they were a century ago. He is a titan in the world of Bible exposition. I recommend his books for any believer interested in getting to a new level of understanding God's Word, holy living, and spiritual growth and maturity."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"Written many moons ago, this book is a must read for all!

I also have read some of it and it is really good! By the title you know what the book is about and I'll just say that J. C. Ryle doesn't water anything down. It's nice to hear the truth for a change! It is well written and it is organized by topic so it makes for easy, quick referencing. This book will not disappoint you."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"Though it is written in the style and framework of its day (the 19th century), Ryle's classic book is no less applicable to Christians entering the new millennium. It is divided into three sections. The first seven chapters set forth the doctrinal principles of holiness and what is involved in its attainment. Then Bishop Ryle turns to a number of examples of holiness as it is manifested in the Scriptures, both positive and negative. The last section of the book presents a number of chapters on the importance of holiness and includes warnings of what might result from a life without holiness as well as what blessings might be enjoyed as a result of pursuing a life of holiness. Though the chapters appear to have been originally composed as a series of unrelated sermons, they do contain the common thread of the importance of a Christianity that involves a transformed life. Nearly every chapter ends with a word of encouragement directed to the pursuer of holiness as well as a word of warning and exhortation to the one who has fallen short of such a pursuit. This format serves as an excellent example of a style of preaching that speaks to the needs of a spiritually diverse congregation.I found my own personal interest level escalating as I came to the central chapters of the book where Bishop Ryle brings the Scriptures to life as he traces the careers of Moses, Mr. and Mrs. Lot, the penitent thief, and Christ's own works and teachings with regard to faith, hope and love. Indeed, these chapters could well present themselves as a separate volume unto themselves in their threefold call of those foundational qualities of Christianity. In the closing chapters, Bishop Ryle returns to the topic of holiness, though there is no doubt that the lessons in the central section of the book serve to illustrate this theme.I found myself personally convicted by Ryle's exhortation to attention in the minor details of life. He reminded me that \\"he that despises little things shall fall little by little\\" (pg 93).One principle which is often repeated throughout this work is the principle of the futility and valueless of a Christianity which stops only at profession and does not change the life of the believer. \\"A religion that costs nothing is worth nothing! A cheap Christianity, without a cross, will prove in the end a useless Christianity, without a crown\\" (Page 72)."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"If you are serious about growing spiritually, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. The book was written over a century ago, but remains highly readable and relevant.What has grabbed me above all is the weight and depth to Ryle's writing - what used to be called 'unction' in former days. I doubt that any studious reader could fail to find great benefit from it."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"J.C. Ryle was a nineteenth century Anglican bishop best known for his fervent defense of Puritanical and Reformed theology. Born in 1816 to a wealthy merchant, his father experienced a reversal of fortunes and had to declare bankruptcy in 1841. In Victorian-era Britain this was scandalous, but the shame this brought about eventually led Ryle to commit his life to Christian ministry. He served as a rural pastor for most of his life until he was appointed the first bishop of Liverpool in 1880, where he served for twenty years until his death. In 1877, Ryle authored Holiness which, along with Practical Religion, has become his most enduring work.I have read this book twice within the past year, and each time I found it insightful and challenging. Ryle's book has helped me understand the doctrines of justification and sanctification much better than I did previously. That being said, and while this book does contain many theological gems, its real value lies in the practical wisdom it reveals. Ryle never loses sight of his main goal: giving Christians useful instruction on how to live a holy life. He does all of this competently too; writing in a clear and efficient manner that is still easy to read more than a hundred years after it was written. Best of all, he uses numerous Scriptural references throughout the book to emphasize the foundation for his teachings.In Holiness, Ryle essentially takes the reader through the process of sanctification, systematically tackling the subjects of sin, justification, the pursuit of holiness, and glorification. Using ample Scriptural references, Ryle starts by describing the problem of sin. He accurately describes the depraved condition mankind finds itself in and laments the fact that most Christians often trivialize the sin present in their lives. The heart of the book is centered around Hebrews 12:14, which states, \\"...holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.\\"Realizing that most saints do not understand the urgency of reaching for this state, Ryle belabors this point to drive it home. He stresses that sanctification and good works will always follow justification. Always! In such cases where this fruit is lacking, he claims the justification is not real, or counterfeit. In describing the believer's struggle to attain holiness, he emphatically states that every Christian will face three recurring battles; they will have to war with the flesh, the world, and the Devil. Finally, he insists that believers can be sure of the truth of the gospel and certain of their own salvation.In Holiness, Ryle attacks the cheap and shallow salvation prevalent at British revivals that were high on sensationalism but low on substance. He talks of the totally depraved condition of every human soul as if it were a fact and not a theological presupposition. He explains that, while justification is immediate and freely given, it is always followed by sanctification which is a slow process filled with struggle, pain and sacrifice. He speaks of the need to explain the cost of discipleship during the initial stages of evangelism, not after the conversion. He rightly believed evangelists often tried to sell Christianity in order to win more converts. Above all, he writes that the sweetest fruit of the gospel was being certain of our faith and beliefs. He states in his book that it is neither arrogance nor foolishness to know the truth of the gospel.Since we live in a day and age all too often characterized by ignorance of Biblical truths, I deeply desire for more Christians to rediscover this devotional masterpiece."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"Thomas Watson and Charles Spurgeon are my favorite Christian writers, and I never thought I would find another author that I would put on par with them.

In Holiness, he breaks down the Christian's call to holiness via santification through the working of Holy Spirit through our \\"working out salvation with fear and trembling.\\"(Phil 2:12) This book will change your outlook on being called to Holiness forever.

Many chapters I read twice before moving on due to the deep well of biblical truth and application. This book is excellent and timeless, a classic and a much needed message to anyone who wants to follow after Christ. You simply do not hear this kind of biblical doctrine taught or preached anywhere today with the exception of some faithful churches that are scattered abroad. After reading this book, it will leave you with a true sence of what it takes to enter into heaven and a hunger and thirst for righteousness."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"One of the great aims of the believer is to become \\"holy as God is holy\\" (1 Peter 1:16). So while we proclaim a \\"gospel of grace\\" (Ac. 20:24) and celebrate freedom in Christ (Gal. 5:1), we realize we were saved for a glorious purpose. We were not rescued from hell simply to bask in sin and lawlessness. We were, as Paul says, \\"created in Christ Jesus for good works\\" (Eph. 2:10).Yet how do we take tangible steps toward this goal? Holiness can feel so abstract, so unattainable, that I fear many Christians never really take pains to achieve it. Over a century ago, the Lord gave us tremendous help through this classic book by J.C. Ryle.Interestingly, Ryle begins his book on holiness by discussing sin. \\"He must dig down very low if he would build high...Wrong views about holiness are generally traceable to wrong views about human corruption\\" (p. 1). From there, Ryle devotes his early chapters to the nature of sanctification and holiness, the fight for holiness, its cost, and the need for growth.The middle chapters of the book focus on several fascinating character studies. Moses, Lot, Lot's wife, and the thief on the cross serve as examples and warnings toward holiness.The latter chapters (12-20) deal with a variety of topics. Ryle discusses Christ's power, His promise to build the church, and His restoration of Peter, among other things. These chapters are solid expositions, though more loosely tied to the main thesis of the book. Ryle closes with a fitting reminder that Christ is all. \\"Christ is the mainspring both of doctrinal and practical Christianity...He that follows after holiness will make no progress unless he gives to Christ His rightful place\\" (p. 300).I found this book a tremendous blessing. Though written in the late 19th century, Ryle communicates in a style that is both eloquent and earthy; both poetic and practical. Every page was full of encouraging and convicting truth. As I read it slowly, marked its pages, and saturated myself in it, I found it affecting my thoughts and prayer life and giving me a greater hunger and thirst for righteousness.For Christians just beginning to learn about holiness, I would recommend first reading Jerry Bridges' book \\"The Pursuit of Holiness.\\" It is much shorter and more contemporary. But Ryle definitely belongs on the Christian bookshelf and is worthy of multiple readings. What a difference it would make if every Christian in our church fed on such edifying material."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"This is probably one on the best book there is pinpointing \\"exactly\\" what Holiness is and what holiness constitutes"},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"Hebrews Says \\"that without holiness no man shall see God \\" Ryle does a great job of showing the difference between a real christian and a spurious one ."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"I have read this book about 2 years ago and about to read it again. J.C. Ryle's book on holiness has tackled one of the most evaded issues of all time, that is SIN. On how the grieviousness of sin has been diminished even by Christians. He cautioned about Christianity that teaches a bit about Christ, something about grace, something about faith, something about repentance, and something about holiness that are not the real thing in the Bible. He continues to challenge those who view Paul's letters as nothing but doctrinal, to review it again for there's a great number of practical directions about the Christian duty in every aspect of life. Ryle also tackled about assurance, and the reason why some Christians feel the lack of assurance. Then there's also the cheap form of Christianity being discussed which most of the church members including me is guilty of violating in one way or another. I say there's a lot more to learn from this book. For me it is a great source of inspiration, and a great reminder of how we should act as a Christian."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"The author writes out of several concerns that were very prevalent in his day and are just as much a concern for this generation of Christians.The first concern being to maintain a clear distinction between justifying grace and sanctifying grace.That faith which justifies a person rests on the person and finished work of Christ,whereas sanctifying faith is a grace which is active throughout the believers life(That is once they have excercised saving faith in Christ).Another major concern of Bishop Ryle's was the increasing influence of the teaching of 'Perfectionism'(that is the teaching that a Christian can attain to a level of sinless perfection in this life and in fact should be striving to do so). That Christians should desire to be sinless is what all should strive for,but it is not attainable in this life due to indwelling sin(which all of God's people struggle to overcome throughout their lives). Ryle correctly asserts that that those who teach such things are somewhat ignorant of the nature of sin,the nature of God,of their own hearts or of the meaning of the Biblical terms.In seeking to develop what holiness is,he begins where one must begin and that is to have an accurate understanding of what sin is.J.C.Ryle gives an excellent definition of sin on p.2 \\"...a sin,to speak more particularly,consists in doing,saying,thinking or imagining,anything that is not in perfect conformity with the mind and law of God.\\"It would be difficult to find a better definition of holiness than the one Ryle gives \\"Holiness is the habit of being of one mind with God... it is the habit of agreeing in God's judgements-hating what He hates-and measuring everything in this world by the standard of His Word.\\"Bishop Ryle paints a definitive picture with words that describe for us what a holy man looks like:A holy man endeavours to turn from every known sin and obey every known commandment,seeks to be meek,longsuffering,gentle,patient,...follows after temperance and self denial,endeavours to be charitable and show brotherly love,is meciful and benevolent,desires to grow in humility,have a pure heart and fears God.The chapter on sanctification begins with an excellent definition then the author proceeds to give us the nature and visible evidences of sanctification.Bishop Ryle then lists five points in which Justification and sanctification are alike and eight points on which justification and sanctification differ.Any fuzzy thinking on what Biblical sanctification is,and how it is to be distinguished from justification should be brought into sharp focus after a careful reading of this chapter. If the reader desires a more detailed treatment then A.W.Pink's book 'The Doctrine of Sanctification'deals throughlywith every aspect of the Bibles teaching on this doctrine. The importance of being able to distinguish these two doctrines(justification and sacntification)can hardly be overstated. Mr.Ryle dogmatically asserts that \\"all justified people are sanctified and all sanctified are justified.What God has joined together let no man dare to put asunder.\\"Another chapter 'Growth' deals with the reality of religious growth,the marks of religious growth and the means of religious growth.Every true Christian desires usefullness in the Masters service. The Lord has joined together usefullness and Holiness. God is pleased to use and honour those who honour Him.J.C.Ryle's 'Holiness' will be of help to babes in Christ and the most mature believers who desire to know what holiness is and how they(by God's grace)may become more holy and therefore more usefull in His service."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"Excellent treatise on holiness and the Christian life. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"If I could only have three books, this would be one of them, along with the Bible and Bridges' Trusting God. J. C. Ryle, a master of application, wrote 150 years ago, perhaps, but his teaching is still relevant today. In this book, he provides us a high standard of purity and holiness, yet his devotion to Christ is the obvious motivation for his admonitions to us. Duty? Yes, but also abundant grace and privilege in serving our Master."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"This book is very well written and even though it was written over a century ago it is still very applicable to today. As read the introduction it was almost as if Ryle was writing about our present time. This book is very challenging and very practical in nature. The chapter on \\"The Fight\\" has been especially helpful to me. Ryle's writing style is easy to read and he explains things well. I would recommend this to the Christian who is not afraid to be challenged to changed. For the person who is happy with the status quo I would recommend they not waste their time as they will not be able to deny the need for change."},{"Title":"Holiness","review":"One of the most powerful books I've read.

At the time, I didn't see a great many books dealing with this subject that had such great pictures. It was one of the things that drew me to this book. After checking it out my 100th time, I finally read it. It is a well put together book although nowadays, it would be considered outdated by some of the science in what makes a tornado go (I believe the book leaves off in 1953 or 1954 when it was published). Barring that, it is a well researched book and it gives some good insight as to what it was like to experience tornadoes before the days of Doppler Weather Radar and even regular radar. All you had was some good country sense and hope that somebody spotted the storm before it reached you...a lead warning time of just minutes usually. I would recommend this book for the die hard tornado enthusiast since it shows just how far we have come to understanding and predicting these marvels of nature."},{"Title":"Tornadoes of the United States","review":"This book has influenced my generation of severe weather meteorologists and storm chasers profoundly (I'm 61). When I was a boy, it was the only book available and its content was eagerly devoured by all of us. From the viewpoint of today, some of its material is pretty outdated, but it still provides a useful glimpse into the meteorological thinking of that era. The photographs were printed on slick paper and so are beautifully done. Even as late as the late 1950s, tornado photographs were relatively rare, and so each of these was fascinating and compelling. With today's context of routine viewing of tornado video on TV, the photographs are far from the state of the art, but still provide a record of some old events. The text is well-written, with riveting accounts of specific tornado cases and various anecdotes that provide human interest. For the budding scientist, the book even contained data sets - primitive by today's standards, but of value for the truly interested. This book is a must-have for any collector of tornado information. It's a true classic!"},{"Title":"Tornadoes of the United States","review":"I was quite pleased to find this long-out-of-print book available on Amazon. Charles Doswell's concise but excellent review covers a lot of what prospective readers should know, so I'll just add a few other general observations.The stark B&W; photos are a treasure trove - including one dating all the way back to 1884! A great visual history. Another plus of these photos is that although the B&W; technology of the day wasn't always able to capture the sharpest detail, the monochromatic nature of the images conveys a terrifying quality that is truly compelling, as if the photographers were capturing images of dark, doom-laden engines of destruction bearing down on helpless communities.A note about readability: much of the text is written with the layperson in mind, and can be easily understood by non-experts. However, the flow of the book is quite choppy, especially since Flora tends to include details (fatalities, estimated cost in damages, etc.) about individual tornadoes in the text - in addition to the same data listed in the numerous tables and charts throughout the book. He also jumps from topic to topic within the same chapter, so the narrative reads in a very inconsistent way. Readability concerns aside, this is an absolute must-have for all tornado fans who want to know more about the history of famous twisters (e.g. Worcester, Mass., in 1953) and how the study of these storms has evolved."},{"Title":"Beckett Racing Collectibles Price Guide (Beckett Racing Collectibles and Die-Cast Price Guide)","review":"Excellent Price Guide, Great detail on all Racing Collectibles.Can't wait for the next edition."},{"Title":"Beckett Racing Collectibles Price Guide (Beckett Racing Collectibles and Die-Cast Price Guide)","review":"The 2005 price guide Beckett Racing Collectibles Price Guide features more cars, more checklists, and more die-cast replica models from 1910 to modern times, and is a pick whether you're a NASCAR, Indy or Formula One fan - or love sprints, drags or dirt cars.

First, let me say, that exercise of the facial muscles DOES WORK! Yes, they have to be done properly, but it is not necessary to spend 45 minutes doing it every day. As Rachel says in the book, most of the exercises she outlines are meant to be done as a person goes through normal, routine things such as cleansing or exfoliating the skin. The picture on the back cover may not have been the best choice, but those that are IN the book do not have the same appearance. I have spoken with Rachel several times, and I assure the reader that she is personable and eager to help in any way possible. Also, many of the things in her product line are excellent. Like any other line, a person has to chose those that are right for them.

The Story of Elizabeth Fry","review":"In this installment of the ValueTales series, Spencer Johnson teaches us the value of kindness by examining the life of Elizabeth Fry (1780-1845).The book tells of you Elizabeth, a girl growing up in a wealthy British family. Elizabeth saw that she had an easier life than many people. She began visiting people at the local hospital to make them happier while they got well. When she was older, Elizabeth visited women in Newgate Prison. She worked to make their surroundings healthier and to provide them with education that would improve their lives. Elizabeth persuaded others to help--and started one of the largest prison reform movements in history.Like other books in the ValueTales series, this book uses a real-life person to exemplify an important value. It is suitable for reading by children in the later elementary school grades. A \\"Historical Facts\\" section at the book's end summarizes Fry's life in a single-page bio form suitable for adults.Closing quote: \\"Perhaps, like Elizabeth Fry, you might like to think about how good you feel when you are kind. Of course, you may decide to bring kindness into your own life in a very different way, indeed. But whatever you decide to do, let's hope it is something that will make you a happier person...

The original Persian along side the English translation of the tragedy of Sohrab and Rostam from the Persian epic the Shahname. For anyone who is not acquainted with the Shahname it is a Persian epic tracing history of the Persian kings to the fall of the Persian empire and the Arab invasion. The Shahname (or book of kings) is just that; it is an epic tale similar to the Greek epics of the rise and fall of kings, mythical tales, epic battles and tragedy. Amongst other predominantly Muslim people we have the stories of Antar for the Arabs or Dede Korkut for the Turks. It is quite possible that all of these works influenced Shorta Rustaveli in his writing of the 'Knight in the panther skin' the Georgian epic.The author provides an introduction to the Shahname, its origins and development. He further explains the importance of the Shahname to the Persian people and Persian culture and continues with the history of the Shahname post Firdosi (The author) The author continues giving an introduction to the text that he is translating and the editions of the Shahname he has used.The text is flowing and retains much of its poetical style thus, keeping it in its correct historical context. For students of Persian that there is a corresponding Persian text on the opposite page is also of benefit. There are notes at the end of the book explaining parts of the text that the reader may find difficult to understand.Not the complete Shahname but an excellent introduction and one I would recommend."},{"Title":"The CRB Commodity Yearbook 2004","review":"This has always been a good handbook, but in the age of the internet with an endless array of information sources, the book is not quite as useful as it has been in the past, especially given its high price."},{"Title":"The Demands of Liberal Education","review":"This book forces educators to consider what it is we do - and whether or not we are on the right path.

She does this by asking whether or not we offer a truly liberal education and then, to double the blow she lays out what we must do if we hope to get there."},{"Title":"The Demands of Liberal Education","review":"This book takes a radical approach to the task of devising a liberal education. Its author, Meira Levinson, a professor in Harvard's School of Education, is not much interested in liberal education as classically conceived. Classically, liberal education has connoted acquainting students with the best in literature, affording them an opportunity to broaden their horizons through exposure to the fascinating themes developed in the literary specimens comprising the corpus and to the artfully engaging styles of their composition. The ideas and modes of presentation displayed have traditionally been thought of as liberating, as possessing ingredients necessary for liberating the untutored mind from the impeding shackles of the ordinary and mundane. They have been credited with the efficacy to enable the student to exercise his critical faculties to great benefit, and to pronounce on the commendableness or otherwise of these works' contents and suggestions. But this conception of liberal education is no part of Levinson's concoction.Instead, she takes her cue from a string of moral and political philosophers who have, since the dawn of modernity, identified liberation with possession of self-autonomy. In some instances, they have begun insisting on the responsibility to take measures to assure that people populating the grounds are indeed outfitted with the touted autonomy and self-determination. With this understanding dominating her thinking, Levinson has blithely shed any pretense to reasonableness and developed a doctrine to the effect that the school system imposed on us by the powers that be should ignore parental predilection and enforce uniformity upon the entire conglomerate of students. Each and every student must, on her having, be compelled to grow into an autonomy-outfitted human being, embodying a liberal outlook on the world at large. The school is called upon to weed from its midst any tendency thwarting the cause of enhancing students' autonomy in as optimal a fashion as possible. It must, as she has it, purge itself of all obstacles to the ready assimilation of the denizens of the classroom to the cadre of what she thinks of as the autonomistically privileged. Thus are all students to be straight-jacketed into the autonomous mold.Autonomous indeed! The book is downright hostile to the far more level-minded supposition that liberalism doesn't liberate the state to impose liberal autonomy as a lifestyle upon its member citizens. Instead, it constrains the state to leave citizens to raise children as they will and, in this way, to empower the next generation of citizens to experience a wide range of alternative modes of living and to fashion their own lifestyles - and that of their progeny - as an overlay upon the resultant prolifically variegated undercurrent. Levinson goes to the trouble of marshalling all the philosophically analytic ammunition at her disposal, building fastidiously upon an already well-entrenched body of literature; but in the end she plays fast-and-furious with her cache and subverts it, much to her own detriment.This is not meant to serve to discourage you from having a look at the Levinson book. On the contrary, read and be amazed! See how cunningly an idea from the literature can be twisted to serve a preordained, steadfastly hewn-to purpose. Witness firsthand how an argument is held onto come what may, in total oblivion to the mass of evidence piling up in its disfavor. Then go and consider the agenda that underlies the rash of maneuvers taken. If you're in the least bit like me, you will undoubtedly come away with the conviction that the whole exercise has been but another attempt at shielding the unsuspecting from the truth. It has been undertaken as a means of constraining our freedom to face freedom's own formidable challenges."},{"Title":"How to Practice Brief Psychodynamic Psychotherapy: The Core Conflictual Relationship Theme Mode","review":"I've been using this book for a number of years with my counseling students.

The book is not for beginners, but one need not be an expert player to incorporate Harrington's methodology into your game.Volume I addresses the various elements of no-limit hold-em strategy- betting strategies, pot odds, reading the table, playing styles- and organizes them into short chapters that end with analyses of 3-5 real hands. The author interjects which plays should be made, while discussing the actual plays that were made and their eventual outcome. The most interesting lesson is that these sample hands do not always result in making the authors look smart. Sometimes the actual player makes a poor play, but gets lucky and wins the hand anyway, while some follow the author's suggestions and lose the hand. I think this may be the best lesson I learned in this book- in hold-em you can be right, but still be wrong. Only the expert player realizes that playing \\"right\\" garners better results over the long haul.Bottom line- if you are looking to improve your no limit game, buy this book. I'm by no means a pro, but I'm already a much tougher out in no-limit games since I've been reading this book."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I know it's all been said before, but previous reviewers are right on the money.

Dan Harrington not only knows his stuff, but he actually took the time to think through an appropriate way to convey his vast storehouse with the reader.

Pot odds, betting tells of your opponents, how to vary your betting to avoid giving away your hands. These are the few things that really stood out when I went through this book. It's no wonder why Harrington is one of the best poker player.After reading this, I went back to my NL ring cash game and totally busted my opponents. Other than mathematical concepts of calculating pot odds, it instructs you in the way of bluffs and probing a possible bluff, staying focus on your opponents betting sequence to reveal their hands.I'm not playing the best game I can after reading this, but over time, revisiting this book and putting it into practice, I believe anyone can be a competent cash or tourney NL holdem player.Stop hesitating and buy it already!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Greg \\"Fossilman\\" Raymer, winner of the 2004 World Series of Poker endorses 2+2 Publishing claiming he couldn't have done it without them. Well, you would have THOUGHT I'd won a WSOP bracelet when I recently won a small stakes, online Texas Hold 'Em tournament and credit most definitely goes to Harrington's Volumns' 1 AND 2. The writing style is clear and concise and his tournament winning theories fall into place from opening plays to heads up confrontations. Vol. 1 was so much fun to read, gave me so much important information I couldn't wait to purchase his followup Vol. 2. I'm now working on Vol. 3, \\"The Workbook\\" that is filled with the same meaninful scenarios as his first two works.

In this valuable book he 'tells em as they is'. Standard strategies like the 'San Andreas Meat-grinder' (perfect for unloading double buffers into an end-zone packed with natural flankers) and the 'Chicago Steamer' (a honey-trap that could leave your opponent fencing against a semi-Lazarus) are explained with great attention to detail. He also has plenty of cavaliar gambits for more experienced snipers to deploy. Although the 'Fibonacci Fallout Shelter' may be too complex to smoke out an amateur cave-jacker, he claims that you can use it against pros to rotate the step of a goose-dance. Just DON'T try to detonate a Dutch grenade with it- use the 'Tallahassee jail-break' instead! My favourite is probably his slant on playing the 'Kentucky Monkey' (the best racket to reverse the polarity of a south-bound pot). Although there is the danger of being drowned in a mud-slide before the penultimate flipper, it usually guarantees the chance to fire a clockwork shotgun into the flood.PS. I haven't tried my hand in any tourneys yet, but I did beat the rest of the Redhart family once- after I decided to go all in before the flop (with an unsuited 4 7) and pulled a straight."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Thank you to the seller.

I've read some other books on No-Limit and I've played online for a little over a year and live play at a small poker room for almost 6 months. It wasn't until I read this book that my play drastically improved. I almost want to write a bad review to keep people from buying it and improving their own game. After finishing the book I went off to my local poker room to play in one of their weekly 100 person max NL tournaments. I have consistently been a 50/50 player at the sit n' go live tournaments, meaning I win money 50% of the time and lose money 50% of the time. I figured my play would improve from the knowledge in the book but I had no idea how much of an improvement I would have. I won! Yeah thats right, I won my first tournament larger than a sit n' go at live play after finishing the book. My online play win percentage has increased as well, I consistently finish in the money in major tournaments. I've finished in the money 11 of 15 of my last online tournemants with more than 1500 entrants and made 2 final tables. I consider this a drastic improvement and attribute the majority of my success to the knowledge in this book. I can't wait to finish and absorb volume II as it appears the endgame is where I need to improve at this point. The best part of the book for me is that it made everything \\"click\\" in my mind. I highly recommend the book and wish you all the disciplne and patience needed to win ~ luck is for losers :-)"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Let me just say this first: These two books are the finest tournament poker books every made.Doyle Brunson at first wanted to sell his original Super System for $1000 a copy as it was the finest collection of poker strategies ever put on paper. These two books are so good that they could also be sold for $1000 a piece, they are that goodDan Harrington has earned the nickname \\"Action Dan\\" due to his super rockish appearance. His super tight style seems to be a throw back to the early days of tournament poker. When this book first came out I thought it would be another book that wanted to teach you how to become the most masterful laydown artist (not a complement), however this is not the case.Volume One addresses the nature of tournaments and sound strategies that are benificial to all player style types. The name of the game in the beginning stages of every tournament is survival and Vol. One addresses many problem that may arise. This is not a \\"if-this-happens-do-this\\" type book, these books review \\"situations\\". How one handles \\"situations\\" is what seperates the winning players from everyone else. After each chapter there are a number of exercises that first set up the hand, how opponents have appeared in previous hands, what your possible table image is, the blind levels, and both your opponents chip count and your own.The first book will do a great deal of good to players that seem to get knocked out often. Everyone from the tightest rock to the loosest hyper-aggressive players will take away a great deal from this book.Volume Two addresses many key concepts that are unique to the later stages of tournaments where you may or may not have the luxury of having solid hands and easy decisions. Crazy things happen toward the end of tournaments. The later stages of tournaments are the situations that make the cut in televised poker, they just flat out make good TV!In volume two, Harrington addresses key problems such as inflection points, making a move on a pot, short handed play and other concepts that you must know to reach final tables regularly.While these books specialize on tournament poker, the concepts discussed are key to both tournament and cash game play. These books are not beginner books, many concepts are very advanced and require the ability to spot key situations that newer players will not notice. I highly recommend these books to both skilled players hand to players who have advanced past the \\"Winning Low Limit Holdem\\" and \\"Holdem for Dummys\\" level and are looking for the next step. Both of these books belong in your poker library. The list price is $30, they both can be found on amazon for around $20, again they are worth thier weight in gold."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Dan Harrington is one of the premier tournament players in the world. And this is by far the best book on tournament hold 'em. Some have recommended David Sklansky's tournament book over this; however, I would personally recommend this over Skalansky's book.First and foremost, it is a much better written book. Sklansky is certainly a brilliant theorist, but he does not write in a coherent style. On the other hand, Harrington, with the help of his co-writer, writes in a lucid style. You will not catch yourself re-reading sentences and paragraphs as you will with Sklansky's book.Secondly, Dan Harrington is a premier no limit hold 'em tourney specialist. His back-to-back final table appearances in 2003 and 2004 may be the greatest achievement by a single player in the history of the WSOP Main Event. Why would you not take this man's advice?And finally, Action Dan makes you think like a poker pro. He takes you into the thinking processes of championship-caliber poker gods as they make moves that are seemingly absurd to us mere mortals.Another common failing of most poker books--and this applies to even such classics as Super System--is that they teach you one particular style, whether that be aggressive like Doyle's or more solid and math-oriented like Sklansky's. What is special about Harrington's book is that while its author is known for his tighter than tight \\"rock\\" image, it exposes you to all the different styles. So whatever your current style may be, you will be able to apply the advice in this book.This book transformed me from a poker neophyte to a feared online player. And while I have studied just about all the poker classics, I attribute my rapid poker growth first and foremost to this book. In fact, I just won a seat to the 2005 WSOP Main Event, and if I am fortunate to meet Action Dan in Vegas, I will be sure to thank him for this great gift to us poker amateurs."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I have been totally blown away by this book. This is simply the best no-limit hold em book on the market. The detail, anaylsis and overall wealth of information make this book well worth its $20. The reason why this book is so excellent is because it attempts to teach you how to think like the pros and gives you clear guidelines on how to accomplish that. Warning though, this book is not for the lazy, get-rich-quick wannabees. This work is going to require a major investment in time and mental resources in order to fully upgrade your game and become competitive. If you are willing to do that, then this book cannot be beat. It's even better than Supersystem."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I have been playing poker for about 6 months. This book is absolutely filled with information about hold em. Probably the most important thing I am learning from it is just how to understand the game. There are so many aspects of this game that need to be looked at. Now I have realized that there are many more factors you need to look at besides tells and the cards in front of you. I am probably going to give this another read-through (maybe of just the real important topics) just so I clearly understand what Dan is trying to teach. This will help apply the new concepts I have learned. Dan teaches you how to interpret your opponents actions and how to act on those interpretations. The best part about this book is probably the examples. From what I have counted, there are about 71 \\"problems\\" or examples. These are probably not what you are imagining (this is really great). On each problem you are given a VERY detailed set of circumstances. You can see the actual table on the page, your position, the amount of $$$ each player has, and Dan tells you if certain players are tight, loose, etc. Then Dan goes on with an explanation such as: \\"Player D in first position is a young, super-aggressive player. Other than that the table seems pretty conservative. Your hand is: King, Queen.\\" This is just an example I made up, its not in the book. But there are about 70 of these problems and each has an explanation of all the different possibilities that could occur during the hand. Each explanation is a few pages long. The great thing is that you can try to answer these yourself by thinking about the concepts you learned during the chapter. Three of the more helpful chapters for me were the ones on the different types of bets (value bets, continuation bets, probe bets), the chapter on pot odds, and the chapter on the Gap Concept. I think another real virtue is Dan's writing. Most books I can't read in a couple of days. But this book is almost 400 pages and I was through it in a few days. Thats mostly because I'm very interested in poker, but Dan has a good writing style which keeps me interested. Also, in the back there is a section for \\"notes\\" which is nice because you can study the new concepts taught in the book. I must say, this book has been helpful mostly because my style of play is mostly like Dan's (very conservative) but I think any hold em player would get a lot out of this book. I can't wait for volume two to come out! 5 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"If you're into Texas Hold'em (and who isn't these days) this is a book worth reading. Even playing \\"free money\\" games on the internet, Harrington's strategies are helpful. If you play in live tournaments or cash games it WILL help you play better, winning poker. The format of using actual hands in actual game situations as teaching aids is a good way to learn the basics. You will be surprised how quickly you will be more aware of your own play - are the other players aggressive or conservative, how many \\"outs\\" you have, what are the pot odds, and so on. Harrington's book will make you a more skilled player, rather than one who just relies on luck to win. Try it!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"On this book [Strategic Play], Harrington provides the basics of proper play, his thoughts on strategy and tactics, lots of problems/scenarios, and builds a foundation for the second book [End Play].His approach works.About a year a year ago I was invited to join a group that plays no-limit Texas Hold'em on a frequent basis. As the other players were far more experienced at poker than I [a few play in casinos or on-line], and because I didn't know \\"I didn't know what I was doing\\", I usually finished last or near to last.Since reading this book, I have not become a champion or won thousands of dollars any place (I only play in this group), but I have finished second a couple of times and recently came in first. But, even more importantly to me, the other players have commented on my improved play. That means they have begun to respect my play. Once they respect your play, you have more options, and you WILL win more pots.

There will be several other no limit books coming out soon I hear, by Greg Fossilman Raymer, Greenstein, etc. and it will be interesting how they compare with Harrington's. I like the book because Harrington gives instruction WITH examples (although I'd prefer a ton more examples like Ciafonne's book Middle Limit Holdem). If you're a limit Holdem player, you should give NL Tournaments a shot--I think it will improve your overall Holdem game and prevent you from going stale--plus it's FUN!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"An amazing book. \\"Action Dan\\" takes you all the way in to the hand to hand tourny action.

This book is the first I have read to have many thorough examples that reinforce the concepts of each chapter, which is a welcome change from books that lecture on how to play. Don't get me wrong, I find great value in the other books on the market (especially the 2+2 books), but HoH reads like you are playing along with a no-limit champion.

The real benefit of this book is that you get a set of \\"problems\\" at the end of each chapter. Harrington gives you all the pertinent information about the table, what type of game it is, info. on the other players, and you have to decide what the correct play is. It really will put his advice into perspective, i.e. you are able to see how he would apply his own advice, and see that some advice does not apply to EVERY situation. Since reading these books I have improved my sit-n-go play, but I am even more impressed with my large-field tournament play. I was never very good at making it through a large-field tournament, but since reading this books have made it to the final table of large fields pretty regularly, including a tourney with a field of 685, and another with a field of 1,120."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I will make this review as short and to the point as possible.... The Harrington on Hold'em series: Volumes 1-3 are the best books written on the subject of no limit texas hold'em touraments to date. Plain and simple! I have owned this series for over a year and these books have helped me so much in understanding the game of NLHE better and has made me alot of $$$ over the last year, so I figured it was my duty to post an honest review...Just like virtualy every review on amazon, I give this one 5+ Stars. Bottom Line: If you want to step up your NL Hold'em tourament game, these books will do it for you. You can only get so lucky in touraments, in the long run you need SKILL to be a winner and consitant in NLHE Touraments. The knowelege from these books combined with table experiance is in my opinion the making of a great overall NLHE Tourament player.PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE...This book teaches you the skills necessary to be sussesfull. You must understand: Proper Out Calculation, pot odds, implied odds, position, continuation bets, betting patterns, M, Q, Squeeze Plays, Gap theory, Value Bets, ect... ect....These books cover just about all you need to be a sucessfull NL Tourament player. To understand and apply the knowlege in these books, and learning to think for yourself will make you lethal at the poker tables. You can read these books over and over again to absorb more knowlege and you will not get bored.These books are Very well written and it's easy to understand the concepts. If you dont understand them Harrington gives you examples and senerios. I will personlly thank Dan Harrington for being so honest and for not holding anything back in these books. He has definatly taken a risk writing these books.He writes about what no other NLHE books to date include. These books have helped me tremendously!! YOU MUST BOTH UNDERSTAND AND THEN APPLY THIS KNOWELEGE.This will give you an edge in touraments....Whenever I am playing a NLHE Tourament I hope that no one else at my table has the same knowlege from these books as I do.I am a firm believer that exeprience is the best practice, but soon after finishing the first 2 books, I have been CONSISTANT in cashing in big live events. I play in live tourements weekly ranging from 40-400 people at NY underground poker rooms,(which in my opinion is the HARDEST and TOUGHEST FIELD TO DOMINATE, and coincidently where harrington starting his poker carrer) and out of the last 20 times I played after reading these books I have cashed 16 out of the 20 times.Like I said, I was pretty good before reading these books, but now, APPLYING the knowlege in these books I am so much better then I ever was. Understanding and applying the knowlege in these books is key to understanding the game and winning touraments!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"If you play NL, this book is an absolute MUST HAVE. Harrington's strategies are well explained through detailed analysis of various hands as they develop. Not only does he share his insight with you, but he teaches you how to apply these techniques to your own play for immediate and visible improvements in your game. Honest truth - the day after I read the book, I finished 1st of 1,100 people on a popular on-line site. Results not typical, but I strongly recommend this book, and I'm reading Vol 2 now."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I have bought a ton of books and DVDs on poker and , by far, \\"Harrington on Holdem\\" has helped my play the most. The books gives you the basic ideas on pot odds, implied odds and starting requirements, tells and other aspects of the game you'll find in many books. However, the book succeeds because it uses analysis that is simple enough to understand yet really touches the complex aspects of Hold'em without leaving u dazed and confused. You'll quickly learn many amatuer mistakes and why pros don't make those mistakes and are able to last longer than the \\"Dead Money\\". Besides his witty comments and thorough explanations, I particularly liked the sections called \\"Problems\\". Here, Harrington gives the reader real life scenerios and shows you what are the right and wrong decisions to make with a hand based on your chip stack, position, antes and your opponents. Also the book teaches you to understand the texture of the flop, turn and river cards from a professional players perspective. Since reading the book i really think hard before making decisions on the table and his insights have helped improved my game. I strongly recommend this book for anyone wanting to take their game to the next level."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I've bought a whole bunch of poker books before and must say this is the best one on hold'em in terms of practical value. It is one of the only books on No Limit and also for tournament play. It is very useful in terms of providing exercises and gives you pretty much all the tools to think your way through all sorts of situations. I have read Super System, Theory of Poker, etc. and most of the other books are confusing to read or are not focused on No Limit. Anyone playing No Limit should add this one to their bookshelf."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I've been playing poker for just over a year, and in that time, I have read many of the 2+2 books, the best of which was Tournament Poker for Advanced Players. That is, until I picked up HOH Volume 1. I have spent the last year seriously studying poker and striving to become a better player, and while all of the 2+2 books have helped, none have done for my game what HOH has done.I have always been fascinated by the math and probabilities involved in poker, but have never quite gotten the \\"feel\\" of poker. That has changed. I'm starting to learn how to think about a hand, how to look at decisions that I've made and others have made, and construct a mental image of how I stand in the hand.I have known from the beginning that position plays a large role in how you play, but I can honestly say that there has never been as good a discussion on position and how to play both in position and out of position as there is in HOH.One of the hallmarks of the 2+2 books is that they are as dry as the Sahara. As for ease of reading, they may as well be written in Sanskrit. Not so with HOH. It's written in a very casual style, and Dan and Bill have a way of presenting complex topics in everyday language. I take nothing away from Sklansky and Malmuth, but they think (and thusly write) on a level that most beginning poker players aren't even aware exists.I have not completed HOH yet (I still have about 1/3 of the book to go), but I can say that my play has improved 100% already. I already have HOH Volume 2 ready to go when I finish HOH 1, but I'm having so much fun playing, that finding time to read is hard.I know it sounds cliche, but if you only buy one book on Hold'em, make it HOH 1. (I'm sure I'll say the same about HOH 2, just as soon as I read it.)"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"While I by no means consider myself a Professional, I do rank myself pretty well when stacked against other armatures. I've read many of the books out there from Sklansky to Cloutier and Brunson, but this is the first book that that really tied everything together for me. A lot of the other books out there require you to be a mathematician in order to understand their discussion regarding pot analysis and pot odds, but Harrington lays it out in an easy to understand format that works. It wasn't until I read his book that I truly began analyzing my hands and stopped making decisions based wholly on what my two hole cards were, and started making decisions based on all the information the table provided. Just recently I finished 3rd in a tournament and won $10,000, and I can attribute a lot of that success to the information I absorbed from this book. I just purchased Volume II, and I can't wait to see what other information I can learn from Dan. I know it's a clich&eacute;, but if you were to only ever buy one book on No Limit Hold'em, this should be the one!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Without question, this is the best NL Hold Em tournament book on the market today.End of story.I have read tons of poker books out on the market, books that focus on Limit Hold Em, books that cover the basics, books that cover how to stay in the moment while playing poker. Each of these books have their own pros and cons, but sadly none of these books focused on NL Tournament Hold Em like it should be covered until I read 'Harringon on Hold Em: Volume I'. Dan Harrington and Bill Roberte have packaged together a book that ALL NL Hold Em tournament players should read (or maybe they shouldn't --- I'll get back to that later).The chapters are broken out as follows:1. Basics of No-Limit Hold Em2. Playing Styles and Starting Requirements3. Reading the Table4. Pot Odds and Hand Analysis5. Betting Pre-Flop6. Betting Post-Flop7. Betting on the Turn and RiverAfter reading this overview you might think that this is just like any other NL Hold Em book, but it's simply not. For one thing, this book ASSUMES that you know something about the game of NL Hold Em before you read this. While you can pick up this book not having ever played the game before, you are better off probably having read a basic book like Phil Hellmuths or playing some hands before you read this text.While most books cover the basics like AA is better than JJ and explaining what 'Big Slick' is, the heart of this book are the hand analysis parts at the end of each chapter. The thing that separates this book from any other on the market is the realism of the hands presented. Other books try to do the same thing, but to help the reader feel better, they will usually say the reader hits a monster hand and wins a ton of money. I understand why the writers do this, but it really doesn't help anyone who really wants to become a better poker player.My favorite poker quote of all time:\\"You win you earn, you lose you learn\\"Without going on and on and on and on, I'll stop this review and state that while I have reviewed many books in the past, this is only the 2nd poker book that I have ever put HPR on. If you want to become a better NL Hold Em tournament player, pick up this text and watch your game improve dramatically.Actually, maybe you SHOULDN'T pick up this book so that myself and others can take advantage of our improved game while you are stay the amateur level and watch the chips come my way.***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I've read many poker books, but this one I can't put down. Very enjoyable reading. Very easy to understand. The examples on how to play hands are very helpful. I found the information on betting the most helpful as most books tell you to play position and what good hands are vs marginal hands in situations. Harrington tell you how to bet right to get the pot odds in your favor. I hesitate to recommend this book as It's helped my game and I'd rather not educate the guy across the table from me but I also appreciate great advice and Harrington has it here. Can't wait for the next volume."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the most respected and famous Hold' Em Tournament Strategy books in the world, and with good reason. Dan Harrington has the stats to back it up, and he knows exactly how to play in a deep-stack tournament. This andHarrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 2: Endgameare absolute MUST-HAVES for your collection if you like no limit Hold 'Em tournaments. This book focuses more on the beginning stages of tournaments, while the second one is very end-game intensive. I personally have always had the most difficulty during tournaments toward the end, and I know a lot of people do. Don't know what the heck you should do when the blinds start rising astronomically and your stack is consistently shrinking? These books tell you all.However, like all poker books out there, not only do you have to read the material, you really have to take it in. Thankfully, Harrington has beautiful examples and quizzes for you throughout the entire book, and I highly recommend taking notes or using a highlighter and just remembering the key points. Sometimes you will read something and just think, \\"Wow. That is genius.\\" Harrington is also pleasantly witty, so the book is not a treacherous read. You can succeed like Harrington, but you need the dedication and the INNATE ability to be able to do it. Unfortunately, not everyone can read this book and become Harrington. If so, there would be no pros. Just take what you learn from this book seriously and don't wimp out when it comes to situations when you're actually playing. As an example, Harrington stresses the absolute importance of NEVER letting yourself get blinded out, even if all of your hands are garbage. He will tell you to push all-in with 10-5 offsuit in the right position and time before letting your stack shrink to the point where people will just call to get rid of you, like a gnat. Have the tenacity, patience, and discipline and this book can do wonders for you. I used to not even want to TELL people about this book because it's so good, but now I realize that it doesn't matter...if you are hard-headed, have a big ego, or don't know how to apply these strategies correctly, all of the reading in the world will do absolutely nothing for you, except possibly make you worse.And most importantly, be humble. Don't think you're a pro as soon as you read this book, or think you're better than everyone else with your newfound knowledge. Continue to learn from your mistakes (everyone makes them) and just let yourself grow wiser with time and experience. That's what a real professional poker player is."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I love reading books about poker, and this one was great.I can see many good players that I've come across in Reno etc. that have clearly read this book, and after reading it myself, it was fairly easy (after a few hours playing with them) to profit from them.This isn't a book you want to \\"skim.\\" Read it well and out loud if you have to.

And I think we often walk away from the good poker books as better players, just not always quickly. I found that books like Sklansky's Poker Theory and Super System are great resources and I have definitely benefited by reading them, but I don't think I ever felt like my game improved as quickly as it did after reading Harrington on Hold'em, beginning with Vol. 1.The reasons are three fold:Specificity: I feel like I'm not just given general advice, but actual analysis of real hands, and all the details that go with them, helping me better understand how to actually implement the ideas.Clarity: Too many poker books feel like it has to be complicated to be good. Harrington writes with an easy-to-understand style that doesn't get bogged down even as it goes into detail. It's simple enough for a beginner, but doesn't sound patronizing.Basic not stupid: Too many people when reviewing poker books take issue with books by saying they're for beginners. Well poker isn't that complicated, no matter how hard Sklansky tries to make it. The point is that a good poker book often gets pretty basic because that's the core to good poker. Doesn't make it only for beginners. This book just does that even better than most."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This is a review of the Kindle Version.This classic by superstar Hold'em Tournament player Dan Harrington is well regarded by experienced poker players everywhere. It is a \\"classic\\" and a worthy read despite the fact that some of the techniques are so widely known that they have lost much of their effectiveness. There is a multitude of good reviews on the content, which I will not discuss. Instead, I will discuss the merits of the Kindle edition.This is one of the best Kindle editions of a paper poker book that I've seen so far - most graphics-heavy poker books don't translate that well. (I also own paper copies of this series, so I can compare the two readily). First, the text itself is not plagued by the transcription errors and typos that are common in most Kindle versions. (I don't know why it's so hard for them to proofread Kindle versions carefully before they put them up for sale, but that's another issue.) The text in this book is exactly like the original, without any transcription errors.Second, the Kindle version does an excellent job of reproducing the diagrams from the original paper book. This book is loaded with diagrams, and some Kindle poker books don't handle these well, especially when you change the typeface size on your kindle. This book is outstanding in this area.As I write this, the price discount for the Kindle version compared to the paper version is only a couple of bucks, but I can't complain. In fact, the kindle version to me is even more valuable than my paper versions, due to portability. The kindle is shaping up to be a great device for serious poker players, because we can keep our Gus Hansen, Dan Harrington, and other books all in one small package to read during travel time to the casinos."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This is by far the only book you need , if you do not improove your game switch to monopoly or come to party poker and play with me :)The books covers the following topics- The Game of NL Hold 'em-Playing Styles and Starting requirements-reading the table-Pot Odds and Hand Analysis-Betting before the flop_Betting after the flop-Betting on 4th and 5th stIt starts off with a very brief intro to NL Hold'em and how it has blown up in the past couple yearsIt went into the different styles :-The Conservative Approach-Aggressive Approach-Super Aggrssive Approachhe does give u a basic strategy that u can follow , it a tight but not so tight approach , not like in Cloutier's style if u do follow harringtons's strategy u will have a good stack coming into the final tablehe does give basic advice on tells and reading the table but nothing special if you want to go into details you might want to read Claro's Book of tellsOverall It cant get any better i cant wait for Vol 2"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This book is good in that it covers a couple of topics never covered before:-Style of play, conservative/aggressive, super aggressive and how to counter each style-Pot odds and implied odds and how to use this in conjunction with your opponents play and style. Rather than a study on odds-Starting Hand values according to style and position.-Practical problems that are deeper in comments and strategy than any other NLHE book ever published. (Including Middle Limit NLHE). These really put you inside the head of one of the top Pros.What is evident is that Harrington is a very sophisticated player and the depth of thinking required to play NLHE at the highest levels cannot be covered in one book. References are made to other books by Sklansky for instance.Feel free to incorporate this new knowledge into your play but understand at the higher levels so will your opponents.The main lesson from Harrington is that we must each think for ourselves and incorporate our natural style but understand that at different stages of a tournament we must play tighter or looser.Harrington has had good success recently and we must ask why compared to the super aggressive players such as Negraneau and Ivey, the answer may be that in super large fields less sophisticated players are less bluffable and more willing to draw out all in. (Remember Men the Master's Aces getting cracked by a 20% draw out by an all in internet player at the 2004 WSOP main event.)Overall its a very detailed book that will take about two weeks to go through and months to master."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Volumes I and II are a must-read for anyone who plays No-limit tournaments with any regularity.The most important factor to consider in any gambling book is: will I make more money after mastering its material? Sadly, 95% of the books out there are pure rubbish. These books are not just instructional, but extremely well written.You can see the mix of the two authors combining to make this text. First, you have Harrington, a well-known no-limit player. More importantly, you have Robertie, an author with amazing talent for teaching gambling techniques with many problems and solutions. Robertie has written a two volume set on Backgammon that uses a similar style: a rule is given, and 10-20 real-life scenarios are given with actual solutions.The combination of a Harrington with Robertie is very effective at teaching you how to win at No-limit Hold'em poker. Before reading this, I was already a winning player. After studying these texts, my hourly win-rate went up about 50%. Even solid players will read this and say \\"Hmmm. I never thought of that, but it makes sense!\\" You will follow the offered strategies, and even though you're not sure quite where things went right, you'll play longer and win more money.When you consider these books, you should really consider both volumes as one large text. The materials are geared towards an intermediate or higher player. A beginner will learn from this,but it is a nasty learning curve for beginners, and there are no good books out for scrubs.No-limit hold'em poker is still a relatively ripe market, despite the press it gets. If you are serious about making money at it, this 2-volume set is mandatory."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Every poker book out there is labeled \\"the poker bible\\" by some expert. I have read many poker books, but Harrington on Hold 'em puts it all together. He covers it all from pot odds, to playing styles, to how much to raise/bet in certain situations. Everyone should have in their library such classics as listed below, but Dan Harrington puts all of the great advice from other books into a useful manner. While T.J. Cloutier's book, Championship No Limit and Pot Limit Hold 'em has several example problems, they are nowhere near as in depth as Harrington's examples. I have finished in the money in on-line single tables ever since I have read this book. Read Doyle Brunson's Super System I and Sklansky's Theory of Poker. They are classics that you should have in your library, however, I found it difficult to play the aggressive style Doyle described. People should also have Caro's Book of Poker Tells. But it will only come together with Harrington on Hold 'em, Volume I. I can't wait for Volume II."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This is one of the best no limit tournament books in years, however there are 3 caveats; 1) It is only! for no limit holdem tournaments, not any other type and not for cash games, 2)This should not be the first poker book you ever read, you really should start with something aimed at beginners and have played atleast 4-6 months before reading this book and 3) Harrington devotes little time making points about off topic points, like JT suited out of position and with slightly unfavorable pot odds, why call with 4 opponents still to act? Well, its a great multiway hand. He also does not mention that one of the main reasons to raise with AK is that it is a hand that does poorly multi way but generally good heads up.Still, this book makes a lot of good points that will improve your tournament play. One of them involves the different types of bets made before and after the flop, its common knowledge to any professional or long time player, but most mid level players will learn a lot from it.

My game has steadily improved over the past couple of years and I've won dozens of online sit and go tournaments, and various real life competitions. I've also learned that No Limit Texas Hold'em is a game that takes many years to master.My game today is a world away from 2003 when I started. I can certainly hold my own in a low stakes game. However, this book by Harrington has proven to be the most valuable and insightful poker book I have ever read (about poker). My eyes have been opened to subtle game concepts that I had not previously considered. I can honestly say this is the best poker book I have ever seen. His writing style and method of using examples seems clearer to me than any other I've read. What he says makes perfect sense, even to an amateur like me.Even before I had finished the book I could feel my game improving, I can't wait to read the second volume and see how my game is by the end of that.

His writings really drive home the importance of calculationg the odds regularly, not by giving complicated mathamatical results over the long term, but by using more easy to understand examples and everyday scenarios.I would say that this book could be read as a stand alone, how-to book for no-limit Hold em tournements. It does however only deal with the early and middle stages of tournements (He is releasing a volume two that will cover late stages and final table play).But I would certainly recommend reading Sklansky's book for a more thourough study of the game in general.Specifically Theory of Poker for a good understanding of, well Poker Theory.Hold em for advanced players for a solid understanding of how these theories apply to Hold em specifically, and for a good solid grasp of starting requirements and the value of specific hands.Tournement Poker for Advanced Players for some specialized theories related to tournement play.Harrington draws from all three of these books and refers to them in this book.Overall I would say its a good book (even with a few too many typos) and could be valuable to a begining player interested in tournement play, even if he hasn't read any other books. I also feel that even more seasoned players will enjoy it and be able to draw some good insights from it."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I wanted to add to the long list of positive reviews on this book by adding a few facts in which this book has improved my game. I've read some other books on No-Limit and I've played online for a little over a year and live play at a small poker room for almost 6 months. It wasn't until I read this book that my play drastically improved. I almost want to write a bad review to keep people from buying it and improving their own game. After finishing the book I went off to my local poker room to play in one of their weekly 100 person max NL tournaments. I have consistently been a 50/50 player at the sit n' go live tournaments, meaning I win money 50% of the time and lose money 50% of the time. I figured my play would improve from the knowledge in the book but I had no idea how much of an improvement I would have. I won! Yeah thats right, I won my first tournament larger than a sit n' go at live play after finishing the book. My online play win percentage has increased as well, I consistently finish in the money in major tournaments. I've finished in the money 11 of 15 of my last online tournemants with more than 1500 entrants and made 2 final tables. I consider this a drastic improvement and attribute the majority of my success to the knowledge in this book. I can't wait to finish and absorb volume II as it appears the endgame is where I need to improve at this point. The best part of the book for me is that it made everything \\"click\\" in my mind. I highly recommend the book and wish you all the disciplne and patience needed to win ~ luck is for losers :-)"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Thousands of words and reviews have been written for this book, so mine won't be anything new. I just want to say that when I first began playing poker and found out of tournaments, Harrington's suggestions (which by the way fitted my nitty attitude overall) were eye-opening and helped me to make my first steps to the world of Poker tournaments as a fish that got aware of it being a fish and starting to recognize the world around it. And that means it was the initial spark for my transforming for a clueless fish to a non-fish player. I won't say that I am a great player now or that this book made me a big player or such big mouth declarations, it is just a book that will help beginners advance well beyond the starting point and basics they probably know.For beginners on tournament play, even many years after its publication, this is the place to start studying..."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This is a great intro to tournament poker and I learned a lot reading it.

This is one of the gems. Many poker books feel hastily written and skimp on the challenging details of solid poker play. Harrington has certainly delivered with this first volume. The book is full of excellent example hands and thoughtful discussions on the finer aspects of hold 'em play. Read this book, and then get the other two volumes.One note: The book is definitely targeted to tournament play, so if you are specifically looking to improve your cash game, this book may not be the best choice."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"just got this book i have 14 poker books now but this is the best of all of em.no messing about like in most poker books with basic play, rules, how to play etcthis gets straight into the heart of a tournament by assuming that you already know how to play poker.at 374 pages long this is a good readonly on page 55 and already learnt a lot of thingscant wait to get book 2"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Very simply put, this book is extremely valuable in referene to teaching you how to mix up your game to the point where your opponets will always be guessing. It was one of the springboards for tournament play. Dan Harrington hits it directly on the head with this. I loved reading this book, although it is extremely long. The GOOD news about this book is that it will be used for a long period of time as a framework for other tournament books.

This should bethe first book you buy."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Knocked this book out in 7 days. It's difficult to put down. It's thought provoking, well-written, and most importantly easy to read. In no way am I an expert poker player, but it's taken my above-average live game skills and given it a new sense of purpose. It's a must have book that covers many different facets of the game really well. Volume II is on its way for me. I will keep this on handy as it's quite tempting to pick up again and re-read."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Action Dan's first book is a great step for fine tuning your holdem game. Any player from beginners to pros can really relish the amt of info this volume contains. It focuses on situations through aspects such as position, stack size, playing the players, observation, tells, and a lot more. One bonus for me was seeing Dan's value of hands and what action to take. Obviously, he's not saying that you shouldfollow every suggestion to the letter, but it does provide food for thought. Dan is known for his formidably tight game, but his trapping methods have proven beneficial as I've tried a few in actual holdem games with proven success.If you play tournaments, this book can aid your game vastly. Also, his ideas can also be applied to cash games esp on reraising and laying the hammer down on early raisers. My conclusion is that I'll most likely be getting Vol 2 & 3 as well."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This book payed for itself! I am a novice player who just started playing in a regular cash game with friends of mixed experience levels. In a short time (two weeks) I went from going out early to winning my first poker game using the skills in this book. the combination of theory and problems helped change how I see the game. I'm also enjoying playing the game more, and understanding it more. I'm naturally a bit more conservative a player and Mr. Harrington writes from that perspective, but his ideas about varying your play, betting patterns, hand analysis I think would be good for anyone to hear. I can't speak for more experienced players but a beginner with a desire to improve at the game and who doesn't mind working would do well to buy this book."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Dan Harrington's focus and strategy for No Limit Hold'em Tournaments is very insightful.

Excellent buy!!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This is an extremely good book on No Limit Hold 'Em. I have found Sklansky's books to be very useful, but for the most part, they contain a lot of math. This covers the basics of the math concepts, but also covers most other aspects of the game, and how the two fit together to play the game well.I've admittedly never entered a tournament and won. However, the concepts herein has helped in all my homegames. I would highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"If you're serious about your NLHE game then ALL of the Harrington on Hold'em books are required reading. I've read and re-read each of the volumes several times. I've seen my understanding of the game evolve in real time. There aren't any books better for NLHE tournament play. These books are worth at least 3 times their retail price.Dan Harrington is an elite poker player, having won the WSOP in 95 and making the final table in 03 and 04. Is there a better NLHE teach out there?I will say occassionally I have disagreed with some of his teachings, but rarely. One specific case is his chapter on heads up play. He says you should call from the small blind with almost any two cards because you will likely have the pot odds. True, but do you really want to waste your chips with 3-7 offsuit? Your opponent raises and then you've got to give up half a blind. Why not just fold the junk and raise with everything else (per John Vorhaus in Killer Online Poker 2)? I think while the chapter is technically correct it is not necessarily the best way to play, especially if you're playing in a 10 player sitngo tournament where the blinds may be quite high by the time you get heads up. Of course it could just be a matter of personal style. What works for one person doesn't necessarily fit for another. There are no absolute right ways to play poker, but there are many wrong ways."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"If you play no limit tournament Hold'em these two books are the definitive guides to successful play. Vol I deals with the early stages of a tournament when stack sizes are roughly the same, they are much larger than the blinds, and the money is far off in the distance.Vol II shows you what happens when those conditions break down. The blinds go up and the stack sizes become wildly different.He uses tons of examples to explain his ideas and concepts. Very well written."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I have read this book multiple times and it has increased my poker skills in house games with my friends significantly!

Learn from the best!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This series of books (and the review applies to all three) is not for the beginner. They assume that before you read this series, you have a basic working knowledge of the game. I would reccomend these books to anyone, but you won't really understand most of what is being discussed until you have played in about a dozen or so live tournaments, or at least fifty or so online games. These books are a must for those who have already read Supersystem 1&2 and maybe one or two of the 2+2 series on hold'em. Not only do these books have wonderful sections on theory, but they have a wealth of play-by-play analysis so the reader can take those ideas and see how they work in actual play. Most of the examples are from real games in which the author, or others, actually completed. Some of the examples are from widely seen televised events like the WSOP or the WPT. After playing for a number of years, and having read most of the books on the market, I was longing to take my game to a new level. These volumes were a godsend. I can't reccomend them enough."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"The most amazing poker book I've read (I'm writing about both volumes, as they are not dissociable). Not another one of those \\"read this and you'll be a winner\\" that finally only gives you basic stuff that anyone can read about on poker sites. It covers just about everything that matters to be a good Texas Hold'em tournament player (useful to both live and online players) - math and odds, stack strategy, making moves, playing the oponents, tournament inflection points, etc. I believe it's a \\"must have\\" to anyone wanting to get serious about Texas Hold'em. It's probably a bit complex for beginners, as it assumes the reader already knows the basic game and dives deep into strategy."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Very good book, excellent examples. I think it's a very good way to explain the tournament strategy.The odds chapter was a little bit confusing though, i think there are simpler (or at least faster) ways to calculate odds.But the book really improved my game, i definetly recommend it, i'll buy volume II soon."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I've read about ten Holdem books and another 20 poker books over the years. This is probably the best book I've read on Holdem (I've read Brunson(2), Helmuth, Gordon(3),Warren, Caro, Ciaffone/Brier -- all good). Harrington really knows his stuff (obviously). What surprized me most was the quality of the writing. I've written several books and knows what it takes to get a readable, enjoyable non-fiction book; it is really tough. Harrington organization, exposition and examples (problems) are all first rate. I'm going to buy the other two volumes. Any serious student of Holdem needs to read Harrington."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This book really taught me No Limit poker. The authors do a good job of explaining what are the important ideas for anyone wanting to win. It's not too mathematical.

At first I had trouble following his example table setups, but after moving about half way through the book I was able to follow them much better. I have gone back and reviewed the examples in the first of the book and they made much more sense. I would suggest reading the book in sections and then playing several games of Hold'em after each section. I think it would solidify the information in the book better. If you are a novice to this game there is a lot to digest in this book so don't try to sit down and read it all at once."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This book is as good as everyone here is telling you. After reading just the first half of the book, I have already started performing better in online NL tournaments.

I don't want any better competition out there!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I've read several poker books, and \\"Harrington on Hold 'em\\" is one of the best. Dan explains everything to you situationally, meaning he sets you up in certain situation and carefully explains how you, as the poker player, can work the most chips out of them. There are probably a hundred \\"problems\\" in which he walks you through a hand to a certain point, then stops and asks you what you would do. You work it out in your head, then turn the page and read what Dan would have done. Dan has a very conservative (or tight) style, and so do I, so this book was a great asset to me. If you play more open, and like to bet on Q7 offsuited, you may do well to look into one of Hellmuth's books (although I really dislike Hellmuth, his books are quality). There is a part 2 to \\"Harrington on Hold 'em\\", which discusses the endgame and how to finish the tournament with strength. I haven't ponied up and bought this one yet, but if it's anything like the first, it will be a great addition to my poker book library.

Harrington does a very good job at explaining how to read the betting habits of your opponents. I'm now much more competent at ( 1 ) playing aggressive and super-aggressive players, ( 2 ) varying my playing style up as appropriate so I'm not always tight-aggressive and ( 3 ) knowing when to call, raise or fold when I have been paying attention to the table.

To say that Dan Harrington's style is only good enough to sustain but not win is a ridiculous assertion. Had Moneymaker not made his only out on the river in the middle of 2003 World Series we wouldn't even know who Moneymaker is today. The fact that Harrington won the event in 1995 and came in third and fourth back to back in the largest fields ever to play in the Series is a testament to his greatness. I had a chance to read the first two chapters of this book and I'm about to buy it. I just have one word to describe this book - AWESOME. It gets into the minds of the top poker players and expertly applies a lot of poker theory that one reads about in the abstract to actual situation play. If you've read books on poker theory and find yourself scratching your head wondering what all of it means, this book really shines the light on how to apply it to real play. If you don't add this book to your poker book collection, you'll certainly miss out."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"About 80% of the way through...

This is a great book for beginners, but don't go telling me that that's who it's made for. I don't see anywhere on the book where it says \\"beginner's only.\\"He mainly goes over how to keep yourself out of trouble in a tournament. You WILL get run over playing like this against people who know what they are doing. Serious players will notice how you play and run over you. Don't get me wrong, Harrington is one of the greatest NLHE tournament players ever, but I think that's due in part to things that can't be put in a book like this.That said, this will help you boost your ROI on the small internet ($20 and less) SNG's since the players are so horrible.

I read Brunsen's Super System section on No Limit Hold em before I bought this book and it gave me a lot to learn but at the same time the motivations for a lot of strategy seemed to be lacking. I have just finished Harrignton's book (I've only had it for 4-5 days) and can say that for the most part everything is explained in great detail, motivation and all. This is a great help for a begginner such as myself to help understand somewhat of what it takes to play good poker. Obviously I didn't absorb nearly all the material by reading it just once (especially given my inexperience with the game) but the parts I have taken from it were nuggets. I definitely plan on re-reading this one a couple of times (probably taking notes) and am certainly looking forward already to volume 2.Though I haven't read the classics of poker (Slansky's and others) I would still reccomend this book to anyone who has a rough idea of what is going on in a no limit poler game (maybe played a few times or watched some TV and have a genuine interest in the game and would like to start playing). I'm guessing there is still lots in here for novices and maybe even those of you who have a great deal of experience (I say this only because of Harrington's success and assume that he has some wisdom to pass on).A highlight about this book is the numerous examples for you to go through. They are a great help too see how your poker skills rate (roughly).I bought this book based solely on the reviews here on Amazon and was not disappointed. (Well, when I read some of the reviews saying that they almost didn't want to reccommend it because they wanted all the knowledge for themselves, and I thought, \\"Come on. Enough already. I'm sure it's a great book, but you can't be really serious.\\" Now I find myself thinking a little along those lines myself. Disappointed that others have this great tool available to them.)"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Three things separate this poker book from all the others I have read (and I think I have read them all):1. It is in plain english.2. It gives clear and excellent problems for you to work out.3. It is well organized throughout.I suggest new poker players read Sklansky, \\"Theory of Poker\\" and this book. Sklansky does not write as clearly, but he gives you a good grounding in the basic mathematics of poker. Harrington will then give you an excellent introduction to the theory and practice of No Limit Hold'em."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This book, although accurate, is very technical. In fact, after reading it, my playing became worse because I was trying to remember and follow all the technical stuff. However, if you're new to the game there are many useful tips. It gives you a clear understanding of the order of things. Example: When playing Texas Hold'em you need to know your position with regard to the big/little blinds, the betting sequence and why it's important to know who you're following. For instance, a decision you make regarding your bet is different if you're the first to bet than it would be if you're 2nd, 3rd or even last. On the whole, it's a good reference but don't let it take the fun out of it or you won't do well."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I've read several Hold'em books, but they all were describing Limit Hold'em ring games rather than the type of game I usually play: No-Limit Hold'em tournaments. This book was exactly what I was needing. Many of the points I already knew, but didn't know the logic behind them and there were dozens of new ideas that I had never grasped before. This book helped me recognize the leaks in my game as well as the moves I was doing 'right' but couldn't reproduce consistently because I didn't understand them well enough. He describes how to play different styles as well as how to play against them, tricks and traps, pot odds and betting amounts (finally a realistic pot odds section) plus great information on reading the table and how to use the information you gather. The only problems that I had with the book was a few typos and the fact that Vol. 2 isn't out yet. I can't recommend this book highly enough. Just look at the ratings on this site. It isn't a fluke that 45+ people have all (except one) given this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Read this book first!!!!!!.I have never written a book review before. This book is certainly the best to start with. Skalansly'book are the best books, however, for a first time poker player its very very hard to undertand/grasp what he is talking about?. In that sense Skalansky's book are of less value to a beginner. After certain good amount of limit experience ( when you can consistently beat $1.00/$2.00 limit tables over a period of 5-6 months) and good amount of online NL tourney experince( when you can atleast breakeven on NL Tourney results over a period of 5-6 months) you can read Skalansky. They will then start to make sense.But for beginner Dan's is by far the best book I would say.I would rate any book on following criterions:(a)The content.(b)Organization.(c)How easily the content is well understood by the reader( intended reader only )?.Dan's book scores well on all three points.Note Skalansky's book scores poorly on point (c) as I am assuming a beginner/intermediate poker player reading. Skalansky will score high on point (c) when reader has gained some experience and can consistently beat the limit he is playing.Just to give an example, this is how Skalansky explains preflop play. He gives a table with each playable hand and a number representing a perticular group. (AA, KK, AQ are group 1) and QT,JT would be something like belonging to group 8. Then he goes on to say you can play so and so group in such and such position. To furthur confuse a beginners he also puts in exceptions like , well you can also play Group 2,3 suited here when you read a player to be lose raiser!!!. How can a begineer grasp all that?.Also what if on button and and there are two raises, now what can I still play all hands that are playable from button?.On the other hand Dan explains starting hands and play like this:(1) You are the first one to enter flop ( when no one has entered the flop yet, either you are the first one to act or players have folded down to you). Now he explains each position and how to play(raise,call) based on how many are yet to act after you and what cards you get.Same thing with cases:(2) There is a raise before you then explains how to play(raise,call) based on how many are yet to act after you and what cards you get.(3) There is a raise and reraise before you then explains how to play(raise,call) based on how many are yet to act after you and what cards you get.(4) There are one to many callers before you then explains each position and how to play(raise,call) based on how many are yet to act after you and what cards you get.(5) Also how to play when there is raise/reraise after you.Now things will make more sense to a beginner.Other good point he explains everything through his real world examples and how players are thinking when making plays. This will give you a good understanding on how to think like a pro!!. Then there are examples and exercise to work on with his solution and again containing the detailed though process you need to do while arriving at conclusion.In all I would suggest to buy this book strongly before going for Skalansky. BTW, if you can understand/grasp Skalansky then there is no need to buy this book. But then you won't be reading this review either and would already be a pro."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This is a terrible book. The book doesn't address going all in with 7-2 off suit like you should.Sorry, I have a feeling this book is going to hurt me in tournaments if all the fish start reading it. The best part of the book is bet sizing which no other book I've read really goes into. The is the last piece I needed to plug my last leak. I was sizing bets based on....well...some mystical feeling I suppose. This book made me, a conservative player, a serious force in live tournaments. The average players have no idea what to do with me now and the really good players show me a lot of respect and stay aaway form me in the early stages and let me build my stack. This book will pay for it a thousand times over.... as long as only a few people read it.

Anyway, it was not hard for me to read. It had GREAT advice for tournament play! things i never would think of without reading this. I got this a month before i turned 21, read it and prepared for my first tournament. I placed 15th out of 72 People at the borgata saturday morning 150+30 tournament. I was actually in second by far nearing the end, Pre-river i went all in with JJ vs the person with the most chips at my table, it was a rainbow and now strait draw so i knew he would only beat me with a higher pair. He called, flipped over an A,K the flop was a A or a K i forget. Anyway if it wasn't for that I would have played tight the next few hours and been at least in the bubble if not close to first.One reason i loved this book is, during the tournament and even loosing 90% of my stack to a nice river for him, I wouldnt change one way i played, i left the tournament with a smile, proud of every single decision i made on the table.Lots of luck to everyone, unless your playing me :)"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Terrific ideas on strategy.

After reading the reviews up here on Harrington's book, I decided to buy it. Boy, am I glad I did. I don't know why I'm putting this review up, because I've made some ok money in the few times I've played since reading the bood, and I can't understand why I would want others to play better, but I guess I owe a debt to those who gave great reviews before me.This book is very easy to read, I breezed through it in a matter of a couple of days. It has problems at the end of each chapter that test your skills and strategy. I found, as the book went on, that I was able to think more and more like Harrington suggests a good hold 'em player should. More importantly, I began succeeding in the poker clubs. I've used the thoughts from this book to play no limit and limit games at local card clubs, as well as in Las Vegas, where I made final table at a no limit tourney (and played a hand very well pre-flop that almost went my way and would've put me in the chip lead at that table had it stayed right).This book lays out strategy that sound intuitive once you consider it. He recommends a fairly conservative style of play, but when you begin understanding the way the table works, you realize that you can play other styles as well, using the tools he's equipped you with.All in all, a great book, and hope that Harrington makes more money from his poker than he does from this book, or it's trouble for all of us."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I am an amature player, playing mostly on-line and local casino tournaments and this book has made me a 100% better player.

This book will make you a better poker player if you have the desire to learn. I now have confidence in my play for the next tournament."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"The Bible has finally arrived. Because Super System is no longer as effective as it once was (it was written back when poker was conservative, but now with all the newcomers and maniacs its theories aren't applicable), the time has come for a comprehensive, NO LIMIT strategy book. Melmuth and Sklansky talk mostly about LIMIT strategy for cash games--this book covers it all--multi-table tourneys, satellites, sit and goes, online vs. live, etc.And yes, Harrington even discusses styles other than his own. I'm telling you, this is the best poker book around, even better than the Cloutier/McEvoy book, which in my mind, was the best No-Limit tourney book ever until now.Read it and weep with joy."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Although this is a two volume set, the books should really be considered as one, so I have reviewed them as such. These books are the best publications on NL Hold'em tournaments to date.Dan Harrington does an excellent job of detailing complex strategies and how they change through the course of any given tournament. He even goes so far as to break down different styles of tournaments and how you should adjust play for each (i.e. major big buy-in, single table satellite, major online, single table online etc.) and examines all of these types within his problems throughout the book.The book is impossible to summarize due to the wealth of knowledge in the book and the detail that Dan puts into his strategies and analysis. A couple of highlights include Dan comparing different playing strategies (Loose-aggressive, tight-aggressive, etc.) and how to play and play against each. Just because Dan is a tight player himself, his vast experience gives him more than enough knowledge to teach any style. Dan goes through some of the basic components found in many poker books: starting hands, pot odds, continuation bets, slow-playing, semi-bluffing etc. But then will get into deep analysis of many complicated facets of tournament strategy that the average player may have never heard of. His analysis of M&Q; and how it relates to your play as the tournament progresses, complicated moves (squeeze play, sandbagging, back-alley mugging, rope-a-dope to name a few), end play and heads-up play are some things rarely found in other books that alone will advance your game tremendously.Dan's in-depth and detailed analysis is what sets these books apart from any other book. He doesn't just explain bluffs, but goes on to explain when to bluff, how to bluff, how much to bet when bluffing, the type of player to bluff, the stack size to bluff against, why you only bluff when you have absolutely nothing, the expected return on bluffing, cards that come on the on the board that send a red flag (this may surprise many, but a 10 on the flop is one of the worse cards) and so on. This type of analysis is used on bluffing, semi-bluffing, slowplaying, check-raising and every other aspect of the game. He doesn't just talk about pot odds, but reversed odds, implied odds, and then teaches you how to not only use them yourself, but how to take them away from the player in the hand against you.Other things that impressed me are Dan is the first to give credit were credit is due, noting that many ideas come from other offers and players. Dan will also send you to other books that cover certain ideas that better than he could insert into his book. For example, he immediately references David Sklansky (of course) on the subject of pot odds, and Mike Caro on tells. Dan barely even touches on the topic of physical tells, but rather basically says that Caro has already covered it better than anyone else ever could, so I'm not going to discuss it, just read his book. Dan does say that the primary physical tell he looks for his hand movements stating that people are aware of their facial expressions but not their hand movements. Dan also states that physical tells, though important, are somewhat over rated and that betting patterns are actually more important stating \\"Not everyone has a tell, but everyone HAS to bet.\\"Overall, a great book that is full of information and even well written and an easy read. I recommend reading the books multiple times, because you will be surprised the second time through the stuff you missed the first time."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Dan Harrington's book is the most sophisticated, subtle, and comprehensive treatment of hold-em poker in tournament format that I have found. This is not just a book to pick up and browse through; it is a master class in every aspect of play, money management, and psychology.This first volume is subtitled Strategic Play, and covers basics and fundamentals of solid play, of finding your own style, of understanding just what a real hand is and what it is not, as well as betting strategy for most any situation. Reading Harrington go into these issues is fascinating, but the real value of the book is then dealing with the 'problems' (actual poker situations) which escalate in subtlety and complexity. To skip over these examples or to read them lightly is to deny yourself an education. By going through them again and again, with Harrington's running analysis, is to really understand what is going on, why, and how to play one's best. Volume II also has a wealth of these problems, and I understand Volume III will be all problems.Harrington's style has been characterized is very conservative; after reading this book you'll know first of all that it is not actually true, and second, why the perception works so well for him.This is an invaluable study tool for anyone serious about poker tournament play,"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Harringtons book is about the sixth book i have read on No Limit hold em. I found that after a certain amount of understanding of the game, information becomes somewhat repetative to the advanced player. I had read about pot and implied odds quite a bit before but i always seemed to find myself making quick calls without really speculating the hand. Harringtons book talks about these concepts with great detail while making them simple to understand. If you implement these strategies into live poker as well as online, results will be seen quickly and often. Definetely the best read on No Limit hold em i have come across. I recommend this book for the player that has a decent grasp of most concepts already, but i don't think it should be the first book you read on hold em. Definetely a must read for anyone trying to succeed at poker."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I didn't realize how little I knew about no-limit hold-em until I read this book. Although I've been playing for awhile and have been moderately successful, this book brought my game to a whole new level. True story, I finished this book on a Saturday afternoon, that night I entered an on-line tournament (with over 1300 others) and finished third.This book had me thinking about things I had never previously considered (or only thought of in abstract terms). The book provides clear and concise analysis of most issues. Sections deal with things such as; the importance of table position in deciding whether to enter a hand, the importance of understanding playing styles (and recognizing that perception is not always reality), the use of pot odds and dealing with aggressive players. In particular, I found Harrington's advice to go against type and play aggressively when the pay-out cut-off grows close (while most players tighten up hoping to finish in the money) helpful. It has won me a lot of chips.I can't over-emphasize how helpful this book is. If you are serious about poker, buy it."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This Volume I edition contains a thorough treatment of playing in no-limit tournaments. Like any hold'em book, every possible hand cannot be covered, but the many examples in this book help make Harrington's material very comprehensible.I want to focus on the one section that is developed much better than in other tournament poker books, which is Part Five: Betting Before the Flop. This part begins with the Basic Hold'Em Strategy, which is the key to deciding whether or not to see the flop. Harrington notes that many players call too often to see the flop because they reason that if the blinds are low relative to their stacks, they can limp-in and see the flop cheaply. But what do you do when you hit middle or bottom pair and don't have much other potential because you came in with mediocre cards? One of the benefits of playing good cards is that your decision on whether to play after the flop becomes easier. As part of Harrington's Basic Strategy, he provides suggestions on what percentage of the time to raise x times the big blind, y times the big blind, and z times the big blind, depending on your position. The reason for the x y z mix is so that you won't become too predictable.Part Five is way too long to use for a quick review prior to each time playing. What I do is review the suggested raises in Part Five and then review overall hold'em strategy by using the Poker 6-7-8 Hold'Em Strategy Cards by Hal Marcus. His compact, fit-in-your-pocket, two-card guide contains virtually the same strategy that's in Part Five of Harrington's book. The strategy on the Poker 6-7-8 Hold'Em Strategy Cards is a little tighter (you don't play quite as many hands) than the strategy in Part Five of Harrington's book because Part Five is based on 9 players at the table, while the Poker 6-7-8 Hold'Em Strategy Cards are based on 10 players. But no-limit tournaments typically use 10-player tables, and when I'm playing on the Internet I always keep my Poker 6-7-8 Hold'Em Strategy Cards right in front of me so I can refer to them whenever I'm not absolutely sure about what to do, which is nearly all the time except for obvious folding situations."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I have read I would say 80% of all the poker books that have been published, good and bad.

Every book that comes after may agree, disagree, or clarify what a definitive book has to say on its subject, but there is one thing subsequent books can't do: they can't ignore it. If you're a serious tournament poker player, you can't ignore the Harrington series. This is THE classic text on Texas hold em poker tournament strategy, bar none.Vol. 1 is meant as a beginning installment in the series. You have to learn to walk before you can run, so Harrington lays out a fairly conservative, straight-forward strategy here. He advocates playing tight, not bluffing, and betting according to the relative strength of your hand. Towards the end of the volume he begins to consider various moves you can make at the poker table, but generally this is ABC poker.If that doesn't sound particularly exciting, remember that you're first task as a poker player is avoiding obvious leaks in your game. Even experienced players begin to develop such leaks over time as we become overly confident, and many beginning players will save themselves a lot of trouble by following Harrington's basic advice. Vols. 2 and 3 will vary the mode of play and show you how to change gears to match your opponents. It's largely the latter two volumes that make Harrington's series the classic text on tournament poker strategy. This is the foundation for those volumes.I'd also recommendThe Poker Tournament FormulaandPoker Tips that Pay: Expert Strategy Guide for Winning No Limit Texas Hold emfor readers that are looking beyond the Harrington series, for additional hand-based poker strategies and techniques.

Therefore, I decided to invest a little money in Harrington's book on tournament play instead of investing (losing, actually) much, much more in actual play.Early in the book Harrington and Robertie share their views on how a typical discussion might go between a beginner seeking advice on a hand he'd played and the top player whom he approaches. Then follows a list of almost a dozen factors that should be considered in a given hand, the last one listed being the cards dealt to you.The book covers such different factors as playing styles (yours and those of others at your table), pot odds and hand analysis, your table position for the hand, and important considerations in your decision-making before and after the flop, on Fourth Street, and on the River. Each chapter has several \\"problems\\" or quizzes to test the reader, derived from hands played in past tournaments.Early in the book Harrington also shares a hand played at the final table of the 2003 World Series of Poker. No one went all-in on the hand. There was no great showdown after the river card, and no one was eliminated; in fact, everyone but the pot winner eventually folded. When I first read the chapter I wasn't really sure why I should be impressed with, or even interested in, his narration of the hand. Having now finished the book and begun to go back over it, the chapter speaks volumes.Will this book automatically make you or anyone else who reads it a winner in tournament play? No. But it should give you a long-term advantage over players who aren't willing to take the time to study the game and analyze each hand as a unique situation. I'm impressed enough with it that I've recently ordered the other two volumes in the tournament series."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This is a well written and clear description of the basics of no limit hold'em tournament play. If you are a beginner like me you'll have tons of great information on how to play the first levels of a tournament. Examples are well chosen to give you an insight to how to react to different scenarios. The book gives you good advice on when to bet and how much to bet.The information is well explained and easy to understand. I'm sure that anyone wishing to develop his tournament skills will benefit from reading this book. Maybe this is not the perfect first poker book to read, but if you have some experience on tournaments and Texas hold'em and want to take your game to next level this is perfect choice. If you're an experienced tournament player you probably know this stuff already.This book covers the early stages of tournaments and I think the vol. 2 of this series is about the later phases of the game. I'm currently waiting for the next part to arrive for I wish to learn how to proceed to the final rounds and bigger prizes."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This is an excellent book. The writing is clear and uncluttered, and the material well-organized and thoughtfully presented.The best part of the book is the many, many, many examples that describe certain situations and then ask you what is the \\"right\\" action given the circumstances. Even if you don't agree with Harrington's approach in every case, he frames the problems and issues well and forces you to question your intuition in various situations. It's a very fun book for anyone who both loves poker and who is willing to tolerate a little math."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Happy new year,All was perfect.

A very valuable tool for the poker player tring to increase his odds of winning a Texas Hold Em tournament."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"All 3 books in this series are great. I wish it was possible to award more than 5 stars because these books are much better than the typical book that gets a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I have had fun stealing my friends money for the past few years at home games. I wanted to get to the next level and play in large casino tournaments. 48 hours before my second ever live tourney, I received this book. I read the first 250 pages, and entered the tournament. EVERYTHING Harrington talks about was right on.It felt like I was cheating. 81 man tourney and I finished 5th. From the player types, betting, opening the pot, pot odds, and pre/post flop betting, Harrington gives you an inside look into NLHE tourneys. Can't wait to get back to my local casino and start beating on all the fish!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This book may seem like heavy reading to someone who is new to hold 'em. After gaining a little bit of book knowledge (through lighter readings) and gaining some table experience, however, this book is exactly the type of resource needed to take one's game to the next level. Poker is complicated because of multiple players with varying styles, changing table position, a near infinitude of card combinations, and rising blinds. Analyzing a hand of poker to determine how to get the most value out of the situation is so much more than evaluating where a hand falls on a poker hand ranking chart. Fully analyzing a single hand of poker is so complex that most poker books focus on just a couple of aspects of a particular hand. Harrington's book gets much more in depth, opening the doorway to a much higher level of poker thinking."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"strategy (noun): a plan, method, or series of maneuvers or stratagems for obtaining a specific goal or result.As the title indicates, this textbook spells out Harrington's tournament strategy. It is not a collection of tactics, but a comprehensive treatment of winning tournament play.Unlike some other well-known poker texts, the writing in this book is clear, unambiguous, and profesionally edited. Harrington is concerned with giving you the facts as he sees them, rather than with self-promotion or opinion. Although Harrington teaches you how he approaches a problem, he doesn't hide the fact that there are other styles of play that can be considered equally valid. After reading this text, you will have a thorough understand of the differences between all the major tournament strategies, their strengths and weaknesses, and which strategy best fits your personality.Bad poker players blunder their way through tournaments: betting when their cards are favorable, checking when they are scared, and attempting the occasional outrageous bluff in hopes of doubling their stack when nothing else seems to be working. These players know all the tactics, but misapply them. Luck is the ultimate decider of their fate.Good poker players, on the other hand, have an overall tournament strategy.Harrington introduces you to the various tournament strategies, and teaches you how to apply them to your play.The value of this textbook is in the wealth of examples it provides. For each major concept or tactic, Harrington describes perhaps a dozen scenarios that illustrate the idea, and teaches you how to think about the hand the same way a pro would -- with a level-headed, rational approach to the problem.\\"Harrington on Hold 'em, Vol. 1\\" is far and away the best tournament NL Hold'em textbook. This is a must-read for any tournament player.If you are a tournament pro, you already think you know everything there is to know about poker tournaments. However, you should still read this book because your opponents undoubtedly have.If you are a beginner, Harrington will show you how to think about a tournament as a single event, rather than as a collection of unrelated hands of poker. You will get a feel for overall tournament strategy, instead of relying on luck or resorting to playing hunches.This text is the best of the best, don't miss it."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Like many players, I thought I knew how to play. Then I read this book and Harrington really opened my eyes. I have been playing for 3 years and read 5 or 6 poker books. Harrington's book is far superior to any other. It takes you into the mind of a poker professional like no other book does. He takes concepts and then gives problems where the reader follows along to see how he thinks. It almost feels like Harrington is giving away every secret and I wonder if other professionals are upset at him.Read, reread, and then play. Then reread again. If you do this, your play will markedly improve."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This book is great. I read it on a trip, came home, and won my first 45 player tournament. I was doing OK before but this book greatly improved my game.The examples add up to give a feel and understanding for how to play. Concepts are explained and then followed up with good examples to show how the concepts are applied."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend and after I read it I won 2 of the next 4 tournaments I played in using his conservative style of play. When I went on cold streak I read it again and got back on track playing much better poker. I ordered it from Amazon before I gave it back to my buddy so I would always have as a refernces and I also bought Vol 2.. If your serious about improving your game buy this book."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I have read about 8 or 9 of the main poker books on Holdem within the past year. This book and volume 2 are the absolute best I have read. Most other books talked about general concepts and included a lot of self praise by the authors. This book gets into the details of various strategies and structured decision making. Every chapter includes several sample hands with various situations and commentary about how to think through each situation. The problems are realistic and show many hands that you lose even when you make the correct decision. Instead of buying a new book on poker, I have just started reading volume 1 again. If you're already familiar with how to play a Texas Holdem tournament, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I bought BOTH of Harrington's books on Hold \`em tournament strategy, partly based on the reviews of others. It's all true. As I write this I've read Vol. 1 (twice...see below) and I'm almost finished with Vol. 2. No, I didn't go out and win my first tournament once I finished the book (I had won a few before playing online), but I AM playing better...and smarter. And that's the beauty of these books - Dan makes you THINK. There are many things to think about...and damned if Dan doesn't know \`em all. But it's a very easy to read book, very well written and thought out, and the \\"story problems\\" (exercises in the back of every chapter) help to put things together, and in perspective. I thought I played well before I bought these books - I now know I didn't know squat (and I was ripe for the pickin's). I still have a long way to go before I even approach players of Harrington's caliber, but at least I understand the plays they make when they're at the final table!"},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I Loved the format it was well organized and easy to understand.The sample hands definitely helped improve my game.

The author does an extraordinary job explaining clearly and with plenty of examples all the relevant factors to consider during NL tournament play. The text is well edited, logical, and direct.I can safely say that after reading his books I have a solid foundation in my tournament game and have acquired solid default rules for typical situations, e.g. raising AK on flop and making a continuation bet.I have read Kill Phil, the Little Green Book, and Making the Final Table - none are comparable. Harrington's books (and no doubt Vol. III soon to be released) are must haves in any serious poker player's library. While I have only a small sample size, I have no doubt that my game has definitely improved."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Absolutely one of the best for the intermediate and upper level players.

The book doesn't address going all in with 7-2 off suit like you should.Sorry, I have a feeling this book is going to hurt me in tournaments if all the fish start reading it. The best part of the book is bet sizing which no other book I've read really goes into. The is the last piece I needed to plug my last leak. I was sizing bets based on....well...some mystical feeling I suppose. This book made me, a conservative player, a serious force in live tournaments. The average players have no idea what to do with me now and the really good players show me a lot of respect and stay away from me in the early stages and let me build my stack. This book will pay for it a thousand times over.... as long as only a few people read it.

Most of the other books out there cover the basics, rehash some common strategies, throw in some anecdotes, and pepper in a few good nuggets.

In another chapter he show you how to focus on how the other players see you. Knowing how they see you will help you to analyze what you should do based not on how YOU see yourself but on how OTHERS in the game see you.

Instead, I will focus on what is important to me and should also be important to you -- Results.Before reading these books I was doing well at 9 handed $25 buyin online turbo sit and gos. But every time I tried to parlay my winnings from the $25 tables and try out the $55 s&gs;, I got killed. I never came close to making it in the money (third place) and was usually among the first three to be put out of the tournament.After reading these books, I struggled for about a week at the $25 tables while I merged my new knowledge with my own style of play (and adjusted for the fact that the players at online $25 tables don't exactly play like the pros that Dan H. is used to playing with). Once I started winning again at the $25 tables, I tried the $55s once again. First night, I played one $55 s&g; won the tournament and walked away. Next night, I played another $55 s&g; and another first place finish.

Props to 2+2 for publishing yet another classic and props to \\"The Cincinnati Kid\\" quote at the beginning."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"No limit hold'em, obviously, is a complex game. So complex that there has never been a good comprehensive treatment in a book form; I had thought that this was because it involves more \\"table feel\\", experience and intuition that can't be easily taught or expressed in a useful format.Harrington and Robertie have done just that. Harrington is the 1995 world champion, and the only player to make the final table in both 2003 and 2004, overcoming the two biggest fields in World Series history (839 and 2,576 players, respectively). Robertie is a top backgammon player and author of several excellent books on that game.Among the top players, there are drastically different styles of play, from conservative to super-aggressive. One problem I expected was that given Harrington's solid, fairly conservative style, he wouldn't be able to give much useful information on playing at the other end of the end of the spectrum, styles such as those employed by Daniel Negreanu and Gus Hansen.I was wrong. The book does a fine job addressing the relative merits of various styles, playing against each type of opponent, and even choosing one for yourself. This makes sense; no matter his own style, to be successful he has to have spent a lot of time thinking about, observing, and combatting all different types of players. Further, a playing style isn't cast in stone; even the most conservative players have to switch gears and become much more aggressive at times, and vice versa.A few more notes on this idea: first, Harrington's own play as described isn't as conservative and cautious as many think. Second, a fairly conservative approach is demonstrably the more sound one for the student, and anyone without many years of experience. Hyper-aggressive play would be much harder to teach well, and also much harder to pull off successfully. The players who thrive playing these aggressive, gambling styles have exceptional talent as well as lots of experience and a great feel for the game and their opponents, and are faced with difficult decisions under lots of pressure much more often. For those who insist on trying, it probably still makes more sense to learn a fundamentally sounder style first and then proceed from there.The book is laid out well for learning. Each chapter starts with a discussion of the topic, touching on the theory. There are several example situations with the authors' answers and detailed reasoning, as well as the merits of alternative plays. Following each chapter there are problems, mostly from real hands. It provides a diagram of the table, the chip counts for each player, your knowledge of the opponents, etc... all the relevant information. The problems usually provide all this information even when some of it is irrelevant to the problem, which is a strength. A big part of the decision-making process in poker (as well as lots of other things) is recognizing and eliminating extraneous details to make analysis more managable.This is the first in a two volume set. I thought this was odd, as this is first for 2+2 poker books, but the first volume is bigger than most of their others already. The book is self-contained; there are no partial answers or information that tell you to buy the second volume for the details. I don't think there has been an official announcement on when Volume 2 will be released, but I've heard sometime this spring.The book is geared specifically toward tournaments, and especially toward those with well-defined formats, such as major casino/cardroom events and those on the Internet. For cash game players, a solid understanding of tournament and poker theory would be necessary to make the appropriate adjustments to cash play. Most of the book would still apply, but some situations would change drastically in a side game, where simply getting your money in with an advantage, rather than survival, is the main goal.For those newer to poker, to get the most out of this book, I would recommend a few others be read either first or at the same time: \\"The Theory of Poker\\" by David Sklansky, \\"Small Stakes Hold'em\\" by Miller, Sklansky and Malmuth, and \\"Winning Low Limit Hold'em\\" by Lee Jones, especially for the newest players.UPDATE FOR VOLUME II:Many of the same comments apply to Volume II, which is more of a continuation of the first than a separate book (even the chapter numbering picks up where the first left off). It focuses on the endgame; the late stages where everyone left is in the money and the blinds are relatively very large. They use the ideas of zones and inflection points to give effective generalized advice about different situations, evaluating your chip position relative to both the size of the blinds and the other remaining players.The last few sections cover short-handed and heads-up play, where strategy often changes radically. In most tournaments the table only gets heads-up at the very end and doesn't last very long, but the difference between first, second and third place is huge, even millions in the biggest events. Given that one position makes such a big difference, strategies changes dramatically, and most players have little experience heads-up, this material is extremely valuable.A third volume is in the works, in workbook style with problems and examples, which should nicely complement and review the material in the first two."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Every time I read a 'poker book', my play seems to suffer until I can figure out how to incporate the new thoughts I have with my style of play. Not true with this book - in some instances my style of play felt 'validated', and in others, I learned where my style of thinking was differing from a 'professional'.This book has a different 'style' from other books - it doesn't start with lame advice like 'hand rankings'... it runs down the difference between amateur and professional thinking - things like position, bets a multiples of the blinds, etc. it then talks you through scenario after scenario from real poker situations, asks you what you would do, then explains how he would have thought about it. These scenarios are grouped into sections with 3-5 hands designed to 'teach a lesson'.This is truly a magnificent book - the first of its kind that I have found that teaches the person who already knows how to 'play', really how to PLAY."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I bought this book the other day and was rather skeptical about how good it would be, but, now that I finished it, I can honestly say that Harrington on Hold \`em is the best book on poker that I have ever read. Am I over-exaggerating? No. The secret of this manual is that, while he expresses many of the same thoughts and ideas as other poker players/writers, he is far superior to them in the teaching of technique and strategy.As a teacher, Harrington is a master. Every page is crystal clear and comprehensible which is considerably more than I can say about the works of his publisher, David Sklansky. The lingo was in keeping with our common poker tongue, and I never had difficulty imaging the situations he described; whereas, with Super System I, while I totally recommend it, there were times when I could not apply Doyle's counsel to my own game due to a lack of skill. Such a situation never arose with Harrington on Hold \`em. Many of my faulty and defeatist habits at the table were identified, and, more importantly, the manual helped me understand just how much careful attention needs to be paid to the betting patterns of my opponents.The strongest segments in the book are \\"The Problems\\" sections. They are found at the end of each chapter or part. Harrington uses them to \\"show\\" us information after he has already taught the concepts. These scenarios grab us by the wallet and place us atop the championship felt. The funniest, and most unique, thing about his examples is that Harrington observes the hands from a vantage point high above the players. He tells us what should be done and then often has to shake his head when the player analyzed does the complete opposite. Regardless of the quality of the amateurs, Harrington follows along and makes the best of their bad situations while being careful to point out how much trouble would have been avoided had the right play been initiated in the first place.Early on, \\"Action\\" Dan makes clear that he will be using examples from online play (and then does so extensively) which is extremely helpful for the majority of us who do not reside near one of the gambling Meccas. Most of the scenarios come from the commonly-played online single table satellites. Harrington, rather surprisingly, knows all about the pitfalls and characteristics of internet poker, and, time after time, illustrates how a particular play succeeds in a brick and motor card room but not on the web-and vice versa.Dan Harrington was the perfect person to write a book like this. Other than Texas Dolly, he has the most gravitas out of any of the poker luminaries. He won two bracelets in 1995, and finished at the final table two years running (2003 and 2004). Practically nobody else has the combination of experience and contemporary success as he, and his intelligence stands out like a flush in this initial volume."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Seems like everyone loves this book!I bought it because I had just started playing a weekly tournament where I live and wanted to improve my game. Why do something if you can't be good at it, and why learn from your own mistakes (at cost) when you can learn from someone else's (free)?This book paid for itself immediately. Some of the fundamental concepts in this book seem extremely obvious once they've been pointed out to you, but cost real money until you grasp them. Others I already been using somewhat intuitively, but by examining them I apply them better.His tight pre-flop play, for example, was a sea change. Throwing away cards that I don't even want to get hit on the river instead of limping in to see the flop not only save me the blind when I miss the flop, but also the subsequent bets trying to defend the second-best hand when my 9 pairs up. Basic stuff, but how many hands/rounds/sessions of losing would it have taken me to figure out that mediocre hands cost more than trash hands? At $20, Harrington's book was the cheaper choice. How much money would it have cost me to discover the connection between an opponents stack size relative to the blinds and his playable hands? A lot more than $20, that's for sure!Furthermore, the book deals very well with the concept of pot odds -- something I as a beginner had a hard time grasping and calculating under pressure, but which is helping transform my game from purely intuitive towards odds-based -- a good thing when one's lack of experience makes one's intuition suspect.Obviously, there are tricks and stratagems in the book for the advanced player (which I'm studying furiously as well), but it's the solid presentation of the fundamentals that make this book and it's follow-up volume.The problems at the end of the chapters are also extremely valuable, if for no other reason than because they keep you from just skimming through the chapters and recognizing concepts instead of actually learning them. Many times I found myself challenged by the problems and having to go back and review -- again, a lesson that would have cost me cash only cost me time.I've already transformed my game and am a noticeably stronger player than before. While it's been hard to make the style adjustment, the returns are making up for it: I'm no shark yet, but I'm making money in the cash games as well as the tournaments, and against people who have been playing much, much longer than I.If you play hold-em for any kind of money at all, invest a few dollars and by this and the second book in the series."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This book wildly surpassed my expectations. I have read several poker books and I am a big fan of Sklansky and Malmuth's books in particular. Having read so many books on poker already it is rare that I find one that contains much new information. Mr. Harrington's book was a delightful exception. It seems as though he truly held nothing back and revealed the full spectrum of his tournament strategy for the early rounds (at least as much as possible for such a situation-dependent game).I highly recommend this book for beginners and experienced players alike (although I recommend the beginners \\"fill out\\" their poker knowledge with other books as well). I definitely recommend it over _Pot Limit and No-Limit Poker_ by Ciaffone and Reuben, and _Championship No-Limit and Pot-Limit Hold 'em_ by Cloutier and McEvoy. An aspiring expert should read all of these books eventually, but Mr. Harrington's is definitely the superior treatise on the subject of No-Limit Hold 'em--buy his book first.I hope this review was helpful to you."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"No-limit play is different from limit play; tournament play is different from ring-game play. In tournaments the blinds come marching irrepressibly around, and they get bigger and bigger. In a ring game, they march around but they stay the same size. What this means is that there is a certain urgency in tournament no-limit that doesn't exist in a ring game.Harrington, one of the top players in the world, and a dead-on scientific and shrewdly psychological player, who is also a master chess player and a world class backgammon player, emphasizes this difference by making this book just volume one of a two-volume set. The second volume is sub-subtitled, \\"The Endgame\\" and focuses on the later stages of tournaments.How valuable is this book? For the tournament player I would say that there is only one other book that is even in the same league; that's David Sklansky's Tournament Poker for Advanced Players. But this book is better. Harrington's nearly exhaustive approach out-Sklanskys Sklansky. Scores of hands are analyzed in minute detail, the analysis typically covering several pages of text. Harrington begins with a diagram of the table, showing \\"your\\" position and that of the other players seated. He gives the amounts in each player's stack, the size of the blinds, the stage in the tournament (just starting, early, middle) and what kind of tournament it is, major, online, etc. And he identifies conservative and aggressive players.Next he gives \\"your\\" hand and the action to you. For example, you have TdTh on the button and Player A passes, Player B raises x number of dollars....and now it's up to you. What I love about these illustrative hands is that Harrington gives first an analysis of the factors that a professional player would consider at that point, and then he gives his recommendation: fold, call, raise x number of dollars, etc.; and then he tells what \\"you\\" actually did--which is sometimes or even often, the wrong thing. And then he continues the hand to the flop and often all the way to the river, commending on every action.How much to bet, Harrington says, can be calculated almost exactly in some cases. If you have top pair and you believe your only opponent is on a draw, you need to bet enough to make it unprofitable for him to call. If it is a turn bet and the pot is $900 and he has a flush draw he has a 9/46 = 19.57% chance of hitting his hand, or about one in five. So you need to bet more than one third of the pot to make it a mistake for him to call. But, as Harrington cautions several times in the book, you do not want to foolishly bet more than is necessary. Going all-in--an irresistible thrill for some tournament players--is silly when you can get the same result by betting a smaller amount.Another nice point that Harrington makes is that whenever there is a bet and you are trying to figure out what the bettor has and whether you should call or not--always more of an art than a science, which is one of the great things about poker--you should put the probability of a bluff at at least ten percent.What the reader realizes is that no-limit tournament hold'em poker is a very complex game and that there are almost always many things to consider before making any decision. Sometimes of course the decision is easy. You have the nut flush on an unpaired board at the river and it's bet to you. You raise, of course. But wait a minute! Is there somebody behind you yet to act? Maybe you should just call and try to get an overcall. And, by the way, just how much should you raise? Even if there is nobody else in the pot but you and the bettor, you need to consider just how big a raise he is likely to call. If you bet too much he may not call. If you bet too little you may not get as much out of the hand as you might.You might say, Whoa, not everybody at the top plays this way. Surely Johnny Chan, for example, in his prime did not stop and figure out every angle before proceeding. He acted and reacted with lightning speed. Yes, but that is only because he had already figured out all the angles, had added them up and totaled them, so to speak as he went along; and when his opponent acted or he saw the next card, he knew exactly what he wanted to do. Instantly, and perhaps somewhat unconsciously.The \\"natural\\" player as opposed to the \\"scientific\\" player considers the same factors before acting, but he or she may put a different emphasis on certain values. The natural player may value position more than the scientific player (or it could be vice-versa), but regardless both players take into account the very factors that Harrington delineates before acting.One thing that really made me sit up and notice is that Harrington's theory about profitable player styles includes not only his fairly conservative style, but the \\"aggressive\\" style and the \\"super-aggressive\\" style. His main point is that the more aggressive your style, the more alert, intense and sharp-witted you have to be. Wild players CAN win, but they have got to be able to read both the action and the other players extremely well since they are often walking the razor's edge.Bottom line: Harrington's mastery of the game and his clear instruction make this a mandatory read for the aspiring tournament hold'em player."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"As other reviews have pointed out, it distills Sklansky's and Brunson's thoughts into digestible form. I thought it stood out from both of those books, though, for 2 reasons: its flexibility and its personal style.Harrington is of course known for a particular style of play, and he explains its merits in the text. He also explains its disadvantages, though, and presents alternative approaches with a balanced review of their strengths and weaknesses.Moreover, the book is written in a wry, personal, occasionally very funny tone, and was fun to read. The practice hands are extremely deep and well-explained.One minor complaint (also noted by another reviewer) is that there are a number of mildly irritating typos and grammar errors; I'm the sort of person who gets annoyed at such things, though, and it didn't hamper my enjoyment of the book.I eagerly await the second volume."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"I would just like to say that I have read over 14 books on poker, won tournaments, and I was fortunate to be in the 2003 WSOP.That said, I read this book and realized that I still have a LOT of holes in my game REGARDLESS of my playing style.I learned that I haven't been tracking my opponent's betting patterns as much as I should be. I learned that I have been giving my opponent's proper odds to make calls in certain situations because I didn't pay enough attention to the money in the pot. I learned how to apply some of the lessons in Theory of Poker to NLHE Tournaments (i.e. make your opponents make mistakes) thanks to the examples/problems/exercises in this book. I wasn't making enough calls pre-flop because I was too focused on staying alive in the tournament (because of Cloutier/McEvoy books which I will discuss next) instead of looking at pre-flop pot odds. I wasn't paying enough attention to what players thought of me to use that at different stages of the tournament.I have a lot of the Cloutier/McEvoy books and one of their main points in surviving a tournament is to throw pot odds out the window because you can get busted out of a tournament on any given hand. Basically: Don't play hands like J-10 suited or 9-8 suited in the blinds or late position in a tournament even if it's only $20 more to call an early position raiser with $10-$20 blinds because those are chip-burners you'll need later to double up when you have AA or KK.Harrington claims that Pot Odds are Paramount. Page 375. And I believe him now. While I have had success playing big hands and big pairs, I have always realized that I need to loosen up my starting requirements, but now I realize HOW to loosen up my starting requirements IF Pot Odds are favorable to me and I won't be making a \\"mistake\\". (As always, \\"it depends\\" on a lot of factors before you play these hands) It's not that I didn't play the occasional K-J suited or Q-10 suited for another bet, it's that I wasn't even THINKING about how I was getting great odds pre-flop. Poker is a thinking game, and I see that I need to do a lot more thinking when I'm playing.When I have won tournaments or done well, the stars and planets were pretty much in alignment. The AK beats the pair, the pair beats the AK. But that doesn't happen often enough to justify entering the number of tournaments I entered in 2003. I had holes in my NLHE Tournament game that I can take care of now thanks to this book.I've read SuperSystem, Theory Of Poker, Championship Series, Tournament Hold 'Em by Sklansky, and a whole bunch of other books and they all had a lot of great information. I honestly thought this book would be more of the same, but it wasn't.I learned in Harrington's book how to use what I've learned in those other books (particularly Theory Of Poker) and how to open up my starting hands quite a bit.No Limit Tournaments will always be big money tournaments, at least for the next 100 years. If you're going to play in those tournaments, I recommend that you get this book and hold it in the same esteem as the other poker \\"classics\\" because this one holds it own with SuperSystem, Theory Of Poker, and the Championship Series."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"This book renders most others obselete. It is simply the most advanced theory of No Limit Hold'em ever given in a public format, putting you inside the genius mind of one of the most successful players of all time. Often I had to put the book down and take a deep breath, simply startled by the depth and insight of Harrington's logic.Beginners books can teach you that AK is a good starting hand, but Harrington will tell you what to do when you are in fifth position behind a hyper-aggressive player and two raises behind you. In other words, every real game situation is covered. With a calculating mix of math and psychology, he teaches how to accurately deduce the situation, put people on hands and make smart decisions. His formulas are unique and replicable.The book is structured in the typical Sklansky-style texts, but the hand examples are deeper, with the specific attention paid to the nuance between online and casino games. Even those tablejockeys who say they \\"never read a poker book\\" should swallow their pride and buy a copy or be left in the dust.When Doyle wrote Supersystem, many players felt he had given away too many secrets. Harrington has just offered us the Holy Grail so cough up the $20, and make far more dominating your lesser opponents.As your bankroll skyrockets, you will keep rereading it.

Its one of the top books I have read. I haven't read them all, but have about 9 books. Dan's book will help keep you out of trouble by limiting the tough decisions you have to go through in a tournament. He has a conservative style, but that is what you need to survive early. I like his hand examples. You really get two for one on most questions. He lays out the situation and goes over the \\"right\\" play. After that, he'll continue through the hand assuming you took the \\"less than best starting play\\" and works his way through the hand trying to limit the damage of the novice type play.I don't think I have ever recommended a poker book, and I am thinking twice about recommending this one. I want the information all to myself! And I want volume two to come out soon.I think there should be a pre-req to this book. Get a Sklansky book and learn the game from the math angle.

Ive been writing key notes from his book and I find myself writing, writing, writing, page after page. Its unbelivebale how he made Holdem so easy to understand.Ive been playing for awhile and have learned many strategies and moves and mastered the basics, but he explains why you should do something. He even gives you a situation and lets you decide what to do. And when you decide what to do, it shows the most common play that will occur(Based on his experience).He mentions at the beginning that there will be a Volume II. I cant wait. I thought Doyle's book would be the greatest but Harrington makes it real to you. Doyle explains one -thing and goes with it(Which isnt bad).

Super System, Play Poker Like the Pros, Ciaffone's Book, Cloutier and McEvoy, and numerous others, and I can say that this is by far the best book on NL Hold Em that is out there.It is geared towards tournament play, however it is also very helpful with cash games. If Harrington's Volume II is as good as this volume is, the two of them together will collectively become the \\"Bible of NL Poker\\".One thing about this book though is that it isn't going to be an easy read, and it's not supposed to be. Don't get me wrong, Harrington writes extremely well, but you have to really be *thinking* as you read this book. You need to *study* this book and re-read sections and always think to yourself \\"Why is this a good play to make for this particular situation?\\" The reason you need to do this is because one play that might be right in one situation can be terribly wrong in another situation (as we all should know), so you must constantly remind yourself of what situation you're in, hypothetically, as you read.I honestly cannot say enough good things about this book. I've read so many books on NL Hold Em, and none of them (not even the classic Super System) come close to this IMO.

Harrington has written the best book on poker ever -- and without a doubt the best text on No Limit Hold Em.

Not that he suggests that mastering expert play is simple or easy -- but he presents the information that the successful player must have so well that the many, many significant concepts are easily grasped.This book is, by design, written to teach people how to win no limit texas hold em tournaments. But it accomplishes must more than that. Harrington presents the essence of successful poker play and with it builds the firm foundation of understanding that is so often missing from other poker books.I am a poker author. I wish I had read this text before I wrote my first poker book or poker article. And I certainly wish I had read this book before my first no limit hold em game.

It was essential, even if your playing style was different to the one advocated in these books, you simply needed to know the contents, the principles, the theories and the concepts discussed within in order to have a good grounding in tournament play. Players at my local casino were literally going away, reading and studying this book on the recommendation of others, and coming back winning tournaments they'd never final-tabled before. Clearly it was the real deal.That was a few years ago though, as we move into 2012 the poker world is a different place and the game is a different entity, does this book still hold any weight? In a world where Super System and Sklansky's Theory of Poker, nay, even Caro's Book of Poker Tells are still contemporary instructional companions to some of the best players around, Harrington on Hold Em stands tall and proud and demands attention; but in a world where Durrrr, Antonius and Ivey are battling with the likes of Phil Galfond, Brian Townsend and Dan Cates for millions of dollars at the click of a button and men like Elky and Jason Mercier are winning unprecedented trophies on the pro tournament circuit with a new style of play, can Harrington's ground-breaking series still be relevant, and is it still worth a purchase? In a word: yes, however, it will depend on who you are.These books present a solid theoretical approach to tournament play written by a man who has proved himself in modern times as well as that ancient era pre-internet boom (it really wasn't that long ago!), just google Dan Harrington poker achievements if you don't know what he has done to prove himself, and while he may not be young or hip (sorry Action Dan!) the guy clearly has a ton of skill and knowledge and wisdom and guess what? If he wins a big pro-level event tomorrow, you can bet a large chunk of his basic strategy and gameplan will come more-or-less straight out of his own book.In light of the modern game it is NOT a complete approach to tournaments (whereas perhaps it once was), and it is certainly not a complete approach to poker, but I would argue that even though you should seek instruction elsewhere as well, especially with regards to the modern so-called \\"hyper-agro\\" tournament style, you should still read and assimilate this series of books and the theory they offer. If you are new or relatively new, they are still a must, probably best studied in the earlier stages of your development to give you a solid grounding before you grow in skill and confidence, loosen up and start attacking your tournaments and your poker in a different way.For me, Gus Hansen was the usher of a new style of play, influencing young guys like me to take everything I had learned and step up to a much more open style of play that demanded sharper skills and higher risk, leaving classical play behind, I am obviously talking about 2006/2007 time here, and since then other players the likes of those mentioned previously have yet again ushered in an evolved style above and beyond that of 06/07 and Hansen's open, hand-reading style yet still born from it. It's scary to think what the next quantum leap in poker style will be, things are already so crazy and advanced as a result of the internet boom and instructional sites/books inspired by the likes of Durrrr, Galfond, Elky, the mind-expanding 2+2 discussion forums etc. and good players are having to keep all of this in hand if they wish to compete, but all good players have a grounding in solid concepts and theory, and this book still offers that. On top of that, it's a classic, and you show respect to the game and the guys that made the internet boom possible by buying it and learning from one of the greats."},{"Title":"Harrington on Hold 'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments, Vol. 1: Strategic Play","review":"Last night I won again the Texas tournament with my buddies; They enroll me on Texas H and I have been playing for almost three years, they play a lot on internet sites and I don't but after reading just 1/3 of the entire book I can tell you that I noticeable improved my game, I put more attention in each hand and I can read all what is happening on the table that helps me to take better decisions.I fish better, I bluff better, I make more chips with good hands, I detect more efficiently the danger and fold on time and I can stop and win a medium hand at the flop or before that can become against me on the turn.This is a great book, you won't regret.

It does, however, offer a variety of ideas and techniques that are useful in other forms of Texas Hold \`Em. Harrington is very selective in the hands that he chooses to play; his choices are based not only on his hole cards but also his position and his chip stack relative to the blinds and the other players. Once he chooses to play a hand, he bets in a moderately aggressive manner so as to present his opponents with pot odds that are unfavorable to them. A central feature of his tactics is always knowing how much money is in the pot, and projecting what size bet you need to make to set your opponents' pot odds at the desired level. There is an extensive requirement to know the odds related to various events - e.g., filling a flush draw, beating a pair with two higher cards, etc. Harrington assumes you have these odds at your finger tips and can use them in real time and under pressure.I found the book informative and useful, even for our local \\"friends and neighbors\\" limited betting poker game."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Fifth Sun","review":"I purchased &quot;Twilight of the Fifth Sun&quot; after reading a list of books available from the small publisher Dark Moon Press with one-sentence synopses, and thinking &quot;Now here is a remarkably unusual plot.&quot; I had no idea what the writing might be like, but I thought a story about a pirate's ghost, a journalist, and a little boy fighting an Aztec God for the survival of the world would either have to be very good or very bad. It turned out to be very good!Several features were present that made this book rather more than a run-of-the-mill fantasy. I am interested in history and cultures of the past, and this book exposes the reader to a facet of Aztec culture that is both intriguing and quite new to most people, namely, Aztec religion. Yeah, we've all read that the Aztecs believe in human sacrifice, but just what their religion is about has always been something of a mystery to me. I don't have time or motivation to bury myself (literally) in some dry treatise on Aztec religion, but having an opportunity to learn about it, to have it made real for me, in an interesting book like this is great. (And I hope what I learned is something like the truth!)Also, I enjoy reading fiction involving life after death and the supernatural. I'm not a fanatic about it, but those books are interesting. And here is a book whose premise is that all persons either remain as ghosts, or else their &quot;souls&quot; go somewhere else. Sounds like a commonplace idea, but a book telling within its pages of encounters with ghosts of knights, pirates, suicide victims, vikings, Aztecs, conquistadors, and highway accident victims is not such a common treatment. And the answer the author comes up with for where souls go is pretty ingenious.One thing I hate is a book full of interesting ideas, but with no real point to it, no emotional impact. This book does NOT suffer from that shortcoming! I think most thinking people want to believe that there is a purpose to life, that there is more to it than living a few years here in a difficult place, and dying. The author puts life here into a context which, while being rationally unbelievable, is still very emotionally satisfying. Furthermore, the characters are depicted in sufficient detail to be fully believable, whether they happen to be alive or not. So you sit reading this book, and after you have read some mere twenty pages or so, you realize that you actually can relate to these people, that you want things to work out for them, and furthermore, that the story is acting on you on some deep emotional level. And you think to yourself, &quot;I really like this character. It would be great to have someone like this in my own life.&quot; And then you think, &quot;And this character is a ghost.&quot; It makes for an exceptional reading experience. And when I say the context is not rationally believable, I should add that it does not stand in the way of enjoyment, at least for me. One does not read a book of this type and then criticize it for not being rationally believable! The entire book is about an area of life that goes beyond rationality. The key point is that the novel premise is supported by characters that one readily comes to accept as real.The book is not perfect. For me, its greatest drawback is related to the difficulty of treating its premise. The party fictionalized mythology was explained in great detail in order to make it more believable. The problem is that the premise of the book is essentially spiritual, even bordering on metaphysical, and when you try to explain that through some supporting mythology you wind up with a lot of words and symbols that get confusing, and I did find myself wishing he had either spared me or at least done a better job of explaining the symbolism in the mythology.But despite the one shortcoming, I found the book to be one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. People without imagination should stay away from this book, because they won't enjoy it. But if you enjoy a book that puts your everyday world in a different light, then you will really love &quot;Twilight of the Fifth Sun.&quot; I hope the author will continue writing! I am looking forward to his next effort."},{"Title":"Twilight of the Fifth Sun","review":"This book jumps around to much took me a long time to finish.

I found Polly a wonderful role model and she helped me feel like I wasn't so alone in my troubles. I read it over and over. I tried to follow her example as the oldest child in how I helped my brother and sister. It also helped me realize that money is helpful but there are more important things. Even though it is set in a bygone era, the essence of the book is timeless and classic.When I was young and poor, it was one of the few books I was allowed and I treasured it. And, even though I'm a bookworm and have read many other books, it will always be my favorite."},{"Title":"Five Little Peppers Grown Up","review":"I've really enjoyed reading the entire Five Little Peppers series as an adult, after having decided to revisit the first book almost two decades after first reading it, and then deciding to go all the way this time and read all of the rest of the books. Reading this series as an adult as opposed to a preteen is a different experience, but the books do still hold charm and sweetness, and contain lovely portraits of this bygone world that no longer exists in anyone's living memory. The over the top sentimentalism and excessive emotionalism that bugged me in the first two books actually wasn't that much of an issue in this book, probably because the Peppers are much older now and it's no longer really appropriate for them to constantly cry, scream, yell, or go into raptures. Margaret Sidney also had a number of limitations as a writer (let's be honest, these books don't exactly hold up as well and seem as timeless as other books from the 19th century, like 'Little Women' or 'Tom Sawyer'), but I would never go so far as to say she's a horrible writer either.The book opens when Polly, now twenty years old, has finally realised her childhood dream of being a piano teacher for young single ladies. She teaches at a school run by a Miss Salisbury, and is in quite a pickle because fifteen year old Amy Loughead, one of her worst pupils, is begging her to give her an extra lesson so she can prove to her older brother Jack that she's a good musician and worthy to be taken on his upcoming trip abroad. This causes one of the signature crises in this series, because helping Amy at that time means breaking a date Polly made with Pickering Dodge. Since nothing ever happens without an overkill of drama in this series, it's turned into some huge scandal and selfish shameful thing, all because Polly put her job over some date. Pickering, meanwhile, is only one of several men who has his eyes on Polly and wants to marry her during this book. Livingston Bayley, Jack Loughead, and Jasper King also have designs on her. Other dramas that unfold during the course of this book are the sudden arrival of the now-deceased Mrs. Chatterton's great-niece Charlotte (who's thrown at us as a full-blown character with apparently a fair bit of history with these people, and it's conveniently never really explained just why everyone has such a hideous attitude towards her), Mr. King's disgust at and disapproval of Jasper's chosen profession in the publishing industry, Joel and David's troubles at college, and a train accident which involves the long recuperation on a nearby farmstead of several of the characters. Mr. King's daughter Marian is injured in a sleigh accident, and Polly goes to visit her, but unfortunately the majority of this visit takes place off-screen. It really annoys me how events and dialogues which seem really interesting and important often are narrated only after the fact, or aren't described at all. Another of the author's shortcomings is her over-reliance on dialogue, instead of letting the action be carried along by more descriptive/narrative passages. Mrs. Pepper/Fisher has also had a baby with Dr. Fisher, King (often called King Fisher, which makes the name King even worse), though we're never told exactly how old this kid is, and it doesn't seem logical to introduce him after he's already born instead of having her be pregnant or giving birth early in the book. And since oldest child Ben is 21, Mrs. Pepper/Fisher had to be in her early forties when she had this sixth child who adds nothing to the plot and isn't even old enough to get his own storyline! (I also missed Dick Whitney, who only takes part in about one scene. In addition to Joel, I think he's my favorite character!)There's also some business near the beginning about Phronsie hosting Xmas celebrations at the Dunraven orphanage, which she's either opened or financially helped out with the money that Mrs. Chatterton bequeathed to her as her sole heir. There's more silly overblown drama during these chapters when Joel decides to go back home to fetch a trunk of toys they forget and a new African-American girl wants to sit on the stage with Phronsie as she leads the festivities. (I thought it was really creepy how Phronsie made all of the kids repeat lines about how they have this home thanks to Mrs. Chatterton and they're so happy she gave them the home. It just seemed like brainwashing, however benevolent the intent.) About half of one of the Xmas chapters is also given over to recapping their first Xmas in their \\"little brown house.\\" This is just lazy writing. It adds nothing to the plot, and if I wanted to waltz down memory lane and relive their first Xmas, I'd reread the first book! It just annoys me when I see the Peppers and their entourage starting up the oversentimentalisation of their \\"little brown house days,\\" AGAIN, like they've conveniently forgotten how horrible it was to be so terribly poor and when they had almost nothing. I get that they were happy and had one another in spite of the poverty, but after they've gotten out of that life, why are they so eager to go climbing back over and over again?I wished we'd been able to see more of the Pepper boys in this book, since their storylines at this point seem more interesting than those of Polly and Phronsie, who are stuck at home in an era when girls and women didn't really have the option of equal education and going away to college. I also thought that 13 year old Phronsie, who annoyed me during the first book and much of the second book, was more grown-up, mature, and self-aware than the 20 year old Polly by this point! I'm liking her more and more with each passing book, whereas I'm no longer feeling that sympathetic toward Polly anymore. Maybe it's because there's so much dialogue that there's not a lot of room for developing the characters through descriptive passages or describing their inner thoughts. I also thought Polly's explanation to Phronsie, following the death of a friend, was monstrous, saying that she shouldn't be unhappy and think God did a bad thing, since God actually did a great thing in having this girl die, because otherwise her mom might never want to go to heaven if she didn't have someone waiting there for her. This was seriously how death was described to a child in the 1890s? The marriage proposal Polly finally accepts in the end also struck me as really lame and anti-climactic, considering how long the reader has probably been waiting for this moment. And of course, the book ends without the long-awaited wedding, which will already have happened by the time the final book in the series opens, seven years after these events. It's not that I don't enjoy these books, it's just that it can be frustrating to read them because of the numerous shortcomings Margaret Sidney had as a writer."},{"Title":"Five Little Peppers Grown Up","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it for anyone who has read the previous books."},{"Title":"Five Little Peppers Grown Up","review":"Was I the only child who wanted to grow up to be like Polly Pepper?

Among the main topics, overpopulation of some parts of the world was a major concern for the author. The rapidly increasing number of people in relation to limited natural resources may lead to social instability and jeopardise the well being of individuals. There is a correlation between people multiplying too rapidly and the rise of totalitarian systems of government. Then the author discusses the issue of what should be undertaken with congenially or mentally insufficient organisms which are the result of unfavourable mutations. Should they be allowed to \\"contaminate\\" the genetic pool from which the members of our species will have to draw?Another problem of modern societies is the fact that the dehumanising effects of their over-organisation, especially in cities, may lead to a high incidence of schizophrenia. In \\"Brave New World\\" we see a society where people are never alone. This tendency can already be observed today as William Whyte rightly observes in \\"The Organisation Man\\". Concepts like \\"socially oriented behaviour, team work, group dynamics, acquisition of social skills\\" are very trendy nowadays.Other topics are discussed by Mr Huxley such as the concentration of communication-power in the hands of a few big concerns, the danger of people assembled in large crowds who then cease to have any judgement or will of their own - overwhelmed as they are by simplistic slogans - the question of children being conditioned by advertising from a very early age to buying specific products, the problems caused by widely available drugs such as \\"soma\\" and the effectiveness of subliminal projections and hypnopaedia.An altogether interesting read which allows a better understanding of Mr Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\"."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"Aldous Huxley brings up a lot of interesting points about our society.

I read 'revisited' before the original. That said, Huxleys arguments will be accessable even to those who've not read the original. I'm guessing, but it may even be more beneficial to read this first. (Kind of like reading the introductory exposition before the classic fiction.) Huxley is a skilled polemicist. Not only is his observation skills remarkable but his writing is forceful with a sense of urgency. Ironically, the two writers I can compare his fervent style to is Ayn Rand (The Virtue of Selfishness) and B.F. Skinner (Beyond Freedom and Dignity). How's that for strange company!Unfortunately, like the above writers, Huxleys ranting is exciting at first, leading to mildly annoying, spiraling to nervewracking. A reader reading in 1958 might've been able to take that urgency as the communism mentioned in this book was quickly spreading. In 2002 however, it's a bit harder to take.This is not to say that much of the observation in this book is not happening today. The 'propaganda', 'selling' and 'organization' sections are DEAD ON!! Propaganda: Those in control have convinced us that government (Huxley warns us of vague terms such as these) is the best way to solve problems. Selling: Business is getting bigger and successful advertising is suspiciously easy. Organization: As business gets bigger and needs to become more effective, the organizational structure spreads and to some degree subordinates the individual to the whole. Last but not least, Chemical Persuasion: Huxley was half right. As above trends continue, we medicate more. Not only is illegal drug use out of control, but drugs to combat psychiatric disorders (including 'Math Disorder'? Thanks DSM-IV!) are abundant. Might this be fooling us into thinking that the problem is solved upon the individuals adjustment to the world? Does the problem lie not with the individual sickness, but the world itself? Huxley would cheer 'Yes.' \\"Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness.\\" Why is Huxley half wrong? Neuroscience has shown quite otherwise.Because of it's overpreachiness and what seemed like a mission to doom and gloom us (while talking the COMMUNISTS tendencies to exploit fear in propaganda) I could only give it three stars.

Mass production is the most important thing in the society of Gamma's, Delta's, and Epsilons. Soon enough we find a person who is very different from the start named Bernard Marx, he seems to show signs of emotions toward Leninna in more then a sexual manner. Leninna is a very popular girl; if she would walk into a club she would soon realize that she had spent a night with almost everyone in the room. Leninna and Bernard have finally planned a date thanks to Leninna's asking. This is kind of interesting because Leninna is very popular and Bernard is not there are often jokes that things went wrong with him while he was being made. Leninna had only recently been spending time with Henry Foster; he was a normal person very popular and sexually driven. In Lennina and Bernard's trip to the savage reservation they meet a man named Jon and his mother. They didn't quite understand how he could consider her mother being as how they don't have parents are family of any sort. Jon is brought back to the community and considered very popular but he only thinks of the society as very ignorant."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"This book is not what one might assume merely from seeing the title and knowing nothing about it: it is not a sequel to Brave New World - it is not, indeed, a work of fiction. Truly, it is, at most, a cousin to it, and one assumes that Huxley used the title he did mainly for pecuniary reasons. One need not have read the fictional work in order to appreciate this. What the book consists of is a systematic examination of the social and political forces that may one day lead us into the kind of false Utopia present in Brave New World - or, looked at another way, the factors that keep a democracy from flourishing in our present day society (or during the time the book was written.) This book still hits the nail hard on the proverbial head in quite a few of its points: the use of propaganda and, especially, advertising methods in the systematic brainwashing of the masses. Some of the other factors, however, show the book's age. One must realize the time in which this book was published, 1958 - smack dab in the middle of Cold War paranoia and still reeling from WWII (references to both Hitler and Communism are rampant) and before the 60's counterculture and modern postmodern (nice phrase, that) movements gained a true foothold. Consequently, many of Huxley's points still hit home, as they probably always will, while others reek positively of era concerns. Still, Huxley's writing is invariably vibrant and crisp, not to mention immensely readable - he succeeds in making information that may, in essence, be dry to many appear fresh and exciting. I, then, reccommend this book to all who loved the fictional work and are looking for more along the same lines - especially if you're interested in the practical aspects of the theories involved therein - as well as anyone interested in this kind of rigorous social examination."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"Amy Goodman recently wrote an article about the forcible removal of \\"Occupy Wall Street\\" protesters from Zuccotti Park in Manhattan. They had a library of some 5,000 books that the police hauled off to the dump. One that escaped that fate was this book, and Goodman wrote about how extremely relevant it is to today's events. And so I decided to reread it, a book I had first read half a century ago... and clearly not comprehending much of it at age 15. On the first reading I had not marked a single passage... a habit I adopted not much thereafter. On this reading, a passage is marked on virtually every other page.Huxley wroteBrave New Worldin 1931. Along with George Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Fourthey were the essential reads of the \`50's and \`60's in terms of how the future might play out. In \\"Revisited\\", written in the late \`50's, Huxley frankly compares the two visions, and says that his was the more correct, while conceding the merits of Orwell's vision. And I agree. The courser brutality of totalitarian control, exemplified by the rats dancing around one's head, as Orwell prophesized, is there for sure, but it is not the preferred or more common means of control utilized by the power elites. They definitely prefer the \\"velvet glove\\" approach of propaganda, the diversionary \\"circuses\\" (read today: the celebrity culture, the \\"missing white women,\\" and professional sports), and the intoxicating \\"soma\\" of consumerism.The author seemed to uncannily identify in the \`50's so many of the real problems we, who want a truly democratic and free nation, face today. His first chapter is on over-population, which I continue to believe is in the top 3-4 issues that must be addressed. With the advances in public health and nutrition, the death side of the population equation fell dramatically. Huxley says that it took from the time of Christ to the Elizabethan period for the world's population to double. He said that it would double again in half of the 20th century, and would be 5.5 billion by the year 2000. In 2011, it became seven billion. All too correctly, he says: \\"Unsolved, that problem will render insoluble all our other problems. Worse, still, it will create conditions in which individual freedom and the social decencies of the democratic way of life will become impossible, almost unthinkable.\\"Another major concern is labeled \\"over-organization, which he describes as the increasingly regimented social and work structures that are imposed on \\"the masses\\" and the increasing concentration of power in the hands of the few (read: the 1%). As he says: \\"As the little Men disappear, more and more economic power comes to be wielded by fewer and fewer people.\\" It is natural that he draws on the writing of C. Wright Mills, particularlyThe Power Elite. Bon mots? \\" The beauty of tidiness is used as a justification for despotism.\\" Certainly one of the justifications for \\"clearing\\" Zoccotti Park.There are a couple of chapters, one on propaganda in a democratic society; the other, in a totalitarian one. Without being able to specifically envision the rise of Fox \\"News\\" he says: \\"In the democratic West there is economic censorship and the media of mass communication are controlled by members of the Power Elite,\\" and \\"But even in Rome there was nothing like the non-stop distraction now provided by newspapers and magazines, by radio, television and the cinema...for the purpose of preventing people from paying too much attention to the realities of the social and political situation.\\" For being written in the \`50's, prescience squared.Other sections are dedicated to the consumer society, and the relentless efforts at selling the latest goods. Fittingly, he quotes from Vance Packard'sThe Hidden Persuadersand discusses how the same techniques can be used for political control.In the final chapter, on what can be done, he discusses the writ of habeas corpus, and suggests that there should be a writ of habeas mentem: \\"But here can be preventive legislation-- an outlawing of the psychological slave trade, a statute for the protection of minds against the unscrupulous purveyors of poisonous propaganda...modeled on the statutes for the protection of bodies against the unscrupulous purveyors of adulterated food and dangerous drugs.\\" He also says, clearly projected the rise of the 1%: \\"We know that it is unsafe to allow power to be concentrated in the hands of a ruling oligarchy; nevertheless power is in fact being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.\\" The last sentence: \\"It is still our duty to do whatever we can to resist them.\\" An impressive read the second time around; a vital book for your library, in Zuccotti Park, or wherever it might be. 5-stars, plus."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"Why read: Enjoyed Brave New WorldWhat impressed me: I loved the concept of Huxley writing essays commenting on how the things he wrote about long ago in Brave New World translated into modern life.What disappointed me: Unfortunately, modern life isn't what it once was. While Huxley drew parallels between things he created and that which ended up actually occurring in the course of his lifetime, his lifetime ended over 50 years ago, making the book less than accurate. Things he foresaw coming to pass soon never did and things have changed in ways he never imagined or at least mentioned.Recommended: Not really. Too much time has past since Huxley wrote Revisited and it just doesn't hold up given modern developments."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"This is an exquisitely articulated and bracing book of twelve essays on over-population, over-organization, brainwashing and propaganda in both democratic and totalitarian societies, and chemistry for so-called better living.First published over 50 years ago, everything essential in the book is a complete state-of-the-art assessment of society and politics.On page 134, in the last chapter entitled \\"What Can Be Done?\\", Aldous Huxley writes, leaving nothing more to be said (after reading):UNDER THE RELENTLESS THRUST OF ACCELERATING OVER-POPULATIONAND INCREASING OVER-ORGANIZATION, AND BY MEANS OF EVER MOREEFFECTIVE METHODS OF MIND-MANIPULATION, THE DEMOCRACIES WILLCHANGE THEIR NATURE; THE QUAINT OLD FORMS -- ELECTIONS,PARLIAMENTS, SUPREME COURTS AND ALL THE REST -- WILL REMAIN.THE UNDERLYING SUBSTANCE WILL BE A NEW KIND OF NON-VIOLENTTOTALITARIANISM.... MEANWHILE THE RULING OLIGARCHY AND ITSHIGHLY TRAINED ELITE OF SOLDIERS, POLICEMEN, THOUGHT-MANUFACTURERS AND MIND-MANIPULATORS WILL QUIETLY RUN THE SHOWAS THEY SEE FIT.What Aldous Huxley writes above is happening right now and has been happening. (See the Copenhagen Treaty, for example.)Mr. Huxley writes to the end that he highlights the values of liberty and individualism but shows how these human rights scarily are dimming like candles being blown out by the winds of corporatism, collectivism, and ignorance through massive entertainment distraction and advertisements.This is a very quick read and needs to be read by every single mind-body in the Western world."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"To me this book which is an essay on \\"A Brave New World\\" ends up being in my opinion one of the most important literary pieces of all the Huxley books.

This book is a must read for anyone interested in maintaining some level of democracy."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"Anyone who had the pleasure of reading the original edition of \\"Brave New World\\" published in the 1930s understands the nature of the concerns Aldous Huxley was exploring in this science fiction approach to the issues associated with modernization and where unleashed science and technology are taking us. In this marvelous companion non-fiction work published some twenty-some years later, Huxley further defines and describes the substance and consequences of his original concerns as outlined in \\"Brave New World\\". These concerns range from the fairly mundane issues of overpopulation to the quality of life for citizens in such a future society to the concerns for individual freedom and consciousness, given what he terms to be the increasing capability and interest of the upper reaches to mold and control the attitudes, dispositions, and perceptions of its individual citizens.Huxley is uniquely qualified to engage in such an exploration, largely due to his stature given the fateful ways in which so many aspects of his prognostications about the direction of future society have been substantiated and actualized before our very eyes, including, among other things, the development of nuclear weapons and the use of nuclear power. So too, as we approach ever greater integration of national economies into something gradually approaching a single global one, his fears regarding the likelihood of the rise of \`fascism with a friendly face' seems much more to the mark than did all the fears of the Orwellian \`1984' type totalitarian government. Yet he also is known and respected for having been, like Edmund Wilson was here in the United States in the same time frame, as an eminent man of letters, a man capable of successfully straddling the various academic fields with a vision so powerful and so true to the facts as to allow him immense credibility and latitude.Here he one again provides us with a fascinating, provocative, and, in retrospect, remarkably accurate of what would come to transpire in the years of the 20th century. As even Huxley himself admits, much of what has already come into existence did so much more rapidly and much more widely than he originally imagined it might. His accomplishment in this superb book is to survey the prospects for what increasingly now, in the first years of the 21st century, is now an uncomfortably accurate set of predictions of not only how we live, but under what particular set of social, economic, and political circumstances. Reading this book, in combination with several of his other texts, such as the wonderful \\"Doors OF Perception\\", helps immeasurably to liberate one from the kind of propaganda-influenced and politically correct sets of personal perceptions so many of us view the world through. This is indeed a seminal book, one that any serious student of the human condition and who lives in the so-called advanced social democracies of the western world must read to comprehend the nature of the environment he or she exists within. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"Brave New World Revisited is a non-fictional essay by the same author as the fictional negative-Utopian novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley.This book was written almost 30 years after Huxley's landmark title Brave New World. Here Huxley compares the ideas in Brave New World with what was then modern day (1959). Huxley discusses brainwashing, propaganda, over-population, hypnopaedia (sleep-learning) and other subjects that were the driving force behind his original work. What's scary is how much truth is really behind this work and it's even more relevant now than it was in 1959!This is a very short book that reads almost like an extended after-word for the original Brave New World. Though for me it wasn't as moving as the original work, I still found it very eye-opening. If you haven't read the original work then you can still read this just fine, but still, read the original if you haven't done so!"},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"As Brave New World the novel was fairly prophetic, as is (and even more) Brave New World Revisited. While I don't necessarily agree with some of the more doom and gloom projections of the future, Huxley is quite adept at explaining mind control by the powerful wanting to remain in power. Plus he has a keen awareness of the threat of our stability by the rising problem of over population. Also, remember this book was written in 1958 so some of his projections have already come true. Brave New World Revisited is quite an intellectual book, yet very readable."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"The author compares his 1930's story to actual events and is disappointed to find the parallels a little too accurate, chillingly so. His discouragement is palpable, but unavoidable given the growth in human population upon which he bases his premise of future problems. Basically he states the world cannot feed and clothe 6-7 billion people no matter the scientific advances humankind enjoy. We just passed 6 billion.A pretty good read. He's not overly pushy but rather contemplative about how his story parallels history. Be sure to read his story prior to this re-visitation."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"It is interesting to note that this was written over half a century ago. Huxley critiques his own great work, Brave new World, from the perspective of the technologies and advancements made some 20 or so years later than his original classic. His analysis of psychological methodologies, comparing Orwell's work and critiquing neurological studies from the late 30's through to the 1950's, including the use of subliminal messaging is certainly thought provoking. I wonder what he would have made of modern technology? The apparent reduction in attention span of the media-obsessed population juxtaposed by the the underlying free access of uncensored information that the internet revolution has allowed would have made for an intriguing analysis. This is certainly a good read, at the very least from a historical perspective."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"Cool and insightful story of how the future might be.

Albeit not long, its volume in information lends much support to its considerable importance and potency to the intellectual reader. There were times where i was audibly saying \\"wow\\" and times when i was so immersed i couldn't contain my excitement. Ironically this very excitement distracted me at times, where i was deep in thought and contemplation of previous passages that i was actually missing out of what i was reading at the moment. Thankfully those instances were few and i was able to comprehend the majority of it. The outlining problems, he explains, come from over-population and over-organization. Each can be summarized as an internal and external dilemma that we as individuals and a society must face. From propaganda to mind-manipulation, he covers all that human society is currently struggling with and will undoubtedly continue to deal with as the situation worsens.Profound, both in its horrifying connection made and it's enlightening message given, this book is definitely worth looking into for anyone that is even somewhat interested in Huxley's work.Lucas."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"If you haven't read Brave New World and 1984, I suggest you read both of those first.

He begins by reevaluating his previous work and Orwell's 1984. Then he will open your eyes to some of the biggest problems we face today. It has been almost 50 years since this book was written and many of the things Huxley predicted are happening all around us. It floors me that so few people have read this amazing work. So quit reading this review and read the book already!"},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"Written over 40 years ago, the book hardly showed me anything that I didn't knew already. Everyone with an above ape intelligence is able to minutely aknowledge manipulative nonsences vehiculated by politically servile media. Thanks to his far-ranging culture, Huxley might argument that with a considerable of obvious and non-obvious examples. Motivational psychology has much evolved eversince and few of his observations continue to stand in present. Today, there are exceptionally few people that realise the darkness of the world they live in. The effort to shut down politically unaffiliated intelligentia has been efficiently carried out and lies now in a terminal stage. Sorrily, no significant opposition ever existed. Nobody can oppose a system that knows everything about you, yet you know nothing about him. ... and what it knows not, it isolates. Never directly, but through inocculated individuals, which you so much need for diverse reasons. Whoever decides to disecate the system and penetrate its inner core it's today unconcievable to not work as a very perpetuator of sheer lies and deformations available. It is not a rigid totalitarianism such as Nazism and Communism, but a brand new upgrade seeking to remove unwanted use of violence and become highly adaptive. I've named it humanitarian totalitarianism, because it claims so persistently to be &quot;for the people&quot;. Actually it's only humanitarian when it comes to satisfy primeval needs such as wealth, sexual emancipation and cheap entretainment. With its hidden, yet prevailent hand it vigilently guards ideological purity and would never hesitate one second wasting you when becoming a true threat."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"This book puts forth the arguement that a society as depicted in Brave New World is likely to be the end result of mankind if we don't do something to prevent it from happening. This is an all-too valid arguement. Huxley claims that through overpopulation and the survival of the physically and mentally inferior our race will be put into such a state that a totalitarian regieme will eventually be able to seize control and eventually prevent those under its control from realizing their predicament. I go to school with plenty of morons and blind optimists who would do nothing to stop such a despicable form of government from taking control. Above all, this book is a plea for democracy, freedom, and intelligence which needs to be heeded."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"Incensed by the burgeoning 20th century onslaught against human freedoms, Aldous Huxley attempts to divulge the threat, which he claims \\"...are of many different kinds-demographic, social, political, psychological\\" (131). Huxley reiterates the warnings first pronounced by John Stuart Mill. That we must remain vigilant in protecting our freedoms from willing usurpers. In this sense liberalism is the antithesis of order and efficiency. And the interests of the individual are opposed to that of \\"Big Government\\" and \\"Big Business\\".Apparently, the demise of Malthusian economic theory had not yet reached Huxley by 1958. In Huxley's chapter on over-population he remarks, \\"The problem of rapidly increasing numbers in relation to natural resources, to social stability and to the well-being of individuals-this is now the central problem of mankind...Unsolved, that problem will render insoluble all our other problems\\" (8-9). Of course modern agricultural technology allows a much larger number of people to subsist than the 2 billion originally predicted by Huxley. Additionally, Total Fertility Rates (TFR) have tended to decline in the presence of literacy, economic growth, and contraception. Ironically, the problem posed to the industrialized countries today is not too much growth but to little, with many demographers predicting an 80% likelihood of an end to world population growth by the year 2080. These discrepant predictions reveal that present projections should not be taken for granted.Indeed, the problem of over-population remains not only a potentially endogenous threat to the industrialized world but also an exogenous one in light of the tendency for poorer countries to support totalitarian regimes. While Huxley may be somewhat off-base when it comes to over-population he does hit the nail on the head when it comes to the corrupting influence of power and the methods used by which to increase power, \\"But liberty, as we all know, cannot flourish in a country that is permanently on a war footing, or even a near-war footing. Permanent crisis justifies permanent control of everybody and everything by the agencies of the central government\\" (14). Adopting a war stance is only one of the many machinations in which the powers that be seek to increase their power.Huxley's writing reveals that he is a cynic by nature, and perhaps rightfully so. He writes, \\"But the Nature of Things is such that nobody in this world ever gets anything for nothing...Indeed, like last year's washing machine, they are still being paid for-and each installment is higher than the last\\" (19-20). Huxley fears that technological progress leads to greater centralization of both economic and political power, and ultimately the squelching of freedom. Unfortunately, the truth of this becomes abundantly clear.For example, we all benefit from the Internet. I enjoy purchasing books from Amazon.com for a discount. However, in enjoying this pecuniary benefit, I inavertedly put my credit card information at risk. In steps the FCC or other governmental agencies that serve as a watchdog against identity theft. This in itself may not pose a problem. However, they do not stop there. Next, the CIA receives authorization for their CARNIVORE program to scour through our emails and library records searching for clue words that may suggest a threat to national security. When all taken together we can see how government is playing a growing role in the affairs of our daily lives with us nodding in consent. Moreover, power tends to corrupt and is not give away without a fight. One can imagine a scenario where government acquires increasing power over our lives to the point that we are no longer in a position to do anything about it. This is exactly what Mill and Huxley are warning us of.Yet, according to Huxley this tendency remains a fundamental part of what it means to be human, \\"The wish to impose order upon confusion, to bring harmony out of dissonance and unity out of multiplicity is a kind of intellectual instinct, a primary and fundamental urge of the mind\\" (24). He refers to this urge as the \\"Will to Order.\\" While not wholly bad, this \`will to order' wreaks havoc when applied beyond the realms of science and art toward politics and social conformity. Thus, red lights should immediately go off and sirens sound once we hear of Marx's \`scientific socialism'.Huxley relates his constrained vision of human nature in biological terms infused with a sense of natural harmony, \\"A great gulf separates the social insect from the not too gregarious, big-brained mammal; and even though the mammal should do his best to imitate the insect, the gulf would remain. However hard they try, men cannot create a social organism, they can only create an organization. In the process of trying to create an organism they will merely create a totalitarian despotism\\" (26). Some organization is necessary for us to enjoy our freedom. The goal is to find a happy medium between organization and freedom and educate ourselves to be able to tell the difference."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"A brilliant look back at Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" by the author along with an insightful analysis of foreshadowed conditions up to 1965.

This book was written almost 26 years after the writing of Huxley's original novel and was an attempt to note the fact that many of the predictions made by Huxley had come true. Aldous Huxley (1894 - 1963) was a British born novelist, essayist, and thinker who delved extensively in spiritual questions and mysticism. Huxley lived for a time in the United States in southern California. This book examines the modern day scientific totalitarian state in light of such questions as over-population, organization and centralization of power structures, genetic modification, brainwashing and other forms of propaganda and persuasion, the importance of psychedelic drugs and designer pharmaceuticals, and the importance of freedom. While I disagree with some of Huxley's remarks concerning over-population, I found many of his reflections to be uncannily accurate given the rise of the modern totalitarian state. In this respect, I found this book highly interesting for what it had to say about such issues and the importance of de-centralization in achieving a modern free society.The book begins with the question of \\"Over-Population\\" as spelled out in Huxley's novel _Brave New World_. Huxley maintains that there is precious little time and that he feels even less optimistic than he did when writing _Brave New World_. Huxley relates his novel to the novel _1984_ by George Orwell, noting the rise of Nazism and Communism. Huxley maintains that over-population poses a significant threat and must be controlled through birth control (something which I disagree with him about). The second chapter is entitled \\"Quantity, Quality, and Morality\\". Here, Huxley examines the role of eugenics and dysgenics noting that IQs and physical vigor are declining in society. The third chapter is entitled \\"Over-Organization\\". Here, Huxley examines the role of governmental organization and the rise of Big Business and Big Government and the decline of Little Business in service to the State. Huxley emphasizes the theories of sociologist C. Wright Mills concerning the \\"Power Elite\\". Huxley also notes the role of Mussolini's corporatist state and relates this to the medieval system. The fourth chapter is entitled \\"Propaganda in a Democratic Society\\". Here, Huxley examines the role of propaganda in democracy, the role of technology, and the nature of Jeffersonian democracy. The fifth chapter is entitled \\"Propaganda Under a Dictatorship\\". Here, Huxley examines the role of the Nazis and their use of radio as well as the Chinese and the Communists. Huxley emphasizes the role of the \\"masses\\" in being propagandized. The sixth chapter is entitled \\"The Arts of Selling\\". Here, Huxley examines the methods used to sell products, the role of advertising (mentioning for example such classic works as that of Vance Packard, _The Hidden Persuaders_), and the nature of commercials and television. The seventh chapter is entitled \\"Brainwashing\\". This chapter examines such issues as mind-manipulation, the experiments of Ivan Pavlov, \\"battle fatigue\\", and the extermination camps. This chapter maintains that Pavlovian conditioning has been particularly used by the Communists in their efforts to destroy free will. The eighth chapter is entitled \\"Chemical Persuasion\\". This chapter examines the nature of drugs, in particular mentioning the role of Asclepias aceda used by the ancient Aryan invaders, and serving as inspiration for the drug soma in the novel. Huxley also notes the role of cannibis, LSD-25, and other psychotropic and psychedelic drugs as well as the role of pharmaceuticals in combating physical and mental ills. The ninth chapter is entitled \\"Subconscious Persuasion\\" and notes the role of Dr. Poetzl in Sigmund Freud's book _The Interpretation of Dreams_. This chapter considers such issues as the tachiscope, suggestion, and suggestibility noting that some people are highly suggestible while others are highly non-suggestible. The tenth chapter is entitled \\"Hypnopaedia\\", a process used in the novel _Brave New World_ for conditioning individuals during sleep. This chapter notes the rise of such methods and their use in certain facilities (although I believe that such results have largely not panned out in the modern world). The eleventh chapter is entitled \\"Education for Freedom\\" and notes the essential nature of human freedom and the need of education in order to achieve it. In particular, Huxley mentions the tendency of the younger generation to sacrifice such freedom and why such sacrifice should not be condoned. The final chapter is entitled \\"What Can Be Done?\\" Huxley maintains that we can be educated for freedom and considers such ideas for de-centralization as those of Hilaire Belloc and Mortimer Adler, as well as the novel _Walden Two_ of behaviorist psychologist B. F. Skinner.This book offers some highly interesting reflections on the modern scientifically managed state. In light of the novel written by Huxley, this book shows how the modern world has come to reflect many of the original notions as reflected in that novel. Indeed, Huxley relates his own novel to that of _1984_ by George Orwell showing how the modern day attempts to achieve utopia have resulted in a great loss of meaning for human life. Huxley indeed remains an important figure who turned his mind to spiritual questions and to questions of the nature of modern society and scientific development."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"I read this directly after finishing Brave New World. This is Huxley's big, long essay where he essentially says: \\"see how right I was?\\" His thesis is that the society he envisioned in Brave New World was coming to pass far more quickly than he imagined. He then goes on to detial the steps that are inexorably leading to our descent into totalitarianism. At the end, he suggests systems of eduction that he sees as the only way to prevent this almost certain and horrible future. I recommend this to those who were enraptured by the philosophy behind the novel and have an interest in the politics and sociology of totalitarianism."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"I can't describe how awesome this book is.

Its importance and fame are in its ideas, and not in its value as literary creation. Its character are more abstractions than real people and it is difficult to have deep feeling towards them.The book's power is in foreseeing that future scientific and technical developments will enable fundamental changes in human society and even nature. He depicts a test-tube baby - world which is divided into classes, and which stresses Security and Community while totally suppressing individual character and freedom. Huxley sees that Happiness when made into a single exclusive Good can be made the Enemy of the Good.There is no doubt that Huxley had foresight all out of the ordinary. But he did not have 'prophecy' and certainly did not foresee the way the scientific developments have actually taken place. The world we live in is much more complicated and has many more new challenges that the simple totalitarian model presented by Huxley. While his great fear was assembly- line uniformity the truth is we more face a kind of anarchic Internet individualism. While he saw a world which would be totally ordered and secure we have a world in which nuclear weapons are in danger of proliferating and Terrorism with a religious base is increasing.What struck me on reading this book is that how Huxley even in the biological areas in which he justifiably focused could not get it right. We do have test- tube babies today but they are not produced in batches and made uniform. Huxley's world is one in which parenting was outlawed but now it seems that one future threat is that parents will be in fierce competition with each other over how to ' best design' their children.Again our world seems far far more complex and more challenging on many levels than the one Huxley envisaged for us here."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"That is the message which Huxley conveys through this follow-up to his masterpiece, Brave New World. Huxley's obsevations of modern day mind control methods, brainwashing, and propaganda are chilling. What is even more chilling is that this book was written in 1958, one can imagine what advances in these dark sciences man has taken since then. A key point in this book is that if a totalitarian state is going to exist in the present day it will almost surely be more like Huxley's Brave New World, rather than Orwell's 1984. The main reason for this is that whereas Orwell's society revolves around the threat of violence, torture, and death, Huxley's revolves around the reward system. Huxley's Brave New World lulls the masses to sleep so that they have no idea that their freedom is being taken away. Huxley predicts that we will drug people who are even slightly out of the norm for &quot;mental illnesses&quot; (does Prozac ring a bell?). He predicts that valuable information, information necessary for the preservation of freedom, will be subtly, very subtly, taken away from the masses while replacing it with a seemingly terrific reward (does television ring a bell?). Huxley's most frightening premise in this book is that the individual (what he and others identify as &quot;The Great Man&quot;) is being done away with by modern &quot;science&quot;. He recapitulates for us the great debate between the behaviorist psychologists (like Watson and Skinner) and the philosopher psychologist William James. Skinner and company believe that the individual is powerless over his environmental influences while James strongly believes in the idea of &quot;The Great Man&quot;. (In other words did Elizabethan England create Shakespeare's plays or did Shakespeare create his plays?) Huxley tells us the bad news in bulk before getting to the obvious question What can we do? His answer can be summarized in one word, THINK!!! Think, debate, don't accept the packaged and marketed ideas that are given to you like a McDonalds cheeseburger. In Huxley's words, educated yourself for freedom. And you can start by reading a copy of this book. If your local bookstore doesn't have one, then for God's sake, for all of our sakes, find a copy quick."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"Mr. Huxley started warning us in 1932, with his masterpiece, &quot;Brave New World.&quot; In this essay-style analysis of his own book, written twenty-six years later, he takes it one big step further.

Our society needs to lift its head from the computer screen for a few hours to read this critical work. Few, if any, have said so much in so little space. Mr. Huxley is one of the greatest thinkers of the twentieth century, and it is a criminal shame that his words are not more widely read.

Huxley explains:\\"When [my science fiction novel] \`Brave New World' [1932] was being written, I was convinced that there was plenty of time. The completely organized society, the...caste [or class] system, the abolition of free will by methodical conditioning, the servitude made acceptable by regular doses of chemically induced happiness, the orthodoxies drummed in by...sleep-teaching--these [threats to individual freedom] were coming all right, but not in my time...I feel a good deal less optimistic than I did when I was writing [my science fiction novel]. The prophecies made in [my science fiction novel] are coming true much sooner than I thought they would...Impersonal forces over which we have almost no control seem to be pushing us all in the direction of the Brave New Worldian nightmare...impersonal forces which are now making the world so extremely unsafe for democracy [and] individual freedom.\\"This is what this book does. It looks in depth at the above threats or forces to or \\"enemies of\\" individual freedom and others mentioned in Huxley's science fiction novel and applies them to the modern world. The author examines in depth the following six threats or forces:(1) overpopulation(2) over-organization (or bureaucracy)(3) propaganda (in a democratic society and under a dictatorship)(4) brainwashing(5) persuasion (chemical and subconscious or subliminal)(6) hypnopaedia (sleep-teaching)His analysis made over a quarter century ago (from the year of this review) is amazingly accurate. I'll give one perfect example:\\"Our contemporary Western society, in spite of its material, intellectual, and material progress, is increasingly less conducive to mental health, and tends to undermine the inner security, happiness, reason, and the capacity for love in the individual; it tends to turn him into an automaton who pays for his human failure with increasing mental sickness, and with despair hidden under a frantic drive for work and so-called pleasure...Man [and woman are] not made to be an automaton, and if he [or she] becomes one, the basis for mental health is destroyed...People are related to one another, not as total personalities but as embodiments of economic functions or, when they are not at work, as irresponsible seekers of entertainment.\\"The above example is the kind of insight you'll find throughout this well-written book. There are a few (very few!) times Huxley seems to be wrong, but the majority of time he is spot-on.In the last chapter of his book, Huxley attempts amongst other things to answer the following question:\\"How can we control the vast impersonal forces that now menace our hard-one freedoms?\\" He does a good job coming to grips with this difficult question.Do you have to read Huxley's previous science fiction novel to understand this book? NO. When he refers to his science fiction novel in this book he does not make any assumptions that the reader has read his science fiction novel. However, as a person who has read his previous novel, I can say that this book had more impact on me than if I had not read the previous novel.Finally, the only problem I had with this non-fiction book is that it has no references and footnotes (or notes). Huxley to be sure uses information and statistics from other sources but no credit is given to them. Huxley, in his main narrative, does sometimes give informal credit to his sources but many times, he does not even do this. All information sources should have been properly referenced.In conclusion, this is an insightful, prophetic, fascinating book that makes the case that our society may be heading in the wrong direction due to forces attempting to take away our individual freedoms!(first published 1958; forward by author; 12 chapters; main narrative 185 pages)+++++"},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"An absolutely superb essay on the world and society in general--like 1984 and Brave New World but without all the story and metaphor--and straight to the point.

I couldn't help but realize this man's genius as I read this book. His understanding of science is evident and only surpassed by his knowledge of the psychological. I recognized some of what I read, and believe that &quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot; must be the original source. Additionally, the book contains much information I had never heard before.The book is a collection of twelve essays written on how to prevent the world from &quot;Brave New World&quot; from coming into existence. Already in 1958, Huxley paints a bleak picture for our future. One of the main problems Huxley forsees is the lack of desire for freedom. In 1958, a study showed that American youths were indifferent to rule by a few experts instead of a democracy. He sees a need to increase critical thinking in the individuals of a society. He also explains the current methods of involuntary mental manipulation. The &quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot; is an informative collection of essays that has risen my awareness of psychological dangers."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"Brave New World Revisited was a very good book. It is terrifying to have Huxley methodically tell of how to virtually inslave mankind. The way Huxley says lines like &quot;a smart dictator will...&quot; it kind of reminds me of &quot;The Prince.&quot; And it is kind of like the Prince, only he's not telling the dictator he's telling us. Unfortunately, since there aren't many reviews, not many people are listening on how to save their freedom. He writes the book so well and leaves no idea without thought. This book nicely explains over-population, over-orginazation, propaganda, sleep-teaching, drugs, and more. Throughout the book he uses his own knowledge, as well as nice passages by Freud,Hitler and others. Don't think this book is not relevent to America and only relevent to third world nations. Because the book explains how people in a government and society like the U.S.'s can also become brainwashed and enslaved. A good book that should be read by everyone who wants too think for themselves."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"This follow up to Huxley's classic brave new world is an absolute prophetic revelation to our modern times as well as times to come if its message is not headed. Huxley shows his unmistakeable brilliance with this discourse on the evils and possibilities of our modern political and economic state. I would recomend both Brave New World Revisted and Brave New World for anyone interested in political socialization and the current economic state of the world. On a final note, Huxley is one of the best political and social satirist I have ever seen in the literary world and I must say that I enjoyed both works."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"Although this book was written over 40 years ago, and is a reflection on a book written over 60 years ago the issues it covers are surprisingly relevant in today's society. Throughout the book Huxley contrasts his work with George Orwell's 1984, and the (then) state of the post WW2 world and current scientific discovery. Covering issues such as overpopulation, propaganda, the art of selling and brainwashing as well as drugs and political control he gives prescient warnings to the reader. My personal favourite chapter, The Art of Selling is an excellent analysis of the (then) new art of marketing. The final chapter though, is a call to activism through education of the people. The book is very accessible, and if you have not read Brave New World, you will not be at a disadvantage. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting a historical perspective to today's issues."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"First, I should say that the three of five stars is really about a three-and-a-half out of five stars, so as to give a bit of granularity to my review. I will admit that I am a great fan of Mr. Huxley's tale \\"Brave New World\\" because of its timelessness and also because of its timeliness today. With this in mind, I am both pleased and, in a minor ways, displeased by the later reflections which he made on the possibilities of his dystopia's realization in the contemporary world.In order to get the negative out, I will very briefly outline what I found to be either incorrect or unseemly in Mr. Huxley's revisiting of his dystopia. Primarily, I am a bit disappointed, perhaps because of my place in the future of his work, in the complete negativity with which he approaches both the problem of population and what he calls \\"quantity and quality\\" with regards to breeding. In his own way, it seems that he has slipped into that pessimistic, hedonistic view which he chided greatly in his own text. Now, I do admit that he does raise a good point that these two forces do have the possibility of creating turmoil in those who are predisposed to use them as an excuse for hyper-control over society. However, he never fully exonerates himself from this pessimism and even seems to believe that there is some positive organizational goal which can address these problems without slipping to the world of his dystopia. To his benefit, he does leave the questions of solutions open but also seems to be like those later liberals, who became less liberal and more collectivist, to view the state as too strong an exponent of individual freedom. He leaves unaddressed the question of how goodness plays a role in the preservation of freedom in society. In addition, while I do agree that much technology tends toward over-organization, there is also the promise, which is seen in various ways today, that technology can also allow for the displacement of power throughout the people. (Specifically, I am thinking of the possibility of some day having an affordable way of augmenting the power grid by individuals on their own property and - more realistically conceivable now - the growth of free communications on the internet and the creation of ad hoc download clusters by means of dispersed torrent technologies [which are to me only a sign of the other promises of some loss of over-centralization].)Now, on the positive, all of the points raised have some level of lasting validity, for every question raised does pose a very real dilemma in the contemporary world. The forces of over-population which today also point to the effects of the exposure of the third world to the global economy could well play into the hands of those powerful ones who would cajole the first world into a much more \\"safe\\" state at the cost of liberty. In addition, propaganda does have an insidious character in the contemporary world and is more spread than ever through the powers of centralization that do indeed exist (bearing in mind the aforementioned promises in the opposite direction). The heavy hand of the singly-focused media, coupled with the ongoing din which prevents one from having the introspection necessary to realize his or her place in the world, coupled again with the ability to escape problems of all sorts through medications and illicit drugs, are indeed, as Huxley suspected, making the world far more susceptible to the possibilities of a Brave New World growth. While he focuses more on education than anything else, it seems to me that - reading this through the lens of his text - he intends such education to enable us not only to \\"know the Truth\\" but also to be able to reflect on the self, to look at the stars as well as the pains of life and realize they are something to be understood and coped with, not ignored."},{"Title":"Brave New World Revisited","review":"In this book, Aldous Huxley examines modern society and shows how elements of his fictional dystopia in \\"Brave New World\\" (BNW) became real even faster than he imagined. In a dozen pithy chapters, he examines the \\"modern\\" world of 1958, and discusses the rise of huge organizations, the methods of modern propaganda, the role of the mass media, over-conformity, over-specialization, salesmanship & commercial society, brainwashing, and drug-induced happiness - all of which appeared in \\"Brave New World.\\" Overall, I found this to be a pithy, insightful, and prescient analysis of society. In fact, I thought it was as good or better than \\"Brave New World\\" itself.Here's a sampling of some points he covers:BNW depicted the non-violent manipulation of people through pleasures rather than violent oppression. In BNW, for example, the \\"system\\" creates people who are psychologically conditioned from birth to have the \\"correct\\" views on the world; the government sponsored drug use to keep people happy, and social interactions were ritualized and controlled. All this provided social stability.Huxley also writes that today's world has also become similarly over-organized, and people are manipulated by pleasures. We've created a vast commercial machine for the mass production of goods and entertainment. As cogs in the machine, people can become highly specialized automatons who subsume themselves into their organizations, making it's goals their own, suffocating their independent human spirit. Although highly productive & peaceful, Huxley claims the resulting social harmony is superficial, and doesn't fulfill us as human beings. People interact with each other from a distance, merely as workers or pleasure seekers, never as total personalities.Huxley's thoughts on propaganda also fill many of the chapters. He shows that the large organizations of the modern world (governments, corporations, the military, political parties, churches, etc.) have all become very savvy in using propaganda to control \\"their\\" masses. As Hitler knew, the masses hate reason; so his key is to create simple, repetitive, emotional appeals that spoke to them and appealed to their secret desires. Not coincidently, advertising uses this same formula; find a common desire or widespread unconscious fear or anxiety, then relate it to the product you sell, then build verbal or pictorial bridge from their dream to your product, and repeat the ad over and over.So, what can we do to improve the world? Huxley offers few solutions, but one key point is that we must be aware of propaganda. To do so, we must learn the proper use of language, and learn how to dissect and critically analyze the messages aimed at us. Also, we should try to reconnect with our neighbors & communities fully as people, without intervening organizations. Finally, we should try to decentralize economic and political power as much as possible, since what is good for the economic or political \\"machine\\" isn't necessarily good for us as human beings.As I mentioned, this book was packed with insights, and a quick, enjoyable read. It's also a superb follow-up to Huxley's famous novel.

There's plenty of solid material here and very little fluff. The information is well presented, up-to-date, and easy to read.Three of the nine chapters are about the potential for life elsewhere in our planetary system, in particular on Mars, Europa, and Titan. Another three chapters are on extrasolar planets: how to find them, what we've discovered so far about them, and what signatures of life we might try to look for on them in the future. There's also a chapter on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). That leaves two chapters for the definition and origin of life, the Earth's acquisition of the necessary water and carbon, and so on. I'd prefer to see quite a bit more on biology here. I'd like to see much more discussion of the development of multicellular life, the changes in the Earth's environment caused by the production of oxygen, and the evolution of humans.That said, I really liked the chapter on the origin of life. It was illuminating to read about the origin of chirality, written by a specialist in organic matter in meteorites. And I also especially liked the chapters on exoplanets."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Astrobiology","review":"Twenty-five years ago the study of astrobiology was quite \\"fringe\\". Much has occurred since then, as technology has continually improved and we have taken further, somewhat less tentative steps off this planet. We now have claims of life in a Martian meteorite (not yet accepted), the discovery of over 400 exoplanets to-date (and counting), and interesting possibilities for possible life that may yet be found on Mars (under the surface), Europa (in a putative ocean) and possibly on Titan (assuming life could adapt to the extreme cold there).This book by Gilmour and Sephton presents the study of Astrobiology in a very straightforward and concise way, offering the reader an introductory look into this burdgeoning area of study. In particular, the textbook includes (a) early chapters on the origin of life and on habitability (ie., in \\"water\\" zones about planets and otherwise based on other mechanisms about planetary satellites), and (b) a great overview of Earth's extremeophiles. The textbook includes expanded chapters on Mars, Europa and Titan, where the authors go into greater detail on the possibilities for life on these bodies. The book concludes with chapters devoted to the potentiality of life on exoplanets, including yet-to-be-discovered exo-Earths.I read the Gilmour text alongside three other books on this subject - (a) \\"The Living Cosmos\\" by Chris Impey, (b) \\"Astrobiology: A Multidisciplinary Approach\\" by Jonathan Lunine, and (c) \\"Looking for Life: Searching the Solar System\\" by Clancy et. al. The Gilmour and Lunine books would - in my view - be properly classed as true \\"textbooks\\" on this subject, while the Impey and Clancy books are presented as more general reading. The Gilmour text is the best introductory textbook to the subject of astrobiology that I have found, and assumes the reader is just starting into the area with limited knowledge. For even greater detail (in a textbook), one can then move on (after Gilmour) to the Lunine text which gives far greater detail, although you will hate all the typos in it.The two other books cited are great expositions of the area in and of themselves, but are presented in a less formal way. Both have been prepared by persons directly involved in the area and both are extremely well-written and a joy to read. These latter books are packed with up-to-date information and indeed go deeper than the Gilmour text does. As such, the latter two references are most easily read for general interest, enjoyment and overview, while the Gilmour text is best used as a clear and concise \\"textbook\\" source that organizes all the materials in an introductory and very cogent way.I am sure there are many other texts and sources on their way vis a vis this area, but if you are just starting out, the Gilmour textbook is a good introductory textbook, while the Impey and Clancy books are great reads for people interested in a less formalistic presentation.

The central arguments are simple and powerful, and perhaps of that, it is sure to be ignored. There are no good reasons to continue devaluating our fiat currency by printing bales of money, but the folks in Congress just don't care. And why should they?I would like to see someone argue point-by-point each of the core positions Rothbard takes, but there are no really reasonable positions that are better or more logical, unless, of course, you really don't care about the consequences of government meddling in the money supply - debt, financial crisis after financial crisis, wars, and an entitlement society that cannot sustain itself. I am convinced that returning to the gold standard, correctly, would save the West, but that won't happen because a few self-appointed \\"elites\\" refuse to explain why Rothbard's ideas are wrong, and cling fanatically to the easy way of doing things - tax more, spend more, and ignore the debts."},{"Title":"What Has Government Done to Our Money? and The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar","review":"I think this is mandatory reading for every citizen to understand how paper money was forcibly created by the government and the detriments that system has for the individual.

Yet, like much of the free-market, many individuals simply don't know what the 'gold standard' is. This book encapsulates the free-market approach to money and, you know what, it makes a whole heck of a lot of sense.Rothbard starts off by saying, \\"Few economic subjects are more tangled, more confused than money. Wrangles abound over \\"tight money\\" vs. \\"easy money,\\" over the roles of the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury, over various versions of the gold standard, etc. Should the government pump money into the economy or siphon it out? Which branch of the government? Should it encourage credit or restrain it? Should it return to the gold standard? If so, at what rate? These and countless other questions multiply, seemingly without end...Of all the economic problems, money is possibly the most tangled, and perhaps where we most need perspective.\\" This book will provide that perspective, informing you how money arises in a free-society, why the 'gold standard' should be in practice, and how government policies destroys currencies and harms individuals in society.If you think the \\"gold standard\\" is simply about tying Federal Reserve Notes to gold, then this is a must read book. It will show you that much of what you believe about the gold standard is not true. If, on the other hand, the gold standard seems to make theoretical sense, but you are looking to understand it better, then this is a great source.Either way, this is a non-technical, easy to read treatment of how a government monopoly on money hurts individuals and why a gold standard works with free people. Definitely worth the couple hours it will take to read and digest this 50 or so page introduction on the 'gold standard', so the next time you espouse heterodoxy amongst friends, you will be able to explain why this is the case succinctly and clearly."},{"Title":"What Has Government Done to Our Money? and The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar","review":"There is an alternative to national bankruptcy, a bigger police state, trillion-dollar wars, and a government that draws ever more parasitically on the productive energies of the American people.

It is nothing more than a power to codify an already existing definition of the dollar ... in terms of gold; it also refers to the government's power to declare the ratio between gold and silver, or gold and any other metal, based on the market value of those metals.Another great book:The Prince (AD Classic)"},{"Title":"What Has Government Done to Our Money? and The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar","review":"Murray Rothbard excels in What Has Government Done To Our Money.

Dr. Rothbard starts by explaining what money is and how it came into existance, which may seem unnecessary but many professional economists make the mistake of not actually knowing what it really is. Rothbard explains barter, indirect exchange, and why money is much more efficient than these two systems. He talks about what qualities a good currency should have, and why a commodity such as gold can prevent inflation. Some would like to blame the gold standard for problems in our past economy, but Rothbard explains how it was gov't meddling in the gold standard, and thus making it not a true 100% free-market gold standard.

The essay reads as a defense of Von Mises's position in places.Yes, the book does read as somewhat opinionated, and no, he does not go into extensive detail. I am not faulting him for that though, as these are just short essays. Really, my only fault with the book might be the redundancy of having the two essays packaged into the same book.

Is a gold standard really needed? Individuals can own gold, so they can, if they like, convert their paper currency into gold, or any other commodity, on receipt. They could also hedge their future expected receipts of paper currency in the futures and options markets. So why bother with a gold standard?2. Is returning to a gold standard really possible? A return to the gold standard would require cooperation between countries to establish a world currency. That's kind of odd given Rothbard's fear that we're moving towards a unified world fiat currency. The recent experience with the Euro should lay those fears to rest.3. Rothbard asserts that money can only be created by the free market. This ignores the power of governments and the effect that what governments accept for tax payments affects what is defined as money.4. Rothbard asserts that all inflation is a problem. I disagree that all inflation is a problem because expected inflation is built into security returns. A portfolio of t-bills has done very well at preserving the value of currency at virtually no risk. Yes, unexpected inflation is a problem, but owning real asset helps mitigate that risk.5. Rothbard argues that it's fine for gold-backed currency to fluctuate in value. But then he asserts that it's a problem when the value of fiat currency fluctuates (pg. 54). He then asserts that inflation creates illusory profits that distort economic calculations. I've done tons of these sorts of calculations, and I can assure you that it is not a problem. I have always based my analyses on real expected cash flows and real discount rates.6. Rothbard ignores the corrosive effects of deflations and glosses over the deflationary bias built into a gold standard. This is a real problem because returns may be better from hoarding gold than from making investments in real productive capacity.7. Why gold? Why not some other commodity? I worry that using gold as money will necessarily limit its industrial uses. The cost of gold will rise and industrial uses diminish if it's just shifted from vault to vault.8. Schwartz and Friedman found that the short-term purchasing power of the dollar fluctuated greatly when we were on the gold standard. Yes, the value of gold in dollars was fixed, but what could be purchased with those dollars fluctuated greatly (the California Gold Rush was an inflationary event).9. New money would originate based primarily on mining activity in Russia and South Africa. Do we really want them to exert control over increases in the money supply? Here a quote from Brad DeLong: \\"For example, the discovery and exploitation of large gold reserves near present-day Johannesburg at the end of the nineteenth century was responsible for a four percentage point per year shift in the worldwide rate of inflation--from a deflation of roughly two percent per year before 1896 to an inflation of roughly two percent per year after 1896.\\"10. Rothbard's greatest fear seems to be the erosion of currency as a store of value. But how much wealth do most people actually tie up in currency? I use my currency to purchase rights to real assets in the stock market. After that, money is then really just used to calculate the current market value of my claim to real assets. And I do use some to support current purchases.11. If you don't trust your government, then why would you trust it to maintain a gold standard? Governments can go off of the gold standard.12. Private money has been tried before, and it was characterized by bank runs and higher transaction costs. So I find Rothbard's views here to be based more on ideology than on analysis. He asserts that private minters can guarantee coins. But didn't we just rely on private \`independent' ratings agencies to vouch for the quality of Mortgage Backed Securities? That didn't turn out so well!13. Recessions were deeper and longer when we were on a gold standard, and the US suffered through eight major recessions that tipped into depressions (1807, 1837, 1873, 1882, 1893, 1920, 1933, and 1937).14. The money supply needs to grow, in a controlled way, with the size of the economy. That is not possible with a gold standard.15. The gold standard restricts government policy options that may be needed to mitigate the collapse of aggregate demand. Friedman and Schwartz blame the severity of Great Depression on the Fed's failure to adequately expand the monetary base (I think they've over-stated their case). But that wasn't possible because the Fed had to defend the value of the dollar, so they raised rates. (Money matters, but not as much as Friedman claimed. Bernanke has done everything that Friedman claimed was needed to avoid depression. It's kept us from plunging deeper, but there's still a great deal of economic pain).16. The gold standard severely limits the government's ability to deficit spend (some view this as a positive). That keeps the economy from operating at full capacity because consumers want to save.17. Rothbard asserts that FDIC insurance has only a negligible proportion of backing for the bank deposits that it insures. This is clearly not a problem - the government can always pay obligations with a fiat currency. The real problem, in my opinion, is in the economic inefficiency of allowing banks to make bad loans that would necessitate a bail-out."},{"Title":"What Has Government Done to Our Money? and The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar","review":"The problem of financial crises is caused by the excessive power of finance capital, a trend started in 1980, when finance capital staged a coup d'etat (Volcker-Reagan) and displaced manufacturing capital as the dominant sector in capitalism. The financial sector is a bloated parasite that causes a lot more problems than it solves . It's a political problem and requires a political solution. How about going back to the Glass-Steagall act and similar restrictive legislation? The repentant Goldman Sachs bigwig Nomi Prins, who is now dishing the dirt on the Wall Street gang, has explained quite clearly the series of deregulatory moves that made the latest financial crisis possible. And those changes in the law were imposed thanks to Wall Street's lobbying & political might.If Obama is a socialist, how come Geithner is Treasury secretary, one more in an unbroken string of Treasury secretaries who were Wall Street insiders, pushing the agenda of the parasitical financial sector?The fact that Wall Street is capable of imposing its will through the current parliamentary system against the interests of the vast majority of the population calls the legitimacy of the Republic into question.When a political system loses its political legitimacy, as the current political system has unquestionably done to a great extent, as I explained above, such a political system becomes vulnerable to the threat of violent revolution.My proposal: Immediately summon a constitutional convention and create a constitution that works, one that effectively and definitively crushes the tyrannical power of finance capital.The easiest way to do that is to change the electoral system by imposing mandatory proportional representation at all levels of government, as in Italy, Germany, Israel, etc. The current winner-takes-all system cements the duopoly of Republicans and Democrats, so third parties don't have a chance. It foils the will of the majority, because to gain political power a candidate must join the Repugnicans or the \`Crats, thus becoming involved in a lot of bickering that has purely historical roots. The two-party system must be abolished by proportional representation. That is the best chance of curtailing the tyranny of parasitical finance capital.I also propose that a large guillotine be placed in a prominent place on Wall Street, and kept well oiled."},{"Title":"What Has Government Done to Our Money? and The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar","review":"Murray N. Rothbard is now recognised as one of the foremost economists of the last century, and rightly so. Not only does he write in a clear concise manner, but he takes what could be an unintelligible subject and explains it in terms everyone can grasp.In this beautiful hardbound book Rothbard gives us an exceptionally clear, detailed description of what money is and how it has come to be manipulated by governments and central bankers into almost worthless inflationary fiat paper currency.He explains how gold became the most respected and trustworthy currency of choice, how this developed into the gold standard when our paper money was actually backed by a real asset; gold, and then how our governments and particularly their central bankers then manipulated the situation until all we were left with was no gold standard and only fiat paper currency of no \\"real\\" value because it no longer had the backing of gold. He then explains very clearly how this situation has led us to where we are now; inflation and the rapidly diminishing purchasing power of the paper money we hold (over the last 30 years the real value of $1 has dropped to around 4 cents!!!!!), unnecessary asset bubbles and the prospect of either hyperinflation or the greatest depression the world has ever seen arriving in the very near future!Mr. Rothbard then rightly argues for a return to the gold standard because of it's inherent automatic adjustment mechanisms due to the scarcity of gold in the ground and the finite quantity already above ground. More importantly he advocates a 100% reserves gold standard which would put an end to fractional reserve banking and thus the ruinous credit creation/oversupply of money by our central bankers and thus an end to rampant inflation as we know it! This would also force our governments to be more accountable to their electorate in that any government allowing an unbalanced economy would face long recessions as the gold standard auto adjustment mechanisms brought it back into equilibrium; henceforth governments would be wise to provide an environment that favoured slow steady growth for their country with minimal boom bust cycles.Furthermore Mr. Rothbard adequately counters the criticisms of his conclusions & recommendations in detail.I think most of us that bother to look further than our noses and not live with our head in the sand now realise the United States financial position(in particular) is untenable in the long term and there is going to be a very painful outcome either slowly creeping through the financial world in a dollar crisis OR precipitated by a large financial event, like the probable implosion of huge OTC derivatives positions. Either way this will herald the end of the world's latest foray into fiat paper currency; it will fail as it must and as fiat currencies always have in the past.When that happens, HOPEFULLY we will return to a 100% gold standard where our paper money, gold grams or whatever are 100% backed by gold; the only true currency, and sanity can once again return to the finances of our world!I wholeheartedly recommend this book to EVERYONE in the hope that more of the populations of the world can become educated to what we have been \\"sold\\" by our governments with these worthless paper currencies we now all hold in the hope that there can be a groundswell of opinion and an overwhelming chorus to return to sanity and a 100% gold standard!

You see the problem was that in real [gold] money no one earned enough to have to share with the IRS and that greatly upset the IRS. So the IRS filed charges on a few people, a total of 176 counts and the jury failed to convict on even one because we do in fact have a dual money system in this country and the accused had done nothing illegal. It's simply not their fault the Federal Reserve [Fiat money] system is failing to hold its supposed value and has caused inflation at a current level of over 16 to 1, and still rising.

He presents the subject simply and in a way that makes for very interesting reading, in a field that is not known for producing page-turners. The book is short, and provides a solid understanding of money and how it works, even for someone with no background in economics. I don't know why I didn't read this when I was in high school; it should be required reading for every high school student. If thousands of years of history have shown anything at all, they have shown conclusively that one thing we can be absolutely certain of is the addiction of government to the plunder of its own people by debasing its money. Murray Rothbard has shown precisely how this is accomplished, as well as pointing out some of the moral implications of a fraudulent monetary system.It seems to me that when almost everyone spends most of their lives focusing on acquiring, accumulating, and increasing money, they should pay at least minimal attention to the basics of what money fundamentally is, and how readily it can (and inevitably will) be destroyed by a government that has granted itself absolute control over the money mechanism. This book will explain all of that, and it is sure to get your attention."},{"Title":"What Has Government Done to Our Money? and The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar","review":"Although the subject of this book is highly controversial, and many readers may not accept the author's tenets, it is a must read.Initially, the author postulates a fictional country with a monetary system based strictly on the gold standard and, to some extent, silver. He then explains, in layman's terms, how such a system would function and shows that it would be completely stable, self-correcting and inflation-free. He then introduces paper as \\"warehouse receipts,\\" and demonstrates that their introduction wouldn't damage the system unless, by some means, more warehouse receipts were printed than there was money in the warehouses (banks) to back them up. He goes on to describe how such an expansion of the currency might be accomplished through central banks and explains how it might be done in such a way that the general public would no longer even make the connection between the warehouse receipts, now termed \\"money,\\" and the supposed gold reserves. Finally, he analyses and assesses the economic impacts of such an inflation of the paper money supply on the society itself and on its interactions with other nations.Following that, the author walks the reader through the various international agreements which have been consummated by governments down through the years in their efforts to allow government sponsored inflation while still maintaining some semblance of a stable international monetary system. Each agreement is evaluated and the reasons for its ultimate failure are identified.Finally, the author offers his insight into the future if the nations of the world continue going in the economic direction they have chosen.Thoughtful readers will likely see that Rothschild was right in the early 1800s, when he observed that there are very few people who \\"really understand the true value of gold.\\" And he or she might easily conclude that there have been far too many economists since that time who didn't understand its value in a monetary system either; but that, sadly, too many politicians did. For it is obvious, from this reading, that the determined efforts of these men over the years to dissociate paper script (Dollars, Francs, Pounds, et. al) from money (gold and silver) have time-after-time led the nations of the world to the brink of economic disaster.In any event, even if one can't recall the past, doesn't believe the author's analyses, and can't accept his forewarning; this book certainly provides food for thought and sheds a great deal of light on the mechanisms by which the U.S. government, in particular, and other governments, in general, manipulate their money supplies. For those reasons alone, it is well worth reading and, quite possibly, re-reading."},{"Title":"What Has Government Done to Our Money? and The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar","review":"I recommend this book to everyone I know.

After having been befuddled for many years whilst trying to make sense of what mainstream economists had to say about money, credit, inflation, and so forth, this book was a real eye-opener."},{"Title":"Manhood Development in Urban African-American Communities","review":"This book covers theories, research and intervention programs which were or are designed to address issues that young African-American men face in urban areas.

After reading this outstanding scrapbook biography, I realize that this woman WAS the most influential woman in the history of our country. Fleming has presented much factual information about Eleanor and has arranged it to lead readers to a clear understanding of the character, personality, background, and motivations of this truly remarkable woman. The author presents relevant biographical information clearly and honestly, allowing the reader to draw their own conclusions. Fleming's straightforward presentation does not condescend to young readers. Refreshing and all too rare in its honesty, this is an exceptional biography of a multi-talented social activist. Although written for young readers, I recommend it for all readers, young and old."},{"Title":"Our Eleanor: A Scrapbook Look at Eleanor Roosevelt's Remarkable Life","review":"A perfectly written biography. Anyone interested in politics, women, American history, civil rights, human rights, and making a difference in the world MUST read this book.

This feeling came from her mother, who often gazed at her daughter coolly, as if she couldn't imagine having such a plain-looking, solemn-faced daughter. Forced to wear a back brace to correct a curvature of the spine, Eleanor knew 'as a child knows these things,' that her mother was bitterly disappointed in her physical features. 'I can remember,' wrote Eleanor, 'standing in the door, very often with my finger in my mouth which was, of course, forbidden--and I can see the look in her eyes and hear the tone in her voice as she said: \\"Come in, Granny.\\" If a visitor was there, she might turn and say, \\"She is such a funny child, so old-fashioned that we always call her Granny.\\" I wanted to sink through the floor in shame.'\\"Eleanor tried desperately to please her mother. Small as she was, she often sat and rubbed [her mother] Anna's temples for hours on end, easing her migraine headaches. 'The feeling that I was useful,' Eleanor later said, 'was perhaps the greatest joy I experienced.' \\"In the manner of American Idol, AOL and the Discovery Channel have been conducting an online process to determine \\"The Greatest American.\\" Happening upon the poll containing the Final Five last week, and reading aloud to Shari what was being done, she grumbled in response to the fact that the remaining contestants were all men. I haven't yet dared to tell her which of those five men has since taken the top spot, thanks to 2.4 million online voters with the wisdom to believe that Ronald Reagan was a greater America than was MLK, Abe Lincoln, Ben Franklin, or the dude with the wooden teeth.If those participating in \\"The Greatest American\\" voting had had the wisdom to make sure that at least one American woman be present among those final contestants, who would have been the most likely female to fill such a spot? OUR ELEANOR provides readers with more than enough evidence for proposing that Eleanor Roosevelt be considered as one of the greatest of citizens in the history of America, irregardless of gender. Candace Fleming does a sensational job of recounting the amazing accomplishments of Eleanor Roosevelt, both in Eleanor's own right, and as the eyes, ears and often the conscience of her husband, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.But at least as important as unveiling the record of Eleanor's prodigious achievements on the national and world stage, the author succeeds brilliantly in revealing the real woman behind the public figure. Closely examined are the relationships with her parents, her husband, her children, her mother-in-law, her friends, and famous world leaders, as well as with the hundreds of thousands of nameless everyday people, both Americans and others, with whom she came in contact over her long, oftentimes difficult life.\\"[Franklin's mother] Sara frequently made thoughtless. stinging comments that deeply hurt Eleanor. Once, in front of a dozen dinner guests, Sara turned to her daughter-in-law. 'If you'd just run a comb through your hair, dear,' she said, 'you'd look so much better.' Another time, during a luncheon party, Sara left Eleanor standing while she showed all the other guests to their seats. She was already serving the soup when she finally turned to her daughter-in-law. 'Oh, yes, Eleanor,' she said snidely, 'you sit there.\\"With the births of Franklin and Eleanor's five children, Sara's interference became intolerable, causing terrible family friction. Sara spoiled them from infancy to adulthood with expensive presents--ponies, trips, cars, apartments. As one of the children put it long afterward, 'Granny's ace in the hole...was the fact that she held the pursestrings in the family.' Worse, Sara undercut Eleanor's authority and confidence by repeatedly calling the children hers. She once told little Jimmy, 'Your mother only bore you, I am more your mother than your mother is.' \\"When the emotional and verbal abuse by her mother and then her mother-in-law led to serious difficulties in fulfilling her role as mother to her children, Eleanor eventually turned to mothering the American people through the Great Depression and World War II. A woman who wore through the soles of two pairs of shoes while meeting 400,000 servicemen during a five-week trip to the war-torn South Pacific of WWII, Eleanor is revealed by Ms. Fleming to be both a woman of her times and a woman who was driven to move far beyond those times to change the world to the benefit of all who have come since.Speaking of driven:\\"Independence-seeking Eleanor took up driving--an uncommon activity for women of her social class, who usually took taxis or rode in chauffeur-driven cars--in 1920. She had tried to learn years earlier, but an incident involving a car bumper and a gatepost had put her off. Now however, she longed to experience the freedom of driving. There were many mishaps. 'Your running into the ditch was all right,' Sara wrote her in 1922, 'so long as you were not hurt.' Still, Eleanor drove herself to church, to luncheons, to speaking events. Once, to her family's dismay, she even drove herself on a camping trip to Canada and reported only three minor accidents. Admitted her son James, 'Mother's driving was worse than anyone's.' She scraped, bumped, and banged her way down the road until 1946, the year she fell asleep behind the wheel. Her car veered across the highway, slammed into another vehicle head-on, then sideswiped one more. The accident cost Eleanor her two front teeth.\\"As with BEN FRANKLIN'S ALMANAC, the author's previous biography, OUR ELEANOR is written in a series of well-illustrated one- and two-page self-contained sections. Even more than with the Ben Franklin book, the various sections of the Eleanor \\"scrapbook\\" flow easily into one another to form an entertaining and enlightening narrative. Mixed right in with Eleanor's convincing her husband to disband the Japanese internment camps, her evolution from anti-Semite to supporter of Israel, her service at the United Nations, and her long career as a writer, are great stories about her attempt to be taught to use a gun in lieu of the Secret Service agent with whom she refused to be stuck, her support of public libraries, and the 3,271 page FBI file that J. Edgar Hoover compiled on her.\\"On April 20, 1933, the world-famous aviator Amelia Earhart attended a dinner at the White House. Afterward she invited Eleanor along on an airplane flight from Washington, D.C. to Baltimore and back--the first lady's first night trip. Eager to show the public how easy and safe air travel was, Eleanor quickly agreed. Afterward reporters asked how it felt to be piloted by a woman. Eleanor replied, 'I'd give a lot to do it myself!' She did consider getting her own pilot's license, but Franklin vetoed the idea. 'I know how Eleanor drives a car,' he is reported to have said. 'Imagine her flying an airplane!' \\"Time and time again I found that OUR ELEANOR: A SCRAPBOOK LOOK AT ELEANOR ROOSEVELT'S REMARKABLE LIFE revealed connections and relationships to scores of important people and events in American history. Eleanor worked for Women's Rights alongside Carrie Chapman Catt in the National League of Women Voters. Eleanor worked for Civil Rights, being a friend and supporter of Marian Anderson, raising money for the Southern Christian Leadership Council and working as an intermediary between President Kennedy and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Eleanor worked for Human Rights, debating in private with Nikita Khrushchev and representing the US at the United Nations. Eleanor worked for Workers' Rights, riding two-and-a-half-miles down into a coal mine to observe conditions and then badgering her husband to improve them. Eleanor worked for the rights of prisoners, for the aged and infirm, and she never shied away from hanging out in public or private with friends or acquaintances because they were lesbians.The life of Eleanor Roosevelt continues to provide inspiration for all women, from the First Ladies who have succeeded her to the girls in the inner cities, small towns, and suburbs who deal with boys still trying to tell them what they can and can't do.You can keep the Gipper. I'll take OUR ELEANOR."},{"Title":"Our Eleanor: A Scrapbook Look at Eleanor Roosevelt's Remarkable Life","review":"... but this one has been, for me.I was actually moved to tears as I read some parts: Eleanor visiting troops in the South Pacific; Eleanor pleading for Israel's right to become a state, by 1948; her grief at Fala's death--what a foolish reporter, who commented that she was dry-eyed at FDR's death, but could weep when the dog died! Totally clueless person.A monumental life, marked by all the human characteristics of failures, victories, heartaches, jubilations... she took little credit, and shouldered lots of blame.I also find it noteworthy to look at the reactions of all the first ladies, after her, to Eleanor. Very telling, to my mind!GREAT JOB! Best biography I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Our Eleanor: A Scrapbook Look at Eleanor Roosevelt's Remarkable Life","review":"This complete biography of Eleanor Roosevelt chronicles her early childhood to her years alone after Franklin's death in 1945. Her transition from an upper class woman to one fought for and espoused several social causes is well depicted. She actively canvassed for woman's rights and labour rights - particularly during the depression years. She supported African Americans in their struggle for racial equality. She participated in the making of the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights. This is a remarkable woman who made change a constant part of her life.This book is well made with several illustrations. It is not just a coffee table book with pretty pictures. Several important people in Eleanor's life are well portrayed like Louis Howe, Lorena Hickock and Joseph Lash. However Harry Hopkins is overlooked. The author does speculate on Eleanor's sexual orientation and a possible affair with another man. She fortunately presents this in a non-judgemental manner. These are events of long ago and her husband was not known as the most attentive of human beings. Also mentioned is the immense file that the F.B.I. kept on Eleanor.Also, regretfully, Franklin's mother, Sara, gets another poor portrayal as an overbearing and intrusive \\"mother-in-law\\". It is not pointed out that she provided extensive care for her grand-children over the years. Both Franklin and Eleanor were not particularly effective parents - they were young and nave when they married and not well prepared for parenthood. Sara looked after her grand-children while both Franklin and Eleanor were pursuing their careers or vacationing. She was always available as a substitute parent. Candace Fleming and other authors have not given her credit for this. See \\"Sara and Eleanor\\" by Jan Pottker for a completely different point of view. And congratulations to 10-14 year olds who read this book (this is the age group cited on the dust jacket) - I am way beyond that age and the book appealed to me!"},{"Title":"Our Eleanor: A Scrapbook Look at Eleanor Roosevelt's Remarkable Life","review":"This is the book that inspired to read every biography that I could lay my heads on. A well-received birthday present, I read this through on one four-hour plane ride to Vail, Colorado. I was immediately enthralled by the beautiful pictures and beautifully written informative pieces. Fleming creates a perfect balance between intriguing photographs and information. She makes Eleanor into a real person, not some political angel that was sent to Earth to rescue the world from all evil. Eleanor was by no means perfect; she was, self-admittedly, a poor mother, and spent the early years of life disliking Jews. However, she grew into a kind, proactive, accepting woman that did all she could to help the people around her when her universe was falling apart. Despite a tumultuous early life with an alcoholic father and a disappointing personal wife with an adulterous husband, Eleanor made the best of what she had, and the world has her to thank for surviving some of its most difficult years. Fleming invokes much emotion in her readers, and skipping this book will surely be something you regret later on."},{"Title":"Our Eleanor: A Scrapbook Look at Eleanor Roosevelt's Remarkable Life","review":"Eleanor Roosevelt was very like a diamond in the rough. She wasn't much to look at on the outside, but she was stunningly beautiful on the inside. She was strong, multi-faceted, rare, and flawed.Author Candace Fleming did a wonderful job of showing all aspects of the amazing Mrs. Roosevelt, from her childhood to her death. This was a clearly unbiased portrait, backed by research and notes galore. Fleming does not patronize her young readers. She shows the good, the bad, and the ugly about one woman's life.The best part about the book is its scrapbook style layout, which allows the reader to peek at little snippets at a time, or read long passages. Full of rare photographs, letters, and little known facts, this book is one of the best biographies I've ever read!Reviewed by: Julie M. Prince"},{"Title":"Our Eleanor: A Scrapbook Look at Eleanor Roosevelt's Remarkable Life","review":"We older persons grew up with Franklin Delano Roosevelt as our thirty-second president, who at four terms was our longest serving. And we knew Eleanor his wife, who remained active nationally for many years after his death. Young people may not know much about her.So, please come in, take a seat, and let me show you this scrapbook about Eleanor. Isn't her picture on the cover lovely? She was indeed a lovely person.I had been wanting to show you Our Eleanor: A Scrapbook Look at Eleanor Roosevelt's Remarkable Life, by Candace Fleming.The design and big size of the book are perfect. You can feel how heavy and semiglossy the paper is. As a hardback it is an enduring treasure.There are photographs on practically every page. And much more. The many articles are well written and presented artfully on the page, the fonts are varied, and many thoughtful quotations of Eleanor's are included, for she did a lot of writing.We learn that Eleanor was born to privilege, but had a hard childhood. Her mother, who was demeaning toward her, died when Eleanor was eight. \\"With my father I was perfectly happy,\\" she wrote. But shortly before she was ten years old, her father also died, a suicide.Eleanor's uncle and godfather was her father's older brother, Theodore Roosevelt, who became our twenty-sixth president. He instilled in her the importance of social responsibility and helping those less fortunate. Eleanor remained a humanitarian all her life.She was first educated by tutor until almost fifteen and then sent to a school in England, where she met an enlightened teacher and developed a winning personality and many friends.We follow Eleanor through marriage and children; through her husband Franklin's loss of the use of his legs from polio. As first lady during Franklin's long presidency, she traveled the country, becoming his \\"eyes and ears,\\" since he could not travel easily, and reporting back to him with advice.She continued teaching, lecturing, writing, and editing. In her sixties at the United Nations, she chaired the commission that created the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Eleanor was intelligent and always a charming and hardworking lady.Our Eleanor is for more mature children and for young adults.

Perlovsky traces the history of AI in a thoughtful and scholarly manner, emphasizing his philosophy and his own generalization of the theory which he calls Modeling Field Theory (MFT). He also traces the study of intelligence back to the Greek philosophers beginning with Plato and Aristotle some 2300 years ago.The book however, provides more than just a philosophy for artificial intelligence. It mixes in some very important mathematics from the disciplines of engineering, statistics and computer science. Mathematical techniques and models have been particularly useful in the solution to problems in classification, clustering, pattern recognition, rule-based expert system development, multiple-target tracking, orbit determination and Kalman filtering, and time series prediction.Perlovsky, over the course of his career, has had a great deal of involvement in the development of this research in both his consulting work and his work at Nichols Research Corporation. I know a lot about this because, in 1980 I began working at the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo California as a MTS (statistician). I worked on statistical problems including Kalman filtering, image processing, image recognition, orbit determination, rule-based expert systems, multiple-target tracking and target discrimination. When I moved over to manage the tracking and discrimination algorithm development for the Air Force's Space Surveillance and Tracking System I became familar with the work being done for us by contractors that included Nichols Research Corporation (NRC). I became very familar with the work of Perlovsky and his colleagues at Nichols Research who supported us from the Newport Beach, Colorado Springs and Boston offices of the company on the multiple-target tracking algorithms and the target classification algorithms. I found the work to be so interesting and of such high quality that I joined NRC in 1988.Perlovsky sees artifical intelligence as a very practical discipline and believes that computing machines can do a good job of at least mimicking human intelligence through the use of a priori knowledge (as rules preprogrammed into the computer or a priori probability distributions) along with experience (collected data from observational or statistical designed studies) combined using algorithms (Bayes theorem, adaptive neural networks) based on the mathematical foundation of uncertainty incorporated through probability theory and/or fuzzy set theory.In my experience, I have found rule-based expert systems to be one of the major successful developments in the field of artificial intelligence. At the heart of these systems lies the tools of mathematics and statistics, including the discriminant or classification algorithms based on multivariate Gaussian models (linear and quadratic classifiers) and the nonparametric classification algorithms (kernel discriminant algorithms and classification tree algorithms). Also, patterns can be discovered by computers through the use of clustering algorithms based on Gaussian mixture models or nonparametric techniques like nearest neighbor rules.The Bayesian approach to statistical analysis has been useful in many areas including the Kalman filter. In Kalman filtering prior knowledge plus current data is used to update the estimate of the current state and for the prediction of the future state of a dynamic system using a simple recursive algorithm that is easily updated in the computer. Many of these developments are well characterized and developed from first principles in this text.Perlovsky emphasizes his own work including the MLANS system which is a neural network system that incorporates important statistical ideas such as maximum likelihood, the Cramer-Rao inequality and statistical efficiency along with the neural network architecture.Some of this work was developed by Perlovsky under an Army contract that was coincidentally managed by my brother Julian. I have always viewed this research as being successful because it applied appropriate statistical models to the real problems. I think the crucial aspects of this work are the appropriate use of the Bayesian paradigm and teh indentification of appropriate models for construction of the likelihood equations. The fundamental and well established tools of probability and statistics are the keys. In his proposals, Leonid also included ideas from fuzzy set theory and embedded his methods in an artificial neural network framework. I always thought that these modern theories (fuzzy set theory and neural networks) were gimmicks to get military funding. This may not have been a fair assessment on my part as a careful reading of this book indicates that Perlovsky honestly views these tools as important.There are subtleties to concepts such as fuzzy set theory. Although I do not yet see its value as a substitute for measure theoretic probability theory for characterizing human uncertainty, it is possible that I just haven't thought hard enough about it. Maybe a continued reading and rereading of Perlovsky's book will help me.This is a very interesting and unique book on artificial intelligence from a perspective that is quite different from what one find in the standard books written by computer scientists (who often do not have the deep understanding of probability and statistics that Perlovsky possesses)."},{"Title":"Neural Networks and Intellect: Using Model-Based Concepts","review":"Perlovsky has published a large number of papers exploring limitations associated with today's main approaches to AI. This book captures the essence of those papers with the addition of developing and expanding Perlovsky's philosophy of AI.Perlovsky takes the reader through the development of AI from its behaviouristic beginnings through Minsky's &quot;revolution&quot; of purely symbolic AI. He then goes through some more recent methods of combining both methods with some adaptive learning techniques. For all cases Perlovsky clearly demonstrates the inherent limitations of all methods through analytic means.He then presents his view on a possible way forward though adaptive networks employing fuzzy logic, illustrated with some examples such as work done on SAR image analysis. Throughout the book he provides many examples and certainly this will make an excellent advanced textbook for the field of AI.I am particularly impressed by his good overview and development of his philosophical views. After years of books by people like the Churchland's, Chalmers, Searle and Hofstadter this is finally a great example of someone who is not afraid to cut through the fluff and expose the real problem to further progress. This should be required reading for anyone looking into philosophy, in particular the philosophy of mind and science. The references are very valuable and Perlovsky and done an excellent job of listing many.That said, there are a few points I would suggest for the next edition of this book. First, I find it odd that Perlovsky seems unaware of Chaitin's work in algorithmic information theory, particularly his book &quot;The Limits of Mathematics&quot;. Considering Perlovsky's many references to Godel and Turing this is a glaring omission. Also, he is missing a reference to Wilson's excellent &quot;Spikes, Decisions, and Actions : The Dynamical Foundations of Neurosciences&quot;, possibly because it is also a very recent publication. These three books belong together!Perlovsky also needs to answer the issues posed by Susan Haack (&quot;Deviant Logic, Fuzzy Logic : Beyond the Formalism&quot;) regarding the viability of fuzzy logic and better-define the methods that are the &quot;correct&quot; interpretation when applied to neural networks. I would hope to see an expansion on this theme in the future.There are some irritating small problems, the most major being the spelling of &quot;Plank&quot; throughout the text; someone's spellcheck was acting up I guess...The index is a bit thin as well.An excellent book and, as stated in the other reveiw, &quot;must&quot; reading for anyone interested in the future of AI. Perlovsky, Chaitin, Prigogine, Wilson and James H. Austin (&quot;Zen and the Brain&quot;) are to be applauded for breaking with the current strangling hold of ancient thought."},{"Title":"Neural Networks and Intellect: Using Model-Based Concepts","review":"The book is a fascinating review of concepts in philosophy, semiotics, and mathematics of intelligence; it is interesting for a wide audience, not just for mathematicians. The author relates mathematics and philosophy and finds detailed and specific connections, suggesting that the evolution of mathematics of intelligence during the last fifty years paralleled the evolution of philosophy of mind beginning from Plato. The author develops mathematical techniques for semiotics, which reconciles the differences among concepts in classical semiotics. He argues that *symbol* as understood in general culture is a process relating conscious and unconscious, and he proposes modifications in semiotic terminology needed to bring in correspondence varying usages of this term. A most intriguing is a chapter that connects the mathematics to Kantian theory; an ability for perceiving beauty, concludes the author, is associated with learning. A useful feature of the book is the proposed course outlines for mathematically prepared students and for non-mathematicians."},{"Title":"Neural Networks and Intellect: Using Model-Based Concepts","review":"The book offers a fresh view of artificial intelligence (AI). Particularly interesting is the drawn analogy between longstanding philosophical questions and problems of modern AI. Even though the knowledge of modern statistical and math concepts is required to understand technical issues most of the ideas are explained on the intuitive level. The key technical problem discussed in this book is multiple model identification from overlapping data samples. The problem is related to computer-based vision, radar target tracking, financial market analysis, and speech recognition. The combinatorial explosion of computational complexity usually is associated with this class of problems and present the great challenge for modern computational science. The author reviews contemporary mathematical approaches, argues that the problem is related to differences between Plato and Aristotle about origin of human intelligence, and explores various approaches among works of famous philosophers in human history. Finally a non-combinatorial solution is offered through the introduction of novel Modeling Field Theory, that combines fuzzy logic with learning and adaptation. This book is a must read for people working with AI."},{"Title":"Neural Networks and Intellect: Using Model-Based Concepts","review":"While this book is not mainstream and would not be a good place to try to begin to learn AI it is thought provoking and presents a number of new ideas. Where Rod Brooks seaks to eliminate internal models Perlovsky makes them a part of his definition of intelligence. I rather liked the philosophical slant of the book. Perlovsky expects to overcome complexity using fuzzy logic. Looked at from Allen Newell's multiple levels or bands perspective fuzzy logic is an extension of classical logic and in any real computer is implemented by a lower level (underlying level) of ordinary Boolean logic. It would seem to me that different granularities at each level would accomplish the same thing. Rules in first order logic can represent subsymbolic entities just as easily as they represent macroscopic objects and actions. Perlovsky presents an interesting MLANS architecture but gives rather less detail on a hierachical version. The computational complexity of these recurrent networks looks rather high to me. Perlovsky's book is a good challenge to those who have already studied some traditional AI and connectionist literature. He criticizes nearest neighbor (and CBR) systems but it seens to me that they offer some very fast parallel implementations such as Kanerva's distributed memory and Stanfill and Waltz's memory-based reasoning."},{"Title":"Neural Networks and Intellect: Using Model-Based Concepts","review":"This is an important book, but it would be more useful if it didn't have so many errors in the equations.

Equation 5.2-11 should have det(Cbar) in the numerator. There are many more errors like these in just the MLANS description in Chapter 5."},{"Title":"Breakaway: A Gail McCarthy Mystery (Gail McCarthy Mysteries)","review":"In Santa Cruz County, California, Veterinarian Dr. Gail McCarthy feels depressed about her personal life since her boyfriend Lonnie Peterson left town. Her work has not helped her mood and dating Clay Bishop fails to pick her out of her gloom. She does make a new friend, artist Nicole Deveraux, but the circumstances under which they first met are nasty. Someone tied up Nico's docile mare and apparently &quot;raped&quot; the horse, leaving behind a substance that looks like semen. Because the European Nico is an illegal alien, she rejects calling the police.Gail's friend Kris Griffith becomes the owner of the second horse victim as her mare is sexually abused and her daughter knocked out. This time the police are called and verify the fluid left behind is semen. Apparently, the culprit is becoming more compulsive and the question is whether women will be next and if yes will he kill to remain hidden?BREAKAWAY spends most of the plot following Gail as she battles with depression. The who-done-it does not form until two-thirds of the tale is finished. Thus, Laura Crum's novel is more of a character study with even the mystery tying back to Gail&iacute;'s present psychological woes.

However, fans that enjoy a leisurely paced horse ride will want to read BREAKAWAY.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Breakaway: A Gail McCarthy Mystery (Gail McCarthy Mysteries)","review":"While I found the basic premise of the book a little hard to believe (or maybe I just didn't WANT to believe it - to give the author credit, she says that it is loosely based on an incident that actually occurred at a barn where she boarded her horses), it offers Crum's usual mix of suspense, veterinary information and background in the world of horse people, along with a surprise culprit. I didn't figure this one out midway through the book.Crum's books offer my favorite combination - horses and mystery. My only complaints are that her books are too short and there is too much time between releases!"},{"Title":"Breakaway: A Gail McCarthy Mystery (Gail McCarthy Mysteries)","review":"This is the second book I've read by Laura Crum, after Chasing Cans, and my primary impression is that her protagonist sure whines a lot. I am attracted to the \\"horsey\\" subject and the veterinary profession but I can't say I've been thrilled by either of the books I've read. In Chasing Cans she whines because she can't be a stay-at-home mommy and a full time vet, and in this one she whines about being depressed.So - in Breakaway, vet Gail McCarthy is battling depression apparently triggered by breaking up with a long-time boyfriend. We get pages of her fighting to get up and get going. She gets badmouthed by a client after a vet call, but we don't get much about horses she cures. No doubt the author meant this to show how depression can slant things, but as a new reader I'm not really sure if she's meant to be competent or not.The mystery is interesting (although creepy), and sadly you know it could happen. The book is a nice fast read. I liked the mystery, the descriptions of her house and her friend's paintings, the rides she takes - but ultimately I'd rather read about characters that have more self-confidence and fewer problems.I'll give her one more try, maybe I can find one of the earlier books."},{"Title":"Breakaway: A Gail McCarthy Mystery (Gail McCarthy Mysteries)","review":"Here is a woman leading a very interesting life.

The play also includes an aged Dolley Madison and the crusty Whig, John Quincy Adams. It is a play replete with romance, humor, and quiet symbolism--a sweet history lesson.

I found it to be an extremely useful reference, particularly for advanced students who are beyond learning the nuts and bolts of the language, but still need help with usage, as is the case with many non-native speakers. Unfortunately, this book has been out of print for quite some time. My good fortune of finding a copy at a used bookstore in Philadelphia prompted me to write a review.This book is not a grammar reference per se - if you need help with the mechanics of forming past passive participles or declining numbers you should look elsewhere (I'd recommend a book like \\"A Comprehensive Russian Grammar\\" by Terence Wade or \\"Russian: A Practical Grammar with Exercises\\" by Pulkina). However, if you want to better understand issues such as the usage of verbal aspect and tense or the nuances of vocabulary, this book is ideal. The authors provide abundant examples of usage with translations to help the reader understand the case in point. The only comparable book that I am aware of is \\"Using Russian: A Guide to Contemporary Usage\\" by Derek Offord, which I would also recommend.As a former student, military linguist and teacher of Russian I've utilized a number of reference books and consider this one of the best available. You probably won't be able to find an immaculate copy of this book (mine has seen better days), but if you are a serious student of the Russian language I suggest you hunt down a copy in whatever condition is available."},{"Title":"Southern Heritage Pies and Pastry Cookbook","review":"This collection of Southern recipes along with companion stories of where the recipes are from is an excellent way for anyone, Southerner or otherwise, to learn about entertaining in the southern United States. The books are not only fun to cook from but offer enjoyable reading as well. Anyone interested in historical recipes should get this collection!"},{"Title":"Southern Heritage Pies and Pastry Cookbook","review":"I own several pie cookbooks, but this is one of my favorites. Pies, pastries, cobblers, different kinds of crusts, bake and no-bake...this is a great book to own or to give as a gift. Pie baking is definitely an art and one well worth learning. This book makes a good addition to any cookbook library whether you are a beginning baker or one who has been pie-making for years.In addition to recipes, the book contains old photographs, advertising, and tidbits of information that are fascinating and fun.Highly recommended, as are all the books in this series. Pick em all up if you can. It took me years to collect them all and it was a hunt that was well worth the time."},{"Title":"Southern Heritage Pies and Pastry Cookbook","review":"I am elated to be able to add this book to my collection that I started many years ago when these book were first offered thru mail-order. I refused the Pie & Pastry Cookbook, thinking I would learn from my Mother. She died before she could teach me all her wonderful pie making secrets. These are the only Cookbooks that any one needs in their Collection...That is if you love Southern Cooking!! Who doesn't?? Thank you for providing me this book and the super fast shipping. It was a pleasure to purchase from you."},{"Title":"Face to Face: A Reader in the World","review":"Ms. Schwartz is an essayist of astonishing perception, skill, and power. She has taken the simple notions of being face to face (and its opposite) and explored them with a thoroughness and thoughtfulness that will probably guide you in all your relationships to make them ever richer.I like books of essays because they provide more diversity of perspective than a nonfiction book or a novel can. This one was exceptionally rewarding in this way.In 'Only Connect', you will learn about the cons and pros (there are mostly cons) of the telephone in Ms. Schwartz's life, along with an interesting description of how our use of the telephone is changing. I share her dislike of telephones, so I was cheered by her thoughts on this subject.'Absence Makes the Heart' is a sensitive discussion of how friendship changes when you are apart, and how it differs when you are reunited again.'On Being Taken by Tom Victor' describes photography sessions with a master who later dies of AIDS. His great gift as a photographer was &quot;to talk . . . to give something.&quot; After you received his gift of himself, you would show yourself to the camera.'Found in Translation' is a fascinating story of the author's experience in translating the memoirs of Lana Millu about Ms. Millu's time in Birkenau, the women's part of Auschwitz, during World War II. Since the author's Italian was weak, she found a person to help her who she had first met when the helper was a small child in Italy. The two problems that almost threw Ms. Schwartz turned out to be typos that the publisher was slow to alert her to. As a novelist, she had cooked up some very imaginative solutions that were, alas, all wrong. She wonders how many translations suffer from the same problem. I do too.'The Spoils of War' describes an experience of teaching a Vietnam vet who has an amazing mind. The author cannot make any sense of it. &quot;You write like this and sit in class like a statue?&quot; The man is a parking meter reader. His war experience has left him inhibited in his dealing with people.'Help' is the most deeply affecting essay. It is about the friendship that develops between her family and Mattie, the cleaning lady who also took care of her children. If you don't read any other essays in this book, be sure you read this one.'Drive, She Said' looks at her ambivalence about driving, and her attempts to develop an independent attitude from those of her parents towards driving. &quot;I am terrified and elated.&quot;'Two Fashion Statements' juxtapose an experience of wearing a new dress while young on a date to Radio City Music Hall with her reaction to house dresses coming back into fashion years later.'Face to Face' recounts her cat-sitting experiences for four months, and her reactions after it was over. &quot;I missed the cat with my heart.&quot;'Listening to Powell' is a powerful description of listening to a modern classic book on tape, A Dance to the Music of Time.'At a Certain Age' considers the differences between her mother's attitudes towards growing older and her own.'The Page Turner' is a tour de force in pointing out how the page turner in a concert can embody the whole experience for us. &quot;The very banality of her task lends her a dignity . . . &quot; that will cause her to be remembered along with the music more than the musicians will.After you finish these essays, I encourage you to consider how you can use being present and absent in different ways to expand your relationships with others. Overcome your bias in favor of assuming that more physical closeness is all that is needed. Proper distance can bring more closeness in many ways."},{"Title":"Face to Face: A Reader in the World","review":"Don't be fooled. You may at first think you are having a quiet, informal conversation with Ms. Schwartz. You are, in a sense. But the ease with which she &quot;speaks,&quot; the depth at which she enters the conversation, and the apparent mundanity of the subject matter belie the profundity. This is one of those conversations--they can occur on a Fall afternoon after enjoying some wine in a cool wine cellar or reuniting after many years one summer morning in a Village cafe with a friend from abroad. As you listen, you know the words you hear are peeling off layers of your long-held intellectual skin.Other reviewers have recounted the content of these essays. That's fine. What matters, though, is the at once soothing and disturbing voice which uproots you from the seat you are occupying,the sleep you are sleeping, the beliefs you are treasuring. Finally, you are grateful.You can probably hear Ms. Schwartz from her works as I did when she signed copies of this book at a New York bookstore. It's an enjoyable, moving experience. It's pale, though in comparison to listening in isolation to her voice as it lifts off the pages into your processing mechanism and turns it once again into a heart."},{"Title":"Face to Face: A Reader in the World","review":"This is an excellent collection of from the author's life. The one that affected me the most was about the relationship between the author and an African American woman she hired as her maid. She always looked down on people who said the maid was &quot;one of the family,&quot; she wrote: obviously there were lots of differences. And yet, the two of them got very close. This is a tough issue to write something sensible about, but Ms. Schwartz has written something thought-provoking and moving."},{"Title":"A Map of Misreading (Galaxy Books, 623)","review":"After shaking up the academic world with his &quot;theoretical&quot; &quot;Anxiety of Influence&quot;, Bloom begins to settle into what would prove his proper mode--the discursive literary essay. &quot;A Map of Misreading&quot; centers upon Browning's &quot;Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came&quot; (one of Bloom's touchstones for his theories) as the perfect example of the latecomer Romantic poet struggling against his precursors. It is Bloom's wonder and love of this poem that is on display here as much as &quot;proof&quot; of his theory.What is most evident in all of Bloom's books, and what is most important, is an obvious passion for reading (reading anything and everything). Bloom ranges across British and American Poets to discover how poems struggle against other poems. But, frankly, what I've always come away from a Bloom book with is a map of Bloom's misreadings that are worth a college education in and of themselves. We discover Emerson afresh and hear of Dutch Psychologist J. H. Van Den Berg, discover we must encounter Hans Jonas on Gnosticism and The Kabbalah of Isaac Luria(if we're to know anything of the roots of literary struggling against the precursor) and wish we'd memorized Paradise Lost. In short, for me, he encourages continued and life-long (mis)reading."},{"Title":"A Map of Misreading (Galaxy Books, 623)","review":"Harold Bloom is the great literary critic of our age. His passion for reading is felt in every line he writes. This does not mean that his lead- ideas as the 'anxiety of influence' and 'map of misreading' are to be taken uncritically, but rather that they ordinarily lead him to ' open up the texts' in new ways, making surprising and interesting connections."},{"Title":"Simplicity: Finding Peace by Uncluttering Your Life","review":"ms. thomas is a obviously a master of words, and she certainly has chosen them carefully and effectively! &quot;Simplicity&quot; is a book that will cater to every woman (and i think men can glean much wisdom as well) desiring to get it right.

DO NOT READ"},{"Title":"A Murder of Justice","review":"Some authors lose energy over time, while others repeat themselves in thinly disguised \\"new\\" stories. In his 3 \\"A Murder of\\" books Robert Andrews does neither. His heroes, and ours, Jose Phelps and Frank Kearney, have become real friends whose credibility grows with each novel. In \\"A Murder of Justice\\" they have become, if anything, still more believable while growing in complexity. This latest book is a terrific read, with a plot that grabs and holds, and with details that bring the story to life. Andrews is at the top of his game."},{"Title":"A Murder of Justice","review":"Nobody mourns the shooting death of drug supplier James \\"Skeeter\\" Hodges or the wounding of his friend Tobias \\"Pencil\\" Crawford in a black DC neighborhood. The drug dealers were sitting in a car when eight or nine bullets went through the window almost taking the Skeeter's head off and injuring Pencil. Nobody grieves Skeeter's death because he turned a nice Washington D.C. neighborhood into a war zone.Police officers Frank Kearney and Jose Phelps are assigned the case but their superior captain Randolph Emerson is more interested in closing cold cases connected to Skeeter than catching the killer. The investigation heats up when it is discovered that the murder that killed Skeeter also killed Congressman Frederick Rhinelander's chief of staff Kevin Gantry. The department is publicly embarrassed because Kevin's case was signed off as an administrative closure. Now Frank and Jose have to find the killer or lose the confidence of the public.Robert Andrews has written a brilliant police procedural with a dire social commentary. Once the public loses confidence in its police force, the country is one step away from anarchy. It is the belief in the police and the legal system that keeps this country functioning and the author makes that very clear. The two protagonists on the case are the heroes because they believe in the law and justice and doing their best to bring honor to the badges they carry.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Murder of Justice","review":"This is the third installment in the mystery/police series of Frank Kearney and Jose Phelps - two Washington, DC homicide detectives. Without belaboring or giving away the plot, this story centers around the murder of a DC drug kingpin which then opens up a whole can of worms concerning a two year old \\"solved\\" murder case of a congressional aide. What catapults this book above most police procedurals is the author's ability to manage/balance a multitude of threads and characters in this story - the murder case itself, DC politics/politicians and geography/neighborhoods, the FBI and all the witnesses, family members, etc that Frank and Jose - who are at the center of all this - meet along the way. Interestingly, (or maybe even ironically), this author's books remind me of several UK authors, (Robinson and Rankin come to mind), in that the author is able to shift gears from scenes, characters, and plot lines seamlessly while never losing/diluting the essence of the mystery. A great read."},{"Title":"A Murder of Justice","review":"Veteran spy novelist Andrews (born 1937) came to crime fiction late in his career, and this is the best of his three police procedurals. As an aside, Andrews served as the Special Assistant to the Secretary of the US Army from 2007-09. Previously he directed Rockwell International's congressional relations from 1982-95. Prior to that, he was Senator John Glenn's national security adviser for two years.In \\"A Murder of Justice,\\" Veteran homicide detectives Frank Kearney and Jose Phelps have been partners on the District of Columbia Police Force for 26 years. These two friends are effective cops in the nation's murder capital. Frank, the erudite son of a respected judge, is a Vietnam veteran and a divorced man who owns a cat. His partner Jose, a football player and boxer during his years at Howard University, is the son of a preacher and a happily married guy. Frank and Jose have a healthy camaraderie. The enemies they face are external rather than internal. A shared delight in excessive consumption of cholesterol-laden foods seems to be their only \\"self-destructive\\" behavior.Frank and Jose cross swords with Emerson, their politically motivated commander, while tackling a series of murders linked to a House subcommittee investigation of crime in the District.Frank sometimes voices comments that do not make immediate sense. Upon questioning from Jose for clarification, Frank usually responds with a brief but penetrating social commentary.Frank's tendency to editorialize strengthens your understanding of the protagonist. His comments regarding human (or human/cat) interactions are sometimes humorous, sometimes profound, always interesting.Andrews' prose style is trim, never ornate. The author's knowledge of the Washington scene, both geographic and political, adds credibility to the action. Comments on the links between politics and crime, the nature of justice and the thin veneer of civilization are presented with mature insight and a deft touch. The book's length is a modest 320 pages. The denouement rather abruptly closes the novel.My only complaint is that the action ends too soon--I wanted to spend more time with Frank and Jose."},{"Title":"A Murder of Justice","review":"\\"If cats could talk, they wouldn't.\\" OK, this is not the main theme of the book, but the initial description of Monty (the cat) is so compelling, I knew the book wouldn't disappoint.

She has helped me not just to understand German culture more, but also my understanding of my native American Culture. I met Susan Stern once at a convention at the University of South Carolina with a few of my fellow German students. She is just as remarkable in person as in this book. If you plan on traveling to Germany, be it for Business, to live there, or for tourism, I highly recomend this book. Even if you're not traveling to Germany, this book is great for understanding and comparing your own culture with that of others. One last thing. Read the up-dated book which was published in 2000, not the 1998 version."},{"Title":"These Strange German Ways - The New Book","review":"I'm amazed! This book shows a detailed understanding of the German psyche. I as a German myself was totally amazed how highly accurate the descriptions are. Although the author sometimes strays a little from the truth (as I see it) in order to help understanding the Strange German Ways, I feel quite at home reading this book. As I have been to the US for a year and tried to explain Germany and the Germans to 'you folks', I would have been really grateful for this book as a companion. This is definitely a 'must have' if you deal with Germans a lot or intend to visit Germany."},{"Title":"These Strange German Ways - The New Book","review":"i guess this is the first book telling about the sometimes really strange german ways. i, as i am from germany, can just say: the author is right. the book contains everthing important (or not important but funny) and will probably do very well, helping you to understand us strange germans. i am now in the us as an exchange student for 11 month and brought it as a present for my host family - it was real fun reading it together and i guess it made the life with me a little easier for my host family. but: only 4 stars because some things aren\`t up-to-date"},{"Title":"These Strange German Ways - The New Book","review":"One of the most comprehensible works for a range of interests in Germanic culture, &quot;These Strange German Ways&quot; approaches the question of &quot;What is German?&quot; with direct, unique descriptions. As a professor at the University of Frankfurt and someone who hast lived in Germany for more than thirty years, Suzanne Stern's occasional, enlightening quips give the impression of an intimate friendship with the Germans. Though Germans may not appreciate her humor, it reflects an Anglo-Saxon perspective on the Teutonic culture (Stern herself is British) whose style is both light and informative. From how to present flowers to the German &quot;Kreislaufstoerung,&quot; this book will either picque further interest in this enigmatic people or provide some laughs at their peculiarities."},{"Title":"These Strange German Ways - The New Book","review":"If you're headed to Germany for a quick touristic jaunt, or even for a longer stay, and you've never been there before, then Susan Stern's thin handbook has dozens of useful tips, guidelines and short explanations of unfamiliar customs and conventions you might encounter. They're all very practical, from the numbering system of floors in tall buildings, to table manners, driving habits, and many other social and societal conventions. Stern's style is brisk and light, but never flippant or condescending.But if you're looking, as I was, for a more serious inquiry and explanation of the complex German psyche, look elsewhere. Nothing here will be of much help in understanding the deeper, more permanent sides of German life: The rigidity of German society. Its political machinations. Its education and training systems. Its relentless formality. Its obsessiveness with detail. Or the tendency for many otherwise likeable Germans to brood excessively, or to suddenly and unpredictably become hypersensitive and confrontational.Or maybe I'm being hypersensitiive and detail-obsessed.

It is a must for anyone who was captivated by &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country,&quot; and in my opinion is his best work."},{"Title":"Ah, but your land is beautiful","review":"I finished reading Ah, But Your Land is Beautiful quite a while ago, but I'd read it again it I hadn't borrowed it from the library. While you can't always tell which character is speaking, I find that that is good because it shows the complexity of views in South Africa in the 1950s. When you start reading a new section, you don't think, \\"Oh, that's just what Hugh Mainwaring thinks.\\" You realise that the statements were actually what real people, not just characters, thought. Especially in this day and age, I think that this book helps a little to get in to the mind of terrorists today, even though the issues at stake are markedly different. I would recommend this to everyone, especially those who enjoy history."},{"Title":"Ah, but your land is beautiful","review":"As others mentioned, this book is confusing, and after a while, I forgot about who was speaking and let it dawn on me. Reading other reviews, I now guess that he wanted readers to be confused and to hear the viewpoints and react to them before we know who made them...who knows.Either way, I loved this book. It has truly taught me something that I had thought about for decades...specifically, how can people do the cruel things they do to others...Paton's message to me is that if we are hurt and threatened, we then lash out at someone else to express our pain. I won't share any more because it's a review of the book, not an essay.His writing style is amazing to me...the emotional quality and humanity he conveys, and the depth of understanding of human nature compares with Shakespeare, but much warmer in my opinion- and he is equally understanding of every one of his characters, regardless of their situation.If I could emulate this writing style successfully, I would become a writer just to do it. Although I am still a little confused, I love this book, and it has fundamentally altered my understanding of human nature...it makes me want to be a more understanding human."},{"Title":"Ah, but your land is beautiful","review":"It's been almost 30 years since I read Cry, the Beloved Country and I'd forgotten how strangely Paton structures his books. This novel gives us some excellent insights on how sick a society South Africa was in the 1950's. However it's an extremely difficult read; shifting between past and present tense, dialogs were the author doesn't explain which characters are speaking, a great many references that are unclear to readers who know little about South Africa. Another reviewer called the novel &quot;docu-fiction&quot;. That's exactly what it is. It has no protagonists. We learn very little about who these characters are and have trouble caring about them, aside from the grief inflicted on them by hateful Afrikaners. This was Paton's last novel. He was pushing 80 when he wrote it. He still had plenty to say. His ideosyncratic story telling detracts from the message."},{"Title":"Ah, but your land is beautiful","review":"Alan Paton descibes realistic events of South Africans involved in 20th century conflicts. It's a great book. There are two main charcaters, Mr. Robert Mansfield and M.K. Bodasingh.

Things seem to be going fairly well until she arrives for an appointment at her wealthy patient Margaux Ashford's house to find her dead of a gunshot.The police are very interested in Keely because she found the victim. They question her quite often, but there are plenty of suspects to go around.She and her friends decide to try to solve the murder, because they aren't convinced the police will look at all the possible suspects. Other things begin to happen, including a fire and another death. Each of these events is in some way related to Keely. This doesn't help direct the police to other suspects.Keely finds herself in some sticky situations. Can she and her friends find the murderer without her becoming the next victim?This is the first book by this author that I have read. It definitely won't be the last. I really enjoyed Keely, and the Key West location was very refreshing. I felt like I was on vacation while reading this book.Keely and her friends and family are such fun characters. You never know what might happen next. I can't wait to read another book in this series. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Pier Pressure: A Keely Moreno Mystery","review":"This book was good on so many different levels. First of all, I loved the flavor of Key West that runs all through it. Many times I felt as though I were there--even though I have never seen the Keys for myself. Knowing that the author spends several months a year there, tells me that most of these places actually exist. Secondly, the characters were so vivid. I loved Keely, Punt, Jass, Gram, and Beau, and I'd love to read a sequel to find out more about them. I found myself deeply involved in their adventures, and I was often rooting and frightened for them. Last, a great deal of suspense ran throughout the novel. It might have been the pervasive, malevolent presence of Jude; the fire; the body; or perhaps the suspicions of the police. All of these things kept me reading frantically. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys a well-written, compelling novel."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Pier Pressure: A Keely Moreno Mystery","review":"In this latest novel from author Dorothy Francis, readers are returned to Key West to consider a different heroine and supporting cast than in \\"Conch Shell Murder.\\" This time it is Keely Moreno, foot reflexologist, who faces death, romance, and the daily stress of living in paradise. Despite the fact that her abusive ex husband lives on Kew West as well these days and could be ignoring the restraining order against him, Kelly has made a new life for herself and is doing rather well.That is until on a visit to a patient's home for a scheduled appointment, she finds Margaux Ashford dead from a gunshot wound. While the list of suspects for killing the wealthy woman is long, no one else's gun was used to fire the fatal shot. That fact, as well as the fact that she found the body make Keely the number one suspect in the eyes of the police. Knowing how the local police operate and being not at all impressed, Keely, with a little pushing from her friends, decides to investigate the case herself by asking the suspects, many of whom are her patients, where they were at the estimated time of death. As everyone knows, asking questions can get one into trouble fast, which is exactly what happens for Kelly.Written in the same style as her cozy, \\"Conch Shell Murder,\\" Dorothy Francis shows her love of Key West. Lush descriptions of the area abound, as do the characters that populate her novel. Many of them are amusingly eccentric and one gets the feeling they are based on real people the author has known. The list of suspects is long and often entertaining as their various eccentricities are covered. At the same time, underneath it all is a tight mystery that provides a rich and enjoyable read for adults of any age.Book Facts:Pier PressureBy Dorothy FrancisFive Star Publishinghttp://www.galegroup.com/fivestar/2005ISBN # 1-59414-271-8Hardback$24.95 USARC-Scheduled Release Date 01/21/05This entire review previously appeared online at the Blue Iris Journal Blog.Kevin R. Tipple 2004"},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Pier Pressure: A Keely Moreno Mystery","review":"In Key West, Keely Moreno is the only foot reflexologist on the island; she takes patients in her office but for special clients she makes house calls. When Keely arrives at Margaux Ashford's house, she finds her client dead from a bullet, a gun in her hand. The police question Keely extensively but won't say if the rich civic minded woman was murdered or committed suicide. Keely is friendly with the children of Margaux's husband, Jess and Punt; the trio agrees to look for suspects.The matter becomes urgent for the reflexologist because ballistics show Margaux was shot with Keely's gun and the alibi of Margaux's husband fails to check out. Keely believes her abusive ex-husband is the guilty party because she and her grandmother saw him following her despite a restraining order. When a fire burns down the house she is living in Keely thinks her former spouse has something to do with it because she spotted him in the crowd and he left evidence behind. Punt isn't at all certain he's the perpetrator and insists they keep investigating, a move that almost costs Keely her life.PIER PRESSURE is a fantastic amateur sleuth tale with equal attention given to characterizations and the investigation. Keely is a vulnerable yet courageous woman trying to start life over after being beaten continuously by her ex-husband. Although he is stalking her, there is no direct evidence linking him to the murder so readers will wonder who the perpetrator really is and keep reading to find out. Dorothy Francis is a talented writer and this reviewer will be on the lookout for her next mystery.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"My husband does not read alot...if ever.

Greeny's clearly sad sports have lost so much innocence, but still finds beauty and joy in the ability of sports to give us heroes and something to believe in greater than ourselves. In a way he's out to save the fading beauty of sports he knew as a kid. For those of us who've become jaded with professional sports over time, Greeny's optimism is a passionate reminder of the love we had for sports and sports heroes when we were kids ourselves."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"Like many of the buyers of this book, I'm an ESPN addict. I was hoping for a glib ESPN-related read here and didn't get that. Instead, I got an enjoyable but quirky book by and about a truly complex/weird sports broadcasting figure. Overall, this is a quick and entertaining read. Mike Greenberg does come across as a whiner at times and in my opinion is far too obsessed with clothes and being Mr. GQ. His wife also comes across as a really unreasonable monster. Throughout the book, Mike details many catch 22 situations he manages to find himself entrapped in. Invariably, he makes the wrong choice much to his wife's chagrin. Maybe that's the way his wife is, but I doubt it. Yet again, Mike also presents himself as the kind of guy who might well let himself be pushed around by an ultra-bossy woman. His kids come out of this book much better and his gambling aunt is great as a minor character. But where is Mike Golic? If you want the inside story behind the ESPN crew, you won't find it here."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"Confession: I'm a sports radio junkie. Not being a cable-TV subscriber, I rely on sport-talk radio to slake my thirst for football news. So when Mike Greenberg, the self-described metro-sexual half of ESPN's \\"Mike and Mike in the Morning\\" show, released his first book \\"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot\\" I took notice. And when it quickly charted on the New York Times best sellers list, I rushed to the local bookstore to get a copy of my own.I wasn't disappointed. With his impeccably-timed, deprecating humor and wit, Greenberg makes reading his memoirs an entertaining and enjoyable experience. The story of how becoming a father forced him to reconsider his priorities as a professional, a sports fan, and now a dad. Greenberg weaves a fantastic story and allows the reader to full access to his foiliables and his at-times narcissistic tendencies.WHY MY WIFE THINKS I'M AN IDIOT is presented to us as Mike's personal journal to aid his therapy sessions. However, book is equal parts journal, memoir, and stand-up comic routine. Mike presents himself as an everyman--a sports enthusiast, a dad and a husband. And for the most part, Mike connects. He struggles to meet his wife's emotional needs, change his daughter's diapers, and somehow squeezes in time to watch a golf tournament on TV.Unfortunately, Mike occasionally breaks the \\"everyman\\" illusion and reminds us that he is really a multimillionaire part of the entertainment elite. For instance, when he discusses how his infant's runny nose destroyed a $600 sweater (yes, that SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS for a shag of cloth to cover his upper torso!) or when his wife catches him ogling Ellie McPherson trying on blue jeans at a high-end department store (honestly, when was the last time you went shopping with a supermodel?). It's almost as if he can't help but let the reader know he's \\"arrived,\\" and in those moments the book loses some of its luster.Still, in spite of those momentary breaks from being a regular guy, Mike Greenberg paints a captivating picture of his experience as a modern male. He's desperately in love with his wife, but continually finds himself frustrating her (a section about his wife's disapproval of the way he handled his best friend's marital crisis is with the price of the book alone!). Entering an NBA locker room to get the interview doesn't faze our hero; but managing his child's play date while his wife is away is a monumental task.And, at its core, WHY MY WIFE THINKS I'M AN IDIOT is a book about life's purpose. Mike Greenberg struggles with significance of his life's work--sports casting--as he contrasts it with the wonders of parenting. He honestly struggles with the questions whether or not his work matters, and what's truly important. It's these questions that give the book its tenderness and poignancy between the side-stitching one-liners."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I am a fan of Mike Greenberg. I listen to his radio show, I watch him on TV, and overall I find him interesting and witty. However, when I first heard he was coming out with a book titled \\"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot\\" I was a little skeptical about whether or not I would enjoy it.Being a young male (22), I was afraid that a book about marriage and parenthood would bore me. I was sure that reading stories about his constant battles with diapers, late night feedings, and everything that goes along with new children would have me putting down the book before I was done with the dedication. I could not have been more wrong.Yes, his book is filled with a lot of stories that you would expect to hear from a new father, but boring they were not. I actually found these stories to be fascinating and funny. This book is so much more then a new dad doting over his kids. It's the realization that life is about more then just sports, yet at the same time that's all that it is about."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I frequently listen to Mike and Mike in the morning and generally love reading sports autobiographies. However, this was not anything like what I was expecting. Granted, you get what you pay for as the title really says it all: \\"the life of a sportscaster dad....\\" It was not meant to be a novel about sports or even his journey in the sports media world, but simply the life of one of America's favorite radio co-hosts.Personally, it felt like a way for Mike Greenberg to roll in some more cash. I did not enjoy reading about the specific designer brands of clothes he wears or how \\"hard\\" life is as a father with a nanny and a job the rest of the sports fanatics in this country would kill for. I would probably have enjoyed a novel more about his career in the sports industry with a few amusing anecdotes of his family and home life. Unfortunately, this was nothing of the sort. I would not recommend this book who currently views Mike Greenberg in a positive light and wishes to continue enjoying his radio show with that same state of mind."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"Mike Greenberg's opinionated on-air persona gets poorly translated to the page in this book filled with lots of bragging and annoying rants about his family life.The book is supposedly written as a journal suggested by his therapist. It sounds like a fake gimmick and although he writes well it comes across like the poor man's Seinfeld commenting on meaningless life events. Many of the stories seem either made up or exaggerated to the point that after the first few pages you won't know whether to believe anything he writes.He proclaims himself a metrosexual and seems to love to talk about clothes (even though he wears a mismatched tie on the cover of the book!) almost as much as he likes to tell the reader how great he is. He rambles on about meeting famous athletes without really giving enough details to make the book interesting for guys wanting to read about sports.There is way, way too much about his wife getting pregnant and too much bathroom \\"humor\\" (changing diapers is a fact of life--get over it!). He creates a caricaturization of his wife that makes her sound like an intelligent shrew. The more he complains about her, the better she sounds and the worse he looks. In the end he paints himself as being very similar to the Ray Romano character on Everybody Loves Raymond--a sports journalist who is pained by having to put up with his wife, parents and kids. Only here it's not that funny.The fact that he is the son of a successful New York lawyer makes sense because his ego is huge, his lifestyle is a bit elitist and he pushes his opinions on the reader as if they were facts. It's not an entertaining read unless you enjoy self-absorbed jerks that mix sports fanaticism with fashion and fatherhood."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"Catchy title, isn't it? Mike Greenberg is half of ESPN's Mike and Mike in the Morning combo. I catch them just about every day, either watching them on ESPN2 during my morning workout or on the radio on the way to the office. I'm a big fan, but I have to admit their shtick is starting to get a bit old. Nevertheless, they often have an interesting view on a story I hadn't considered.If you too are a fan of the show, Greenberg's book, Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot, isn't what you'd expect. I was hoping for lots of insights into the many athletes he's interviewed and worked with over the years. No dice. It's mostly a parenting book. I knew what I was getting into when I flipped through it at the store. Still, couldn't he at least offer a few insights into some of these personalities he's come across over the years?!All in all, it's not a bad read. I feel like I know a lot more about Greenberg than I did before, but I wish he'd write a book about sports next time."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"What to do, what to do. . .Your toddler son's first word is an expletive about poo. Your four-year-old daughter no longer needs you to go to swimming class with her. Your middle-aged, paunchy billionaire bud enjoys wearing speedos in public. You have a flat at 4:00 a.m. on the way to work and Triple A doesn't respond. You find out the hard way you can't clean up puke with a vacuum cleaner. And to top it all off, your wife thinks you're an idiot.So what to do? Go see your shrink? Or write a book?How about both?Accordingly, Mike Greenberg's tribute to superficiality is born. WHY MY WIFE THINKS I'M AN IDIOT, penned by ESPN Radio's self-proclaimed--and unabashed on-air drama queen--metrosexual, is a read so lite you're afraid a slight summer breeze will waft it away. Greenberg (known affectionately as \\"Greeny\\" by his handful of fans) is at times witty, once or twice engaging, but always self-deprecating as he shares with his readers the trials and tribulations of marriage and parenthood (obviously something foreign to the rest of us)--all from the perspective of a semi-famous celebrity. Greeny writes, goes to see his shrink, then writes some more; after a few dozen pages the anecdotes and antics start to blur until the reader races to the Epilogue with a sigh and a yawn.Wait a minute, Greeny. You had Elle MacPherson try on a pair of designer jeans right in front of you at a chic boutique and you said nothing and did nothing?Your wife's not the only one who thinks you're an idiot.--D. Mikels, Author, Walk-On"},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"Anyone can relate to this book. My fiance read it first and he couldn't put it down. I had to read it after I heard him laughing every five minutes... and I'm glad I did. I have never heard Mike Greenberg on the radio. I've never even seen him on tv, and quite frankly I could care less about watching sports. But I loved this book, it's simple and to the point, and it also made me realize why men are so moved by sports. It makes COMPELTE sense to me now, and I thank Mike Greenberg for explaining it to me in the funniest way possible.Like I said, this book will be fun for anyone to read, but I think if more married women read it, they would realize why their husbands are so infatuated with sports, and furthermore, how men see situations differently than women. I give this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"Mike Greenberg hits the nail directly on the head with his book. It is a wonderful book with witty, smart and insightful passages. I laughed outloud. Every married woman should read it, as well as their husbands! Greenberg is a combination of Jon Stewart and Jerry Seinfeld. While he may be an idiot, we should all have such an idiot in our lives!"},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I listen to Mike and Mike every morning on XM 140 on my way to work. It's a great stress free way to start the day. This was a tough week at work--I stopped at the bookstore on the way home looking for something to read that would make me laugh...and I have been laughing out loud all evening. Greenie is so on target about the stuff that makes life worthwhile. His family, like mine, has tons of \\"characters\\" and this was his way of telling us he loves them. Both sentimental and hilarious, this is very worthy of 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"This book was excellent. I acctually bought it on kind of an impulse buy, but when I got it I couldn't put it down. Finished it in about 2 days. Never gets boring. Inspirational for someone like me who wants to go into sports broadcasting. The stories where he talks about meeting starts such as Michael Jordan will leave you in awe and you can acctually relate to his everyday stories with his family(just funny as hell). One of the best books I've read in a while. His personality on his radio show matches exactly to what is in the book and if you love sports and lots of stories, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"The book is very sweet. I have always loved sports and have a young daughter myself, who I hope will someday find as much joy in watching football/baseball and playing golf/tennis as I do. The best parts of the book, to me, are the descriptive little snipets of life that make it worth living. Like when he picks up his daughter up from school and the way she likes her ice cream. Also, his encounters with Jordan and Bo are poignant.I don't listen to Mike and Mike in the morning but will try to find it on our local radio station."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"My wife and I are huge fans of Golic and Greenie on ESPN.We found much of the book very entertaining, but the \\"folklore\\" about Aunt Ada was completely overdone.What we found particularly displeasing however, were the continual references to human excrement. Most people of adult age have raised children and took care of the nasty business of changing diapers, washing poo from the little one's bottoms, etc.I suppose bathroom humor has it place somewhere in literature when it is done well, but when it is overdone, it becomes tedious and trite.Shame on you Greenie. Try to do better next time."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"...well from Jason Landings review. after ammy pulled all 85 of his reviews for the copy and paste jobs he performed from Barnes and Nobles, he finally wrote his own review!First off, it was typical. The content was short and revealed that not only did he not read the book, but he doesn't know how to use sentence fragments properly.Second, his use of smack is not fresh but about as stale as a 2002 dorito chip found under the cushions.Third, it's obvious to us now that he is not competent enough to write good, solid reviews that invoke criticism regarding self knowledge of the product. That coupled with the fact that he now has zero credibility with the amazon community, makes his one lone review all the more fun to simply laugh at. We shake our heads at the immaturity that emits from his skull."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"This humorous autobiography tells about one sportscaster's quest to balance work with his family life. If you don't mind foul language, this book will entertain you."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"Mike Greenberg mines the same material as Paul Reiser did back in the \\"Mad About You\\" heyday. Greenberg might be a sportscaster, but this book is really about the battle of the sexes, and the difficulty in combining work and family. What makes it a little hard to believe is that Greenberg and his wife are both loaded financially, and actually have a live-in nanny.Still, the writing is crisp, and Greenberg's voice comes through loud and clear. You won't find as many sports anecdotes as you might be hoping for, but the book is entertaining."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"Mike Greenberg is fairly well known to the serious sports fan as cohost of ESPN radio's morning show \\"Mike & Mike\\", and an occasional anchor on SportCenter. In this book, he shares some anecdotes about sports - encounters and thoughts on/with Michael Jordan, Bo Jackson and a few others. When he describes the instant rapport that occurs between strangers who are fans of the same team, many will nod knowingly. But mostly, the book isn't about sports or his experiences at ESPN.Most of it is about his family life, a goofy look at domestic foibles. Andy Kaufman-like, it's occasionally tough to tell if Greeny is exagerating or if he's being dead serious. He pokes fun at himself and his metrosexual image, happily tells things that make himself look less than macho or clever (social miscapades when tipsy, the fact that he claims he didn't know what a uterus was before his wife's pregnancy etc). Give him some props for guts by admitting that much of the book is from journals he wrote as part of therapy.While anecdotal, Greeny is a pretty good storyteller, and many of his domestic disaster stories are quite funny. His gambling-addicted aunt Ada is a true hoot. And at times things are sweet and romantic or even poignant. One entry tells of the time his 4-year-old daughter became old enough to take her swimming lessons alone, and the instructor told him \\"Your daughter doesn't need you\\" - I bet any parent could relate similar moments.It's a light book that reads well enough, and made me laugh often. Sports fans and parents may well like it."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"This was a great book for those who want a serious relationship, having a baby or the one most everyone is missing wonders about perspectives on life. I am interested in how different people view this world and Greenburgh writes it beautiful. This book is funny and informative."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"This isn't the best of Mike Greenburg, but it was an entertaining and humorous one nonetheless. I still recommend getting it even if I gave it 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I had very high expectations for this book. Greeny delivered on every one. He is such a Dad first, sportscaster second, but his true love of sports speaks to every sports fan out there. His self-deprecating remarks show that you can be, as he puts it, \\"a little bit famous\\" and still be extremely humble. I wish I could hang out with him on a daily basis. Do yourself a favor and read this book...I don't want to tell you how quickly I got through it, I couldn't put it down! Mike, write another one! Or get your others published!!"},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"If you have ever heard Greeny speak before, you will know what this book is about. Greenberg rants about the non-sensical life of a \\"metrosexual\\" sportscaster, how he cares for his own looks more than that of his wifes. The book flows just like you were listening to Greeny telling Golic (his radio co-host of Mike and Mike in the Morning) a recap of the previous weekend. A good, lite read for any dad."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I am only halfway through reading this book, however I am surprised at how little Greenie talks about sports and how much he describes his experiences with his wife, child, and family...and I actually don't mind it! For those guys who prefer reading auto-bios on Dick Butkus' punishing style of football play, this may not be the book for you. What makes this a good book is that it actually appeals to both men and women, as I have been sharing excerpts from the book with my wife because Greenie's opinions and experiences sometimes relate to our own lives! I recommend this book...it's not a Pulitzer-caliber book, but worth reading nonetheless."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I bought this book for my nonreader husband. He loved it and quoted from it so much that I had to read it for myself. Mike is fun, lighthearted, and says everything that everyone else is thinking, but never say. He is refreshingly honest. We couldn't put the book down. This is a must read for newly weds, new parents, sports fans, or any woman who thinks her husband is an idiot!"},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"After years of listening to Greenberg and following his career both in Chicago and nationaly, I was a little disappointed that I wasn't more inpressed with what he had to say. His amusing neurotic nature is one of everyman, and the book does have some amusing moments. Mike is a bumbler, as all middle-aged men eventually become, and his mishaps are no more newsworhty than anybody else's."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I really enjoy listening to Mike Greenberg on the radio and looked forward to reading this book quite a bit. I enjoyed it thoroughly, though it was not exactly what I expected.The book consists of journal entries he wrote while struggling through some difficult times in his life, mostly revolving around his wife and children. He is very open about his personal life and his feelings about the people that populate it. I found myself often thinking, \\"He's going to get in trouble when his wife/aunt/neighbor reads this.\\" And I can't help wondering if he did!This book, I think, is more geared toward parents-to-be and married couples than to hard-core sports fans. There is some discussion of sports, but it is more in the sense of how it affects his personal life. Still, the book is entertaining, Greenberg writes well, and I had a hard time putting it down.This is a good read for \\"Mike and Mike\\" fans, but be prepared to learn a lot more about Greeny's wife and kids than about his radio show and Golic."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"As an avid sports fan that listens to Mike & Mike show, I found myself hooked on the witty banter both bring to the radio. I found myself agreeing with Greeny on many different issues but also was happy to have someone representing the 'every man' point of view in dealing with sports. Greeny is not the former player turned sportscaster and that was something most listeners could relate to. It was with these thougths in mind that I looked forward to reading his new book. This is not the Mike Greenberg I know...Whomever came up with the notion that publishing a bunch of journal postings was a good idea should be fired on the spot. Everything was loosely tied together and most were just ramblings of a man trying to come to grips with his priviledged life. The readers should feel sorry for you because your nanny/maid took the same week off as your wife??!! Suck it up and change a freakin' diaper!This book is not for fans of the Mike & Mike show, it will ruin the broadcast. Leave the book on the shelf and DO NOT BUY IT FOR THE SPORTS DAD ON FATHER'S DAY. While they can get through it quickly enough, they'll be worse off having read it."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I truly wish I had not read this book. I used to love \\"Mike and Mike in the Morning,\\" but my view of Greenberg has been so damaged by this superficial, shallow, clueless piece of garbage that I have found myself unable to stomach listening to him anymore.Greenberg obviously plays up the apparently oxymoronic \\"metrosexual sportscaster\\" angle, setting a defensive tone early regarding his abilities to discuss sports despite having fabulous taste in clothing, travel, and fine dining. Fine, this is a play on his on-air persona, no problem.But when he tries to become \\"everyman,\\" Greenberg demonstrates that he is as out of touch with the common populace as the athletes he covers are (or as Paris Hilton is, hence the title of this review). This is also why his Seinfeldian approach fails: Seinfeld found the common irritants we all face, whereas Greenberg complains that his wife left him alone for a week to raise his children...with their nanny. Excuse me? Are we supposed to chuckle knowingly that he now has to parent two small children with professional assistance? Sorry Greenberg, most of us would actually be single parents in that situation, not pretending. Similarly, he tells a \\"funny story\\" about his son's first word being a curse, but it is set up by sharing that this happened in Aspen, in a chalet with cathedral ceilings and chandeliers (\\"How do they change the lightbulbs in those things\\" he wonders increduously, as we all do when vacationing in Aspen in gorgeous chalets). Oh, and what used to be six people is now \\"three couples, three nannies, and seven children.\\" This kind of unnecessary, extraneous detail--which is prevalent throughout the book--reinforces how different he is from me, how unrelatable his experiences are to mine, and breaks any sense of community that good writers are able to develop. For example, he also repeatedly discusses his neighbors--billionaires who throw lavish parties, give him cases of his favorite Vodka, and fly him to Florida in a private jet. Greenberg shares that, if given the option, there is no better way to fly than on a private jet. Thanks for the tip, Greeny, I'll get right on that.Coupled with his repeated references to $100 ties, Prada backpacks, and expensive clothing, Greenberg comes off as an arrogant, superficial, spoiled little rich brat. His obvious lack of appreciation for what he has, coupled with his assumption that he has anything of relevance to teach a larger audience about parenting (\\"You cannot get snot off a cashmere sweater\\" as but one example), makes me view him as completely undeserving of his success and not wanting to contribute to it in anyway. You think your life is hard because your daughter threw up on the tile floor in your spacious kitchen? Try wondering whether you'll have money to pay your bills next month. THAT'S stress.The title of his book references his belief that ALL women think their husbands are idiots; it's his grand insight into relationships that I guess is supposed to convince us he is thoughtful and has some depth of character. Sorry Greenberg, most women I know--including my wife--have respect for their husbands. Your wife thinks you're an idiot because you are one.Just like Paris Hilton."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I enjoy the Mike & Mike show and expected to be at least amused by Greenberg's book. Unfortunately for me, my experience was quite the opposite. I walked away feeling annoyed and not the least bit amused. What should be the most important comment -- how well the book is written -- has hardly been mentioned. And probably with good reason: it is horribly written. Awful, really. I don't know if that's more of an indictment of his editors or him. Much as he tries to impress with his stories, he tries to impress with his diction, and it just fails. There even are instances when he's obviously using the wrong word, though it apparently was close enough for Greenberg and his editors. Relatedly, there is absolutely no connection between his premise and the text. Sure, he works in the concept of him being an idiot (as he does at every opportunity now on the show, unfortunately), but if he hadn't used the phrase, I wouldn't know what the book really was supposed to be about. It's a disjointed collection of overplayed stories that aren't even original coupled with radio segments that, having listened to the show since 2000 or so, don't seem like they happened in the way/at the time Greenberg says. It just seemed phony -- the book and, by the end, Greenberg. There's nothing really underpinning the \\"idiot\\" concept. His stories have been told by everydad in the states. Unlike other reviewers' experiences, his book has caused me to be less inclined to listen to his radio show, and that's disappointing. He used to come across as genuine, but now he's just slick. A vanilla sportscaster who grew up privileged who writes his memoirs before the age of 40 has to have some level of ego, but the book was dripping with it. Unfortunately, even his ego is boring and fake. A real disappointment."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"Boring, superficial, meaningless.That about sums this snoozer of a \\"book.\\" Another ESPN media type who thinks people actually are transfixed by his life."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"While I enjoy Greenberg's radio show, I was extremely disappointed in this book. Throughout the book, Greenberg relays the same banal stories he repeats ad nauseum on the radio. Unfortunately, unlike on the radio, when Mike Golic is always available to slap some sense into Greenberg, this book is purely 100% Greenberg.I am always amazed by those people who have lived extremely privileged lives, yet try to act like they have \\"struggled\\" in life. Greenberg has had to \\"struggle\\" thru a cushy upbringing, going to exclusive schools such as Northwestern and eventually landing his gig at ESPN.For those of you in the Chicago area, I hope that you caught Debra Pickett's article on Greenberg in the Chicago Sun-Times. While Greenberg professes to be a family man, the article notes how he spent 2-1/2 hours talking about his favorite topic, himself, while forgoing the opportunity to meet his wife and children at the pool. Keeping with his privileged existence, the pool was located at the East Bank Club in Chicago, yet another privileged club to which Greenberg belongs.I should receive a refund for slopping thru this \\"book.\\" Hopefully, this review will prevent other people from making the mistake I did. ESPN should fire this wimpy \\"meterosexual\\" for writing this book."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"Mike Greenberg, half of ESPN radio's Mike and Mike in the morning, does here what he does so well every morning on the radio with his partner Mike Golic - he says what we are thinking about sports, relationships and life, BUT in a much more fully realized way than we would ever have mustered. The wit, the sarcasm, the desire to believe in sports and heroes and in Greeny's case the New York Jets is all here along with a terrific cast of characters including Mike's wife (who if this book is any indication should produce her own tome). If you are a dad, heck, if you are a parent, you'll enjoy this book. If your wife makes you help select what shoes to wear even though you haven't a clue and don't want to have a clue, this book is for you. If you love sports and find something deeply essential in what very often appears to be meaningless fun and games, this book is for you. If you listen to Greeny and Golic in the morning and find yourself coming back for more, you'll find yourself turning page after page in an all too quick sprint to the end of this book. Thanks Mike Greenberg for the book and for the daily dose of sanity."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I enjoyed this book a hell of alot more than almost anything I've read the past year, fiction or non-fiction.The title of the book is a bit misleading. There is no overarching theme here, it is not a treatise on why Greeny's wife thinks he's an idiot. Nor is it a collection of essays. It purports to be a journal that Greenberg kept over the past few years. I'm not entirely sure if that's true, particularly because of one blurb on page 133, but it really doesn't matter.What you basically get is a series of humorous but relevant anecdotes from Greenberg. Sometimes the topic is serious, sometimes it isn't. Sometimes the story has a point, sometimes it doesn't. But it's always written with a ton of wit and a rich personality. You never forget that this is Greenberg writing, and not some faceless author with stories to tell.Greenberg's stories of trying to impregnate his wife, the absolute worst thing to say in a room full of women, trying to decide on a name for his first child, the staff at his favorite restaurant expressing their hatred for him, his worst fears almost being realized as his daughter is born, his deck furniture salesman being offended that \\"Mr. Big-Shot Sportscaster\\" doesn't remember him, his rationale for buying his son a giant Clifford doll, and many other stories, not all of them pleasant(the sixty-five year old Billionaire in a Speedo stands out as one of the least appealing), are sure to keep you entertained for as long as you can go without turning the last page.Well done Greeny, my only complaint is that your book tour isn't coming to California."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I used to listen to his show every day, but after reading the book, I can't bring myself to hear his voice... I for one was disappointed that the \\"book\\" was a compilation of his therapy journals. I had always considered Greenie a sort of 'everyman' sportscaster... a real fan with a real fan's perspective. Now, I consider him to be a self serving pompous sportscaster like the rest of them. \\"everyman\\" would never refer to himself continuously as \\"a little famous,\\" and a neighbor of billionaires, and certainly would never have the unmitigated gall to compare an internet rumor about himself to the fan adulation received by Bo Jackson! If you really want to read this, get on the waiting list at your library, borrow it from a friend or at least wait until the paperback."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I occasionally catch Mike & Mike on ESPN2 and usually enjoy the show. Since I don't watch the show that often I didn't realize the Greeny was such a diva. I mean every time I see him on TV he has on a casual shirt over a t-shirt and a pair of jeans...kind of like what Ray Ramano wore on \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\". He seems like an \\"everyguy\\" and I enjoy his wit. But....in this book he comes across as very shallow. Why, because he constantly has to punctuate his stories with design-label name dropping, as if he's looking for affirmation....and whose affirmation would that be, the fans of Mike & Mike (NO!)...so who? Which leads me to the question, who is this book written for anyway?All in all the Greeny comes across as someone who doesn't have much meaningful to say. Like many other reviewers I find him spoiled, privileged and out of touch with the REAL people who watch/listen to his show."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"This was a pretty funny book, although Mr Greenberg is a better sportscaster than an author. I did enjoy the book, there were some spots where things were slow and I was waiting for the funny stuff, which sometimes wasn't there."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"a quick read with good stories. anyone who is a dad and a sports fan will easily relate."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I really enjoyed this book, written by one of my favorite sportscasters. Greeny has a great writing style, and there were many absolute laugh out loud moments in the book, usually relating to family experiences or one of his many speaking engagements. I would recommend this book to anyone, whether they are into sports or not, as this is more about the man, than his occupation. I hope that Mr. Greenberg will take on the project of writing another book in the near future, as I am sure that there are many more interesting and hilarious anecdotes to relate to his fans. (PS: My wife loved this book, too.)"},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"My wife and I are huge fans of \\"Mike & Mike in the Morning\\" on ESPN radio. When my son isn't watching his shows in the morning, we always turn on their show, which also airs on ESPN 2. We usually listen to their show on the way to work and school as well. When we heard Michael Greenberg had written a book, we were extremely excited and reserved our copy immediately.'Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot' is a very appropriate title. Greenberg shares excerpts from his journal that were written while he and his wife were expecting their first child, about raising children, about dealing with marriage and expectations, and dealing with being a little famous. There are other stories thrown in, but those are the central themes of the book. I will say this, Greenberg is extremely brave for sharing as much as he did.Both my wife and I have read this book and we agree, Greeny is an idiot. However, we love him just the same. Some of his mistakes and the way he deals with his wife and kids are exactly what you would expect from a guy. The flip side of that is that Greeny is the ultimate metrosexual, and you'd think he'd know better sometimes.As Greenberg is a sportscaster, you would think there would be more about sports in the book. There is a fair amount. Greenberg is a huge Jets fan. He has met most of the major sports figures in the country. He does share some of his experiences in this book, but it is really about family, as he says towards the end.Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone that is a fan of the Mike and Mike show. I'd also recommend it to newly weds and those expecting children. The book was very funny. It is a quick read. In between the humorous anecdotes, there are some real epiphanies worth noting. Foremost amongst those are how to deal with a wife that thinks you are an idiot.Overall Grade: 5 Stars."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I've listened to Mike and Mike a lot over the past few years and very much enjoy their program. This book is a quick little insight into the life of Greeny and the format make the book a very quick read (I completed the whole thing on a round trip flight from Hartford, CT to Washington, D.C.). I think the overriding theme of dealing with being a minor celebrity and what it took to get to that point made it quite interesting and in the end I would recommend it for anyone looking for a pseudo-sports book without getting into a lot of technical aspects."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I absolutely love this book. It is one of my favorites and it is definilty a book you can read again. Very happy i got the book. I would recommend it to anyone, whether you are a fan or mike and mike in the morning or not."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"Allow me to start with an objective review, and then tell you how I really thought about it.This book is a humorous autobiography of Mike Greenberg's experiences, primarily of his family life. Thus, you don't need to be a sports fan to enjoy this book. It is in character with his radio persona, though the language is rawer here. There are parts where he makes commentary, as well as the humor. If you want a humorous book about parenting and marriage, and can tolerate cussing, you will enjoy this book.Now, my subjective opinion.I really think those who weren't expecting what they got with this book probably were not paying attention. The lead title of the book (\\"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot\\") points to the theme of family life in the book; while the word \\"Sportscaster\\" is in the second line of the title, and there are some sports paraphenalia on the cover, it still seems to point to the major theme. Additionally, Greenie sometimes talks about his family life on the air, so I wasn't surprised for this to be the focus. (In fact, I remember several of these stories from his comments on the air.)I could handle the lack of sports in it, and even the fact that Mike Golic is not even mentioned until the acknowledgements. I was disappointed by the language, which showed up in the first sentence of the first chapter. One thing I enjoy about Mike and Mike in the Morning is that it would be rated straight PG; I did not appreciate the R-rated language, though that was the only reason this book would receive that rating).I loved the chapter titles (\\"The First Trip To The Grocery Store\\"; \\"The Second Trip To The Grocery Store\\"; \\"The Third Trip To The Grocery Store\\". I'm sure most men could relate to going back multiple times to the store. It turns out that the grocery store is not mentioned until the end of each chapter, as a summary of each point. I will also say that I thought using the journal thread was a good idea. I am not sure that the stories really took place when they did in the book (e.g. I remember Greenie's incident with food poisoning, but I believe his daughter was already born then).I'm sure you have friends that, as you get to know them better, there are things you don't like about them, but that does not affect the friendship. Though I've never had the privilege of meeting Greenberg, let alone getting to know him personally, this book fit that bill. There are characteristics of Greenie that I didn't like, but I still like him. I will say that there are hints of those negatives even on his program. I would not have finished reading this book except for the case that it was Greenie who wrote it."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I am not a very avid reader normally, but I bought Mike Greenberg'sbook because I love the show. Being a recent parent myself I found the book hilarious."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"I think this is a very funny book. Mike Greenberg has a wacky way of expressing the things that happen in his life. I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot: The Life and Times of a Sportscaster Dad","review":"People listen to Greenberg and Golic's radio show mostly for the sports talk, not to hear about Greeney's family life. While some of his off-air activities are amusing, I wanted more of the book to be about sports. Mike thinks the public likes hearing his metrosexual talk and off-air stuff more than they actually do.Incidentally, to the reviewer below, screen name \\"DJK ver 2.0\\", this book in NOT a novel. It is non-fiction."},{"Title":"In search of ghosts","review":"When I was a student at Hammel-Actual Business School in 1975 and 1976, I thought I read every book Hans Holzer ever wrote. But I was passing B. Dalton Booksellers in the Mall at Sierra Vista and saw this book from the corner of my eye on the sales rack. I did not remember seeing this book so I bought it. And somehow I had missed this book back in 1976! I have to say that, although the book is good, it is not up to the Hans Holzer standards I remember from 32 years ago. It does not have the scientific inquiry approach I remember from the other books. It is more simply stories of investigations of ghosts."},{"Title":"In search of ghosts","review":"This book is geared towards a middle school audience, but I , as an adult enjoyed it immensely.Hans Holzer never fails to disappoint with his recountment of the fascinating cases he has investigated."},{"Title":"Pass-a-Grille vignettes: Times past, tales remembered","review":"Frank Hurley really knows Pass-a-Grille. Like no one else. His vignettes are priceless but only if you have been to Pass-a-Grille for a while.He talks about things that happened that will never happen again (and maybe should't) but that is what attracted me to his book. He is a story teller like Carl Hiassen or Jeff Klinkenberg but he does it from being there and probably doing it. He is a real Floridian.I recommend this as a good read but visit Pass-a-Grille first or it won't be the same.Stu Hostetter"},{"Title":"Quatre-vingt-treize","review":"I encountered this book while writing an honors undergraduate history thesis on the revolt in the Vendee--which is the setting for this book. Ninety-Three is both a literary masterpiece and an historical commentary ahead of its time. Hugo carefully balances his personal belief in the French Republic, and his distaste for the methods used by the Republicans in 1793. His characters are vivid allegories, and the novel is peppered with small parables. It is a story where the \\"giants\\" of Robespierre, Marat and Danton become less important than three small children, where the Republic of Swords must face the Republic of Ideas.I highly recommend this for anyone studying the French Revolution. It is also a fine piece of prose."},{"Title":"Quatre-vingt-treize","review":"Refer to Ayn Rand's non-fiction bood entitled &quot;The Romantic Manifesto&quot; There's an excellent introduction to Victor Hugo's Ninety-Three.

For example, when asked to describe 100 ways to improve a &quot;bed,&quot; how many of us would step outside the confines of a mattress and box spring and think size, color, or even a &quot;bed&quot; of flowers? Fremier's book approaches all aspects of photography by looking at all variables, and then rearranging them in a way that creates a new &quot;reality.&quot; It's fun!Fremier's book does not beg the basic question &quot;Can people be taught photography?&quot; Instead, it simply goes on to provide exercises that enhance and structure our initial approaches to photography. Not only can photography be taught, but we can also be taught to produce great photographs that create more impact than a postcard of our favorite travel icons (i.e., the Eiffel Tower).When I returned from Fremier's Photo Seminar in Paris this summer, I knew that I would never see Paris in quite the same way. We used &quot;photo storming&quot; and some of Fremier's creativity techniques (described in his book) as we created our own unique vision of Paris and its beauty. One afternoon, when I ran out of film, I found that I just kept taking mental pictures as I walked along the Seine and through the neighborhoods of Paris.
