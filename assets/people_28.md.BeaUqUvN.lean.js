I think it was intentionally styled as if a 14 year old Dungeon and Dragons aficionado had penned it. But if you can look past the (for me) annoying strict adherence to present tense, and the occasionally simplistic handling of certain details, you will discover a pretty good little story within.Who knows, you may even find yourself hooked and needing to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The storyline is the only thing that is worth anything in the book. It is a very tedeous read, almost painful. There is no clear end to the book. If you want the adventures of the a teenage D&D game with the play by play this is your book. But if not... Well, just skip it and do yourself a favor."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I downloaded this book when it was made free on the Kindle, because it had an appealing hook. While I never played D&D; myself, I always loved adventure games like Zork and King's Quest, and I had even thought about how cool it would be to have a book where people from the \\"real world\\" get sucked into the classic environment of one of those games.Very shortly into the book, though, the writing overtook my zest for the proposed plot. My major complaint about this book was that the author could not stick with a verb tense. He so obviously wants to use continuous present tense, yet he kept throwing in past tense verbs (much like I did with this sentence). Call me picky, call me anal, call me a cab... whatever, it grated on my nerves as a reader. A LOT.In addition to all of that, the main character, James, just was not very likeable. Not that I was rooting for the necromancers or brigands, but he just didn't do anything to ingratiate himself in my mind. Before he left the town of Trendle, would it have killed him to have at least offered 10 or 12 gold pieces to the family that had just let him recuperate with them for the past week? 10 or 12 gold pieces out of his newly acquired 1,000+ gold pieces?Bastard.I shan't be reading any of the other installments, though I wish my fellow indie author good luck in his future endeavors."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I enjoyed this series. If you've ever though, \\"wouldn't it be cool if I got yanked to an alternate world where I was a wizard?\\" .. then you will too.The writing is decent, but the entire series needs some major editing. The biggest repeated issue is the author's blatant misuse of homonyms. He'll use heal when he means heel, knew/new, I'd make a list, but there are dozens of examples and I just don't care. He also, in various places misuses plurality. He also, from time to time, forgets which god is which.Spell-check is not an editor.Spell-check Is Not An Editor.If the author paid anyone to edit this series, he needs to get his money back. If he didn't pay anyone to edit this series, then his publisher needs to be slapped.But, if you can ignore the blatant and repeated mangling of the English language, it's an enjoyable series. I'd give it four stars if it had been passed through the hands of a decent editor."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This book is like a glass of water - refreshing , simple but colourless and tasteless .You drink it and forget it .There are 2 kinds of 2 stars ratings .One kind is when you are angry because the writer really messed up and delivered a sub par piece of writing (Jordan anybody ?) .The other is a happy rating because the book is simply worth it .The Unsuspecting Mage belongs to the second category .I have been for the first (and last) time mislead by advice on Amazon and actually bought the first 2 installements .I read both books in about 7 hours , don't really regret it but won't be buying the sequels .What are the weaknesses ?There are many but all probably originate in the fact that what we got is a transcription of an AD&D; session .1)There is no plot . Even if I wanted to give spoilers , I could not . James , a young student , crosses a door and finds himself in another world . He meets a magical character who tells him \\"Go to X .\\" and \\"I won't answer any questions .\\" . Then he disappears .So James tries to find X and gets involved in fight every couple of days (of course he always winns) .Between fights he sleeps in Inns and eats stew .Sometimes he eats sliced goat . He also drinks ale .After X he will go to Y .And after Y to Z .The places are not actually important , like in an AD&D; session what is important is the travelling because it enables to set up ambushes what leads again ... to fights .2)The fights are despairingly identical .A module of between 7 - 12 riders , brigands , thiefs , soldiers rush James .He takes out 4 or 5 with magically propelled stones (later metal slugs) while his companions hack down the rest .One almost hears a Dungeon master saying \\"Brigand 4 is touched by knife . Critical hit to femoral artery . He falls bleeding . Brigand 5 slashes with a sword at Miko . Miss . Your turn now James ...\\"3)James is a very bad AD&D; player .Example 1 : On one of his stops he goes looking for 2 missing persons (a peasant and a child) .Using a magical compass he finds their location in an abandoned ruin where supposedly a necromancer lived once - typical AD&D; situation .He gets in a fight with a necromancer who turns out to be a girl from his world .Interrupting her while she is trying to summon a demon he kills her and liberates the child .Now what would every player do ?In this very intriguing situation , it seems necessary to stay at that place and to find out why this girl was there . When did she come and how .However James would not even ask the questions . He gets on his horse and rides away like if finding summoned demons and killing necromancers was as usual as eating a stew .Example 2 : James goes on an errand while his friend Miko sleeps in an Inn . Getting back to the Inn he sees Miko tied up and gagged in the bed . Of course he enters the room and gets hit on the head by a horde of brigands standing behind him .No worry , he'll escape easily by using some simple spells .Yet a good AD&D; mage player would never let himself surprise so stupidly .He'd use a spell checking on unfriendly beings or alternatively leave a trap spell on the door when he has to leave his friend sleeping in an unknown and potentially hostile environment .Yet James would never think of it .Of course I understand why the author lets him to behave so stupidly - if James was never kidnapped (and boy does he get kidnapped often !) it would eliminate dozens of pages describing fights accompanying his liberation .However stupidity always irritates .4)The worst part as far as I am concerned is the characterisation .The characters are 2 dimensional , don't evolute , have no past , no motivation or psychology .The villains are anonymous shadows whose role is to appear , slash with a sword and dieEven the main hero James is a hasty sketch with whom it is hard to identify .In conclusion - if you have time and money to spend on a very simple account of a series of Ad&D; modules , you will get here a refreshing and fast read that will put no stress on your little grey cells .However it is not necessary to go beyond the first book .The following will be only more of the same .En evil God using an evil Empire as a tool stands in a fight with a good God using James as his tool .Don't get concerned about the motivations - the evil God will be evil only for the fun of it and is there anyway only to provide a frame in which fights can take place .After 124 000 ambushes , kidnappings and slashings James will prevail and return home with loot , XP and several new spell levels , ready for the next session with another evil God ."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Like some reviewers said , this is not a book but a transcription of a computer D&D; game .Play for example Baldur's gate . Take notes of every single fight . Put it on paper and dilute with some descriptions .The end result is this book .Actually the most puzzling and interesting issue are the 5 star reviews because it is utterly impossible to rate this more than 2 stars for anybody who's used to fantasy litterature .To be complete and to provide helpful information for eventual readers , it appeared to me necessary to review the 5 star reviewers and here are the results .There are 15 of them .- 8 (Bertramm , Donal Hicks , Gamma Man , Grad Student , John G.Pritchard , River Rat , Sven Bjorenson , Bj&ouml;rn Ostermann) have only reviewed this single book . What is the probability that a reader would write an enthousiastic 5 star review on the first volume of a series , say how much they looked forward to the next book and not review any of the sequels ? Right , 0 .So all 8 are in reality Mr Pratt .- Reggie is like the 8 above but wrote also another 2 line review . He is Mr Pratt .- 2 (Diane A. Goins , Kevin Davenport) have reviewed only Mr Pratt's books and all of them . Of course all 5 stars . Their style is very similar and reproduces Mr Pratt's comments . With a very high probability both are Mr Pratt .- Keril has written also 3 2 line reviews on Donaldson , Martin and Hobb . After the 2 lines he always added a warm recommendation for this book which is longer than the original \\"review\\" . He is clearly Mr Pratt .- M.Thorsson is an interesting case . 153 reviews . All are \\"written\\" in one day , all rate 5 stars , consist of copy and paste and concentrate on whole series of unknown writers . This is probably not Mr Pratt but it is clearly a professional \\"improver\\" of ratings .- Kadyra Reddick is like Reggie . A few 2 line reviews out of which 1 for this book . Posted at the same time like John G.Pritchard , River Rat and Bj&ouml;rn Ostermann . Probably Mr Pratt too .- A Kids Review . Here it is impossible to check anything . With the benefice of doubt , this may be somebody else than Mr Pratt .Summary : Out of 15 5 star reviews , 12 are Mr Pratt , 1 is very probably Mr Pratt , 1 is a professional rating \\"improver\\" and 1 may be a genuine 5 star Kid's review . I didn't review in detail the 4 stars ratings but a random check showed that some may be Mr Pratt too .Last but not least . While this shows dedication from MrPratt what is a respectable thing , it may misguide some people who trust in the value of ratings . So for future visitors of this page , read also this review of reviewers ."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Don't waste your time, don't waste your money, don't waste the space on your Kindle. Really. The story line is horribly repetitive. The protagonist spends most of his time going from Inn to Inn, bargaining for a room and taking baths. Any action or fighting is dry and lacking in imagination. I never did figure out what the actual conflict was. Not only is the protagonist a boring idiot, but really... he gets zapped to a new land and doesn't spend ANY time worrying about those he left on Earth?I am an English teacher. Every year my students write short fiction that is much on par with this novel. Oh- did I mention that I teach 7th grade? Same confusing tense shifts, lack of creative tag lines and descriptors, and so on.I can't even begin to tell you what a waste of time this is. What amazes me is there are actually several more books in this series."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"While the premise of the book is of interest, the scenes in the book are very linear. The sub-plots resolve very simply, without any buildup of tension. If you think about, say, the LOTR trilogy, every scene is imbued with its own level of complexity and anticipation. That this book is meant for younger readers is not a worthy defense - the Percy Jackson/ Olympians series is sophisticated enough to attract older audiences as well. Usage of the present tense also makes reading challenging, without delivering any side benefit."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"After the 40th time the book was recommended to me I decided that I should give it a try. Suffice to say that I'm still p..... off at myself 'cause I should have known better than to fall for it.The whole book is written in present tense - which works just fine for fantasy role games, inner monologues, reviews and essays in elementary school but not for a novel. Word repetitions, the constant use of no-no words like \\"say\\", \\"do\\" and \\"is/are\\" and grammatical, spelling and typing errors are the icing on the cake. What was the editor thinking?! I'm not a native speaker but even I noticed!Another weak point is the characters. James offers some identification potential because he is a fantasy geek and turns into a valiant hero but everything comes too easily to him - especially in the beginning he's outfitted like in a computer RPG (money, horses, comrades ...). Miko, his companion, is the typical auxiliary - true of heart, none too bright and asking convenient questions which help the reader to understand the story line. Consequently the dialogues are stilted and awkward. The rest of the cast fulfills every bloody clich? of the genre.The plot could be straight out of a RPG, too. There's no pattern of rising action, climax and resolution, no complexity, no depth but a constant stream of little events that just happen to lead the hero to the next clue of his quest. Moreover the author pays overmuch attention to everyday details like haggling, sleeping and travelling arrangements, food purchases etc. It's not necessary to tell the reader about each roadside tavern and every market stall the hero comes across, especially if it doesn't serve any deeper purpose. It takes the flow out of the story and the way it's done doesn't even create much of an atmosphere. That's my next issue - the book lacks atmosphere. Descriptions of either characters or surroundings are inadequate and lifeless.THE UNSUSPECTING MAGE by Brian S. Pratt is a cheap sham. My recommendation is to try Jim Butcher's FURIES OF CALDERON or Patricia Brigg's DRAGON BONES. Those novels are truly worth their money and will please teenagers and adults alike."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The plot of this book is fairly standard fantasy: a modern Earth human gets transported to a fantasy world, along the lines of books such as the Narnia series or the Thomas Covenant series or Tad Williams Magic Kingdom for Sale. Any of those are far more polished works. Not that I expected brilliance from this effort, but the amateurish carelessness and lack of attention to detail was jarring. It is marred by awful writing~misused words in phrases such as &#34;make due [sic]&#34; and the like. At one point a stablehand refers to a horse as &#34;he&#34; when the horse had been introduced as a mare. The dialogue was clunky throughout, and the relationships were unrealistic.The presentation of magic was initially the only worthwhile aspect of the book, but even that degenerated as it became obvious that the particular uses of it weren't well considered. Spells are presented as taking personal energy, but then in many instances instead of using misdirection effects such as invisibility or darkness, he presents over-the-top magic such as golem creation.The author is also rather wasteful, setting up many encounters and scenes which do little or nothing to advance the plot. Although this can often be excused as setting up later events in many books, Pratt's overall lack of care gives me no confidence that this is his aim. Rather, it feels very much like it actually was a D&D; session transcribed -- poorly -- into novelized form. The constant use of present tense and single stream af action reinforces this impression.On the whole, a forgettable work that's not worth any more than the $0.00 price of this first entry."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"From the spectacularly cheesy and predictable storyline, to the unbearably irritating third-person present tense style of writing, this book was actually painful to read. I found myself silently cheering for any of the enemies James encounters in his 'adventure' to kill him and end all of our misery. The author could do with the services of a decent editor, as well - the misspelled words and incorrect homonyms were very distracting, although a pleasant diversion from the tragically awful storytelling.I urge any reader interested in reading a _good_ novel in the genre to stick with the far better Raymond Feist and David Eddings. At any rate, I paid nothing to read this book on my Kindle, thankfully. I definitely got my money's worth with this novel."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This book is a complete waste of time. I was apprehensive about reading it, after reading the review, but I decided to give the book a chance anyway. It turned out the other reviewers were right. This book has action just of action's sake, no plot or character development. Most incidents are without rhyme or reason, and just there to make it an 'action book'. If you like reading asinine books, filled with mindless fights, this is for you, but for other readers with a more discriminating taste, try better authors like GRRM, Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson, LeGuin etc."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I have been reading the Morcyth Saga books along with my 13-year-old son. We both are enjoying the story line. However, the text is riddled with errors that appear to be the result of relying on spell-check instead of actual proofreading or editing. This does not serve to help teenagers struggling with spelling to get a better grasp of what is correct. Further, some of the words are misused (again, a spell-check artifact). For example, \\"empirical soldiers\\" is used, when \\"imperial soldiers\\" should have been. Look up both adjectives, and you may burst out laughing. The list goes on, but you get the idea."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"If this was written by a High School Senior that took notes while playing a linear RPG (Say, Heroes of Might and Magic) and then put his notes into a book, this is what you would have. I can almost imagine the \\"pick how you would respond/reply to this situation\\" on screen. Do you A) go get help to get the cat from the roof (it's in there, yes, page 190), B) Help the kids throw rocks at the cat, or C) Scold the kids for being immoral and attempt to rescue the cat yourself. If you chose C, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I'm really loving this book. I got it just to read when i was bored but soon found that i couldn't put it down because i wanted to know what happened next. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Enjoyed the ideas expressed in the story. Thought the presentation of the plot line was clever.Needs a lot of editing, that distracted from the story. Also didn't like the main character; found him to be very pretentious. Characters could use more development."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This appears to be the very first book of a long series. The magic is good, and it can be exhausting...possibly even fatal. The main key to magic seems to be being able to visualize clearly what you want it to do, which means a bit of understanding of science goes a long way...probably why the main character was brought in in the first place since science is pretty rare on the planet."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I will admit, that the first few books in the series, like this one and it's sequel, seem to have no arranged plot to them and is just like the characters kind of thrown into it with no real purpose. But as you continue to read through the series, I find the way the writer did things, was extraordinarily clever. The early books are pretty boosted with action, and that continues through the entire series. But character development is admittedly lacking earlier in the series. As you continue to read things come to clarify, (and while plot may be somewhat predictable in some spots, it's still extraordinary and worth the read) the books become amazing. These are some of the best novels I have ever read, and have produced my favorite fictional character ever. I am a young, but avid reader at 19 years old.Getting more into this novel specifically. You meet a rather common character in the fictional world, but he develops into someone extraordinary in the progressions of this novel, and whole series. The plot does seem kind of thrown together, but I believe because, as opposed to a book by book basis, the author had the entire series mapped out in his mind before he began writing, and that reflects. This book is a little lackluster plot wise, but has a lot of action, and great characters. Pick up the book, and if you even like it a little bit, continue on with the whole series, because it is AMAZING."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The author is one of the few writers that realize they are in control of everything in the story, and don't have to conform to RULES laid down by English Teachers and Editors! I enjoyed not having to read pages of minute descriptions of each new scene, I rather like being able to use my imagination for this!I really like that the hero always had plenty money with which to buy what he needs like food, horses, lodging etc. Also that he was very resourceful and knew how to live off the land when needed.The only downer for me was, I thought his being weakened by each magic act was a bit overdone, I would have preferred to see him get used to this to the point that it didn't affect him anymore.I liked knowing that no matter what predicament he found himself in, he would be able to extricate himself with magic. Nothing is more aggravating than stories about magic where for some reason they aren't allowed to use it any time they wish.The beginning reminded me of the C.S.Lewis stories, of how he moved from this world to the other one.I read this with my Kindle App on my Smartphone. I got this book free from Amazon."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I really enjoyed the story in the Unsuspecting Mage - but dear me, the writing was, well, terrible. I wondered at one point if it had been written by a teenager. Sentences switched tenses mid-stream, which made me wild. Which sucked, because it was a good story. I'll try the next book with the hope that the writer matured."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The plot got better over time, but in many places I found it to be lacking. It seems like the work of someone who hasn't quite figured out the intricacies of what detail needs to be included and what detail can be left out. He just didn't push far enough. There are some details that really didn't make a whole lot of sense either, such as how a main character with the particular set of experiences and attributes that James had could know and accomplish some of the things he did, even if he did read a lot of fantasy books.I'd say this makes for a mediocre book for middle school students. With some more practice perhaps Pratt could go somewhere, but this didn't really hit the mark.*Re-posted from goodreads.com"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I read this book because of the title and obviously for the price... is it literary genius? No. Is it a work of art worthy of praise by the masters? No. Does it contain a couple of errors? Yes.Normally that would be enough to send most people running for the hills, but you know what? I read this book and promptly bought the next one. The author shamelessly admits his D&D; reference and at no point does he claim intellectual, physical or emotional superiority for the cast or main.This is certainly a book you will either love or hate.I am currently reading the series a third time and frankly I can't put a stamp on why I like it. I see logic in the plot and it might be due to my imagination, but hey, that's something I like. I find myself smiling at moments that only become important later and by now I have a whole sub theory of my own as to the motivation of the gods here...I don't like being spoon fed everything and this book and series gave me enough to work with to have an enjoyable experience.So, two years later I admit it, I love this book and the whole series. So sue me lol.Now, Mr. Pratt, when are you publishing the next one in the follow up series? Your obscure fans are waiting!"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"It reads like something that would probably make a good TV series or miniseries.There are little to no mistakes to distract the reader from the story, or at least none that were readily apparent to me. but i did speed read.I enjoyed it, well developed system of magic, cohesive world, overall story. Some may complain about the lack of character development but what it lacks in providing full backstory and emotional rounding of characters is made up for in the detailed way the author constructs the system. Also they probably didn't give it a chance the main character, hero of the story and his companion while starting out somewhat two dimensional expand to a more full character as the story progresses. What seems like shallow 2D shells of characters (twilight gag!) are allowed to develop subtly without overwhelming the reader with unessential emotional baggage.I'm one who prefers world building, I enjoy a well created world with good systems setup, I've read a few books that focus solely on the characters providing back story, motivational details, emotional conflicts and failed to get me interested in the world itself. This book probably focuses more on the world and system of magic than it should on the characters.I hope the author can develop a proper balance between character and world."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I dont know what others think of this book but for me it took a whole new light to magic for me. I loved the charecters i loved the plot but i cant say it was perfect but it was awesome."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"It's the best word I can use to describe this book. The present-tense narration (straight out of a D&D; campaign and something I don't like much anyway) is inconsistent, with occasional lapses into past tense that interfere with the storytelling. The formatting is inconsistent, at least on the Kindle. The setting is inconsistent. Pratt does a good job in some places with the confusion between James' language and that of the world he winds up in. Then, not too long after Miko doesn't understand the word \\"clue,\\" he uses the phrase \\"momma's boy.\\" In another point, someone from that world uses the word \\"cool\\" to describe something that's neat or groovy. The magic system is inconsistent. There's some effort to give it a level of difficulty and a learning curve, but the effort falls flat. James never really has to learn anything. He reads a passage in a book hes' given, tries it and it works. His abilities grow over time, which is a nice touch, but he doesn't have to learn anything. The only hindrance he has is that too much effort gives him a headache and makes him pass out.The only reason this book gets two stars instead of one is because Pratt occasionally (and, I think, accidentally) creates a good story, one I actually enjoyed reading. But the problems made that enjoyment inconsistent."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I started our writing a comprehensive criticism of The Unsuspecting Mage by presenting my likes and dislikes, and then discussing my opinions. I then decided it wasn't worth the effort for this book.World building was meager, character development was shallow, and too many subjects of interest were presented then neglected. Grammar and punctuation were atrocious. The story was presented as a quest but amounted only to disjointed errantry.The hero became physically and mentally exhausted after every exertion, and always had to rest for a day or two afterward. This pattern became rather tedious.The hero picks his requisite sidekick, who starts as a filthy street urchin and then almost overnight becomes his equal in wisdom, maturity, strength, endurance -- everything but magical talent. Again, no satisfactory character development here.Toward the end of the book we are treated to a real Mickey Mouse dream sequence. Why? I don't think this added anything to the story.I'm rating Mr. Pratt's book with two stars instead of one, because whatever the faults were the book did hold my attention until the end. I had even hoped to buy inexpensive sequels just to see how the pieces fit together, but at about $6.00 per book it just isn't worth it to me."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I feel that some of the reviews of this book are a little harsh, but to each his own. As for my own experience, I enjoyed the book as a free kindle book. It took a little while to get into, and some of the wording throws me off, but overall it is an engaging book. The path of James as a rising mage is an interesting one, and possibly is the most intriguing part of the story line to me. Seeing him learn various spells through trial and error, and wondering when he'll become more powerful or meet a mentor drew me through most of the story.For the negative, there are some repetitive parts of the story that simply get old. Travelling to inns, hitching your horse, getting a goose meal with gravy...must happen at least 5 times in the story. Until nearly the end, I didn't feel any true struggle for James. Language and slang sometimes threw me off, and tense got confused in a few places, but overall wasn't a deal breaker. I do hope that the story gets more trialling and epic in future books.However, the read overall is quick and pleasant. The story was engaging, and possibly despite his being a somewhat annoying high schooler, eventually I did start to like James. The climax was exciting, and I will continue reading into the series. I can tell that the author set out to write an entertaining series, and for me at least it was easy to escape into and be entertained (I lost time reading at least one full night, and finished most of the book in a weekend). I look forward to the future books."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I got this book for my kids but I decided that I liked it and it was a nice read."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This book is like a video game. It has a simple, one dimensional world that vaguely resembles medieval Europe. The main character (I wont call him a hero as others have), James, is a seventeen year old boy from our modern world who suddenly finds himself in this strange land to which he adapts instantly. He never gets homesick, almost never shows any emotions, even when killing people by the dozens.James has magical powers in this world which he uses like a video game player: to kill, maim, destroy, blow up and set fire to things. He goes out of his way to constantly put himself in dangerous situations so he can have the fun of killing a bunch of people. And then the book just stops. I wont say ends, because in a novel that implies resolution of the major conflicts in the story. There is no resolution of anything, we are left hanging like a TV show that ends with \\"To Be Continued\\"."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This is the first book in an excellent series. It is appropriate for adolescents and interesting for adults who are interested in some character development, like sorcery and like their heroes to be human with weaknesses as well as strengths. Few bulging muscle swordsman or luscious maidens in these books. The low price makes this book even more attractive for kindle readers."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This is the first of Mr Pratt's books in the Morcyth Saga and I found it interesting enough to purchase the entire epic. He comes across as the neighbors kid who still lives in the basement at 35 and plays online games and Dungeons and Dragons all night. BUT, his story is entertaining and would be lapped up by any 9-15 year old out there. Most certainly a series for young people. Not the best effort out there and not the worst. Find yourself wishing for the gravy that did not come with your mashed potatoes. The author has absolutely no descriptive skills in several areas. Do you remember your Junior year of high school when the assignment was to write a descriptive story? He fails to make you feel surroundings or character profiles. In short, do not be expecting to be able to visualize the appearance of anyone or their surroundings. This is why I rated it the way I did. He appears to be a talented story teller who has no time to tell you anything but the facts. Might be better suited to police procedurals. Just the facts,mam. Just the facts."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I have nothing bad to say about this book. I like the authors style, he has the decency of letting you know what is happening, and gives you enough detail to form good pictures in your mind. I found his style refreshing and I have purchased the second book and can't wait to find out what happens next!"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Ok I have just read some nasty comments!!!I personally liked this book.The beginning is very slow, didn't know if I was going to be able to get into the book but it did take off.I ended buying all the ebooks in this series and he is now starting on a second series with same characters so will be waiting for it also.thxs for the free ebook Mr. Pratt!"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This is a great read and I was very happy about the thought that went in to the story. I was a little confused at the very beginning, that might have been me it was good enough the order the rest and then pass them onto my husbands kindle."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I bought and gave this to a teen who reads day and night and likes this sort of thing - along with computer games. I had no idea that he would flip over it! Talk about a great choice! I can't give you an idea about what its about, except to say a 14 yr old really loved it and is going to read all of them....so if your child is into fantasy computer games and books, magic etc, this book will win their heart.Some books that worked too, which I was amazed at, because they were popular with kids long ago were the original Tom Swift adventure set, all are good, here are a few:Tom Swift: Seeking the Platinum Treasure: Swift by Name and Swift by Nature!Tom Swift: Adventures on the Road: Swift by Name and Swift by Nature!Tom Swift and his Mastery of the Sky: Swift by Name and Swift by Nature!Keep reading!"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I really liked The Unsuspecting Mage. The story revolves around a senior from high school who goes to answer and ad for a job and winds up in another world.To make matters worse, he isn't told what he's there for or who brought him there. The fun part is watching him work his way through in an attempt to at first simply survive and then discover what's going on.I have been an RPG fanatic for ten years now and this book at times feels just like you're in the adventure. Not many books puts you in the action, maybe it's the use of present tense, but at times it feels like you're going along with him on his quest.The magic system is sensible and logical, I like that. Some books have magic spells, where the words have the power. Here, it's the people who have the power and must use their minds to bend the magic to do what must be done. And it isn't like he says, 'Do it' and the magic does, he has to understand how to bring it into being such as starting a fire. Since he was brought up in a technology world, he understands about heat, oxygen, fuel etc so can bring about the desired effect. All in all very believable.Action abounds as he stumbles upon various factions going about their business. Most if not all seem to want him dead for one reason or another. You see, a lot of the subplots he runs afoul of have little to do with him, they're already set in motion and the people don't care much for interfearers.All in all a good book. I definitely reccomend it."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Being a grad student doesn't leave one much leisure time to read, especially at this time of year but I had to make time when I first starting reading this book. Lost too much sleep when I finally got into the story a little ways.This author has a definite style which I like. It's easy to read and flows pretty well. When I came to write this reveiw I saw on an earlier review how there's a rape in this book. At first I couldn't remember when but then I looked back and found it. It's but one sentence in the last chapter and doesn't describe anything other than someone is. From the way the other guy made it sound, you'd think it was explicitly detailed.Let me set your mind at ease about that. There is no sex in this book other than that single sentence. No swear words or anything else other than maybe Damn. I have a younger sister and I wouldn't have a problem in letting her read this.The action flows well. James(the hero) isn't a kill all death machine. I like the fact that he is humane and kind, only killing when all else fails. Those around him continue to tell him he must kill, but he tries all other means before resorting to that. I found this book had many morals in it, good morals that is.He also has consequences for his actions whether being reduced to unconsciousness or affected in other ways, the reader understands he can't just do whatever he wants.In many ways James seems like just an average person you'd find walking down a street somewhere. Nothing extraodinary about him, no massive strength, no amazing intellect. Just an average Joe set in a world where his experiences from this one gives him an edge.A refreshing tale all way around. I would reccomend this to anyone, except perhaps those who are annoyed by little imperfections like punctuation or a few spelling errors, there are a few but not so many that they detract from the story.This book begins a good story which anyone interested in a fast paced adventure."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Book has a good story line, keeping you interested in the characters and locations. The writing style is a little different than I am used to, and was a little distracting at first, but as I got into the story being told, got used to it quickly. Will be looking to read the next in the series...."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I read a lot, and with the Kindle even more so. I picked up this book as it was free and quickly read through it. The plot is simple, the characters easy to identify with, and the story flows smoothly. I have since read about the author and agree that this book is not riddled with detail and specifics that you typically scan but mostly skip over. There is just enough detail to make every word important and not take away from the storyline. My only lament is that I would like to see a little more detail in the battle scenes, but there is enough there to allow the point to get across. Solid read for free, and for 5.95 for the other books in the series, well worth the money spent as well. Entertaining, well thought out, well done.**UPDATE**After reading 3, or possibly 4 books in the series I stopped. The same description in the first is used throughout and it seems that the ideas created in the beginning of the series are being beaten to death toward the end of the series. As seen from my update, I don't remember how far along I got before I realized the story was lost, and the writing was repetitive."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I enjoyed reading The Unsuspecting Mage.The writer went through many interesting scenes and adventures.James and Miko make a great team, James always looking out for Miko's well being. It's very traumatic what happens to Miko.Thank goodness for James' magic, he must find and help Miko.I'm looking forward to Book #2 and continue the Saga."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"A truely fun novel beginning I hope a great fantasy series. The way the story flows from one exciting situation to another kept me turning page after page until I finally realized what time it was and turned out the light.The fall of the city of light was my favorite scene, or rather when they reach the city all the way through to the last page.Great book."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I loved it from beginning to end. The magic was believable though I really thought James would spend more time in learning rather than be good at it from the get go. The author does explain that, his time role playing helped to prepare him for it.Can't wait to see what's in store for book two."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This has to be one of the best books i've ever read! This book is filled with adventure and thrills around every corner. Did I mention there was magic! The way James(The main character.) uses magic gives it a sense of realism to the factor of magic. The personalities of the characters are also well developed and give them the marage of them actually being real peopel. I look forward to the second book and recomend anyone who is mystified by magic and loves adventure to get this book! The only regret with reading this book was that it had to end.When James relizes that the job he applied for wasnt the job he thought he was. He was put in an alternate world where he discovers he can do magic! Real magic! just by imagining what he wants done! James then hasto adapt to this new world or else he wont be able to get back or even worse, not survive. James faces many challenges with Miko and the rest of the friends he gains in order to unlock the secret of getting back to his own world. This book is great and it seems that the second book is even better."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I was not expecting much from this book as it was free, 3 pages in I thought \\"wow this is great!\\" At 2:30 in the morning I had to make myself put the Kindle down and go to bed. Great read! I usually stick to books more along the lines of Lackey, and others this was great!"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Well, what can I say...All of you, who love novels about magic or the Middle Ages are going to like this book as well. Cause that's what it is about...But if you ever read such a book and thought \\"Boy, I'd like to be there.\\" or \\"What? No way, reacting like that is illogical. I would...\\" you must read this one.The author takes a normal boy (well, he is kind of a geek) out of our world into ... well some kind of the Middle Ages with magic.And this is where the second reason to read the book comes in. The magic system.It is well thought through. No \\"I can do anything, with everyone, just by accident\\" like Harry Potter. No \\"I have to prepare ahead of time, but guess what, I always have the right spells.\\" like some D&D; books.As the story goes on, the reader as well as the main character learn about the way magic works step by step.The author writes on his homepage, that he likes to stick with the main character, and write from his point of view. He does that in the first book, but in the second one he leaves that path some times.For the reader it means, you only know, what the main character knows. I think this adds even more \\"being there\\" feeling, cause you can identify with the hero's choices, before you know what's behind the next corner.Last but not least, you have a lot of action. The descriptions of the environment are cut down to a minimum. But not below. I never had the feeling something was missing, other than me reading the next chapter.Oh, and a warning: I couldn't leave the book out of hand for more than sleeping and eating... even though I had an important test coming up the next day. Well, I passed the test, so no problem there."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"it is difficult to write a review for this book. i thought the plot was basically good but the writing is just not very dynamic. in fact throughout most of the reading of \\"the unsuspecting mage i really wanted some level of complexity to develop. there needed to be more excitement in the development of the story. even though this series is supposed to be for young adults i don't think that is reason enough to make it such a simple writing. i haven't decided whether i am going to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This is the first book of seven and is simply amazing, I am 22 years old and have never read a book quite like this before, I received a Kindle for christmas and decided to download a bunch of the free books, this book was the first I read and it was outstanding."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I downloaded this free book not expecting a lot. I was thrilled with the writing style and story line. I loved it so much that I just had to purchase the next book of the series. This of course is the hopes of all the authors who give away the first book of their series."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I've just discovered the very talented author, Brian Pratt. He writes adventure books the way that an adventure book should be written. The way he weaves the story puts you in the story from the very beginning! Action every time you turn around. Thanks Brian, can't wait to read your other books!!!"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I am disappointed to see that a review has caused controversy as it detracts from what should be the main focus; the book, not the reviewers. I took a shot and bought this book because it was so highly rated and was not disappointed. Seldom do I find a book that I can't put down. The story moves fast, is action packed, and pulls no punches. I have also read the sequels and found that they are equally as entertaining. I am eagerly waiting for the release of the fourth installment."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I have liked this style of book for over 25 years. Once I started reading it, I could not put it down. I was hooked from the first chapter! It moves along at a good pace. I thouroughly enjoyed it.If you liked the \\"Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\" series, then you will love this series also. I highly recommend this book. Please hurry with Book Two!"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I am 11 years old and my mom bought me this book after I nagged at her for awhile. I loved it. The action was cool and the way James and Miko get into all sorts of situations is exciting. They make me laugh."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"What a great story! I was taken on a trip and thoroughly enjoyed myself. If you can allow yourself to take it for the YA story that it is, I believe you too will be looking for the next book in line. Wondering what lies in store for James, Miko and the rest of the motley crew. There is adventure, magic, crazy bad guys, friendship and loyalty for all."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This was one of the best books i have read! I am going to buy the whole series that is how good it is. IF YOU TRUST ME FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS : 1)GET THIS BOOK; 2)READ IT ; 3) ENJOY IT!"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I found the book to be a very light read, but that doesn't make it bad. The story was just a refreshing adventure/fantasy plot, with little to no twists. Some characters one has to wonder about, until the author cleverly puts them in later. But I do like the fact that by bringing in an 'out of touch' teen from our time, to another, allows the story to have some more sensibility then most stories would have, ex; he makes spells to clean his water, he's worried about sanitation ect.over all an enjoyable book, and one would not regret reading it."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The kind of book you just love to reed because it is fun, entertaining, and straight forward.The book follows the adventure of James. A regular guy in his late teens reluctantly going to an interview and finding his true passion: MAGIC, REAL MAGIC! The only catch is: he may have to pay for it with his very own life.Launched on a path without knowing the target, He is now forced to complete an unknown task directed only by little pieces of information in a world where He absolutely ignores everything but language.The book follows the usual path of an RPG, preparing you for the rest of the series (Morcyth Saga).The book is not \\"a classic\\", but it is, obviously, not intended as one. If you are looking for something light, fun, and addictive you should definitely give it a chance."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I kind of got into this book, and kind of didn't. Honestly the writing in the present tense was a little wierd, and of course the spelling errors, and missing words, but the reality is I've never read a book that didn't have an error of some kind or another. Yes, this one had more than most and it was a little distracting. From a writing persepective there were a lot of extra words that could have been removed or tweaked to make for a better novel, but for a person starting out writing, it is a natural mistake.I think the plot was interesting starting out, and had there been more twists and turns instead of the constant repeating, it could have turned out to be a pretty great novel. There were also some awkward scenes that I felt were left incomplete, or there wasn't a smooth flow to the next scene, but if you can get around all of that and try to picture what the author intended, but couldn't quite get across, then it was a decent book. It interested me enough to finish it, and that says something, because if I'm not into a book half way through, then I just quit trying.I haven't decided yet whether or not I will purchase the other books in the series. The first one was free, and the ending left me interested enough to attempt the other books to see if they are written better, but based on the other reviews it looks like I will get more of the same, which I don't want. I really think this series could have been great if it was more pulled together and focused."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Well, I have to give credit for actually writing the book (and a multitude of sequels) but that is about it. It's written in present tense, which is most annoying. I cannot confirm the other review's contention that the book is like a transcription of a D & D game scene, as I've never played D & D. However, as an avid reader of fantasy/magic novels, I can say I think I'd think of better magic for our erstwhile James to use.I agree with the others that there is little plot development - there *is* a bit of a story, but it isn't fleshed out too well. I've read book one, and if the others were free, I'd read them. I'd like to know the story behind the amulet. I'd like to know why the Morcyth religion disappeared. I'm just not going to pay to find out. I'll be satisfied not knowing.Another irritating thing is James' adherence to a strict moral code without explanation of why it is good to have these good morals. If nothing else, the author could've injected a bit of teaching into his work, but like so many other opportunities for character and plot development, the development of a moral is left by the wayside.By all means, Mr. Pratt, keep writing. Just find yourself a beta reader (editor) or something!Kindest wishes for future success!"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Some are very clever about bashing this book, but I believe that it does not merit such ridicule. It was a fun read -- up until the non-ending. I hate cliffhangers.To say that it has no plot is extreme, but the plot (that of \\"man vs. man\\" or \\"man vs. self\\") does not materialize until midway through the book, when the main character has to find out was a gift he received really means. Even after the plot solidifies, there is no climax, and there is some build up. The classic story outline of character intro, plot intro, plot development, escalation, climax, and resolution are regrettably avoided and becomes a travelog.It had clever concepts. The story 99% of the time was something that I would gladly allow my kids to read, because the author treats immorality in a classy way (the 1% that soured me was when the sidekick refers to circumcision as mutilation). For the most part, it was good, clean fun. However, those that desire intrigue, complexity, and humanistic truth (\\"what's so special about you, human?\\") will never be sated with this text.Characters that you would expect to evolve, don't. Characters that would add color are dropped precipitously. Even the main character does not face moralities that come with killing, saving lives, witnessing atrocities, choosing one over another. The \\"human condition\\" is what makes stories lastingly impactful. There is one point that the main character reflects on the use of his sidekick's \\"energy\\" to fuel his power. He concludes that it is wrong without a willing vessel -- that's it. No rumination. No evaluation. No turmoil. Don't we all dicker with the good and bad, the right and wrong of an action?If this were the _first_ author's work, I would say bravo. But, since I believe that it is not, I have to advise the author to read some works and sharpen his saw."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Just finished reading this ebook and i have to say it was very good. James was a good main character and i liked miko as his sidekick. This brought me back to the days of playing Dungeons and Dragons back in the 80's. I saw reviews of how it was written in the present tense and it was no issue, I just got used to it and it flowed nicely. I look forward to ordering book 2 of the Morcyth Saga. Thank you for writing an entertaining story. Great job!"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This book rocked!!!For a self published book this was well written. Some have complained of the quality of the copy editor, in response to this I say give me a break. There might be problems but to a non-English major college graduate there was nothing that impeded my ability to get immersed into the story.I enjoyed the D&D; style story line even though I have never gotten into D&D.; This book does what I like my fiction to do, it immersed me into the universe. After reading this book I find my self thinking what if ... In ways that I could \\"play\\" a story in the same universe on my own. In my opinion this was a well written \\"dungeon\\" style story.In conclusion if it is free give it a read and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I tried this out and I did end up buying and reading the whole series. I think it is too expensive for how small the books are but I did enjoy the series. First one is free but the others are almost $6."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I read the first 3 books of this series, while reading the 3rd book I went to Pratt web site click on contact and wrote him a page and a half critique of his books. The 1 and 2 stars review are very correct. I have never played D&D;, I have played DAOC, and other simalar computer games. The idea of the quest game hit me while reading the first book, it was fully obvious by the end of the 2nd book, but the 3rd book I had to make a statement so I wrote the author.I like the over all story line its one of the basic plots of a certain type fantasy. bring a person from our world to a world of magic where they learn they can do the Magic,. I had not problem with it.BUT, his characterization is lousy. in fact by the first part of book 3 Miko and young boy who has been traveling with James, has devolved. He is acting 2-4 years younger then he was originally. James himself has not matured much more then this himself, When this story started he was a senior in high school, about to graduate and his grandparent who had raised him were anxious for him to geth is first job.My recommendation was the author should read Tamara Pierce's series to see how young characters can mature through a story. Take Holly Isle online writing courses on plat developement and character growth. Read Modestta for creating magic systems that our realistic and consistent.These three authors in my opinion are a required reading for any author writing Fantasy of the Epic type.I have now starting the Dark Mage Travil, or book 8 of this series, as the same character and univers are in this book,I apolizie for all the misspelling in this review but I am badly visual impaired, and can barel see what I have written.I hope you can understand what I was trying to say."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This book read like a grocery list. Go to store, pick up rock. Throw rock at bad guys. There was nothing memorable about this book. I'd give the writer credit for completing a novel, except it doesn't feel like anything was accomplished by this book. Usually when a book is a series,when it one book ends something get resolved. This booked ended with no questions being answered, no idea where the next book is heading. While not all series books do stand on their own at least they feel like a complete novel, not a half finished book.I would be curious as to where the author is from, because the spells in the book are supposed to rhyme and they do not to my ears. One line has steel trying to rhyme with kill."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"In this book, a kid named James is taken from his antisocial life into another world, where he learns to be a mage and tries to find information about the people who got him there and why he is there. He meets many friends, has many battles, and acquires a companion named Miko. I'm not giving anything away, but something happens to Miko while in a different kingdom that is at war, and James is saved by a group of young people. It is a great storyline and the battles are very exciting (albeit a little gory), but this author has a few large and really annoying problems. First of all, he puts the entire book in the present tense which tends to be kind of bothersome. Second of all, he makes a huge amount of grammatical and spelling errors which were very annoying and noticable. He almost never puts in question marks, and he makes very simple typing mistakes. It almost seems as if he didn't ever read it over. Also, he sometimes becomes quite redundant with a few situations. Several times in this book and the sequel he uses a scene where James escapes into an allyway, comes to a dead end, and finds a door into someone's home leading out of the allyway. Also, sometimes when talking about a specific person he will repeat the same name over and over instead of using a pronoun. Besides these few mistakes, this is an amazing book and I definitely recommend it. Parents, be warned if buying this for your kids: there are quite a few instances where characters are raped, and during battles the deaths are described quite gorily."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Suffice to say I didn't like 'The Unsuspecting Mage' very much and promptly returned it. Out of the many books I've read lately I rate this the lowest. Not much of a story really and no characters I cared about."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Okay, I enjoyed some of the one-star reviews for laughs, and I can understand what they are saying, but this isn't bad, it's just not for everyone. If you are young, or young at heart, and you really want to read A LOT of action, this could be a GOOD book for you. It reminded me of old John Carter of Mars books, where limbs sprayed the guy was wacking his way thru them so fast. So, if you like hack-and-slash action and want to be harry potter grown up and ready to fight a world's worth of monsters, this is a good book. If you are a librarian, forget it. You will be horrified. I think as a kid, I would have really gone nuts for this one. I can recall being bored to death with \\"conflicted characters\\" and \\"poetic descriptions\\", I wanted stuff to happen and I wanted it to be cool and simple and NOW!Also, if you think that Pratt actually made up his 5 stars reviews you are totally wrong! People just like different things. I can very easily see a five star review from the target reader. If you don't believe me, try watching a game show on TV and then a Shakespearean play...Keep writing Pratt, some of us will love your stuff."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"C'mon people. I've read pretty bad reviews, but cut the author some slack. Yes, the book could use some editoring, but it seems the author is his own editor, publisher & whatnot. Pratt, as an author, needs some time before fully maturing, but hey!, so does Goodkind, more established as a fantasy writer than Pratt. And the Morcyth saga is far more readable than the last 5 or so installments of the Sword of Truth. The series is entertaining and the books have kept me company during endless hours of train and bus rides while on vacation. Just don't expect a LoTR. As fun goes, it feels like playing a good D&D session. And I was never one to like DMs who were trigger happy. I was always one to appreciate some cheating favoring players. I do look forward for the next installments and I'm pretty sure Mr. Pratt will soon be counted among the bestsellers of the genre."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"My plan wasn't to write a review until I saw the two previous ones. I read this book and found it quite enjoyable actually. I wondered about the two reveiws, coming on the same day, saying pretty much the same thing. Then I checked out all their reviews and realized what they wrote here they slammed almost verbatum many others, seems to be targeting only a few authors though. And the funny part is, all the reveiws came on the same day. Odd to say the least.Now I'm not saying they are making it up or anything, I'm sure they genuinely don't like it, but to do it so widespread all at once arouses my suspicion as to the voracity of what they are saying.Always check out another's past reveiws before you take anything they say to heart.Like I said, this book is decent, maybe not the best out there but still enjoyable. Have a good day."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Being stationed over here in Irag, these books are a godsend. Not all are available in ebooks as these are and being on the go you can't lug around paperbacks, space is at a premium where I go.These books bring back a little of home, I like to imagine I am the main character James, just for awhile to take me away from here.The story itself is great, full of action and novel ideas.If you know someone who's in the military, get them a portable device that they can use to store ebooks on, it's a lifesaver when you have nothing else to occupy yourself."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Call me an uneducated fool i guess. I noticed grammar and spelling errors which really ,really irk me, but I really liked the characters and the story. I think the author may have hit the fast forward button a little too quickly in the development of James' character but eh, whatever. I enjoyed the story and the characters so much that I bought the next book on my Kindle. After that, I got the third one. Then I was reading the fourth one. Then the fifth. And so on. I read the whole series and I liked it all and I was so sad that I was finished when I was done. I miss James and Miko and Tersa and Jiron and everyone else. I would recommend this book to someone who is interested in D&D type stories. Heck, the first one is a free download, the only thing you have to lose is a few hours of your time. if you don't like it, don't continue on with the rest of the books. I'm one of those folks who can read darn near anything and get lost in the story so you may just have to take a chance and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Great book! Cannot wait to download the rest of the series. Literally spent every available minute reading it! Brian S Pratt is a wonderful writer."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I have completed the entire series and this review encompasses all of these installments. I think it is somewhat unfair to rate a series based on a single installment. In addition I know that for me I read about 4 books a week and generally read an entire series if I start. I wish i had read a review before starting this series.The overall plot and pace of book are decent. The basic concept for the book is somewhat original.Now the things that really bug me about the book:1. Grammar.2. Made up and misused vocabulary that should be in the basic toolkit of any author. I have to give just a few examples that really annoyed me and made me yell at the author. He uses the phrase 'empirical soldier' instead of using the appropriate imperial soldier, James frequently describes himself as being systematical, describes a situation as 'problematical', confuses heel and heal numerous times, lists 3 items then states 'neither', not to mention lack of variance in presenting dialogue.3. Very shallow characters: James' great love interest is essentially a girl he met at a party one night, sent a dolphin analogue carving to as a gift, and had a paragraph conversation with after a high seas rescue. Give 7 installments in this saga, before we can buy this as a great love maybe a bit more development is needed.4. James, James, and James - this character is shallow, vapid, inconsistent, and a whiner. Typical high school student nothing exceptional other than his ability to wish really, really hard. He is constantly preaching a somewhat socialist mantra about helping the poor and uses the communist phrase 'for the greater good' several times in the book. Yet James is the only person who seems always to skip his turn on watch, nobody is allowed to eat until he sits down at dinner, he has the only valet in the war camp, they are all in the adventures together but somehow James is the one in control of the purse. Having a spoiled teenage daughter I can recognize the poorly considered, shallow, and vociferously championed positions of the author via James.My suggestion as an alternative to this series- find a self centered vapid teenager who has a very high opinion of their insight and lurk on their facebook page. The dialogue will be every bit as enlightened as James and Miko."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Poorly written with elements cribbed from other better stories. Rife with inconsistencies and a generic plot, it did gain better pacing as you get deeper in."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I am sorry but I could not get into this book at all. I seldom am unable to finish reading a book, but after only a couple of chapters I gave this one away."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I'm a 72 year old eclectric reader and enjoy fantasy. This book was written for 12 year olds. Give me Elizabeth Moon."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I enjoyed the start of the book and was intrigued with the concept. As the story progressed, it appeared to be nothing more than a bunch of short stories with the main character moving from scene to scene. I first thought it was interesting, but was wondering about how it would be resolved. I then came back to Amazon to see how many books were in the work, and see that the story goes on infinitely. I was disappointed with the end of the first book as it just kinda ended without any real reason. Seeing that the next 7 or eight books are all $5.95, I have decided not to waste any more time with it. There was some great potential with this storyline, but I have no energy to continue with it."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I had a horrible time making my way through this book due to the horrible grammar and poor or non-existent editing. There was bad use and awkward switching of tense, along with spelling and grammatical errors throughout. The story premise could be good, but the execution just didn't make it. It's a prime example of how important it is to have good proofreading/editing. I'm glad this was a free Kindle download. Even though I am a bit curious how things work out, I won't be paying for or reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Had I actually paid for this, I would have definitely felt cheated. As others have already said, this reads like a transcription of a game -- the reader can only follow along and not actually participate. Mostly, though, I thought it was more a travelogue than a story about a mage.The passive present tense was jarring, until I figured out that this was a game -- and even then, I did not care for that style. The whole thing cries out for proofreading and editing.I have the impression that any follow-on episodes will be more of the same. There is probably one good book's worth of story in all the episodes, but the first part was so non-engaging that I'll not be joining in on the rest of it."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The story itself seems like it could be interesting if only all the characters were defined more. It's like reading a book where everyone is played by Kevin Costner. The main character, who is 17, speaks like a noble as does his 14 year old street urchin sidekick. I mean if you always thought fresh prince of bel air would have been good had the cast of 90210 been in it instead then you shouldn't have any trouble getting into the characters. I want to know how the story ends but I'm not going to pay for the sequel / shrug"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I could not finish this book. Believe me I tried. Usually I can force myself through a book. Sometimes I continue reading when everything in me says MOVE ON and I'm rewarded but honestly I couldn't talk myself into finishing it. Maybe there's plot eventually. I have no idea. I read about 60% of this book. All that I read of it was the main character traveling and then fighting battles he shouldn't be able to survive and yet somehow does, then he travels some more, gets into some more craziness he shouldn't get out of alive and then more traveling. None of it seems to have a purpose. It's just walk walk walk and then fight fight fight. It felt like a dungeon crawler video game. No real purpose. Just walking and killing. I have no clue why this has so many good reviews. I'd think maybe it gets better in the end except so many people feel the exact same way I did that I have to say I must be right and it's not worth it."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"When I first decided to read this book, it was based on the author's voice, because he said that he was skipping over chapters in a particularly popular book. I can only think that he was talking about Harry Potter. I too, wished for Potter to be a bit more dark than it was, so the idea that an older version (Older meaning High School Senior) book was on the rise was very interesting to me. It was definitely not anything like Harry Potter, but the book was simple, and an easy read and I did enjoy it. I give it 4 starts instead of 3, because I think it was a good attempt and I appreciate when someone tries to execute something with their own passion through their heart. I think if anything, that shines through."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I stuck with this book for quite a while after I got it for free in the I-tunes library. After reading almost 200 pages without any direction or story line I walked away. I only stuck with it thinking there had to be a direction eventually, a plot line eventually. It hasn't gotten there yet. I charge $90 an hour for my time, I want my $135. Had I paid I would demand my money back."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This book should never have been published. There's a reason it's free! It sounds like something a 10 year old illiterate kid wrote, with unrealistic characters, and a horrid plot."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Well, since I got the Kindle book for free I think I can safely say I got what I paid for. It reminds me of the old old games we played on the computer back when we typed in the code to play the game we wanted because we were too cheap to order the floppy. Pages of characters, letters, numbers that came with a magazine. We are so spoiled now! We spent hours typing in the characters from the magazine and then hours trying to find the errors so the game would work.I keep thinking: Game: You come to a wall with a gate. Player: Open the gate. Game: The gate is locked. Player: Unlock the gate. Game: You don't have a key. etc., etc., etc.,.The inconsistancies are a problem, also. James picks up his spear in one paragraph and two paragraphs later makes the spear. Huh? There was a tree with a truck instead of a trunk and several places where a sentence just made no sense.I also had a lot of trouble with the use of present and past tense in the same sentence, sometimes several changes in one sentence.Very poorly written although I think there was actually a good concept here, it just didn't live up to it's potential. I've read high school kids short stories that were better written.I really wanted to like this book because I enjoy reading a series that follows the characters through many stories. This is not one of those. I won't buy the next one even if Amazon makes it a free one."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The idea behind the story was intriguing, but the execution was greatly lacking. If you prefer immersing yourself in an author's world where the scenery is vivid, and characters have more personality - then this is not the book for you.The good:The most descriptive scenes involve food and/or drink.The bad:Lack of character development.The story really didn't go beyond traveling from point A to B to C, and all the meals in between.Feels like it was written directly from someone's D&D; campaign."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"*YAWN* Do yourself a favor and delete it before you even download it. It's that bad.It is nothing more than the transcript of a computer RPG play-through. There is no plot. There is no story. There is, however, lots of boring repetitive traipsing through the realm in search of . . . what? Who knows.The story *might* have been improved if it came with an MP3 of the sounds of D&D; dice being rolled--just for background ambiance."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I don't normally write reviews, but this book is so horrible that i had to. The characters are extremely one dimensional with no personalities at all, the plot kind of gets shredded into lots of sub plots, there are many errors such as switching tenses...I found myself starting to hate our dear little protagonist as he kills the people in his way while exclaiming at one point that he only kills people when he has to. I've lost track of how many he has killed. The story is also very unrealistic as he fends off half a dozen wolves with his spear, and he's not even very athletic, as mentioned in the book. The author spends much too much time painfully recording every detail of his stays at various inns, most of which are named after an animal doing something. It's also pretty dubious how almost everyone is a really good cook, so the author spends a fair amount of time describing all the good foods shoved into the protagonist's gullet. Etc., etc.What's a Morcyth anyway? (Sorry if it's already mentioned in the book-- I skipped ahead after struggling all the way to the middle of the book.)To conclude my review, my firm opinion is that this book is worth less than its $0.00 price. People should be paid just to read this book."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"There are times you read a book and wonder how the heck it was ever published. I felt uncomfortable reading the first chapter because of the present tense he used but kept forging forward hoping the story would blossom into something good. I didn't read the reviews before purchasing this book and now regret it. How can such a badly written book not only become published but also make it to the top 100 bestselling? That is the biggest surprise of all. If such a bad piece of work can be published then I guess anyone can be an author. As an avid reader of all genres of books this one ranks up there with the worst of them. The story was predictable and with nothing new or refreshing it had to rely on the only thing left - the characters which were cartoon mimics of real people. If this story was written by a teenager as a first novel, I would applaud the effort and encourage them to keep writing. The other reviews nailed the problems with this book being a D&D game transcript with no place to go. The target audience of this book deserves better."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I find the premise of the story to be an interesting one, but am not enjoying the quality of the writing. It reads more like an outline than a fully fleshed novel. Or perhaps fan fiction written by a middle schooler. The characters are not well developed, and the story is rather unimaginative and repetitive."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I tried reading this book, but just could not get into it. The storyline itself sounded like maybe it was a new spin on a well known Fantasy formula, but it was just the same old stuff. The writing is amateurish. And just as the other reviewers wrote, the author does more telling than showing.And that makes for a very boring book. (Sorry)I really wanted to like this one, but I just couldn't."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I enjoyed the two books, although I don't care for the cliffhanger at the end of the second book.I think the two star reviews were a little harsh -- this is a decent work and worth reading.It does seem like a D n D lover's book, but isn't like some fanfic. It has an interesting spin on the adventurer in another world that I liked.I didn't like some of the obvious mistakes the main character made, but he improves as the story progresses. I really enjoyed some of the ideas on how an untrained novice might learn how to use magic, and combine that with experience from our world.Update. I finished reading this book in 2010, but it still lingers in my thoughts. This series has some interesting twists that still have me wanting more."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This book sucks, I could go into more detail, but it's not worth my time. Extremely poorly written, reading it was a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I really hope that the author reads the bad reviews on this site because that way he should easily figure it out that he is not meant to write books. It's sad someone let him publish one but it's never too late to stop. I was looking up free books on my nook and I came across this. Just by looking at the title anyone with a common sense can tell that it will be trash. One who would give a title like that to his book already has problems. Now I have to agree with some of the other people who say that this is not a book. It's more like random sentences somehow put in some order and then written down. Like if someone took some random notes of a persons life and then wrote them down in the order of events.. It is almost unbearably dumb. If I didn't know better I would assume that it was written by a 10 year old child who is not very good at creative writing but has a homework to write a book and he has to produce something so he doesn't get an F. The story is not the worst but I just can't see how the author or anyone as a matter of fact thought this was even worth finish reading. I can't even finish reading it. It's almost not even worth free. I wish I was paid to waste my time reading it and even then I would not do it again. And I only got through less than half of it. This is the kind of book that I would expect someone write after waking up from a coma that caused severe brain damage. Please if you value your time on earth do not read even the title."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I read a lot of fiction - classics and sci-fi are my main genres, so maybe I'm a little too \\"heady\\" for this book. I don't know.What I do know is that I was totally willing to give it a chance.I bought this book free as one of the first purchases for my kindle and eagerly dove in. What was the worst it could be? The premise seemed interesting enough, and I was willing to allow that it would be awkward prose, because it was blatantly self-published (Amazon's self-publishing is a vanity press, there is no great deal of financial risk involved or editorial checking-over, either), so I was ready for bad writing.What I wasn't ready for, however, was a main character who seemed alright in the first chapter and then, come chapter 2, his entire brain evacuates his skull.Yes, the prose is awkward in present tense. Yes, the premise has been done. Yes, sometimes it's like reading sand - boring and painful at the same time. But I'll put up with that, to an extent, if the plot and characters seem interesting.Enter chapter two. We learn James has magic. Hooray! James then spends the rest of the day whining that he's hungry (you're a mage now - summon food). He doesn't pick a campsite until it's after dark (what, seriously?). And then, when he's sleeping in a tree he's awoken by the sound of wolves.Okay. Here's where I lost my patience. The wolves (howling = wolves, yes?) are chasing someone. James' thought-process is this: \\"I SHOULD HELP BUT - OH NO I HOPE THEY DON'T CLIMB MY TREE!!\\"Since when do wolves climb trees? Seriously? But he's a scared kid in the night, so I forgive him and I keep reading. He hears screaming, the wolves eat someone, and he goes back to sleep, satisfied that he's not next. Okay. In the morning, he decides to be opportunistic and check on the body - maybe there's something useful hidden there.Dude, if you were so squeamish last night that the wolves might climb your tree and EAT YOU, maybe looking at dead bodies isn't the best idea.He discovers the body is that of a classmate who was also transported to his magic dimension and was running in fear for his life. James' thought at that point: \\"GEE MAN I WISH THERE HAD BEEN SOME WAY TO HELP YOU BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO.\\"I'm sorry. When your main character is so dim that he doesn't understand that wolves do not climb trees and expects his self-centered cowardice to somehow magically make better the death of a classmate who was described as \\"well-liked by everyone\\" and then he just CONTINUES with his day, that means just one thing for me: I've got better things to be reading than this.PASS."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Even for free, it's overpriced.Calling this bad doesn't cut it. Bad implies that it would have had to work at being bad. This? It's just so immature that it comes across as the literary equal of vomit thrown on a page. It doesn't even deserve to be called bad, just ungood. It's a completely unthought out and bland description for a unthought out and bland attempt.Skip this title and watch paint dry for a more rewarding time."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"In a world full of wonderful books, I will not waste my time with this one. It's as if you're at a wonderful desert table with a chocolate fountain and unbelievable cakes and candies, and you choose to eat a stale wafer cookie.It's narrated as if you're watching a old educational video, dialogue that was totally out of style 50 years ago. What is with the weird use of present tense? And the weird absence of use of contractions? What teenage boy says \\"I did not know him well, but he was well liked by everyone.\\"? The whole thing has the effect of distancing the reader from the characters altogether. It's as if all the characters are on very heavy doses of anti psychotic drugs, totally flat affect and super super superficial. I cannot stress enough what rubbish this book is. That there are apparently 5 books in this series already completely boggles the mind. Who buys this rubbish? What moron in the publishing house sent this through?"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The whole point of reading a book instead of playing a computer game or watching a movie, (all of which are storytelling devices) is so that you can allow yourself to be transported by the author's descriptions to another place that is also partly of your own creation. This is especially true in fantasy novels where the world you are transported to is completely different from the one you are used to. This book does not transport you anywhere. It is awkwardly written in present tense, which ruins the story because you get caught up in how a sentence is structured badly instead of being carried away by the story. There is little to no character development and the scenery is just as flat. The plot has some potential, but it gets unbelievable (yes, even for a fantasy novel) at times and the interesting plot twists aren't developed enough. The biggest problem though is the writing style. I read books that are succinct and enjoy them just as much as those that are poetic and flowery, but the sentence structure and tense are obstacles that cannot be overcome."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I must say before I begin, I have never played a role playing game. This series, and I have read the whole series, Felt very much to me like I imagine a role playing game to feel. I love how descriptive the book is. It very well painted a picture of how things played out.James, the main character, I fell in love with. He was loyal, kind, and while always aware of danger always jumped right in with both feet. Something I would hope everybody wishes to see in the hero of a story.To me, each book had a different feel to it. With most series',after a while of the same old monotony I get bored before I've finished them all. Not the case with these. While the writing style didn't really change, the feel of each book always did. Much like life as, James grows in this world he's been transported to, he becomes more confident. He makes friends, and quite a few enemies.It's a Fun read if you read it to it's end. Just having finished the series I find myself wanting to read the whole thing over to see what I had missed the first time. Things click into place the further in the series you read.Get sucked into this world, and have a good adventure! It is well worth your time.Oh and thanks Mr. Pratt for entertaining me. Hurry with that sequal series, I just can't wait!"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I downloaded this as a free book when I first got my kindle to try it out.

Also, the books aren't as expensive as some of the newer fantasy books are."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I've read some of the other reviews on here...everyone seems to hate or love the book...I'm guessing that all of the \\"loved its\\" are coming from the author, his friends, or 12 year old kids.It is really a D&D; script. There is waaaayyy too much attention given to how much he spent on this and that...There really isn't much of a plot throughout the first 95% of the book. Something just starts to emerge at the end.That said...I did enjoy the book. Call me a 12 year old kid....but I liked it. I didn't love it, but at least it kept me reading (most of the other free books on Kindle don't even get that much from me). The little bit of plot at the end was actually enough for me to check if there was a second FREE book to keep reading.In the end...it is probably a 2/5 stars...but the price is right at FREE so I gave it three."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I agree with the 1, 2, and 3-star reviewers. This isn't a well-written book, and there's not much plot.However, despite the many, many problems this book has, I enjoyed skimming for fun parts like James's first encounter with outlaws, and when he has his fortune told, and his encounters with One Eye. Swordplay gets witty repartee like, \\"Ceryn, you cannot win. I am the better swordsman!\\" Slightly later, when James receives a reward: \\"I guess we can't begrudge [a horse] for the man who saved our Warden and helped to terminate the long-standing threat to our community.\\" Yes, the dialogue is amusingly corny.The only reason I even considered reading past the opening of the second chapter was because of the reviews. Thank you, everyone who took the time to explain why you liked or disliked this book. I eagerly awaited certain scenes because they had been so entertainingly mentioned. It was like watching Mystery Science Theater 3000.So my recommendation is to enjoy as many of the reviews as you have time for. Then possibly consider downloading this book . . . if it's still free.Kindle formatting 2/5Batches of dialogue will suddenly have their whole paragraphs indented instead of just the first line. This happens off and on all the way through the book.

I actually couldn't put it down, and read the whole series in a few days! It was a very easy read, but it kept me interested the whole journey.James is from a earth, and ends up in a different world after a supposed job interview. In this new world he discovers you can use magic. From there he makes friends and goes on an amazing journey. There are a lot of battles, and yes he does win most of them by a hair. There are also a lot of kidnappings etc. But overall I give it 5 stars. I have read a TON of fantasy books, and while this series wasn't my absolute favorite, I did find it charming and greatly amusing.

I am having huge issues dealing with the physical grammar of this book. Throughout the first half of this book (I'm exactly half way through now) the author cannot quite figure out which tense he wants to write in .. which is grossly distracting. It also has a number of spots of incorrect word use (which actually renders one sentence literal gibberish .. it just doesn't parse) that I can't quite attribute to publishing typos.Mostly I'm finding the writing is getting in the way of the story/plot .. or lack thereof. Like the other non-five-star reviewers here, I find the yarn basically lacking from the typical literary fantasy fiction standard I'm quite accustomed to reading. Its merely tolerable because it was free; I'd be seriously put out if I'd purchased it."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I downloaded this to my kindle. It looked interesting, and I am always looking for good books for my niece. In all honesty, I find the storyline riveting. I like the hero, and I want good things to happen to him. Because of this, I would give the story 5 stars.What I don't like: (1) I don't like the story in real time. Instead of feel, it should be felt. A story tells of past events; at this the author fails (I would have given him 2 stars for this). (2) I think he could have built up the character more, had he established \\"learning language skills\\" for adaptation. He is instantly able to speak to everyone, and his young sidekick uses slang like: Rats! and Darn! and yet doesn't understand basic words like \\"clue\\". On the other hand, linguistically, and grammatically, Pratt follows the rules (So he gets 3.5 stars as opposed to Myers, who couldn't follow the rules if she had a bucket to carry them).I also think that some good graphics would go a long way to making this book a hit!Basically, I am going to mail this first book to my niece; I think she would enjoy them as much as Percy and the Olympians."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I've been reading fantasy books since I was little. I did like this book. I guess you could say I agree a little with all the previous reviews, hence the 3 star rating. I got this book for free (can't beat that!) and it was a very quick read. It does remind me of an RPG game. Towards the end, all the fights just seem kind of repetitive. I do think the story has potential, though. I'm intrigued enough to buy the second book in the series."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The Unsuspecting Mage is totally and completely unreadable.

This book, will not change your life, but it is entertaining."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I didn't think it was possible for someone to create another world in a genre already filled with wonder that would captivate me so. Mr. Pratt has done so, much to my gratitiude. His main character James is quite believable and the way he works his way through different situations is logical. When James encounters a situation, he solves it the way an American lad would, with ideas and solutions based on our world. So many books have characters form our world going to others and then lose the differences that make them stand out. Mr. Pratt incorporates many different aspects of this world in the way of James' thinking and actions that has a certain appeal.I would recomend this work to anyone who is interested in epic fantasy, or even just a good adventure story. Kudos Brian, kudos"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Maybe I'm just to old but this book just seemed to be rambling on and on never going anywhere. I think the only female interaction was a princess smiled across the room. But D&D never was one of my favorites. I think the comments about the food in every pub they stopped at was about the only sensual appeal to the whole book. As far as the \\"Mage\\" his magical abilities were limited by his lack of insight as he stumbled from one thing to the other. If you have time you want to totally waste then this book is a must read."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This is a great free book. By that I mean- if I had paid for this book I would be angry at the waste of my money, but because it was free I feel fairly ambivalent about it.As many have said, this book reads like an amateur dungeon/game master's idea of what pitfalls he'd like to throw at his characters. The protagonist is \\"mysteriously\\" able to adapt to this new world he finds himself in, and is all kinds of comfortable using magic and following the advice of strange creatures that he meets. Being the Gary Sue that he is, he adopts a street rat named something that sounds Asian (seriously, not every nerd has an Asian culture fetish! Way to perpetuate this), even though no one else in the world seems to be reflecting any kind of Asian culture. Also, somewhere along the line he helps out a bunch of strangers for no apparent reason- he's just a good guy, honest!- and uses the loads of money he can conveniently access to further do good and get to some city. He fights/kills a girl from his world at one point, but tra la la, this doesn't really matter, on with the quest.This book had potential, but it really needed the polish of an editor who was familiar with the gaming world, which I assume the editing staff responsible for this book was not, because then they would have seen some of the gaping holes. Maybe next time, Mr. Pratt should sit around with a case of Mountain Dew and let his friends take a crack at how they would play this character, and it wouldn't come off so sloppy."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This is yet another two star review. I am reading the first two installments because I am a gourmand reader, not a gourmet reader. I will not address critiques I have read that characterize the story as one dimensional D&D adventure. I will simply state that the writing is so bad that it interferes with the story. Misused language. Story goes back and forth between third person present tense (which grates on me anyway) and third person past tense, sometimes in the same sentence. Mr. Pratt, you don't \\"make due,\\" you \\"make do.\\" Please find an editor. I can't believe this was ever edited at all. It wouldn't take that much work to fix these simple issues."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I read this because it was a free kindle download.I have to admit that I enjoyed the story but I had to enjoy it in spite of the writing. It is a complete story and if it went through the editors hands a couple of more times, it would actually be worth paying money for. I found the changes in tense to be very irritating, when in the middle of a sentence the tense would change. The characters sometimes would feel flat and sometimes would actually have depth, it came and went. I found that the book got marginally better toward the end of it as if the writers' skill was increasing a bit. Overall it felt as if the book was written by someone with a good story to tell but that technically they are still developing the writing skills to write it. As a free download I found it fun to read if I could ignore the grammatical irregularities. As a book for sale that you would pay money to read it is extremely sub par.So to give my final thought. I would like to read the next book in the series because the story caught me. I wouldn't pay money for it based on the quality of the writing. I found the $18 price tag absolutely stunning.To the author: I think you have a talent for telling a story. If you could get an editor to work with you to smooth over the grammatical issues, then, I think your books would be worth paying money for."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I bought this book for my android with the kindle app because it was free. Yes, I agree with some of the negative reviews for this book, they make valid points. I however will rate this book higher and give it a 4 star rating because of its simple charm, the story does get a little cheesy at times, but however cheesy it gets Pratt gives enough of everything else that I like, to keep me reading. I have just finished purchasing the entire saga.I would NOT recommend buying these in hardcover or even paperback, but the cheap kindle version's were worth the price to me, that or goto your library and borrow them. They are worth reading because they are very entertaining, but maybe not worth the higher prices of hardcover/paperback.I would compare this as a cheap terry goodkind knock off, with a twist.at least don't pass the first book up, its free in kindle format and will help you decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The coming of age of the protagonist is written in s style that will appeal to all who like role playing games.What this book is: It is an interesting first person present tense tale into an alternate magical world war. The slave owning empire is expanding fast and it is for the good guys to come to the rescue. The only issue is the good guys enter this dangerous world before they have a chance to learn the required survival skills. The 'on the job training' is the fun of the tale. It is a fun coming of age tale where the protagonist is gifted with magic, but on a learning scale (he isn't instantly Gandalf).What the book isn't: It isn't a moping coming of age tale (thankfully) nor about a kid with superpowers above and beyond the opponents. It doesn't switch tenses (past and future) which can turn off some readers.The best author analogy I have for the writing is Robert Asprin's tales. But it is a poor analogy as Unsuspecting mage isn't 'slapstick' nor as light as Arprin's tales... It is a book well worth the time to read.Neil"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"i downloaded the book as a free book for my kindle. I found it interesting enough to purchase the entire series. Is the book/series predictable? Yes. It is an easy to read, is to pick up book. If you need more fantasy/sci-fi or more intellect stimulation don't buy the book or the series and get Tolkien instead. But if you like book that is easy and where you don't have to think about the plot etc, get it, and read it."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This book had no depth or character development the plot is pretty simplistic and never develops much. The narrative perspective is odd and distracting.If this was a first draft written by 14yr I would probably say it was great but anyone who is as old and claims to have read as much as the author should have known better to release a book in this rough of state.I will not be reading any of the sequels."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Okay. I think I am being perfectly fair when I sum up this book as simply \\"readable\\". I found the lack of writing ability hard to get into, but I hate to not finish a book so I soldiered on. I'm going to break this review into some key points.====Awkward Writing====There are many places in the book where the writing is awkward and in dire need of review. Despite what the \\"five star\\" reviews have said, rampant errors detract noticeably from the enjoyability of any novel. When I read a novel, I like to be taken away to another world, and strangely worded sentences and poor writing ruin that immersion. I appreciate what the author is trying to do here, not overburden the reader with details, leaving much open to your imagination, but unfortunately it comes across as very dry and \\"matter of fact\\" reading. Some of the sentences are not formed in a way that sounds natural or flows, so it can come across as jilted, or sounding somewhat like a police report instead of a novel. Examples that in my opinion seem weird:\\"Which surprises him as it had only been mid-morning when he and Dave departed the bus on Commercial Avenue.\\"\\"But not wanting to consume the last of his food, he sighs and leaves it where it is[...]\\"\\"Miko silently vows silently to himself not to let James down again as he races after his friend.\\"There are spots in the novel where I counted 5 or more sentences in a row starting with \\"they\\". Very choppy. It's like no effort was put into the quality of the text. Even just having a few family members read through and give constructive criticism would probably have been enough to alleviate some of these extremely basic problems and improve the book significantly.====Awkward Dialogue====James is an eighteen year old boy (or around there, I think that's his age). James doesn't sound like a real person, let alone an eighteen year old boy. I know he reads a lot of books and doesn't have a ton of friends, but its just weird.\\"I'm having to leave town for awhile and I wish to withdraw two hundred gold pieces.\\"\\"Steady boy, don't let the past rattle you.\\"\\"Shall we go find him?\\"Miko is 14 and grew up on the streets without parents. When we first meet Miko, the author does put in a subtle effort to give his dialogue a rough edge, but within a chapter or two Miko is chattering with the providence of a well educated noble. He (and other characters) also use some modern colloquialisms like \\"did a number on you\\". Several of them also say \\"Oh my God\\". It would have been nice if the author spent a little bit of time developing a \\"voice\\" for the people of this alternate world. Everyone in this book sounds exactly the same, from James, to Corbyn, to an aged scholarly librarian, to city guards and young street thugs.====James & Miko====James and Miko spend a lot of time together, but I never get the feeling there is a bond formed between them. I feel like James is very cold and uncaring towards Miko, despite numerous situations where Miko has proven not only his loyalty, but usefulness. We remember Miko's downfalls, like getting captured or falling asleep, because James makes such a big deal out of it. James repeatedly makes stupid decisions, or throws them into dangerous situations for no reason but receives no criticism. Miko, however, consistently proves not only his loyalty, but his usefulness, and James continues to chide him. After draining Miko's power to save some people, he leaves Miko, barely alive on the ground while he goes to check on people he barely knows. I found the relationship awkward and straining because James is always harping on about the \\"right\\" thing to do, but doesn't treat Miko much better then a random stranger (and often, worse!) We are made to feel like James is doing Miko this big favor by even allowing him to come along, when in reality without Miko James would probably be dead several times over.====Who is James?====What motivates him? We know he's nerdy and quiet and likes books and being alone. We know his parents died and his grandparents raised him and he is putting off getting a job, although it isn't really clear if it's typical teenage laziness or social anxiety. He bursts into tears when realizing he let a real-world acquaintance die (and later admits he wouldn't have done anything, even if he knew), but only shows the smallest pangs of homesickness for his family back home, and never shows any social awkwardness around all the new and strange people he meets (even when he is naked in a tub around other people, and a woman walks in! Not even a blush or mention of any qualms or thoughts.). Oh yeah, he blushes when he sees a pretty princess! But really, we have no idea why James does anything he does in this book except because it is \\"right\\" or \\"good\\" or maybe just because there is nothing better to do.====Magic====It's nice that the author tries to convey James' introduction to magic in a careful and controlled way. It's realistic that spells tax him and over time he is able to do harder spells as he gains experience. It makes sense that James does not want to abuse magic for personal gain. I just do not understand why he doesn't practice or try to think of small, useful spells in his spare time, like lock picking, concealing identity, noise amplification or some kind of magic warning system (James imagines a bubble expanding a small distance around the camp. If someone passes through it, it will make a loud noise.). You know, try to hone the only skill that keeps them alive!====Repetitive====Spoiler alert! Here is how the book goes:Step 1: James encounters dangerStep 2: James executes a spell powerful enough to extinguish the enemy, but he barely clings to lifeStep 3: Time is taken to recuperate, usually in a camp or inn where he encounters filthy conditions or overpays for the roomStep 4: Eat something If staying at an inn: Poultry and gravy, meat and gravy, some kind of stew, and usually a loaf of fresh or stale bread, depending on the inn's quality. If at camp: Use aiming spell to spear a rabbit or fish, cook and eat.Step 5: James will use an orb of light, or his compass, to help them find a person/place/thing, and the process repeats.Over time, the battles get bigger and more dangerous.Once again, I see what the author is trying to do. Make the book exciting by constantly having battles and fight scenes. Unfortunately, the battles are very predictable and often don't develop the story. After the first 2 or 3 times James saves a random person in distress to further the cause of goodness, we KNOW that's what he's going to do, every time. Even when there is a whole group of mounted soldiers, we know James will help out and survive. Many of the battles do absolutely nothing to advance the plot or grow James as a character.====No plot====What is the plot? If I had to tell someone what this is about I have no idea what I'd tell them, except, \\"It's about a boy who gets unsuspectingly sent to a world where he can use magic.\\" What is he doing there? He isn't really trying to become more powerful. He isn't trying to go home. He doesn't even try to learn about magic and it's role in the world. A stranger tells him people don't like mages, but that's literally ALL we know about them in the context of this environment. I guess you could say the plot is trying to find the origin of the amulet, but so little progress is made in this regard it's hard to really say that's it. This book has no climax or resolution.====Ratings====I think it is deplorable that the author has gone through such a great effort to boost the ratings on this book. Take a look at \\"Karl\\" and read his other reviews - It is obviously the author under another account! Every single review is within a short time-span and tells readers to go read this book! There are other reviewers like that also. I don't like this because it is a poor reflection of the actual quality of the book. Thankfully I got this book for free. If the second book were free I might skim through it to see if anything happens, but 13$ is crazy when you are expecting to get another novel of this quality.====Conclusion: It's Readable====Although it may sound like it, I didn't actually *hate* this book. There isn't anything there to dislike or like. It's like another poster said: A glass of water. I don't love water, I don't dislike water, it's just plain and clear and kind of flavorless. I could see it being a good \\"out loud\\" bedtime read for children. The fight scenes present constantly would provide ample entertainment for a young mind, and by speaking it aloud you could add inflections and voices for each character making them a bit more distinct. I do not recommend this book for a typical fantasy fan or avid reader, because the nonexistent character and plot development as well as the overall poor quality of the book will leave you wanting. I could see this being a good first draft, with someone going through, rewriting each chapter, correcting errors, removing unnecessary things, and adding stuff to build up the characters and plot.Sorry for the long review. I was compelled to just leave a terse comment or two with a one star rating, but since the high reviews are so badly skewed I wanted to make sure people thoroughly understood the places where this novel needs improvement."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. There was hope for the characters but the plot was weak and the writing was exceptionally poor. One does not put present and past tense in one sentence. I was disturbed by the fact that a young man from our world could so easily involve himself in murder without emotional repercussions. The book portrayed itself as a book for youth and yet the violence was almost matter of fact as when Miko disemboweled the guard.Neither character appeared to be overly concerned. Episodes did not occur in a logical manner and important descriptions between events were left out -characters were left shallow and lacking in emotion that readers could identify with and empathize. I never was certain as to why the character was there or for what important purpose for far too many pages. Too much of the writing was immature and lacked strong editing. Perhaps the author should read more of Brooks and Modesitt in order to get a handle on Fantasy. I downloaded this book from Amazon Kindle and will be much more discriminating in the future."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This book is an adventure everyone should take. You immediately get involved with James and his life. He starts as an average teen with no cares. His grandfather nags him about finding a job and make something of himself. The job he finally looks into leads him into an adventure he could never imagine in his wildest dreams. One minute he is just an average teen, the next he walks through a door and his world as he knows it ends and an amazing adventure begins. This book is a journey towards manhood for James. The friends he makes, the people he encounters, and the amazing adventures he has on his fantastic journey makes this a book that any age can enjoy. I couldn't wait to see what happened next. I'm 66 and don't normally read this type of book but I'm glad I did and can't wait to start the second book in this series. I think it is better than Harry Potter."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This is actually the first review I've ever written on Amazon. I read a ton (averaging three books a week, down from six), but have never felt the need to write a review unitl I saw that this book actually received poor reviews. WHAT?? This book was totally entertaining from start to finish, and a great light read. I picked it up because it sounded interesting and it was free. Within the week, I had purchased, downloaded and read every other book in the series. I can't wait for the next one. Anyone who has ever had interest in Dungeons & Dragons, magic, coming of age, friendship, fighting evil, a modern man becoming lost in an earlier time, etc. will love this book."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"...and characterization. This book has no flow whatsoever. Some of the other reviews have it pegged... It is an rpg module. The character follows blindly off into a new world, rarely questioning things, not knowing where he is going, but seeming to know at every step where he must go. It sounds like James thought that the plot was unrefined and predictable as well.It's not bad enough that the fight scenes are predictable, but the dialogue is as well. It is always the same... Character x says something, character y says I think it is this way because of this, character x says, I can see that point. There are so many literary atrocities associated with this book that I can't list them all, unless someone is going to pay me to do it, because it is just too painful to relive the reading of this book. Mr. Pratt just does not have the writing skills to pump out an interesting and hearty read although I have to give him props, he did create something so awful that I could not put it down because I wanted to see just how bad it was all the way to the end. By the time the \\"dungeon master\\" walked James through Disneyland in a Mickey Mouse suit, I was ready to poke something into my eye."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"As far as plot for a new fantasy goes, this book stands out well. But that's all this book has in its favor. There is very little character development, and James (the protagonist) lacks a lot as a hero. He can't be bothered to shout \\"climb a tree!\\" or \\"over here!\\" as one of his high school acquaintances is attacked (and killed) by wolves during his first night in a fantastic world - yet we're to believe he is a seasoned role-playing gamer and well-read in the realm of fantasy literature. In fact, James seems very proud of having read over a thousand fantasy novels. Oddly enough, the author makes the same boast on the back of the book... For an avid reader of SF and Fantasy to read one thousand books in twenty-five years seems reasonable (an average of forty books a year), but for a high-school student like James to have read the same number is far less credible. It seems clear that James is really meant to be the author, Brian Pratt, as he would picture himself. However, some of James' actions are so far out of character that I have difficulty with my suspension of disbelief. After all, a boy his age who finds himself in a fantasy world with his background should know better than to start killing animals for food right away. He learns early in this new world that all sorts of things can talk, yet doesn't wait to see if the rabbit he kills is more than just an animal. Later, James is very charitable and soft-hearted in many ways, but he never expresses the slightest thought of remorse or regret with killing people. He often jumps into a fight with \\"bandits\\" and slays them with his magic without ever learning if they really are bandits and murderers. As Mr. Pratt writes his story, James is always justified about his killings, both of animals and people. It is hard to conceive of such a situation. Wouldn't a child of this world who believes in the concepts of \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" (as James explains to his sidekick) think twice about so much killing?James' sidekick, Miko, is a street orphan who seems to have an advanced vocabulary and relatively few street-smarts. Miko often speaks more like a college professor thans as a poor, uneducated orphan would in a medieval fantasy setting. I'm not referring to the content of Miko's speech, just his vocabulary and grammar. And for a street brat to be so open, honest, and forthcoming is unusual - he trusts strangers immediately and completely to the point where James repeatedly scolds Miko not to tell their business to strangers.This book is written in the literary present tense, and that alone is a bit distracting. Most of the fantasy works I've read seem to be written in the past tense. Maybe this is one of the reasons I found it difficult to immerse myself in this book, because the plot really was well-conceived.The biggest problem with this work is the sad lack of editing. There are so many misspellings (the word \\"lightning\\" is only spelled correctly once in the whole book, even though it is used many times - always spelled \\"lightening,\\" for example). The author includes many run-on sentences, and doesn't use commas correctly. Often he includes commas where they don't belong and doesn't use them where they are needed. Mr. Pratt also doesn't seem to know how to use an apostrophe. He constantly mistakes \\"its\\" for \\"it's\\" and vice-versa, as well as \\"their\\" and \\"they're.\\" His dedication refers to his students - I truly pray he doesn't teach English!All said, I really enjoyed the plot but wish that the complete lack of proper writing skills didn't distract me from the story. I will read more of James's adventures, if only to see if the writing style and grammar skills improves.EDIT: I tried to upgrade this review to three stars - I'm extremely impressed with Mr. Pratt - not only did he take the time to respond to my review, he also emailed me and explained that he is self-published and had no editor! Thank you, Mr. Pratt! I'll continue to read your future writings, with pleasure!"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I am on book six of the series. The plot becomes more involved as the books go along. The books do read as if Pratt is a dungeon master making up the story by rolling dice as he goes (almost hear the dice roll on the table top). Some of the twists in the plot were predictable, but this is a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Imagine a 15-year-old nerd recording his role playing game and then publishing it without any rewriting, editing, or even a literate adult's proof reading. That, in Pratt's terms, is what you have to \\"make due [sic] with\\" in this book. I found the lack of editing so frustrating it was hard to pay attention to the mediocre story."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"So I am all of maybe 10 pages into this book and I just can't force myself to read it. It is written like a trashy romance novel. The dialog is very poor, and the narrative bland and stilted. I believe I written essays in middle school with more pep than this."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Disclaimer: I got this book for free, albeit, from the looks of it, I probably got it free from Smashwords.When I first got this book, I will freely admit that I got it and was curious because it was free, was within a genre I knew I would like and thought I couldn't fail very much if I keep within a genre I had like. I will tell you right now, I am so so wrong on the quality of the book that if this had been the first free book I have ever gotten, it would have been my very last.Summary of the book and it's series: Boy got pulled out of his comfort zone, forced to grow up quick and become hero material, while finding his way back into comfort zone - but was never to be the same again.What is wrong with this series:- Firstly, it is laden with a lot of cliches. I can handle cliches when it is well set up but not like this. Firstly, it is completely fluffed up with inconsequential things, from the description of the trees or grasses and so on, to the somewhat redundant thoughts of the main character in the midst of a mundane, seemingly \\"normal\\" action. Yes, I recognise it can be hard without editors and all. However, considering how I have read enough free authors by now, I have come to realise that editing is hard, yes, but it is not impossible.Considering an \\"interview\\" that I read via a link from the series' website, I can only hazard a guess that the author did not seriously edit the book because he couldn't care how the readers felt while reading it.Then you think about the cliches that were given some thought but was never explored, e.g. the flawed hero approach. It fell so flat that the character came off as 2d.- The storyline is so full of contradictions. James is such a smart and well read boy, figuring out magic and survival skills quite early into the journey. However, at various points through out the book, he not only failed to utilise the magic he knew, he fumbled at common sense thoughts. As someone pointed out, seeing Miko all gagged up, he still walked into the room and just got smacked around.What pissed me of the most was the scene where he cried over this schoolmate of his that he left to die because he was a coward, apologising for being a coward and all. In the first few sections, James had no hint of care or concern for Seth for being missing. Yet him being shred to pieces caused him despair, depression and guilt? Shouldn't that \\"sensitive side\\" be there from the start then? and the crying itself just pissed me off in general, simply because of the focus on that action that generated nothing for the character for me. E.g. show some form of evolution for the character? fleshing out of the character?- Character fleshing: as others have pointed out, many characters are quite 2d. Even the main character. And, as above, characters are full of contradictions too. Life's so easy and smooth sailing for the main character. Sure, James your \\"typical\\" flawed hero, but how come he got kidnapped so often and still suddenly got saved from a sudden spark of intelligence within him or others? how did money just dropped from the sky from kind people? seriously? no one likes mages, yet the first person who met him gratefully gave him 1000gold from a bounty?- the \\"plot\\" or lack of it drove me nuts. it's gotten to a point where I am barely skimming the pages so I could find the exciting bits or maybe some answers to my questions... and also an indicator of when and where the book will reveal the answers to my questions (seeing how this is meant to be a series). I will explain why later, but what I am trying to get at is this: there's only so much sleep, stew and inns I can read about, on top of fights. Alot of things were not explained that could be explored further for the sake of the story, yet it wasn't so that the character could \\"respect\\" people's privacy and get on with his sleep/stew/inn/fight. hell, even the fights kept dragging out for a bit without much explanation as to the hows and whys. 50% through this book, james has been smacked around a few times yet the only thing that could have gotten him into trouble is because this dodgy lord found him in his grounds. so... what? give up some sort of bait for us to want to know why?!?!- there simply was not much bait in the whole storyline in general to keep me from wanting to read more.at the end of the day, the main bait in the whole storyline was the idea behind it. I liked the idea, part of the reason why I downloaded it. I rushed through the book thinking that, perhaps, I would start to like it more halfway down the line. but at 50%, I am despairing, and then I scoured around the net to tell me something positive about this book and I found despairingly few reliable sources of delight. So, I am going to put this down at 50% with some regret. I have disliked books before, but I have rarely ever stopped reading part ways and this is going to be one of those.To Mr Pratt, this review has a one star (at all) not because Amazon wouldn't let me put a no-star (which I had, at some point, wanted to use for other things). I applaud the idea, even if it's not fantastic or original, but I love storylines relating to that idea. however, your writing skills needs to expand further and an editor will surely help. Even if the editor is your wife, kids, family - someone who can tell you where it's simply not working.However, as a hint, I will say this: 2-3 years for the whole 7 books in the series is simply ridiculous. You may think you are saving the readers from having to wait, but it also means sacrificing the quality of the story to suit something else. There is a reason why even the quickest of books can take up to a year to go through the full process of thoughts to prints. Do not mock the process but take that hint."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I liked the concept of the book however, the author lacks the skill to keep the readers attention for either the storyline. Read only if you are desperate for fantasy style adventure."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I tried to read and like this. The basic idea sounded good, a teenager fumbles his way to becoming a wizard in an alternate world, BUT the thing is written in the present tense. Personally, I hate that. You read lines like \\"He washes his hands\\" or \\"As he walks along, he stubs his toe and he falls.\\" It's like reading a narration, and it's unpleasant in the extreme. I found the dialog to be weak, I thought the characters were a little flat and all in all, I thought it read like something from an inexperienced 7th grader might have written for a school project."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I read this book from another source. I can see why some love it and some hate it. For the first it has action in every chapter, then moves on to more action. For the second it is not a classic fantasy that spends 500 pages developing characters and their universe toward some massive assault on evil.This is a first book that already pleases many. It has readers. I would normally give three or four stars, here I give five to counterbalance the hating snobs. Consider my vote \\"I Love It\\" because the author was brave enough to start engaging his art and audience.Analyze what you as a reader enjoy. If you want a basic universe that is developed by revelation rather than exposition give this a try -- it's free. If you enjoyed reading James Bond you may enjoy this. If you are bored by detailed counts of the hair on a character's toes, you may find this interesting.If you are a seventh grade English teacher; grab your red or blue pencil and go somewhere else. This book is not for you. Don't beat on a book someone else might like because the writer is not proficient in mere mechanics. Don't try to limit a reader's choices to what your myopic, fine art professors demanded. Leave this page. Don't be a tool of repression for a beginner's art. Come back after the third or fourth series he writes. Try again in ten years. This story teller is more likely to develop or buy editing skills than constipated editors are likely to entertain a large audience. Go back to your cave and work on your own masterpiece that will never be published.Yes the book has flaws, but the author isn't writing for draconian rule-mongers. Let him serve his audience and grow. He will mature as he writes more, and his audience will demand more if they are satisfied by his initial efforts. He and his loyal readers don't need to raise their hands and ask your permission to act. Thank God."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I'm still trying to get through this one, but the writing isn't very good. In addition to some distracting formatting problems, there are glaring errors, such as ending a paragraph in a comma and continuing the sentence containing the character's dialogue in the next one.Usually, I can get past those if the story is good. However, my main problem with this book is the speech. It sounds stilted and more suited to an English class essay than to dialogue in a book. Oddly enough, while the overall style seems immature, the manner in which the eighteen-year old protagonist speaks seems way beyond his years, even ignoring the fact that no contractions or idioms/slang are used.I'm still trying, but reading a leisure time book shouldn't be a 'trying' experience.Update: I've stopped trying to read this book. And, on a side note, I noticed that 'someone' gave the majority of the one star reviews an unhelpful vote, while at the same time, the glowing 'reviews' have received helpful votes. I think potential readers should look at those votes with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Really. really bad writing - the whole thing was written in the present tense. \\"He gets up. He drinks some ale.\\" I couldn't finish the book."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This book has an interesting premise, however it fails to deliver a story that carries the reader away into another land. The primary problem is that is does not use past or future tense. Also, several times words have been confused such as effect and affect. Like several other reviews have said, it sounds like a transcription of a D&D game that has been thrown together into a \\"book\\" without any proofreading or editing to make it interesting. The author clearly has a nice idea, but a horrible implementation."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The glowing 5 star reviews are likely fake. I'm not sure I'll even finish it. The plot is pretty standard (\\"boy tricked into entering a magical world\\"), but the writing is not very good. An actual quote: \\"His eyes start to water and can barely breathe.\\" Another: \\"They stroll down the street eating their tarts, when James sees coming down the street toward them, a group of boys a little older than Miko.\\" I realize the author self-published, but I think he should at least find a literary friend to proofread his work. I'm just glad I got a free e-book and not a hardcover!"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I downloaded the first free edition to read on my iPad during whatever free time I could find. Mr. Pratt does a fine job of weaving an adventure together for a young man that did not expect to be put into one. I played AD&D for years - over 25 years ago - and I still enjoy references back to that RPG. It is obvious to any fellow gamers that this is based on that game, but it is still an easy and enjoyable read. I will be looking forward to the next books in the series."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"My fellow readers, do not be fooled by these ungodly high review scores that people are posting here. This book is terrible. The plot is about as herky-jerky as a zombie in Dawn of the Dead it ramble it stutters and it moans, but dones nothing useful.If you want a fantasy book of this quality go to your local high school, find a creative writing class, ask the students to write a story about magic and you will most likely get at least 5 submissions better than this. It musst have been a slow day for the publishing company when they let this slide through. It's too bad several hundred trees had to die for this book to be made... poor trees.Also, you will notice on some other fantasy books a reviewer by the name or 'Karl' wrting a two sentence blurb about nothing, then highly recommending this book to everyone. It's a slap in the face to the real authors to have to put up with him doing that. I am guessing 'Karl' is really this books author and he needs tohe book sales.No wonder sine this book is terrible. Don't be fooled by the over-hyped reviews of this authors friends. This book is garbage."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"All of the one star reviews have covered all the relevant points in regards to a reading of the book. I should have read these reviews before wasting time downloading. Like others, I am happy I didn't spend money on it. However, a few reviewers feel the need to congratulate Mr. Pratt on having at least been published. Then they wonder about what the publisher was thinking. Let me clear this up for you. Mr. Pratt is Mr. Pratt's publisher. It says so right on his own website. Apparently, he's his own editor as well, and he knows no more about editing than he does about writing. It is hard enough to find good books these days without free crap like this getting in the way of the search. If it was possible to give this book negative stars, I would do so."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The author obviously didn't take any sort of literature or creative writing class. (If he did, then whomever the professor was didn't do a very good job teaching him how to write a decent piece of novel)This book maybe OK for pre-teens who never read any fantasy novel before, but if you had any sort of experience with fantasy novels, stay far far away from this novel series. You're welcome.The story just doesn't develop very well and characters are very unattractive, and there is zero development in terms of characterization. Everything in this novel is just WAY too convenient. (I mean, James meets the right people at the right moment and knows exactly what to do with every situation. Got no money? BAM, and suddenly a generous forest guard who can speak perfect English with heart of gold appears and gives him 1200 golds which is equivalent of 3 year worth of salary in that world. Need a sidekick? BAM and you see a city boy who had a harsh life and astoundingly honest and diligent and will die for the main character whom he just met.)I agree that this is not a novel, but a TRPG (D&D;) script written in novel form. The author obviously want to project his ideal man as a main character 'James', but it is just painfully bad.If you want to read a fantasy novel that actually gives great character development and 'plausible', read Twelve Kingdoms."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I downloaded this book because I thought the storyline sounded fun. I forced myself to read 4 chapters, hoping that it would improve. Other reviewers thought it read like a D&D Campaign. I've never had the opportunity to play D&D so I can't compare it to that. Personally, I thought it was like one of the old \\"Choose Your Own Adventure\\" books without the fun of choosing what happens next. I feel bad for those of you that paid for the book. I downloaded it free for my Kindle and am really glad I didn't pay good money for a bad book."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Very hard to follow. Very choppy written.Rough around the edges. The story has potential given a few more rewrites and thought for a more smoother flow of story."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Well, I was really looking forward to reading this, it had me written all over it, \\"do you love books? Become the hero of your own story\\" it was a bookworms dream. Sadly it fell short of the mark, yes it had all the right ideas and by the book but it lacked draw and imagination. I couldn't picture the world I couldnt see myself as any of the characters and it bored me.This could be because the author always used third person view for the main character, it made it impersonal and didn't feel as though you were part of the story.Sadly this is one of the books I never finished, I couldn't, so maybe it does get better but life's not worth reading boring books."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This story could be fantastic! It was adventurous, imaginative and definitely entertaining. HOWEVER, the tense in which it is written, while described by another reviewer as \\"current tense\\" and \\"taking some getting used to\\" is the least of its issues. I wouldn't mind the tense at all if it was consistent. But the inconsistencies were frustrating and I often felt I had to go back and re-read a section, or sentence, to be sure that I did indeed, read what I thought I read.On top of the tense issues, which overall were distracting but not debilitating, the spelling errors and lack of proper punctuation were truly disturbing. Some examples being the term \\"jam-packed\\" being set forth as \\"jambed pact\\" as well as several run-on sentences, or complete non-sentences which changed tense midway.I was left to wonder if an editor was ever hired to proof the release. If so, the money was wasted. If not, the effort was wasted by the author. An editor would have encouraged better character development, recommended less repetitious (and completely obvious) scenarios, eliminated hundreds of pages of wasted descriptions that got the reader (and characters) nowhere, and may have allowed for a better story overall. He also would have eliminated the plethora of run-on sentences much like the one you just read.I want to read the second book because the story took me on an entertaining adventure to basically get me nowhere and this book was, in all actuality, the set-up for a conclusion in the next book(s). There was no neat tidy ending here (not even close) the story just basically stops in the middle of a scenario. The author definitely hooked me with the promise of what could be a decent story but, I don't know if I am willing to brave another full novel's worth of the frustration that accompanied reading this one."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I'm surprised by the poor reviews here. I purchased this book on my Nook Color and I enjoyed it immensely. Some people may be put off by the style of writing used by the author, but I loved it. This first book is, in essence, a first person tale of guy learning to cope with a crazy situation. I was personally enthralled by the story. I couldn't put it down. Once I finished it, I promptly ordered the next book. And so on, until I finished the series. Very good story here, that sets up a very good series."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I normally do not write reviews on books, but I felt this needed it. I agree the editing was terrible. I enjoyed the plot. Someone said they enjoyed that this did not have multiple plot lines. I thought it unusual that the character acutually accepted what was happening to him. He does not try to change the world but work with it. I am looking forward to buying the remaining books. I can\`t wait to find out what happened to all of the minor characters and of course the main one."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The use of magic is totally different from anyother form i have ever heard of. Pratt is good with incorporating adventure and back story to make a good read for anyone. I really enjoyed this book"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"What killed me was the writing. \\"He goes here. And he does this. Then he says something. And when he is done speaking, he moves to there.\\" Both the tense and the phrasing are TERRIBLE throughout the book.That said, it's an interesting story. I enjoyed the D&D; references things to like a character's encumbrance when deciding how much gold to carry. It's just a hard slog through a badly-written book."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I don't normally write reviews but I am writing this one in response to several others who state that the author is writing his own reviews. I gave the author five stars. For writing a book that was simple but yet an enjoyable read, that I found to be entertaining. I don't always require a book to be deep and have plots and sub plots like a Robert Jordon Book. Sometimes a simple read can be a great read. I would like to thank the author for offering up the first book of his series for free. I don't know many authors that will give you their first book for free with the risk of never making a dime. I will continue to buy the rest of this series. If you enjoy and simple and fun read then this book is for you. If you are looking for the answers to life, the universe and everything ...... The answer is 42."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I have to say, I only picked up this book since it was offered for free on Amazon, but I really do find the story compelling enough to purchase the next book in the series.For the detractors on the author's style of writing, it honestly threw me for a bit at first, but it's written in a current-tense style that really grew on me. The only other time that I've seen this particular style is with John Updike (and no i'm not saying this author is the next John Updike of Fantasy, but if you don't like this style you're probably not going to like tales of Rabbit either). If however, you would like to see a piece of truly atrocious writing, please look up \\"Time Traveler's Academy\\". The Unsuspecting Mage shines in comparison.As for the story/plot elements I really did enjoy how things were put together, but do agree with the other reviewers that some things did stretch credulity (even with this being a fantasy book). As far the comments that this appears to be a play by play of a D&D; adventure, I LIKE THAT!. Brings back good memories.In summary, if you're looking for a book that is a fun read, definitely give this a go."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I'm glad authors can self publish & find their audience using ebooks. I'm not going to vituperate a self published author for making it easy to find out if I like their work.This book inspired me to learn how to purge books from my kindle archive. Go to amazon.com/myk and use the \\"actions\\" pull down on the right to make sure a book no longer shows up in the list."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"James, a young adult who likes to read fantasy novels and play role games is transported to an alternate medieval universe. He is given a spell book and discovers his magical powers. Later on, he loses the book, is given an amulet and starts to move from clue to clue in order to figure out its meaning.This is clearly a D&D; adventure, written in curiously stilted way. \\"He does that, he sees that, he moves to the left.\\"There are a lot of very minor characters (farmers, soldiers, merchants, bards, thieves etc.) who disappears almost as soon as they are introduced. The plot moves from deed to deed or from clue to clue without any depth.There is no reflection on different cultures, manners, values or ethics. James is transported and instantly understands what to do and when, without putting a wrong foot forward. He does not even mind being there, does not miss the \\"real\\" world, his friends and family. He also has the bad habit of mouthing off his beliefs, as unsubtle as they are, every chance he gets. I found this unnecessary at best, distracting at most.To cap it all off, the book ends on a cliffhanger and there are at least five more volumes to follow. No thanks!For a similar plot, done the right way, I recommend the \\"Guardians of the Flame\\" series by Joel Rosenberg."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"As everyone says, since this was a freebie so I decided to give it a try. The storyline sounded interesting. Unfortunately, the characters were very 2 dimensional. The main charactor, James, seemed to just meander along from place to place with no goal or idea except to do \\"what feels right\\". Other than that all he and Miko does is fight off bad guys and eat one meal after another.With lots of irrelevant observations.The other annoying thing was, although for young adults, the writing was so simplistic that if not for all the fighting would be more for an elemantary student. Talk about dummying down for the reader! Definately no challenge.Needless to say I will not be reading anymore from this series and probably won't give the writer another try."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Well, since it was free, at least I don't have to feel cheated ;-) I definitely won't be buying any more in the series. I thought, with so many published books under his belt, that the author must be fairly talented, but his talent must lie elsewhere. I won't repeat most of the things that other reviewers have mentioned aside from the present tense of the book. I found it extremely distracting, and actually started forcing it into the past tense in my head.I agree with the other reviewers that this reads like a walkthrough of an AD&D; session with very little character development, strange/stupid reactions and lack of questioning of various events and situations, no reflection of previous events, and repetitive battle scenes."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I was not sure when I started reading this as the use of mainly the present text in the third person is unusual but after a few pages I no longer noticed this and was engrossed in the story. Although I think this is a \\"teen/young person\\" book and I am far from this I found it enjoyable. One of the problems with any book that involves magic is where to start the author usually has the reader make a huge leap of imagination and there is a world of magic. This book overcomes this rather neatly with the hero of the story James a fairly normal American teenager being pressured into going for a job interview when he gets there he has to read a book on magic and then go through a door for an interview. On going through the door he is suddenly in a medieval world where magic works but because he has read the book he knows how to start. I am always disappointed when a series cannot be easily read as a standalone and this one is like that as it ends with a new direction to go in. Although not too graphically violent there is a surprisingly high \\"body count\\" and although not much is very original it does hold together as a story and found that I could visualise the characters and locations for me always an essential. I do not know if I will read all of the series but will read the next one."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This book was purportedly a novel, but was written as one short story followed by another by another with little suspense and no use of subplot. While entertaining at moments, it never fulfilled the promise of its premise nor, in fact, of being a novel at all."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"Given that this was the first e-book I downloaded (and free!), I had very low expectations. I enjoyed the plot and initially thought the author's detailed descriptions enhanced my enjoyment. However, halfway through the book I mostly skipped the descriptive details (unless it was explaining a fight or magic) and looked for quotation marks; not exactly the emotion you want to have while diving in! I would still recommend reading it if you are into fantasy, although this part of the saga isn't dramatically fantasy-like."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"This one started out with a good premise but the writing style and the linear nature of the plot didn't live up to its promise. It reads just like a gaming script which makes it a bit stilted and occasionally jars. I finished it hoping it would get better as the author got more practice but it didn't - I wouldn't recommend it and won't be going further with the series."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":".....and this book reads like it was written for a high school English class. Worst book I've read in a long time.I like lots of books, especially ones written by Robin Hobb, George Martin, and Stephen Donaldson to name but three. These books were well written. This one was not. Just wondering - how many of you are still in high school yourselves?"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"The plot is okay (albeit deritvative), but the execution is dire.Honestly I've read fanfic written by 12 year olds with better pacing. The author cannot write dialog to save his life. His \\"magic system\\" is \\"rhyme and concentrate\\" and his action scenes are flatter than his dialog.How anyone can seriously rate this at 5 stars I really do not know (but I have my suspicions)AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!"},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is engaging, and you really get to know and care about the main characters or dislike the evil characters. I highly recommend this book. The ratings on this book are all over the place, so you will just have to decide for yourself whether to read it or not. I got it for free on amazon Kindle so, there really isn't anything to lose but some time. Some of the one and two star ratings are simply cruel and unmerited. I don't understand why some have such a dire need to tear others down. I am sure none of them could possibly write a story as well as this one. There is no need to be cruel, either you like a book or you don't. I did. I am now starting book two."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"A worthy read.

Now I want to buy \\"Fires of Prophecy\\", the next book in this series."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I know many have rated it low because they do not like how closely it resembles different D&D; possibly story lines and the D&D; world; however, that is exactly the reason why I enjoyed this book so much. I enjoyed the idea of a kid as \\"nerdy\\" as I was being transported to a world where those rules seemed to apply, where he suddenly had the ability to develop the power of a Mage (i'm always a mage lol). I LOVED this idea. I love how the story focuses on the journey rather than the destinations. It's refreshing. I love how the characters develop slowly over the course of this book and the following one. I enjoyed how this book ended perfectly setting up the next but not leaving me feeling cheated or with too many questions up in the air. I loved reading about the displays of magic, and the feeling of never being able to quite relax but being on edge.So yes, its a lot like D&D;, but that is what I enjoyed so much about it."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"No regrets reading it because it was free but not sure why I bothered.There was nothing to take away from this book. It was just a play-by-play of battles with a few lines of speech thrown in for good measure. The narrator's voice also became very grating very quickly. I disagree with others who say that present tense was the problem because it was more than that. I can't quite point my finger on it. Like a distant, omniscient grandfather figure used to narrating Left 4 Dead matches. I ended up wanting to off myself.I'm giving this two stars, and that's only because it was free."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"I loved the book. Being a geek, gamer, fantasy, book lover myself, I was unable to put this ebook down. He explains situations and character thought as the story goes from the characters perspective. The development of each character is great and you begin to love each and every one of them. Good adventure, good plot, it most certainly draws you in. Definitely worth the price. I will continue to read this series."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"this was a great book for me.people that like magic books should read this.it might get a little boring but that is gone quick and its replaced with action.i will definetly read the rest of the series!this was a exelent book also because of its lenght.this was a LONG book which is a really good thing snce i LOVE long books."},{"Title":"The Unsuspecting Mage: Book One of the Morcyth Saga","review":"now lets be honest for those of us who have a kindle this is a no brainer its a free book. now with this said this is a great book in the way all great books are. the main charcter is very relatable. and this is the kind of thing we all wish for. to be in a world where anything is poss and where you can see why the first rule of roleplaying is KILL THE MAGEthere are times when you think james the main charcter is dumb for not using common sense but at the same time it further goes to show that the author did his job and has us invested in his world. and had a very clear view on what he wanted. he is very good at not doing the normal d&d; fan fare as his go to but makes his own rules as well as including the d&d; bits."},{"Title":"Foucault 2.0 Beyond Power & Knowledge","review":"I've been reading Foucault for years now and have always been mystified by apparent dramatic changes in his method and focus. But I've always assumed I'm missing something, not fully grasping his point. I remain confident that I have at no time fully grasped his point, but I read Paras's book with growing relief and joy -- it turns out my instincts were sound all along, and Foucault really did change his method and focus from Madness and Civilization to Discipline and Punish and then through his trilogy on the History of Sexuality.Foucault 2.0 traces the emergence of the subject in Foucault's works, and his gradual trajectory toward existentialism from his initial (somewhat nasty) rejection of Sartre's project.Paras's style is refreshingly straightforward and his book serves as a terrific primer, though it helps, of course, to have read the works he discusses already. I'd never made it through The Order of Things or The Archaeology of Knowledge but I feel I have a tenuous understanding of those works after reading Paras.This is a great book to read if you've struggled with and engaged Foucault somewhat already. But an even better introduction to Foucault is Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals. I wish I'd figured that out sooner than I did."},{"Title":"Kids' Guide to the National Parks of California and Oregon - Written by Kids for Kids* - *but parents might learn something too","review":"In the Kids' Guide To The National Parks Of California And Oregon, 12 year old Jenna Sullivan and her 14 year old sister Laura effectively collaborate to write a thoroughly &quot;kid friendly&quot; guidebook to the spectacular parklands of California and Oregon. These include Redwood National Park; Yosemite National Park; Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks; Pinnacles National Monument; Point Reyes National Seashore; Lassen Volcanic National Park, Lava Beds National Monument; and Crater Lake National Park. These descriptive text covers the geology, vegetation, and wildlife of the parks, along with the young authors' insights into natural resource issues like air pollution, acid rain, fire ecology, wildlife habitat, plant ecology, and resource management. Very highly recommended for any family planning to visit these west coast parklands, the Kids' Guide To The National Parks Of California And Oregon is enhanced with an introduction, a conclusion, an index, author bios, and four color plates."},{"Title":"Kids' Guide to the National Parks of California and Oregon - Written by Kids for Kids* - *but parents might learn something too","review":"As I read these two sister's enthusiastic descriptions of a number of national parks, I found myself forgetting that they were only kids. I'm a habitual reader of travel guides (otherwise known as the armchair traveler), so I feel qualified to say that this one is very refreshing. In fact, if you're thinking of travelling with your kids to any national park, you should pick up this book so you can see what it's like from their point of view. I particularly enjoyed the interviews with park rangers who treated their thoughtful questions very seriously and added a needed perspective on many parks. I'm impressed that two young kids were able to put together such a professional book -- I can only imagine what their next project will be!"},{"Title":"The Spiritual Traveler: New York City : The Guide to Sacred Spaces and Peaceful Places","review":"NYC has about 13 retreats, 471 Baptist, 403 Catholic, 437 Jewish, 391 Pentecostal, 163 Episcopalian, 60 Islamic and 1 Bahai religious centers (to name but a few). The book's author, Edward F. Bergman is chairman of geographic studies at CUNY's Lehman College. The book is the must read for astute New Yorkers and tourists. It is eminently enlightening about the city's history, its architecture and its religious progression. As Bergman writes, from the early 17th Century, the chief religion of the non-Native Americans of the New Netherlands was the (Dutch) Reformed Church of Protestants, which spawned the Collegiate system of churches (read it and you will discover why they are called Collegiate Churches). As new settlers arrived, and New Amsterdam became British, new churches were established, persecuted, tolerated, and then in most cases, accepted. In the first chapter, Bergman includes brief histories for the major NYC religions, including Quaker, Adventist, and Sikh. In the second chapter, he discusses the architectural elements found in houses of worship and their origins. The styles explained include that of the basilica, cruciform with transepts, Gothic nave, Greek cross, and narthexporch, as well as those of Wren-Gibbs, Georgian, Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, High Victorian Gothic, Gothic, Romanesque Revival, and Renaissance Revival. He explains why some Protestant churches did away with their stained glass windows. The reader will also learn about the mihrab of a mosque, the Sikh gurdwara, and the Hindu rajagopuram, and along the way learn about religious history and the lives of saints and other clerics. In Chapters 3 through 9, Bergman describes the houses of worship by neighborhood. In Chapter 3, for example, the buildings of Downtown Manhattan are discussed. For each worship location, the address and architect are listed. For Trinity Church there are four pages of history; the African Burial Ground is discussed in three, as is the Eldridge Street Synagogue. Did you know that you can find the largest Buddha in the area at Mahayara, that the Sung Tak Buddhist Temple was formerly a Kalwarie shul, The Middle Reformed Coll. Church has its own Liberty Bell dating to 1729, or that the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol (1885) was the seat of NYC's short-lived Chief Rabbi in 1899? The book answers why the German Catholic Church of the Most Holy Redeemer is built so high, and why J.P Morgan supported St George's Episcopal Church to the extent he did. Every few pages there is a shaded section that explains a topic, such as &quot;the Greek Temple style in NYC&quot;; &quot;The Influence of the Reverend George Whitefield in the early 18th Century&quot;; &quot;the Jesuit Teilhard de Chardin and his noospere&quot;; &quot;The Draft Riot of 1863&quot;; &quot;Fulton Sheen and his ratings war with Milton Berle&quot;; and &quot;Churches and Multipurpose Buildings.&quot; Bergman also includes an &quot;Around the Corner&quot; paragraph after several listings to point out other attractions, like the harrowing offshore Merchant Marine Sculpture in Battery Park. Jewish readers will especially be fascinated by the histories, designs, and evolutions of the Manhattan synagogues. The book closes with a glossary, bibliography, large index, and list of websites."},{"Title":"The Spiritual Traveler: New York City : The Guide to Sacred Spaces and Peaceful Places","review":"&quot;The Spiritual Traveler New York City&quot; is more than just a guide to a few churches in NYC. It includes wonderful historical and architectural information on all the great houses of worship in the 5 boroughs of NYC as well as hidden jewels and oases of peace and calm that have been the prized secrets of many New Yorkers for years. While there is detailed information about churches of all denominations, synagogues, mosques and Hindu and Buddhist temples, it is all presented in a way that people who are not familiar with a lot of technical terms can understand and explanations are always provided. It's also compact enough that it easily fits into a backpack or pocketbook. I think &quot;The Spiritual Traveler New York City&quot; is not only perfect for tourists that want to know a little bit more about the spiritual history of NYC and about some of it's well-known places of worship, but is also perfect for the person (even New Yorkers like me)who wants the inside scoop on where to find peace and tranquility in the sea of madness that is NYC!! For those of you who like this book and are planning a trip to England, &quot;The Spiritual Traveler England Scotland and Wales&quot; is also available and is another great travel guide."},{"Title":"The Spiritual Traveler: New York City : The Guide to Sacred Spaces and Peaceful Places","review":"This is a great read for those who are interested in the religious buildings ofNew York!

A treat"},{"Title":"Monkeys","review":"\\"Monkeys\\" isn't a novel in the usual sense of the word. It is more of a collection of vignettes encompassing about 13 years in the life of a modern family, snapshots of moments in which we come to know each family member, then see how they change as their story progresses.The most astonishing thing about the book is how Minot ties each piece together. For the most part, the \\"big\\" events in the life of the family happen outside the narrative itself, in the space between the snapshots we are given. We may experience these moments as a part of their memories, but we come to understand what they were and what their effect has been in a fractured flow of story.Minot's prose, as in all her books, is expressive but spare, an economy of words that leaves much up to the reader's interpretation. She tells us just enough to know the family, to understand their quiet successes and their obvious failures, to see both the shape of the mask and what lies underneath it. She gives us the same kind of knowledge that we might have if they lived in a house down the street, a neighborly knowledge, not an intimate one.For the most part, this is a strong point in the book, but at a few points, Minot's style puts the reader at a distance when we might prefer a closer understanding of the feelings of each family member. In a way, it's the same frustration one experiences when we know something has happened to a neighbor, but we don't know how to ask without seeming nosy or pushy. Perhaps this was a deliberate choice on Minot's part, this enforced distance from her characters, but intentional or not, it was frustrating at times.Still, despite the occasional frustration, \\"Monkeys\\" is a well-rendered series of portraits of a modern American family, the foibles and wrinkles and soft tragedies that make up so much of the family landscape, and shape the people in it. Minot's writing is a delightful and refreshing change from the self-indulgent, overwrought prose most modern novelists love to employ, and in these brief vignettes, and the implication of events occurring between one and the next, we are given the chance to observe the quiet act of disintegration that goes on around us every day."},{"Title":"Monkeys","review":"This book was about the success and failure of a middle class New England family. The beginning was interesting enough, but towards the middle, it began to lose my interest. I admit, I shed a few tears at the end, but those tears wouldn't have been shed if I had not forced myself to read the entire book. Don't get me wrong, Susan Minot has incredible talent, but this book just let me down. The book centers on women, so I think all women should consider reading it, but in my opinion, it is not a book that should be read more than once."},{"Title":"Monkeys","review":"This book describes one woman's painful childhood in an upper class New England family. The book deals with difficult subjects (alcoholic father, death of mother) with an acute deftness and touches of unexpected humor. The first chapter is written from the child's point of view and starts with a &quot;typical&quot; family Sunday of church, ice-cream, and the beach. It ends with the children and mother hiding in a linen closet to play a prank on the father. The ending of the chapter is unexpected, but rings oh-so-true. &quot;Monkeys&quot; is brush-stroke writing at its best."},{"Title":"Monkeys","review":"It's been nearly a decade since I read this book but I'll never forget its profound impact on me--even as an only child! Minot's voice is so truly crafted that you will experience this family through each of the characters. You feel as though you are inside the heads of the mother and the siblings. You feel a sense of forboding with the father's presence. It's almost haunting that is exactly what makes this such a memorable read."},{"Title":"Monkeys","review":"This is not a badly written 'novel', but I found that I didn't care a bit about any of these characters -- with the possible exception of the first couple of 'chapters' (and I put it that way because, to me, this really felt more like a collection of short stories -- and indeed, much of it has appeared in that form in various publications), when they were very young children.Perhaps because of the way their parents lived and raised them, and the fact that they are so privileged financially, the children grow up to be spoiled and self-centered, with few redeeming qualities -- I know this may seem a bit judgemental, this being a work of fiction, but when I read a book, I try to identify or sympathize with at least one of the characters. Pretty much without exception, all of the children in this book turn out to be brats who never really grow up. There was a quote on the book's cover comparing Susan Minot's work to that of J. D. Salinger -- she's a talented writer, but this doesn't hold a candle to his work.I much preferred THE TINY ONE, by Minot's sister Eliza -- her style was much warmer and gentler, and the characters she drew much more likable. I've read a lot of good comment's about Susan's writing, so I'm still curious to check out some of her other books -- but this one disappointed me."},{"Title":"Monkeys","review":"A moving glimpse into the world of a New England family. With such an exuberant, energetic family, enviable social connections, and vacations boating in Maine, are the Vincents living the good life? Of course not. They are miserable. Minot skillfully sketches the framework of pain underpinning these lives."},{"Title":"Monkeys","review":"I could not put this book down once I started reading it! I found it to have truly human characters that were funny, poignant, and easy to fall in love with. I highly recommend it. Because it was originally written as several short stories, it is easy to read one chapter at a time. You will love it!"},{"Title":"Monkeys","review":"Monkeys, by Susan Minot, is a colourful novel about life in a large family. It is about seven children, called \`monkeys' by their mother. The book follows the seven Vincent children as they grow up, and learn to live on their own.Rosie Vincent, the Vincent's mother, was the character who seemed the most real. She brought their household together, tried to hide their father's alcoholism, cooked and cleaned, and did most of the work in the family. While Rosie may seem well-developed, the other characters were not. Because the novel was so short and there were so many characters, I had no connection with any of them. While the point of the novel was that life is hard in a large family, Minot could have gone into further depth on this topic. There was not enough room in the story to describe the emotions of all her characters. Seven children are too many for what this book is trying to tell about.Minot is talented at making the reader understand what is going on without directly saying it. However, I felt there was a lack of foreshadowing in this novel. If each chapter stood alone they would make nice short stories, but put together they lacked something. If there was a link between chapters, something to connect them, this book would have been more interesting. However, instead, I often found myself thinking, &quot;How is this important or relevant to the rest of the book?&quot;The first and last chapters were interesting and moving. In \`Hiding', Sophie is the narrator and I get a sense of who she is and what she thinks. This book would have been much more captivating had each chapter been told from each of the children, and the remaining two chapters told by the mother and father."},{"Title":"Monkeys","review":"This book will do it for you if you come from a large upper-middle class family. You need to approach it from a sibling stance. If you don't have a background to relate, then you will most likely not appreciate the beauty and pain Susan Minot put into this work. If you can understand, then you will love this book forever."},{"Title":"Monkeys","review":"I've been on a Susan Minot kick, and so I just re-read this book for the first time in years.I still enjoyed every page. Minot takes readers inside a large family and puts us right in the middle of the action, or inaction. Although more like linked vingnettes than a novel, Monkeys made me think of a contemporary Cheaper by the Dozen meets the Kennedys. Her writing is flawless and the stories are so simple, so absolutely every-family, I couldn't help be be mesmerized all over again."},{"Title":"Monkeys","review":"I could not put this book down once I started reading it!

The rest of the family, Chicky, Delilah, Caitlin, Gus, Mum, Sherman, Sophie are regular attenders. Dad has weird taste, spam. He grew up in Motley, Massachusetts. Now the parents and six children live in Marshport, Massachusetts.Thanksgivings are spent in Motley with grandparests, aunts, uncles, and cousins. Ma smokes cigarettes and Pa cigars. The children sit at a children's table. Creamed onions are served. There are apple, pumpkin, and mince pies.The Vincents go to Maine in the summer. In Bermuda, on a real vacation, Gus, age 10, has horrible cabin fever. Caitlin, age 14, is the oldest. Sherman and Chicky are the youngest. Grass in Bermuda is scratchy and rough. The children are told not to bother their father too much. Dad feels the roads in Bermuda are death traps. On the last day his wallet disappears and Gus finds it in the hedge.In Maine Wilbur Kittredge, the owner of an estate in North Eden, is a special friend of Mum's. At age forty she gives birth to another child, Rosie, nicknamed Minnie. The Vincent parents met each other on a double date. Mum asks Sophie to postpone her suicide until age 18, hoping that by then Sophie would not wish to resort to such means. Sherman, by now age 12, has an appetite for pot.A train hits Mum's car and she is killed. For the Christmas after her death the girls buy presents for everyone. Minnie shows the others where the decorations are kept. Dad marries a new wife, Pat. Mum's ashes, for the most part, are dropped into a channel at North Eden.

Artists Chris Burden, William T. Wiley and Sol Lewitt, who contribute book jacket testimonials, have sat and drank with Tom Marioni. Why not you?Since 1995, I've been attending Marioni's infamous weekly Wednesday gatherings that have continued his thirty year commitment in an extended performance involving hundreds of artists and friends. We drink and swap war stories. Some of the yarns in the memoir are familiar, reappearing as good friends, perfectly shaped after repeated telling. It's a blessing to see them gathered in print and paraded before a larger audience.There's a reason Marioni's gatherings (and this book) are so successful. He's a perfect host and an entertaining raconteur. Difficult concepts are carefully constructed in terms his audience comprehend. Marioni's art may be challenging, but the ideas expressed are simply stated and make for great reading. His insights into the art of John Cage, with whom he interacted yearly from 1978 to 1992, when Cage would stay with Marioni and his wife Kathan Brown to explore visual art at Crown Point Press are especially moving.People ask Marioni what a particular work is about, and as an artist he is loath to answer, knowing how easily mood can be explained away. But Marioni is also a curator, a perfect host and writer, who enjoys recalling the personages and mysteries of art. Art critic, Thomas McEvilley, who contributes an introductory essay, hails Marioni as &quot;Northern California's foremost Conceptual artist.&quot; You'll see why after sampling this delicacy. Pull up a chair and get yourself a cool one.John Held, Jr., San Francisco, March 2004."},{"Title":"Beer, Art and Philosophy: The Act of Drinking Beer with Friends Is the Highest Form of Art, a memoir by Tom Marioni","review":"As a young kid, I grew up in my dad's studio. I remember various refrigerators with the \\"FREE BEER\\" sign on them and his weekly wednesday gathering of friends drinking beer in his studio or at the old San Francisco Breen's Bar on his turf corner at 3rd and Mission. Years later, I would see his refrigerator and a wall of empty anchor steam beer bottles lined up at the SFMOMA and would bring a humorous smile to my face--thinking my dad is the only person I know who could transform beer drinking into art--beer art. Although I am biased, I love my dad's work. There is always a puzzle, a natural beauty and a bit of humor in every one of his works.My father's book takes a look at the development and history of conceptual art in the 1960's until now through his eyes and his experiences. Many of his ideas and art were very advanced for his time and are very relevant today. If you want to get another perspective on conceptual art, read my dad's book....and have a nice cold beer ready.disclaimer: my dad did not ask me to write this :-)"},{"Title":"The Age of Rococo","review":"Superb Layout and Photography.

Age 2-5 year olds. I read this book to my kids and they loved it! Now I woud like to buy it and read it to my grandchild. Wonderful story like &quot;going on a bear hunt,&quot; but a little prince going on a dragon hunt on his little pony Dumpling. The art work is wonderful! Once you read this book, you will fall in love with it!"},{"Title":"Klippity Klop","review":"Mr. Emberly has really created a wonderful book here. It tells the story of Prince Krispin who goes for a ride on his horse, dumpling. As they pass through different areas the sound of dumpling's trotting changes from the &quot;klip-klop&quot; of the road to the &quot;kwish-kwash&quot; of the field to the &quot;kersplash-kersplosh&quot; of the stream. Eventually they reach the cave of a dragon! When the dragon roars at them, they turn and run for home as fast as they can. The sound of Dumpling as he speeds up changes,too. So instead of the &quot;krinch-krunch&quot; of going up the gravelly hill, we get the &quot;krinchety-krunchity&quot; of galloping down the hill. My daughter has loved this book since she was 6 months old. Bouncing on my knee as Prince Krispin and Dumpling go through the different places at different speeds never fails to make her laugh. And I can't wait until she gets older and starts to notice the animals that Prince Krispin and Dumpling scare out of the way as they run away from noisy dragon! Lots of great detail here! And it all ends with a nice moral: &quot;Going adventuring is a fine thing. But being safe at home, that's a fine thing, too!&quot;"},{"Title":"Klippity Klop","review":"My son loved this book when it first was out. I bought it again for a young friend.

I am a fairly new knitter (about 6 months) I actually learned to knit just before I left Los Angeles. Having moved back to North Carolina (very small town, Highlands) I have just let the knitting bug take me over. I can't stop myself. In fact sometimes my boyfriend will say \\"Caroline, can you put it down for a bit.\\"I have enjoyed making many of the patterns in the book, esp, the purses, bags, and Ponchos. I have been in the fashion/retail industry for over 14 years, and am actually starting to sell/consign some of my items in local shops. Really exciting!I'm on my way back to LA for the month of February, and look forward to checking out your store, and hopefully taking some classes.Just wanted to let you know that you, and your book have inspired me.

Not only does Cousins include patterns and helpful tips and hints - she also includes lots of anecdotes and stories about each item she has knit. She has lots of ideas for knitting get-togethers and even recipes. This book is great to actually read and not just use for patterns. Also, the patterns are for very different and unique items. The book is very different from the usual knitting book - I love it!"},{"Title":"Hollywood Knits Style","review":"I love Hollywood Knits Style, even enjoying it much more then the first one. Her clever creativity and the fearlessness of combining textures and colors--not to mention her detailing--is very inspiring and you don't see it in other knitting books. Her women's sweaters are very feminine and body flattering. I have already ordered yarn from her website and can't wait to receive it and start knitting.I also liked the fact that Suss shared her favorite recepies with the reader. That takes me back to my childhood memories of my mom, who was always either knitting or cooking. My only concern with the recepies in the book is that the picture could have been bigger."},{"Title":"Hollywood Knits Style","review":"This book is wonderful. I thought the first was was great, but this book is even better. Thank you suss for your orginality and keeping knitters current!"},{"Title":"Hollywood Knits Style","review":"Suss's first book Hollywood Knits had some of the best designs I'd ever seen, this new book is no different. great patterns that seem very modern and arty and now she added recipes and knitting group ideas. Obviously she is inspired by the stitch n bitch craze and melanie falick's excellent book \\"weekend knitting\\". my favorite patterns are the bags, the sweater with the clever zippers, the blankets and the cute dachshund sweaters. However,This book suffers from the same problems as before, there is a lot of name dropping, which I didn't mind and even enjoy but many others were annoyed with. She is still knitting things flat instead of in the round which may frustrate experienced knitters. Her sizes are still tiny even for the dogs. She almost always uses her own yarn line and accessories which you can only get from her store and this time does not offer alternatives.I gave this 4 stars because I love the designs and that is the only reason I buy her books. Her use of color and clever shapes is very original and I can always incorporate her ideas into my knitting"},{"Title":"Hollywood Knits Style","review":"I would not recomment this book to beginners because of the frequency of mistakes. I'm an experienced knitter, and had a hard time with some of the patterns. For instance, the cast on and number of stitches weren't even mentioned in one of her hat patterns. I eventually figured it out by counting the stitches that were in the rounds.Suss Counsins...Knitter to the Stars! Please. This book looks all shiny, pretty, and hip. Upon closer inspection, the patterns are a bunk. I've tried to make several items in this book, and just about every pattern has a correction to it. To find the corrections for the pattern one must visit Suss Cousins's website. I find this frustrating, because I was expecting a level of quality that wasn't there. I will, however, grudgingly admit that the book does make knitting seem glamourous with photography. In the end, save your money, and check this book out of your local library."},{"Title":"Hollywood Knits Style","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that anyone who thinks a 32 inch bust is a Large has been in Hollywood too long.I bought this book after flipping through it quickly at the bookstore. I liked the designs. Some are quite cute, for example: the bamboo-handled purse, the heart-shaped pillow, and the fuzzy baby booties.I'm now kicking myself. I should've read some of the patterns more carefully. A skirt that I thought I could make for myself goes up to a size Large - a whopping 33 inches (and remember - that's the size of the FO, not the person wearing it)! GET REAL, SUSS!Don't make the same mistake as I did. Take a pass on this one."},{"Title":"Hollywood Knits Style","review":"I bought this book and dutifully knitted away my first poncho.

I am half way through another Suss project and come to find out there was a little misprint. She left out a major detail. You will find that you need to print out the additional information and use it along with the book if you intend on knitting any successful project from this book.

I have been to the shop, and it was nice, but not a welcoming atmosphere with very little assistance. That basically describes this book: extremely unhelpful.For one, she uses many over simplified designs, which is aggrevating especially since a lot of her knitwear that she sells is more complex. Like many other knitters have said, she uses a lot of flat knitting, which can require bulky seaming. Furthermore, if you look at her designs she sells, she has a lot more unique ponchos and stuff. When I bounght this book I expected some neat ponchos, but only found one.AND THE WORST PART IS THE ERRORS. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!! On her website is about 3 pages of errors in the book. This is appaling since most knitting magazines that release 4 issues a year have less errors. Extremely unprofessional.Overall, nice designs, which is why I didn't give it 1 star. However, the frustration with knitting with this book far outweighs the nice designs. I am also very dissapointed that she did not make improvements from the first book. This is a fun book for experienced and higher level knitters (especially if bought used), but NOT for beginners."},{"Title":"Hollywood Knits Style","review":"I have mixed feelings about this purchase. Some of the designs are very cute and look like they will be fun to complete; however, most of the patterns look identical to ones in knitting books I already own.

Many of the knitwear designs look like they would be well-suited to larger figures, but the sizing of the patterns does not allow for this."},{"Title":"Hollywood Knits Style","review":"I checked this book out from my local library and began to flip through it.

I feel embarrassed that this was the first knitting book I purchased when I was starting out. I remember I used to look up her website to order some yarn that was called for in her book but am very glad I didn't. I've visited her store once but didn't have any unpleasant experience. One of her assistance there was really sweet and I think she modeled one of the shrugs that were online exclusive. Other than that, I've touched some of her in-house yarn that they had and they weren't exactly the softest I've felt. Again, none of the designs are very innovative and if you're an intermediate and above knitter, it's just easier to eyeball it and make it up on your own.

Perez tells Cuba's history thoroughly, using fascinating details and stories, and does a masterful job at explaining the main tendencies in the island's history. His writing is clear, entertaining and well-referenced. His political position does not dominate his account either and refrains from bashing or glorifying the revolutionary period. If I was going to suggest only one book on Cuba's history, it would be this one. (And I've read most of what's available)"},{"Title":"Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution (Latin American Histories)","review":"This is a history book, wonderfully thorough, that unfortunately at times takes on the disguise of a dozen monographs torn apart and chronologically slapped back together into one volume. It is an appropriate jumping-off point for further study of Cuba.What Perez presents in Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution is a book that few students of Cuban history can write: it is unbiased. My political and emotional perspective on Cuba is strong and personal, yet try as I may, the two times I've read this book, I did not ever find it tarnished by the rhetoric of propagandists.I recommend this book to teachers and professors searching for a complete and honest history of Cuba for classroom use, and to independent students and learners who really want a strong background knowledge on the long history of Cuba."},{"Title":"Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution (Latin American Histories)","review":"At least two reviews have been posted recently claiming Professor Perez is wrong about the facts he offers on social and economic conditions in Cuba before the victory of the revolution in 1959. I have placed a comment under the more extensive of the two challenges, but I want to alert others who may not look at the comments to the reviews, that in general, but especially on Cuba and its revolution, a subject on which feelings run very deep, a challenge to factual material presented by a leading academic expert such as Professor Perez (no relation to this writer) cannot be credited unless the source is given, and preferably a reliable or authoritative source that can be independently verified.In this case, the author of the longer challenge writes with such assertiveness and specific detail that I imagined I was reading first hand testimony from someone who was there, although the reviewer doesn't say that. Even then, on Cuba, such accounts need to be taken with a grain of salt and the person should be encouraged to provide authoritative or reliable and verifiable sources to corroborate at least the overall picture they are presenting if not all the specific details.But as it turns out, in the case of the comment that challenges Professor Perez so vigorously, it comes from someone whose profile page has another review where he makes it clear he was born in 1973. He is in his 30s, but he'd need to be well past retirement age to know from personal experience the assertions he makes challenging Professor Perez on the facts about Cuba in the late 1950s. Yet the critic provided no sources.Among many of us Cuban emigres (and our descendants) a myth has developed that I would caricature as, \\"Nothing was wrong with Cuba before 1959; nothing has been right ever since.\\" But that is more a reflection of the depth of feeling about the Cuban Revolution from those who were negatively impacted than a true portrait of what the island was then and what has happened since. (And feelings run just as deeply on the other side, too.)As the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, \\"Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.\\" Professor Perez's record and standing in the academic community makes his book authoritative. I would completely discount those kinds of negative reviews claiming the book is inaccurate until and unless they are backed up with sources."},{"Title":"Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution (Latin American Histories)","review":"E X C E L L E N TE X C E L L E N TVERY EXCELLENT"},{"Title":"Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution (Latin American Histories)","review":"Covering almost 4 centuries of history even of a small country as Cuba is a daunting task. Perez, however, does a wonderful job in making a succinct and clear overview of the general narratives that have shaped the island. Beginning with a brief introduction to the native population of the island before the Spanish discovery of Taino and Ciboney tribes to the present years of the revolution. What I think was important was how the author provided a geographical overview of the island so as the reader can become acquainted with the territory. While for many Cubans this may not be necessary for those with little or even just some knowledge of Cuba this preliminary step is extremely helpful. I enjoyed this book most of all because it gives a narrative to each historical epoch. From the bleak beginnings of Cuba as a country that was depopulated over and over as more Spaniards moved to the Spanish colonial mainland to how and why Havana was able to grow as an important city for Spanish interests. Again because the author cannot cover everything many will criticize that he missed this or that. Personally my biggest surprise was that he didn't mentioned the events that lead to the Spanish-American War. He does extensively note the long history of U.S. intentions to annex Cuba. But the explosion of the Maine and the events leading to the U.S. occupation are not mentioned at all. With respects to keeping a bias opinion and the accuracy of his evidence...well with regards to all the modern developments (i.e. 2000-present) the author is quite accurate and he does give a succinct and clear idea of the main events. With respect to the Pre-1959 I cannot attest for much. The author at least does try, so it seems, to a keep a non-biased view throughout his book. He neither staunchly praises the Revolution nor demonizes. He notes its few achievements and its key problems. The author does note how Cuba is one of the most developed economies in Latin America by 1958 in comparison to most Latin American countries on many levels including # of radios, televions, literacy, infant mortality etc. At the same time, this doesn't mean that there aren't many problems with Cuban society before 1959 there are and A LOT. And the author does keep note of these. Some things I would like to have seen mentioned were key public works of Havana i.e. The Capitolio built under the Machado administration, the Hotel Nacional build in 1930 and most importantly Habana Libre, Riviera. These last were built just a year or 2 prior to the Revolution I would like to see more in depth economic analysis of these years preceding the Revolution. Despite these minor setbacks I think Perez has done an astonishing job and hope to read other books by him"},{"Title":"Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution (Latin American Histories)","review":"I do not recommend this book for the casual reader nor for the beginning student of Cuban History.This text is filled with errors in various places. The most distorted portion seems to deal with the Pre-Revolutionary, Pre-Castro Cuba. Mr Perez explains, for example, that \\"approximately 892,000 Cubans were fully employed in 1958 and of these 62 percent earned $75 (US) a month or less.\\"The fact is that Cuban union workers earned about $40 per week in 1958. The lowest paid workers were those who worked in construction. They were paid more than what Mr. Perez believes. Bricklayers earned an average of $4 a day and other construction workers about $7 per day. Construction work in the decade of the 1950's was on the increase - not decrease. And even if we were to accept the figure of $75 per month (for which I'd love to know the source) this would be a decent salary in the Cuba of the 1950's. Rents at that time were as low as $15 or $20 per month, for apartments. Rent control existed in Cuba as far back as 1940. (Although new construction, anything built post-1940, did not have to be rent-controlled.) A gallon of gasoline in 1958 cost about $0.32...Writing about Cuba in 1958, on page 304 of the Second Edition, Mr. Perez continues, \\"The neighborhoods of Luyano, Jesus del Monte and Las Yaguas were crowded with tens of thousands of poor, unemployed, unemployable, living in squalor and destitution, eight to a room in hovels of tin sheeting and cardboard without sanitary facilities, garbage collection, sidewalks, or street lighting, and increasingly without hope.\\"The statement above is only true of one neighborhood called 'Las Yaguas,' but the statement is not accurate about the other neighborhoods.The fact is there were no 'Yaguas' in Jesus del Monte, nor in Luyano. Jesus del Monte had broad avenues, theaters, churches (The Passionists), homes - new construction of poured concrete and slab - built in the mid 20th century after the Great Depression and WWII, so that by 1958 the homes in this part of the city would have seemed new. In 1958, Luyano was also a middle class neighborhood. It too was a neighborhood composed of new homes, new construction - such as the home built by my own grandmother in 1953 on the corner of Fontz and Cumbre, hospitals (such as 'casa de socorros') etc.Las Yaguas was a slum. It was home to perhaps as many as 5000 people. President Batista attempted to move its residents into new housing in the 1950's, into something akin to public housing here in the US, in a place called 'Mantillas,' but the people moved back to 'Las Yaguas' on their own because in Las Yaguas they paid no rent. Theose people would routinely illegally vandalize the homes in Mantillas - selling toilets or whatever they could - and return on their own to Las Yaguas.Castro then did finally move these indeed 'unemployable' people, as Mr. Perez describes them, out of Las Yaguas and into government-built housing after 1959. But this success was only due to Castro's mandate, this is to say it was something achieved by force, practically at the point of a gun.Leonardo PuigUnion City, NJ"},{"Title":"Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution (Latin American Histories)","review":"As an anthropologist, I found this book an invaluable introduction to Cuban history, and I would certainly use it as a text for undergraduates.Perez starts with Cuba's geography and a quick review of its pre-Columbian peoples, and ends with Cuba in the Post-Cold War World. The book is readable and concise, and gave me insights into U.S. designs on Cuba that began with our second President. Perez goes through Cuba's history in extricating itself from Spain only to be dominated by the U.S., and then gives a very good account of Cuba under its various presidents up until the Revolution. His account of the Revolution and its roots is dispassionate and unbiased, though it won't seem like that to right-wing exiles who would like to see everything about Castro totally demonized.I disagree with other reviewers that the role of the U.S. is not included. It certainly is. With 329 pages, you can't go into extreme depth on all topics to everyone's tastes, but I for one was surprised by how old U.S. ambitions toward the island are. If you want to get into Cuba-U.S. relations in more depth get Perez' book \\"Ties of Singular Intimacy.\\"This third edition is an updated version that includes events in the exile community up to 2004, and includes a nice political chronology at the end, along with a 75 page guide to the literature.

What is missing, however, is the role of the U.S.; Perez almost totally ignores it.

Lewis was a very popular author in 1926, and this novel became a hot movie property, soon earmarked for flapper Clara Bow: the film right before she became the \\"It Girl.\\" Lewis called it \\"a straight, out-and-out romance of an unspoiled country...the most captivating love and adventure story I have ever conceived or told\\" (Michael Sragow's biography of Victor Fleming p. 112) but director Fleming saw the story as something quite different, a new kind of sex comedy.Like all Lewis' novels, it incorporated elements of cultural commentary, in this case, that of a \\"social climber\\" the manicurist, Alverna, who thinks she is marrying up and finds herself keeping house in the Canadian backwoods. But, the love triangle between the incorrigible flirt, the rough-hewn backwoodsman and the effete city divorce lawyer who has sworn off women, is unusual enough to confound reader and audience expectations, who may not know how they want the story resolved.The adaptation is an excellent distillation of the novel, previously serialized in a magazine. Some of the most humorous written passages, which involve the outfitting of two city men at the 1920s version of REI, and being talked into more and more useless gear, is only hinted at in a few brief shots in the film. Bow softens Alverna's hard-boiled character with her unique snap and sparkle.Lewis's book is not one of his major works, but is still a delightful read, especially when complementing a viewing of the film version of Mantrap (1926) starring Clara Bow, Ernest Torrence and Percy Marmot."},{"Title":"The Time It Took Tom","review":"Puppies and kids, you can't leave 'em alone. Here young Tom finds an inviting can of red paint, apparently a really big can. Red-cheeked Tom thinks for a few seconds before deciding how to exploit this exciting find. After popping off the lid with a large spoon, Tom paints the entire living room including walls, floor and everything in the room. I can imagine young readers watching this transpire and yelling, \\"Oh No!\\" with delightful horror.While Tom paints, Mom cuts the grass, talks to a neighbor and takes a nap in an outdoor lounge chair.This is a fun book with the bright colors, outrageous behavior , and breathless list of things Mom has to do to get the room back to living condition. The two solid red pages inside the cover foreshadow what's to come and the two solid blue pages at the end might be an omen of things to come after Tom finds a can of blue paint exactly where the red paint was found.The Time it Took Tom certainly doesn't teach time, but it does touch on the concept and helps youngsters practice the numbers one to ten."},{"Title":"The Time It Took Tom","review":"A great book for preschool-kindergarten age.

They complain that The Time it Took Tom has \\"no therapeutic message and no satisfying resolution.\\" Oh, I beg to differ.Tom paints everything in the house. Everything. And then, surprise! He has to help clean it up! He and Mom pull every ruined item out of the house, Tom accompanies Mom on every time-consuming shopping trip -- on the public bus, by the way -- for furniture and paint, and then back out to get new paint after she hates the first paint. Going step by step by step through the cleanup process makes that time really tangible, and hearing my daughter laugh and groan \\"Oh, no!\\" at every new step let me know she really understood that Tom's momentary fun caused a great big long protracted mess. That's pretty therapeutic, at least for me!At the end, Tom finds another can of paint and gets a mischievous look in his eye... and my daughter starts laughing and screaming \\"No! Don't do it!\\" Because she got what Publisher's Weekly failed to get -- Tom isn't a boy behaving badly and not getting punished for it. Tom is Impulse -- that's why he doesn't learn from his behavior, why he has the same cheerful approach to every part of this story. No, Impulse is not properly chagrined -- it never is! It always has such great ideas! And kids have to learn to stop, think, and make careful decisions about those ideas, based on imagined consequences. So, how do they learn that without making a really lot of horrifying mistakes? They don't -- that's what childhood is!

The story ends in classic \\"round\\" fashion, with Tom finding a can of - you guessed it - blue paint.The bold line drawings in bright colors are lots of fun and the perfect complement to the text. The book lends itself to an over-the-top dramatic reading, especially sections like Mom freaking out upon finding her entire room painted red. Kids can join in on the \\"countdown\\" sections, and it's a good opportunity to talk about both numbers and time. Yes, Tom is completely unrepentant and we all have the sneaking suspicion that the can of blue paint will be put to similar use as the can of red before it, but that's part of the fun of the book.

I my own self am a free-market radical, and, while I don't agree with everything Mr. Langsburg writes, his views are overwhelmingly on target. Want to know why movie popcorn costs so much? The &quot;obvious&quot; answer is wrong. Are you happy when your senator provides your area with a road project? You really shouldn't be that excited about it. Even the most absurd notions (Unemployment is good! Recycling is bad!) are hard to refute once you get the basics of economics down. Mr. Landsburg writes that economics can be largely defined in one terse sentence: people respond to incentives. If everyone in America knew how much that makes sense, I can guarantee 90% of our nation's (and world's) social ills would be eliminated.I used to tell people that if everyone read the first few chapters of a standard economics textbook, the world would be better off. The same holds true for this book."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"I started reading this book with great expectations as well as enthusiasm but after a number of chapters I became more and more disenchanted.I do agree with the other reviewers that the author does sometimes manage to do a good job of explaining to non-economists how economic reasoning works, but in the end one does get rather fed up of his rather narrow minded belief that the only correct way of explaining everyday life is to implement, in his words, the discipline of Economics\\". I do not want to discuss all the topics he covers - this has been adequately covered by other reviewers but would like to pick out a few examples where the author clearly does not practice what he preaches. He then suffers under credibility, which does make me tend to undervalue his arguments over topics which may otherwise be totally logical and true.He is not tired of constantly repeating how moral-free economical theory is, but the ironic part is that he can not refrain from including implicit moral judgments himself. A typical example of his attitude is most clearly evident in the last chapter over the Science of Economics versus the Religion of Ecology. He may be right in ranting and raving against radical environmentalists but he is very ill advised in underlining his arguments with:1) A seemingly poor knowledge over ecology. He seems to believe/assume, for example, that the inferior mono-cultural forests planted today for future logging can safely be compared with, and are a proper substitute for, the rich, ecological diverse and healthy forests occurring in nature.2) A blatant mistaking of real tolerance with selfish apathy and indifference as displayed so clearly in his own example, where he professes disinterest for a newly discovered species of monkeys which may be safely driven to extinction on the dubious premises that they in no way enriched his life in the past. This is just cynical and cheap polemic and not an example for tolerance towards other view points. In this case I would personally rather side up with those so called radical but at least ideological environmentalists, even though I do not myself agree with many of their ideas.3) Showing very poor taste in conceitedly including a letter he once wrote to a preschool teacher (who is now not in a position to defend herself) after first arrogantly dismissing the chance to discuss the issue/problem with her personally. If the issue is really so important to be included in a book, then it should also have been important enough to discuss at the time it arose. Any opinionated views, petty mindedly submitted in this chapter only undermines his self-righteous and smug chain of arguments (exactly the kind of behavior he wanted in fact to prove for the environmentalists themselves).In summary: Many views in this book are not that suitable for an Armchair Economist\\" but rather more for a belligerent drunk arguing in a bar."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"This books uses real world examples to debunk some of the common misconceptions and preconceived notions people have about economics.

Slaughters many sacred cows, including the litany of ideas on the environment, deficits, illiteracy, unemployment, dollar-cost averaging, and the use of statistics.Many reviewers have criticized the last chapter of his book, which is about environmentalism. It is true to some extent that he is building straw men and tearing them down (though he does asknowledge he is referring to &quot;naive environmentalism&quot;).

In The Armchair Economist, Mr Landsburg, a teacher at the University of Chicago, uses simple and fun examples to explain some of the most fundamental principles of economics. Read it and you'll understand why deficits may not be that bad after all and, a lot more important, why popcorn is so expensive at the movies"},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Perhaps the author contributes to the view that the economists are not serious scientists. For example, he mentions that unemployment is good for the society. I'm sure that the people who were unemployed in the midst of the Great Depression would tell you otherwise, and many millions who are currently unemployed now. The only point that I could possibly agree on was that recycling paper might reduce demand for trees and we may have less trees planted as a result. Other than that, I couldn't find much economic insight in this book. The author seems to be more frustrated by the fact that economics is not a science on par with physics and chemistry, but that's the nature of economics. One cannot predict the economic future as one would predict physical motion using Newton mechanics. That does not mean that law of economics does not work. It is a rough science and you would have to make intelligent guesses based on common sense and clear evidence. Either way, disappointing book."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Why tigers are in danger of extinction while cows never are?Why Landsburg's analysis may be wrong?In the book Armchair Economist, Steven Landsburg argues that the reason behind cows' population growth is the ranchers' self interest. Due to the fact that ranchers' profits depend on breading more cows they will make sure that this specie will never go extinct. On the other hand existence of tigers will not benefit any body and that makes them prone to extinction. Following the same chain of reasoning Landsburg argues that recycling will have a counter effect on trees' population. By recycling the loggers' business will be less profitable which will decrease their interest in keeping forests full of trees and thus forests will be more in danger of deterioration.This chain of reasoning although may apply perfectly well to cows but seems to have some problems when applied to forests. Landsburg forgot to take into account the cost associated with keeping the forests full of trees. His argument is only valid if the cost and investment associated with planting new trees returns in time with enough profit. Contrary to cows that have short life span, forests tend to take several decades to grow back, therefore an investor may find it more profitable to use the forest once and never replenish it. On the other hand, as he himself mentioned in his book investors tend to diversify and hedge their investments consequently they are invested in both paper industries and recycling businesses, therefore they may find it more profitable to force paper industries to cut trees without the cost of replenishment for more profit now and when the tress become scarce they will decrease their interest in paper industries and increase it in recycling. If ROI of repopulating trees is more than switching to another business I am sure that the investors will choose to use current resources and move to another business later.Due to the reasons I offered above it is necessary to understand that in capitalist society, long-term planning is often left to the state. But unfortunately at the same time, the powerful influence of industrialists in a country's affairs stipulates for a smaller government. And a small government won't be powerful enough to address long term problems such as environmental issues. Although I love Landsburg's book and I should say it opened my eyes to many new and valid new points. I think that in the case of environmentalists he fell short of his own standard and method of scientific analysis."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"The first time I read this book I enjoyed it. I liked its flowing prose and delighted in its plausible explanations of puzzling economic phenomena.The second time I read it I found it almost infuriating in its naivete. His focus on individual consumer preference and dismissal of other factors result in a dismal science indeed.Applying Landsburg's framework to an extreme example, we might find slavery to make perfect economic sense. The buyers and sellers of the &quot;commodity&quot; would simply be expressing their preferences via prices and transactions. Of course, in this case, human suffering is left out of the equation. So in many of Landsburg's examples, something is invariably missing from the equation.Landsburg is especially passionate in his denouncement of environmentalism as &quot;a force-fed potpourri of myth, superstition, and ritual&quot;. Perhaps he did personally encounter this debased version of environmental, but he must not have looked very far for another kind. His mistake is in making the colonial assumption that natural resources are free and endless. This may have seemed a natural mistake for Adam Smith, but it's inexcusable for Landsburg writing in 1993. His model of &quot;Grimyville&quot; and &quot;Cleanstown&quot; takes a different turn once health costs and cleanup costs are added to the equation.Apart for his environmental blind spot, Landsburg also fails to discuss Econ 101 topics such as externalized costs, the tragedy of the commons, and the principal-agent problem.The difference between my first and second readings was five years of living in the real world. This book might be great for late night discussions in the freshman dorms, but will eventually ring hollow once reality sets in.P.S. Since I will be trying to sell my used copy of the book, does my negative review demonstrate irrational behavior?"},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Steven Landsburg's book shouldn't be thought of as an economics textbook. It presents no graphs and few conclusions.Dr. Landsburg rather presents questions and then a fascinating tour of the mind of a trained economist. He asks his reader first to take the tour and then to use the blueprint and join him in thinking like an economist.I have used The Armchair Economist as a supplement to my Advanced Placement Economics classes for two years. My students relish each opportunity to watch Landsburg's mind in action and to join in on the fun. Many of them have purchased copies of the book for themselves. They particularly enjoy sharing discussions about the questions presented with friends and parents."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"A delightfully though-provoking look at many everyday matters, seen through the eyes of an &quot;economist.&quot; I parenthesize the word, since much of his analysis doesn't center around money per se. Rather, it's economics as the study of Man the decison-maker. He asks such simple questions as &quot;Why are concert tickets usually underpriced?&quot; (i.e., why is there greater demand than supply). And the wonderful part is, he's often unafraid to say, &quot;Economics can't provide the answer.&quot; Likewise, he can find no reason why people tip anonymously in restaurants.One nice thing about most of the book is that it provides a libertarian analysis of the decision-making process, but doesn't openly advocate libertarian politics. The chapter on &quot;Courship and Collusion&quot; perfect sense of the mating game (in the macro sense). Starting with his observations, we can begin to understand the incredible social changes that have occured since contraception became widely available. But he refrains from passing judgement on whether this is good or bad.The chapter on environmentalism is interesting, and this is the one that earns him the scorn of the diehard leftists. His analysis of recycling being counterproductive is eye-opening, yet so simple and irrefutable in economic terms. To be sure, it's not to his credit that he includes a letter he wrote to his child's kindergarten teacher, and it's distracting when he slips into his personal concerns.

Still, the book is such a delightful read that I'll deduct one star from six, and still rate it with five."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"This book is excellent, and quite readable if you can think logically. As best as I can tell, most of the one-star reviews come from Landsburg's skewering of the environmental movement. He talks about it as a religion, and the emotional reaction of those reviewers shows he's pretty much on target.Bottom line - if you can suppress your emotional attachment to certain popular ideas and consider them objectively, you'll like this book. If you can't, you'll hate it."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Landsburg is tremendously clever at coming up with logical explanations for everyday phenomenon.

What a load of beans. Recycle at once!"},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"If you're remotely interested in economics, you should read this book; it's a hoot.Not too many books on economics could be described as a &quot;hoot.&quot; But Steven Landsburg, an economics professor at the University of Chicago when he wrote this book (now he's at the University of Rochester), has a delightfully sharp sense of humor and a gift for clear, logical exposition. He also doesn't in the least mind naming names when it comes to egregious economic fallacies and the people who commit them: he keeps a &quot;Sound and Fury file&quot; consisting of economic gaffes from the op-ed pages and he devotes a chapter to exposing the culprits.His theme is easily stated, and he states it on the first page: the substance of economic science is that people respond to incentives. &quot;The rest,&quot; he writes in deliberate imitation of Rabbi Hillel, &quot;is commentary.&quot;Landsburg fills the rest of the book with such commentary. His witty and occasionally sarcastic exposition deals neatly with such topics as why recycling paper doesn't really save trees; why certain statistics are not reliable measures of the &quot;income gap&quot; between rich and poor; why the GNP is not an especially accurate measure of national wealth; why unemployment isn't necessarily a bad thing; why taxes _are_ a bad thing; why real economists don't care about what's &quot;good for the economy&quot; or endorse the pursuit of monetary profit apart from personal happiness; and lots of other points that will no doubt be profoundly irritating to people who just _know_ he _can't possibly_ be right.For example, Landsburg is delightfully allergic to the claims of the &quot;environmental&quot; movement and recognizes it quite clearly as a strongly moralistic religion. And contrary to the opinions of some not terribly careful readers, he does distinguish firmly between the actual harm caused by pollution and the psychic harm caused by (e.g.) the use of automobiles to people who object in principle to such technology.Interestingly, Landsburg recognizes a problem here for his own cost-benefit approach: if economic efficiency with regard to utilitarian/consequentialist goods and bads were really the whole story, he notes, he should care about _both_ the physical harm and the psychic harm, and yet he doesn't.Which leads neatly into the other notable feature of this volume: Landsburg is stunningly forthright about the nature -- and the limits -- of cost-benefit analysis. Unlike some economists who like to pretend such analysis is value-free and involves no commitment to any particular view of morality, Landsburg is clear that cost-benefit analysis is quite unambiguously committed to one particular moral outlook (which he characterizes and describes very neatly). And he is keenly aware of its limitations, though he is not at all confident about what should replace it.The problem, roughly, is this (the following characterization is mine, not his). As Landsburg notes several times, cost-benefit analysis does not regard &quot;theft&quot; as a cost, since it merely transfers existing stuff from one person to another; society is no worse off on net after the theft than before it. (Of course theft entails _further_ costs that _do_ leave society worse off, but that's not the point here.) Economics, as Landsburg describes it, looks only at _outcomes_ and not at how we got to them. And even at that, it looks only at one abstract feature of such outcomes, namely, how much &quot;good&quot; there is in the aggregate.And yet most of us would say that &quot;society&quot; _is_ somehow worse off after a theft -- that there is some sort of &quot;moral cost&quot; involved in the theft itself quite apart from its further consequences, and that it makes a difference whose &quot;good&quot; is rightfully achieved or acquired and whose is not. (Some of us might even say that there is something illegitimate in comparing the thief's gain to the victim's loss in the first place.) In ordinary moral discourse, it matters very much how we arrived at a given state of affairs.If so, then economic science has two choices (this is still my opinion, not his). (1) It can throw those &quot;moral costs&quot; into the mix and deal with &quot;rights and wrongs&quot; in the same way it deals with &quot;goods and bads.&quot; In that case, the total &quot;good&quot; will take account of the number and quality of right acts vs. wrong acts. (2) It can ignore those &quot;moral costs&quot; and continue as before.In either case, economic science _as Landsburg presents it_ is simply insufficient as a guide to policy decisions. (Landsburg tends to acknowledge this, maintaining only that cost-benefit analysis is an important _part_ of whatever it is we need to make policy decisions.) And it is certainly not -- as Landsburg also recognizes in a wonderfully forthright chapter -- sufficient as a guide to personal conduct.So this volume gets five stars even though Landsburg doesn't have much to say about what should supplement cost-benefit analysis. It's a terrific introduction to economic thinking genreally, and it's also a clear and frank recognition of the limitations of such thinking at least as practiced by many mainstream economists."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Landsburg's book is entertaining and often witty, and written in a conversational, easy-to-read style. The book is very good at presenting often unintuitive and novel (to the non-economist) ways of looking at things. This is an invaluable book for pointing out common fallacies in arguments about deficits, inflation, unemployment, and other major political issues. At the same time, however, I can't help but think that Landsburg occasional misses significant relevant issues, most glaringly in the final chapter on environmentalism. For example, Landsburg describes a case where Jack wants a woodland at the expense of Jill's parking space and vice versa, and argues that the desires are exactly symmetrical. While environmentalists claim that the wilderness should take precedence \\"because a decision to pave is 'irrevocable'\\", Landsburg says \\"a decision _not_ to pave is _equally_ irrevocable\\" because \\"Unless we pave today, my opportunity to park tomorrow is lost as irretrievably as tomorrow itself will be lost\\" (p. 224). While this is correct, this misses the environmentalist's point that it is much easier to convert woodland to parking lot than to do the reverse. The environmentalist fears taking actions that are irrevocable in the sense that they cannot be undone in the future. Landsburg's perspective throughout the book seems to me to ignore the possibility of actions taken which may have consequences which may adversely effect the very existence of mankind (or economic institutions).Another example in the same chapter is when he suggests that the best way for environmentalists to support the existence of cattle is to eat beef: \\"If you want ranchers to keep a lot of cattle, you should eat a lot of beef\\" (p. 225). This presumes that environmentalists care about the number of cattle in existence, irrespective of their living conditions. Would Landsburg have told abolitionists during the Civil War to buy more cotton as a way of improving the plight of slaves?Yet a third example in the same chapter is about preservation of the Amazon rain forest, because a new species of monkey was discovered there in October 1992. Landsburg writes that this gives him reason _not_ to preserve the rain forest, since he \\"lived a long time without knowing about this monkey and never missed it\\" (p. 226). Would he make the same argument if it was a tribe of people whose existence depended on the rain forest rather than a species of monkey? If not, then he's missing the point of those who argue that animals (or the environment) have inherent value. It is clear from his writing that he disagrees, yet his own position does assign inherent value to the interests of people and so is not neutral. He seems to admit at the end of this chapter--in the letter he wrote to his child's teacher--that his view on environmentalism amounts to a religious view that is not subject to discussion (just as he thinks environmentalism itself amounts to a religion being inappropriately taught to his child).Despite my complaints, I found the book as a whole to be entertaining and informative, and would recommend it along with David Friedman's _Law's Order_ (I haven't read Friedman's _Hidden Order_) for insight into economic analysis of issues of the day."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"\\"Why do rock concerts sell out in minutes -- couldn't the promoters raise the ticket prices?\\" \\"Why does movie popcorn cost so much?\\" \\"How much harm is caused by government debt?\\" \\"Why is it hard to measure inflation? Output? The rich/poor gap?\\"This book is a series of loosely organized essays about \\"how economists think.\\" The target audience appears to be people like myself, who are interested in economics, but are not highly trained in the field. It's a good companion to \\"The Economics of Public Issues,\\" which focuses on real-world illustrations of basic economic concepts. This book focuses on how to approach analyzing the real world for yourself.According to the Introduction, many of the essays have grown out of discussions Landsburg had with his regular lunch group ... and what lunches those must have been! Questions are raised, and explanations batted about and critiqued. Assuming that Landsburg is a typical economist, the book succeeds spectacularly in illustrating \\"how economists think.\\" Many of the essays retain what must have been the original feel of the lunchtime debates (ideas are raised, then criticized, then rejected or refined) -- a form which sheds considerable light upon how economists approach problems. The essay about why economists are sometimes wrong is very enlightening. It describes why economists thought that unemployment and inflation were inversely related -- until government started acting on that assumption, which destroyed the relationship. While I'm not very good at macroeconomics, Landsburg's explanation of this is simple and persuasive, and creates more insights into how the study of economics works.As a series of essays, some are better than others. Landsburg slips easily between making arguments about issues to making assertions about issues. Since the target audience is amateurs like myself, it's a little hard for an untrained reader to critically evaluate the assertions, but (after much head-scratching) I think some of them are flawed. Landsburg clearly feels strongly about some topics, and it's possible that when he gets worked up about an issue he loses some of his open-mindedness. The essay on environmentalism beats up on environmentalist excess but provides little in the way of alternatives. (I worked for an environmental group at one point; Landsburg's critiques are largely accurate but veer off-topic and illuminate little.) He ridicules several prominent public figures (Felix Rohaytn, extensively, and several US presidential candidates from 1984-1992) for making statements reflecting economic illiteracy, but fails to address the issue: the public's economic illiteracy would instantly render unelectable a candidate who said the things Landsburg says.Still, distilling several years of what must have been stimulating lunchtime discussions into a book which can be read in a few hours is a valuable service. The reading is easy, the topics are accessible (for the most part), and the thinking is clear. Also, since these essays came from leisure time, they successfully communicate some of the joy of studying economic issues.The book feels like one long lunch with a great group. The more standoffish, angrier essays were concentrated near the end, so they feel like one guest had had one too many martinis and should go home rather than back to work. But they'd still be worth eating with again.(N.B. Landsburg has a monthly column for Slate, if you'd like to sample some of his writing or you liked this book and want more.)"},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Landsburg hits the nail on the head with this book. I was looking for a short and to the point explanation of economics for the benefit of my 17 year old daughter when I picked up this book and found that and more. His premise is that &quot;people respond to incentives and the rest is just commentary.&quot; Landsburg takes off from there and explains economic concepts with simple but apt examples and deflates quite a few myths in the process(using no formulas or complicated math in his presentation but including endnotes with references for readers inclined to look behind the words).College students would do well to read through this book before plunging into macro- or micro- economics because it puts the theory into perspective with real world examples and stories. Everyone else can benefit from having a better understanding of how our economy works.I highly recommend this book as informative, thoughtfully written, and thoroughly entertaining."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Enough has already been said about the perspective on economics that this book gives, and how it can give laypersons a good insight into the thought processes behind economic analysis. This review is in regards to the final chapter, an out-of-place editorial tirade entitled \\"Why I Am Not An Environmentalist: The Science of Economics Versus the Religion of Ecology.\\" (This chapter can be taken as an editorial afterthought since, unlike the other twenty-three chapters, it lacks any listed academic sources in the appendix.)It's possible that this final chapter on the evils of environmentalism is a clever satire not unlike Swift's \\"A Modest Proposal\\" (that the author himself references in chapter 15). Or maybe he's merely speaking point blank about his own ideas. Regardless, whether Landsburg intends to or not, he writes the perfect final chapter to a survey of economics: he exhibits the limits of the applicability of economic theory.What he either demonstrates or merely fails to take into account is that some things have worth beyond their immediate market value. Forests and other natural resources have consequence outside their economically-quantifiable use for paper or recreation. What Landsburg shows is that economics, which explains behavior though simplified models, falls short at the point where it fails to take into account actions that alter the world that contains the model itself.The ease and comfort (and the world that it takes place in) that economists are attempting to maximize through consumption is put at risk by that consumption itself. Explain the point through models, put a market value on trees, put a market value on oxygen, and use natural resources for their greatest economic potential, but if the ecosystem breaks down, it doesn't matter what the interest rate or money supply is; life quality will be inextractably decreased for the model world as a whole. If you prefer cleaner air, maybe you can move to a higher priced neighborhood as Landsburg suggests, but unless you're moving to another planet, there won't be a piece of real estate that is unaffected from the effects of environmental degredation. The economic model presented in this chapter fails to take this result into account.But it's not likely that Landsburg's beliefs are a satire. The letter that he sends to his child's preschool against their recycling program only mirrors the fanaticism and righteousness that he rallies against when he uses the analogy of an academic curriculum that includes environmentalism being akin to forced religious conversion.One of the most telling points of Landsburg's ignorance on the subject is that he continually confuses 'ecology' (a true science, arguably stronger in its hard scientific analysis and ability to predict outcomes than the social science of economics) with 'environmentalism', a social movement. Perhaps Landsburg should best stick to popcorn and avoid showing his ignorance of biology."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Three facts about economists teaching laypeople:1: Economists love to be counter-intuitive.2: Economists love to be controversial.3: Economists love to go on about their personal opinions as though they were fact because, after the above two points, no one feels he or she can defend any contradicting opinionThis book suffers from the worst of these points. Yes, economics is sometimes quite the opposite of what one might think and is very often \\"politically inviable\\" because of its conclusions, but Mr. Landsburg goes far too much into the rhelm of \\"I'm the author, you have to do what I say.\\" I, too, agree that, for example, enviromental policies are often extremely ineffecient. However, if these policies are important to others, if they bring happiness or, in other words, \\"utility\\" to a degree greater than the opportunity costs incured, that's their business. The book is scattered with his belittlement of the poor idiots who don't understand economics and if they did they would think like him.This is the sort of reason why people don't like econmists. This is why people think we're heartless prigs. If the people through whom this book must have gone before it was published knew enough about economics to defend their positions instead of just accepting the author as their better, they would have perhaps reminded him to tone down some of his particulars that he forms into generalities.To summize: Mr. Landsburg is an insufferable know-it-all, who does, in all fairness, know-it-some."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"This short and eloquent book does a mostly excellent job of explaining to non-economists how economic reasoning works in a wide variety of mostly non-financial areas. But it's frustrating how he can get so much right but still demonstrate many annoying oversimplifications that economists' biases make them prone to.For example, on page 145 he claims that a trash collection company could cheaply prohibit Styrofoam peanuts in the trash by checking everyone's trash once a year and fining violators $100,000. But anyone who thinks about the economics of such fines will be able to imagine massive costs from people disputing who is responsible for peanuts in the trash. Maybe there are cultures in which such fines would ensure negligible violations, but there are probably as many cultures in which disputes over people putting peanuts in someone else's trash cans would produce more waste than the peanuts do.His suggestion of applying antitrust laws to politicians is almost right, but ignores the public choice problems of ensuring that laws marketed as antitrust laws do anything to prevent monopoly. The details of antitrust laws are complex and boring enough that few people other than special interests pay attention to them, so special interests are able to twist the details to turn the laws into forces that protect monopolies.On page 183 he says \\"Flood the economy with money and the nominal interest rate goes up in lockstep with inflation\\". Given a sufficiently long-term perspective, this is an arguably decent approximation. But he's disputing the common sense of a typical reporter who is more interested in a short-term perspective under which those changes clearly do not happen in lockstep (on page 216 he provides hints at a theory of why there's a delayed reaction).He makes some good points about the similarities between environmentalism and religion, but it seems these points blind him to non-religious motives behind environmentalism. He says on page 227 about relocating polluting industries: \\"To most economists, this is a self-evident opportunity to make not just Americans but everybody better off.\\" Maybe if he included a payoff to the U.S. workers whose jobs went overseas, this conclusion would be plausible. But it's hard enough to figure out how such a payoff should be determined that I suspect he simply ignored that problem."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"This is a very good book for those looking to learn fundamental economic principles and the way they are applied in practical terms every day. Some of the analysis is deft and subtle and surprising while in other places he either ignores practical behaviour (he assumes that people consume an evening at the movies without regard to the movie being shown and that popcorn eaters always eat popcorn and make their movie decisions based on this). Most surprising is his abandonment of economic principles during his alarming rant against environmentalists and their \\"hysteria\\" where he admonishes a primary school teacher for preaching environmental conservation to children. I agree with the fundamental point of not indoctrinating youngsters but Landsburg overreaches and attacks environmental concerns as a form of mass hysteria rather than focusing on the economic principle of negative externalities and their social costs when the overwhelming majority of scientists (and economists for that matter) agree that there is a long term social cost which needs to be addressed by either a forced market (cap and trade for instance) or government regulation (less desirable from an economists standpoint). A good book though and he would be a lively, convivial and intelligent dinner guest at an intellectual banquet."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Landsburg apparently sets out to explain real-world, everyday economics phenomena (the subititle is &quot;Economics &amp; Everyday Life&quot; and the cover has every-day examples) but proceeds to merely use real-world, every-day examples to show that economics is inscrutable and political. He fails to actually reach any conclusions about most of the scenarios on the cover--or any others, for that matter--and continually concocts loaded scenarios that enable him to reach bizarre conclusions. The worst part about this technique is that it leaves the reader continually baffled--knowing that his conclusions are wrong but not sure why.Landsburg is best when he is talking directly about economics and worst when he applies theories of economics to law, science, and the environment.He concludes that air pollution is great because it makes a city so unlivable that poor people can afford it, ignoring the fact that real-world cities are always more expensive to live in than the (unpolluted) countryside and that cities--polluted or not--always contain lots of poor people and rich people.Landsburg claims that we shouldn't elect the best candidate for senator because that person's productivity is better used in private industry. He fails to take his argument to its logical conclusion and have the country run by autistic children. Apparently, he can't see that the work of a senator also has value and can actually be more beneficial to the economy as a whole than the work of a private businessman.He goes on to claim that the value of proving scientific theory with experimentation is mainly in giving credibility (and higher salary) to the scientist (it's actually in the economic value being right more often). He claims that there are &quot;high-powered&quot; research firms and &quot;low-powered&quot; research firms so that bad scientists can work at the &quot;low-powered&quot; ones and stay out of the way (high-powered firms are actually for theories with high profit potential, not high correctness potential). This shows that Landsburg thinks that science works like economics: theories don't have to be proven right before they are implemented.Landsburg's hatred of environmentalism, which is a recurring theme (he ends the book with a letter attacking his daughter's kindergarten teacher), is especially peculiar. He seems unaware that the destruction of flora and fauna is a permanent loss of not just value but a resource to the planet and its people. He argues that the value that could be obtained by destroying it is also lost if it is never destroyed; this is true (it's the definition of &quot;consumption&quot;) but there is a fundamental difference between a non-renewable rainforest and a renewable resource like wheat or cows. The rainforest can even provide us with value (exotic plants and animals, tourism, oxygen) without destroying it, making it a renewable resource. Perhaps Landsburg looks out on the Statue of Liberty and bemoans the waste of all that good scrap metal that could be had.He casually observes that since he never heard of a certain species of monkey, it didn't have much value. Well, that monkey has never heard of Steven Landsburg, but I'm sure that Landsburg and his family would say that the world is still a better place with him than without him. But the monkey and I am not so sure."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"This may not be the worst book on economics ever written, but it surely ranks among the most narcissitic and self-indulgent.Landsburg explores through 24 short chapters a number of myths, problems and paradoxes that confront the contemporary economist. The problems in the book fall into two general categories.First, Landsburg seems far more interested in proving his own cleverness and superiority than presenting useful discourse. Take this example: &quot;In my experience economists are extraordinary in their openness to alternative preferences, life-styles, and opinions.&quot; One senses that Landsburg could go on at length about the intellectual and characterological virtues of economists. Mercifully, one can fit only so much self-praise in such a brief volume.There are other examples, but let one more suffice: &quot;There is an appalling population of otherwise literate adults who prefer the poetry of Rod McKuen to that of William Butler Yeats.&quot; He follows this observation with a contrived scenario in which McKuen-lovers buy volumes of Yeats for public display so as to conceal their real preference.Now mass culture is certainly fair game for criticism, but Landsburg's contempt for anyone not a member of the allegedly superior economist class is so pervasive and mean-spritited that it finally is just offensive. He outdoes even himself in one chapter that is nothing more than a puerile diatribe against environmentalism.This arrogance might be tolerable if the text were otherwise virtuous. But failures of substance are legion. Many of the &quot;problems&quot; that he addresses are trite or have trivial solutions. There are numerous examples of inconsistency between chapters and, in at least one case, a hypothetical with analysis that disregards its own assumptions. Finally, some of his commentary is simply jejune, as for example his discussion of air pollution in which obvious externalities are somehow ignored.On the positive side, the book may have some use as a thought-starter; some of the problems posed are thought-provoking. And a pervasive theme -- that obvious solutions to economic problems may well be wrong -- is certainly correct.The failings here are unfortunate. Economics is a poorly understood science; and that poor understanding has led to misguided social and economic policies. Landsburg had an opportunity to produce a really useful volume here but was diverted by his own attempts at cleverness and self-congratulation. Too bad."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Not a very good book. The author is overly opinionated and not very open to conflicting ideas. He also does not do a very good job in educating the reader on economic concepts he uses to support his views. Overall, I would say it's not worth the time or money."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Non-technical economic writing usually takes the form of superficial - and often inexpert - commentary on ephemeral issues. Landsburg's work is different, in that his non-technical writing consists in the explication of complex economic concepts in lucid and entertaining prose. It is witty and perceptive writing, and is likely to be of enduring value. There are three absolutely priceless chapters in particular that are devastatingly funny and economically important: a list of economic howlers (such as that of the well-meaning, non-economist academic who believed that government spending involves no cost anywhere else in the economy); a shrewd description of the differences between environmentalism (which, in its non-economic form, is more like a branch of religious fundamentalism) and economic reasoning; and a superb exegesis of equilibrium theories of asset pricing. The last of those chapters covers my own professional field, and I can only say that the sport Landsburg has with those supposedly expert financial advisers who tout dangerous superstitions like 'dollar-cost averaging' ought to be required reading for anyone considering investing in the stock market.My only real criticism of the book concerns the ubiquity of Landsburg's premise, which he deploys over a range of subjects, that economic agents respond to incentives. That, of course, is absolutely right, but it is not the only reason that markets generally allocate scarce resources more efficiently than bureaucrats. A more powerful reason is the problem of information: market pricing is a co-ordinating system as much as it is a system of rewards. Even if men were sufficiently altruistic not to require incentives, they would still need information, of a type that dirigiste economic planning cannot provide.But this is a minor quibble. The book is great stuff."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Before I review the book, I have to provide a digression (I have to lay down these foundations before I can critique the book): There is nothing wrong with economics, it is a beautiful social science (I am a Ph.D. student in economics myself). What one has to bear in mind is that economics explains certain aspects of human behavior and how society works, it is a science, but not one without bounds. When applied methodically and correctly, it gives powerful insights in the subjects it studies. But one must understand that it is not without limitations, to name just a couple: economics is the study of \\"homo economus\\", it is by definition anthropocentric. I am not saying this is right or wrong, but certainly there are people who do not share the same view (environmentalists may think, for example, other species have rights too); another foundation of economics is that people are rational, but even economists admit that under certain conditions humans can be \\"unpredictable\\" or appear \\"irrational\\", and their preferences can be unstable (e.g. see Richard Thaler's works).Now back to the book. Landsburg labels himself as a libertarian economist, and he takes such doctrine as \\"free market\\" as religion. It is true that under perfect competition, low transaction cost, etc., free market will achieve the most efficient allocation of resources. However, we must not forget that the real world is full of obstacles to competition and transaction costs can be forbiddingly high. But though Landsburg claims that he is trying to apply economic principles to \\"real world\\" problems, but more often than not, he retreats into the simplistic assumptions of first year college microeconomics.Parts of the book are simply bad economics. For example, when one reader complains about the quality of air is getting unbearable in the city he lives, Landsburg comments: the fact that he did not move away proves that he is indifferent (between living there and moving away) after all (I actually couldn't locate this in the book at the moment, but I am pretty certain he said something along that line), completely ignoring elasticity (people are not perfectly mobile and can't just move from one city to another on a whim) and transaction costs.Parts of the book are bad writing. I've read the chapter about popcorns at theaters at least 3 times, to date I am still trying to figure out what he tried to say. Also as other readers point out, his arrogant and snobbish attitude permeates the whole book. He sounds like as if he's the only one who knows the answers to all the questions of the universe. Anyone who does not accept his logic is simply branded \\"unscientific\\". One gets the impression that Landsburg is not just impatient, but also a deeply insecure person.Parts of the book are not easy to tell whether they are bad economics, bad writing, or both. For example, in Chapter 7, he says that he is not sure why he spends a 3 cents worth of effort to grab a one-dollar bill. I understand that the whole chapter is about cost-benefit analysis, but to say that he \\"is not sure why\\" is misleading to say the least, because his private gain from this action is 97 cents so it makes perfect sense to do so. I am sure Landsburg actually understands this, but the way he tells the story is just a bad presentation and will make the layman scratch his head (as Landsburg puts it himself): are economists really so \\"dense\\"?Landsburg's attitude toward environmentalism and conservation is appallingly ignorant. He calls environmentalism \\"the religion of ecology\\" to imply how unscientific it is, but his own stubborn hatred toward the environment (not just environmentalism) and single-minded faith in libertarian economics are not a shred less unreasonable or zealous than any religious beliefs. I don't consider myself to be in the environmentalist group, and certainly extreme environmentalism has its pitfalls. But from Landsburg's writing, it is apparent that he never bothered to read the other side's arguments at all. For example, he says that if \\"you want large forests, your best strategy might be to use paper as wastefully as possible\\" (yes, he actually said \\"wastefully\\", chapter 24), but that is assuming people strictly care about the number of trees, and not the composition (diversity of the biota, native species vs. introduced species, etc.) of the ecosystem, not to mention the disturbance, distress and destruction logging can cause to the environment. To an environmentalist, a coastal Californian redwood surviving from Aristotelian times may well give her more \\"utility\\" (to use economists' jargon) than newly planted timber crop from lumber companies. It is pretty clear that Landsburg has not the faintest idea about these issues. In the same chapter, he also suggests that \\"we can pick up a lot of valuable knowledge by wiping out a few species to see what happens\\", well, have we humans been doing that for, uh, the last few centuries? Need we count the number of species that have been wiped out and are being wiped out everyday? Have we not learned anything yet? (certainly not Landsburg).Actually, one should not equate Landsburg with the word \\"economist\\". Fortunately for us, there are other economists with more reasonable, patient and perhaps humble minds. For example, for the topic of environmental economics, I suggest the reader (and Landsburg) read John Krutilla's \\"Conservation reconsidered\\" for a more sophisticated and reasoned argument about conservation."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Here is an example the kind of question that Prof. Landsburg asks, but not one in this book.In Europe - at least all the parts of Europe I have visited or lived in - Chinese restaurants are almost always empty. Typically these restaurants are plush inside: they are heavily carpeted, exotic objects such as vases and jade Buddha statues are commonly seen, and expensive furniture, often in dark wood with a high polish, is found. Beautifully folded serviettes are seen on the tables. The restaurants are usually empty.Italian restaurants, on the other hand, are often full. If one neglects to make a booking, there is a high probability of finding no place at dinner time. These establishments are usually cheaply done out: chipped Formica tables and tubular steel chairs of unfashionable vintage are common. Decoration may include plastic grape vines hanging from nails in the wall or ceiling, and perhaps clusters of old Chianti bottles gathering dust. Wall murals, naively painted, of fictional Roman ruins might decorate the plastered walls.Both Chinese and Italian restaurants make a significant proportion of their income from take-away food. Pizzas, especially, from the Italian restaurants. The Chinese restaurant in my village makes 80% of its turnover from take away food. The Italian restaurant less than 50%.Why have the proprietors of Chinese restaurants so obviously over invested in their establishments?My theory is this. There is a sufficient degree of racism in Europe that Chinese restaurateurs are obliged to display the equivalent of the marble facades of 19th Century banks. They must brand themselves as sophisticated luxury establishments in order to sell take-away food. Otherwise, too many people would suspect that the chicken may be rat meat and the pork, stray dog chops. But I am not sure. I wonder what Landsburg would think?What do you think?Read this book to find out how Landsburg formulates and answers these kind of questions. Have fun."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Landsburg does more to explain what economics is really all about then all the textbooks I've read put together. It should be mandatory reading for all highschool civics classes. Great illustrations of proper economic thought processes that will enlighten all readers of any age."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"I found the book very entertaining as well as educational. I particularly enjoyed the authors disection of many day to day situations that apparently do not make sense.The author's columns in Slate are also enjoyable."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Reading the reviews of The Armchair Economist show people's amazing lack of understanding of value. What I value is not necessarily what you value AND vice versa. People value things differently from others, and nothing has innate value. Something only has value if you are willing to pay for it (people will assume here that I only mean money, but I also mean paying for something with time, emotion, thought, or any other type of effort, not just money).Many of the reviews bash Landsburg for being an anti-environmentalist and accuse him of arrogance. The reviewers are clearly environmentalists, and value the environment (however they define it) more than Landsburg, so declare themselves superior by saying how inferior he is. Landsburg's point is that there ARE competing views. There are real costs imposed on people due to environmental regulation that exceed the benefits that these regulations are supposed to bring about (the fact that costs outweigh benefits for environmental regulation is typical). One of his parables goes something like this: Imagine two towns, Cleanville and Smogville. Cleanville has clean air, but has $10,000 homes, while Smogville has dirty air, but $5000 homes. These towns are identical in all other aspects. No one is forced to live in either town, so people can freely move to EITHER town. The people who live in Smogville choose to put up with dirty air to have cheaper housing. Those that live in Cleanville think that $5000 is a reasonable cost to have clean air. But now somebody decides that Smogville's air should be as clean as Cleanville, so introduce legislation cleaning up the air, which results in a house in Smogville to cost $10,000. Now those that chose to live in Smogville because of cheaper housing (i.e., those that think $5000 is not a reasonable cost for clean air) are hosed. The choice of cheaper housing (at a cost of dirtier air) was taken away. THE CLEAN AIR LAW IMPOSED A $5000 COST ON EVERYONE IN SMOGVILLE WHO LIVED THERE, BY THERE OWN CHOICE, THROUGH HIGHER HOUSING COSTS.Those that don't like this arguement deny there is any trade off. They think clean air is always more important than cheap housing and treat those who would dare to choose otherwise as soft in the head. If you choose clean air over cheap housing, there are others that choose cheap housing over clean air. If you choose cars that get a lot of miles to the gallon over power and speed, there are others that choose power and speed over getting more miles to the gallon. And so on and so forth. Different people prefer different things. Markets are used to negotiate these differences to maximize happiness and utility.In other words many reviewers don't know what they are talking about and do not understand economics. They don't understand that preferences for recycling are not shared by everyone. For them, that's okay- they'll impose their preferences through legislation, mandating recycling. This decreases the overall wealth of society because this legislation denies people the opportunity to negotiate, maximizing happiness and productivity. The legislation categorically declares recycling superior always, in every situation.Economics is not counter-intuitive as many write. It merely shows that by using a little common sense, what we perceive as intuitive is really just bias and myth that we've learned throughout our life.Now that my rant is over, I'll review the book. Landsburg begins the book \\"Most of economics can be summarized in four words: \`People respond to incentives.' The rest is commentary.\\" That's the whole book in a nutshell. Incentives matter. Change the incentives and people change their behaviors. Landsburg illustrates this with many stories such as seatbelts cause accidents. They do this because people feel safer driving a car, so are less attentive to their driving, so have more accidents.I think this book stands out from many other popular economics books because it goes more deeply into the typical topics. Also, the book contains topics not normally found in popular economics books, like the Coase Theorem. I had to reread this section because the Coase Theorem was difficult for me to grasp.I highly recommend this book. It's not always an easy read, but it is enlightening."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"The book arrived on time and in the condition stated.

Landsburg delights in winding his readers up, but the writing is a lot of fun, the analysis is always sharp, and the book is strongly recommended.

My only reservation: David Friedman's \\"Hidden Order\\" covers a lot of the same ground, and is perhaps even better."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"The author seems to contradict himself here and there, beyond which he makes horrible logical mistakes when he gets into talking about the income gap (IMO)."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"I bought this book for my brother who is an Economics and Mathematics double major.

Fun ans easy read."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"I am generally a big fan of Steven Landsburg. I loved his The Big Questions, which you should buy and read right now. I had some trouble with The Armchair Economist, though. Too much of it seems designed to be simply provocative-for-provactiveness's-sake. For example, to start at the very beginning, in a good discussion about incentives he says that safety features like seatbelts on cars are a wash. I don't know how to reconcile that claim with the fact that driving deaths are at their lowest since 1949; I am not talking percentages--last year had the lowest total number of deaths even though we drove 46 billion miles more (these are Dept. of Transportation numbers).Or later on he presents an argument about polygamy that seems absurdly divorced from reality in that it suggests all parties are equal players in a competetive \\"romance\\" game. Romance? I won't rehearse here the horrors of Warren Jeff's domain.Those reservations (and more) notwithstanding, I would still recommend the book. I guarantee that you will wander about your daily life reflecting on the presence and effects of price discrimination. And best of all is Landsburg's tone--engaging, funny, witty, insightful, open. Even when you disagree it is great fun, and that is worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"For you all you people who learn with words, and not charts and figures... this book will help you understand economics entirely with words!"},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"I found this book to be fascinating. It definitely helped me reconnect and reinterpret the economics lessons I learned growing up and cast new light on arguments I would not have anticipated.The authors recasting of the free trade issue with the example of cars grown in Iowa is worth the price of the book and the time spent reading it alone. The Armchair Economist does a great job of demonstrating the complexity of the world we live in with respect to economics and also helps to point out ways of simplifying and trying to understand it.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"A fascinating book, the main theme of which seems to be debunking economic myths through teaching people the science behind the drama. It does contain plenty of straightforward explanation, but Landsburg continually returns to topics which have caused the most confusion and controversy, and attempts to show us why our thinking is plain wrong. Chapter 21 on the economic logic of free trade, based on an argument by his friend (also a popular economics writer), David Friedman, is a classic. The previous chapter shows how to *really* make money out of the stock market, which is also thoroughly entertaining. The debunking of unemployment and wealth-disparity statistics is another fascinating contribution. There is so much meat in this book that if you read it for its strengths, you will definitely gain an insight into the way your world works, and deepen your perspective on it.However, the book does also have weaknesses, as other reviewers have pointed out. The logic is simplistic at times, even melodramatic, and the conclusions are too sweeping, but I don't see a reason to care - if you adopt a take-it-or-leave-it approach, you won't get sucked in. Don't give it to your 12 year old, who might be impressionable, but you yourself can use your own critical thinking skills, and enjoy the challenge of finding the holes in his logic. There was still one catastrophic low-point for me, at the end where he reprints an abusive and sarcastic letter he penned to his daughter's primary school teacher. This is the only place where I concur with other reviewers that the deficient logic and derogatory tone are worthy of some condemnation. The problem is that, whilst Landsburg's intellectual opponents are not named anywhere, here he did actually send a letter addressed personally to a teacher, full of the bitterest complaints, all directed at someone in an underpaid profession who was just doing her job, and the letter is reprinted in full. The problem is nothing more than trying to rear children with a respect for nature and the health of their planet, as a way of inculcating civic virtues necessary for future society, but Landsburg sees it as moralising and fundamentalist. I can see why he has a right to disagree, and to de-programme his unfortunate daughter, but not to write abusive letters, and certainly not to reprint them shamelessly in a public manner. A sad moment in an otherwise superb book - highly recommended, but a raspberry for that last bit."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Some economics books read more like a manual of technical instructions, designed only for those with a PhD in economics, yet Landsburg's witty writing and precise examples keep the book entertaining enough that it's hard to put down.Landsburg does get a bit caught up in some heavy-handed language and technical jargon in a few chapters (most notably in the middle of the book), but the rest of the book more than makes up for it. In short, The Armchair Economist is a must-read for anyone who doesn't know anything about economics but would like to."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"This is the rare book that will have you thinking about it months after reading it. The author presents some of the most basic principles of economics in an accessible format. For anyone who missed out on taking econ in college, this book is a useful read.However, a few things keep this book from getting 5 stars. The author's hyperbole often borders on distracting, and a few of his conclusions seem unsupported by the evidence presented. Also, the author did not always distinguish between his opinions and economic analysis. In a book like this, the line between theory and opinion should be clear.If you liked Freakonomics and you are looking for more economic reading material then you will probably like this book."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Excellent and EASY TO READ book on life and what economics has to say about it.

I've come across some good books that I couldn't put down. Landsburg's Armchair Economist was good enough to keep reading, to the point that I read the whole thing, but in the end it was the worst book that I've entirely read.Only about half the content was worth reading. The editor was a genius in that he cut up all the material and put one good paragraph after every bad paragraph. The result is that the materially is perpetually choppy, and you can't remember the details of any one story he told. As long as you finish one paragraph and start a new paragraph, you can never definitively say you must stop reading right now. Then, by the time you read the last chapter--done!Oh yeah, and if you're looking for answers to those questions that are splashed across the cover, such as \\"Wouldn't they sell more popcorn if they charged less?\\" Forget about it. I'll spoil it for you. He doesn't answer the question at all. In fact, he answers very few questions. He just raises more questions, such as:- Why is he still holding a grudge against his child's elementary school teacher?- Why does he hate people without economic training?- Is his love for economists a healthy love?- Has he ever researched or discovered anything on his own? Or his job to interview other economists at lunch and report his findings?In summary, the author manages to illuminate the typical (\\"bad\\" to use his own terminology) economist's thought processes on various topics. He asks a lot of unrelated questions he never answers. He preaches his viewpoints. He pats himself on the back. And he kicks a lot of monkeys along the way."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"This book is a good read; it's fun, entertaining, and factual correct. Landsburg explains simple concepts through the eyes of an economist with blinders on. It's an interesting read where pages seem to fly by. For an educational book, it flows as freely as a novel, and is incredibly gripping for something about economics. He presents different scenarios, from the price of popcorn to government debt, and shows how a true economist would view each situation in small bite sized chapters. It's both refreshing, and at some points, eye-opening.One problem is that he tends to simplify everything way too much. It's hard to relate what he says to the real world when many of the details are gone. For example, when explaining national debt, he talks about the lending rate, and the rate of return to being exactly the same. He doesn't explain what would happen if they were different.Another problem I had is the lack of continuity. He seems to switch from one topic to another without any direction. Sometimes, the types of arguments were repeated from one hundred pages ago, while the previous page had nothing to do with the current page. With about 30 or so seemingly random arguments and situations present, it's hard to place it all into any lesson or theme.Finally, and most importantly, Landsburg seems to take out his aggressions and displays some mean spirited rants in the latter part of the book. I felt that it incredibly hurt his credibility. When someone starts debasing someone else's opinion vehemently and atrociously, it gives the impressions of fanaticism rather than cool-headed thinking. He seems to enjoy criticizing every line of particular papers and making the writer feel like an idiot. He even goes so far as to reprinting a letter he wrote to his daughter's kindergarten teacher espousing the horrors of environmentalism and how the teacher is indoctrinating his daughter into it.I would recommend this book as good, fun, quick read. As an educational piece, it needs to be more organized and more levelheaded."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"I found this book very well written and thought provoking. Importantly, it rekindled my interest in economics (I last studied economics at college in 1992) and made me realise that there is more to economics than just discussions and graphs about unemployment, deficits, inflation etc. The best achievement of this book is it gives you a peep at how an economist may think about any issue. You wouldn't regret buying this book, I can assure you.I would also recommend the author's &quot;Price Theory and its Applications - 4 edn&quot; published by South Western (part of Thomson Learning group).Very strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"i got it. i got it on time. it was necessary for my econ class in brigham young university. yeah."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"This was a great book.A lot of people don't bother to think arguments all the way through when they make them, and this author did a great job when he took sample letters (from the paper) and carried the arguments contained therein to their logical conclusions. (The Sound and the Fury chapter).In addition, sometimes people who like to read about Economics as a hobby don't notice a lot of the little things around them that need explaining. (Popcorn prices at movies.) This book does explain many of those things.Lastly, the author does his best work by uncloaking the environmental movement as a religion and NOT as science. It is telling that he went against a coreligionist (a Jew) in stating his objection to the indoctrination of his child with a religion just as quickly as he went against a Christian for brining Santa Claus into the classroom.The entire book was worth the purchase price if for no other reason than the chapter on environmentalism."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"The \\"Armchair Economist\\" by Steven E. Landsburg is written well, and written to be read quickly. It seems many economists have a lot of time to contemplate the answers to \\"why\\" questions.One of the many realistic quotes and comments I liked is: \\"People respond to incentives. The rest is commentary.\\"This is a fun and informative read. Landsburg makes everyday economics that we deal with logical yet realistic and funny. As we know, economics (and many other fields) are not exact \\"sciences\\" and opinions often differ. Economists are good at saying why something happened in the past, and why something is happening now. But predicting what will happen in the future is extremely difficult.Some titles of the many chapters are:*Why The Rolling Stones Sell-Out.*The Mythology of Deficits.*Choosing Sides in the Drug War: How the \\"Atlantic Monthly\\" Got itWrong.*Why Popcorn Costs More at the Movies and Why the Obvious Answer isWrong.*Telling Right From Wrong: The Pitfalls of Democracy.*Truth Or Consequences: How to Split a Check or Choose A Movie.This book also notes the many concepts we hold to be \\"true\\" as not being so true, or, as being significant as they seem.Landsburg states in the \\"How Statistics Lie\\" chapter (to paraphrase): statistics to don't lie, but the truths they tell are often misinterpreted. The government and journalists often use different indexes to measure inflation and the economy at the same time. (the Consumer Price Index (CPI) includes airfare prices, but not prices on computers.)COLLUSION:On the topic of collusion, Landsburg provides a point too many of us fail to recognize:\\"When an industry is dominated by two highly profitable firms, theory tells us that if there is no price war then there is probably collusion. In the case of the Republicans and Democrats the requisite collusion is on display for all to see. It is called bipartisanship.\\" (page, 146.)\\"When the President of United runs into the President of American at a picnic he is forbidden by law to say, 'I will not undercut you on the Chicago-to-Los Angeles route provided you do not undercut me on New York-to-Denver.' Yet we allow Republicans to greet Democrats with offers like, 'I will support housing aid to your urban constituents if you will support agricultural programs for famers in my district.'\\" (page, 147.)Ahh....the absence of political anti-trust legislation.The \\"Armchair Economist\\" is great for thinking and talking about common things we constantly come across. It's fun, too. An enthusiastic author explained everyday economics, and made it enjoyable. A rare feat, indeed."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"for the layman. This book presents an economic way of thinking to the public, sometimes taking a &quot;shock therapy&quot; approach, in which he seems to deliberately avoid the arguments for positions that would be most likely to convince people of his conclusions, primarily because conclusions are not so much what this book is about; it is about the arguments, which will be foreign to many people. While he is surely sometimes glib, don't assume that the reasoning is always invalid if you disagree with his conclusion; sometimes your conclusion is wrong, and if it is not you should gain something by making yourself determine why it is not. (E.g. while later in the book he drops this assumption, many of the first several chapters assume that all consumers are identical in their tastes. Figure out how dropping this assumption would change the results, and to what extent his conclusions are still valid.)Another illustration: in his last chapter he attacks environmentalism. There are environmental arguments against recycling, but he refuses to make them, in large part because they would confuse the real issue, which is his right to a preference set. It should be clear from his previous discussion that what he is objecting to is not the notion that pollution imposes a cost, nor that it is improper for people to want a clean earth; he is defending his right to a preference set, and not to have it itself dismissed out of hand.The glibness and sloppiness that cost him his star may well make the book more effective for what it was intended -- to introduce a way of thinking, and follow it to its sometimes unexpected conclusions."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"The author has some neat ideas, a nice turn of phrase and a dry wit. However, this book is wildly opinionated and often poorly justified. The author is demonstrably ignorant of topics outside of economics. Biology and climate science are particular weaknesses which are embarrassingly used in far too many examples. I have never classified myself as an environmentalist but when reading the author's anti-eco tirade I couldn't help wondering if this was a joke. It reads like the author and his friends, all paid-up Republican-voting supply-side economists, decided he should write a book that discredits all those nandy-pandy liberal ideas that are ruining America. If only, he argues, we had purer and freer markets everything would be fine. Every problem is the result of interference in the magic distribution of Smith's invisible hand. The author has clearly no idea of jurisprudence either. This is the key problem of the book. It's simply not rigorous in its justifications of sometimes outlandish-seeming claims, particularly improbable-seeming behavioral predictions. It's so flippant, you wonder whether you're supposed to take any assertion seriously.The result is a political manifesto masquerading as a book about economics. I accept that the two are related. As a political manifesto, it's not without its merits. The problem with its moral/political judgements is that we've just come out of over a decade of \\"light touch\\" regulation in financial markets and the net-effect has been a global financial catastrophe where the very rich are being bailed-out by the relatively poor. All brought about by other economics lobbyists, with similar beliefs to the author, succeeding in reducing federal regulations on the financial services industry, instead advocating self-governance.

So I looked his book up on amazon, read a few of the posted reviews, and bought it (second hand, of course).The book was not great, merely all right. There are 24 chapters making varying points about economics, and they could be read independently or even in reverse order. The writing style is breezy and humorous, but the quality is uneven. Some very good chapters, with titles like \\"New, Improved football, how economists go wrong\\", and \\"The mythology of deficits\\". And also some real clunkers, like \\"Random Walks and Stock Market Prices: A Primer for Investors.\\"I was hoping this would be a book I could recommend to normal people for insight into economics (it's not called \\"the dismal science\\" for nothing), but I'm sure there are better books around.DIGRESSION - The best short one volume book on investing and saving is still Andrew Tobias's book, \\"the Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need\\", first written over 20 years ago and most recently updated in January, 2005."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Steven Landsburg takes a number of seemingly absurd statements and shows them to be true.

Mr. Landsburg went out on a limb on a subject he seems to know too little about and it shows. 23 5 star chapters and 1 3 star, can't win them all."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"To be fair, this book has moments that are very funny, some of the funniest I've ever read in economics, and Lansburg provides some economic insights into social problems that are truly enlightening, such as his comments on competition among the sexes for mates, competition among political parties for voter-consumers, and his lucid explanation of what the &quot;random walk&quot; of stock prices really means. However, I could not finish the book for the style in which the ideas are presented. First, the prose is not fluid. Lansburg often wanders in his argumentation, leaving the reader behind to anticipate where he intends to go with his analogies. The result is a lack of transition that makes you want to read the chapters over again to absorb what he is saying. Second, he contrives some overly simple hypotheticals to drive home his points, and these don't even survive a moment's critical reflection. Granted, his economic arguments, however outlandish someone else may think them to be, are correct, but his models are so abstract as to have little relevance in the real world. Most importantly, Lansburg is guilty of making straw men out of his opponents' arguments. More than once Lansburg makes his opponents' arguments into weak, brittle little straw men and then proceeds to hack them apart. Lansburg's arguments are correct and proven in the literature, but he is an argumentative bully. As a final criticism, I would say that a few of the chapters are downright awful.(I wonder if other readers will understand any of it.). On the flipside, Lansburg is very funny, and you won't find any falsehoods in the book. So, my advice is to skip the book, or read discerningly, skimming the poorly written chapters. Economists were never known for their writing ability, but you can probably enjoy a book buy Paul Krugman (Age of Dim., Peddling Prosperity, etc.) a lot more. (Krugman is also more current.) --Lewis Gainor, Mizzou Econ"},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Landsburg's book should be entertaining for persons interested in learning basic economics. His style is a bit questionable, in that he can occasionally be found lost in self-argumentative circularism. I found David D. Friedman's book 'Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life' a more valuable book. As a singular example, his discussion of the price of popcorn in theaters seems, intuitively, better than Landsburg's."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"I decided to read this after reading Landsburg's MOre Sex is Safer Sex. Like that book the Armchair Economist was a very interesting read. This book goes into more traditional economics than More Sex is Safer Sex but it was still interesting. It was written in the mid 1990s so seeing how things have evolved in our economy and the world was interesting backdrop. Unfortunately the book ended on a slightly sour note for me. Landsburg shared a letter he wrote to his daughter's kindergarten teacher about how she and the school pushed environmentalism and recycling on the kids. I can understand his viewpoint but in my mind the letter came across harsh and bitter. The book would not have lost anything had the letter not been there so I'm quite surprised the editor allowed it. That aside, I still highly recommend the book. He does a great job explaining economic viewpoints without numbers, charts and graphs."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"If you want answers ... look elsewhere. The author addresses many questions from \\"everyday life\\", but seldom provides credible answers.Of course, he seldom claims to; what he does is point out the flaws in conventional wisdom, e.g. regarding why popcorn is expensive in movie theaters. Sometimes he provides multiple theories, sometimes none at all.I'd advise taking the harsher reviews with a grain of salt: the author doesn't claim to reveal any profound new economic theories, and the wise reader will recognize that that sort of thing is to be found in peer reviewed academic journals, not pop-econ books.The author points out the flaws in some generally held truths, provides some solid, fundamental tools of economic thought with which to address them, and leaves the reader to his own devices.What he accomplishes is to provide the reader with interesting puzzles to ponder, and some guidance on how to begin.The end result is less like an economics textbook, and more like one of those \\"philosophy puzzles\\" books (e.g. http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/0312314523).If you want to learn economics proper, start with the Schaum's outlines on Micro/Macro/International economics, or a good econ text. If you just want some extremely enjoyable, light reading that will make you really think, Landsburg delivers."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Armchair Economists was a book that compared thoughts of economists to everyday people through examples that pertain to everyday life. Only reading the first few chapters I found it was easy to understand because the author gave examples from his own life and included the differing points of views. Before i read this book I did not realize how economists came to their conclusions but it become more clear throughout the chapters. Economists do seem to make things more difficult then they seem but that is because they realize that more then one thing effects the outcome of different situations. For example one of the scenerios in the book was the fact that people became more reckless when safety features were put in cars. My thought at first was that people just got use to driving and became more reckless because they thought other people would look out for them. But in fact people have realized they have less of a chance of dying due to the fact that more safety laws and more safety features have been added to cars. Some of the examples in the book didn't make sence to me but many were justified not from assumptions but from facts and reasoning. Overall the chapters I read in this book were very good. It wasnt boring because the author used examples to simplify the problems presented. It was interesting seeing how economists reason compared to the assumptions of other people."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"In this collection of essays, Landsburg introduces the reader to how economists think about the world and teaches a number of fundamental economic principles, from the power of incentives (the lynchpin of economic analysis) to the first and second fundamental welfare theorems (which don't sound interesting, but believe me, Landsburg makes them fun). He examines seatbelt laws, financial markets, government deficits, and the war on drugs, all along giving clear, instructive, and humorous examples to make his points.Both this and another popular economics book, Freakonomics, show how clear thinking can clarify the world. The Armchair Economist relies more on hypothetical examples to demonstrate how one might think about life \\"economically,\\" whereas Freakonomics uses empirical research to demonstrate a few interesting cases where such thinking has established very counter-intuitive results. I recommend both. If you would like a sample of Landsburg's work before buying the book, you can go to Slate.com and search for \\"Landsburg.\\" Those articles are similar in tone to the ones in this volume.One can undeniably disagree with elements of Landsburg's arguments (and he sometimes seems to go out of his way to be caustic), but he is demonstrating how one boils scenarios down to their most basic elements (another key aspect of economic analysis). The real question, then, is only partly whether you agree with his specific assumptions but also what insights this kind of simplification may offer (even if you disagree with some assumptions). Landsburg suggests that the simplification can greatly clarify our analysis of the world. This book is less about whether you agree with Landsburg and more demonstrating how you might use his tools (with whatever assumptions you feel good about).For example, his final chapter on environmentalism makes assumptions that will rub some readers the wrong way, but the key (and true) point he makes is that protecting the environment involves trade-offs that should be weighed like any other trade-off, even though public debate in this area sometimes takes a form more similar to religious ideology. (Some people embrace a form of environmental protection as part of their ideology, but if this is the case, they should treat it as such when presenting it to others.)"},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"The criticism of this book seems to be largely based on the feeling that rational economics leads to unsatisfactory political conclusions and even possibly that rational economics is itself a suspect theory.My take is that this is a pretty fun read that illustrates some basic economic concepts via common examples. True, it is not comprehensive and the arguments presented are neither completely thorough or precise. But then again, that's not what I'm looking for from a book about economics with the word &quot;armchair&quot; in the title.Anwyway, if rational economics isn't a good model, what is? Central planning? Keynesian economics? European socialism?The criticism here is of a worldview, not this book. It should come as no surprise that to those whose political views tend to conflict with rational economics, this book is threatening and must indeed seem highly political. But imho, the political agenda is in the eye of the beholder. When you point a finger, there are 3 pointing back at you.Quit picking a fight about epistemology with a country pastor."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"This book isn't even something I would typically refer to as a book. It is more a cobbling together of blog-like material, short articles, rants against things and people in the popular media that the author doesn't like, bad examples of economic thought-processes that simply collapse at the first poke of logical analysis, and contradictory arguments.Don't get me wrong - I absolutely love economics, one of the most beautiful and fascinating sciences we have. I am not an economist, but am a successful business owner, fairly smart, well educated, and no slouch when it comes to analytical thought.This book falls flat, not because of the subject matter, but because of the way it is presented. It seems more an attack on everything that ever annoyed the author. Ideas that might otherwise have been well presented seem somehow warped to serve the authors underlying opinions and politics, and the ideas suffer for it.The author also displays a good bit of ignorance of things outside the field of economics, which damage the examples he uses to show economic ideas.For example, much of the book amounts to rants that point out, directly or indirectly, his views on the stupidity of \\"environmentalists\\" and the \\"religion of environmentalism.\\" There are places where he makes assertions which are scientifically wrong, then draws conclusions from them. I found myself wishing he had done even a little research on basic biology and ecology.This isn't an issue of pro- or anti-environmentalism. Whichever side of the fence you fall on in regards to the issues, you will be disappointed with the lack of thought or knowledge behind much of this book.That said, the author obviously has a good understanding of the tools and theories of economics (he is after all an economist), and if you are willing to set logic and critical thinking on the shelf for a bit, you may get some benefit from this book, but you will have to wade through an awful lot of ego and narcissism to get it.More likely, you will end up with the impression that the author knows how to use the tools but uses them to create constructs that simply collapse.Chances are, if you've read the excerpts and marketing material for this book and think it sounds like something you would like to read, what you are really looking for is more likely to be found in \\"the undercover economist\\" or \\"naked economics.\\"(This is where I would normally end a review, so you can stop reading here if you like - the rest is my personal reaction to a few specifics.)A couple specific issues:I normally try not to address specific issues as part of a review, because I know my personal responses may not apply to other readers. I do have a few specific responses that I just can't resist bringing up.These are MUCH more personal than my general review above, so please take them with a grain of salt.1.One chapter describes how the author and some buddies have lunch (he said every day) and discuss \\"big mysteries\\" that seem to have stumped them. One of these questions is why ticket prices don't go up for certain performances that regularly sell out and have lines of people camping to buy tickets. He points out some economic principles, then mentions a theory that somebody offered to him, which seems pretty sensible. He then concludes by saying that this theory could be the answer, but nobody really knows. It's this type of mystery that economists theorize about and try to solve every day.Honestly, when I was done laughing, this nearly made me put the book down. I know the author is discussing theory, but it reminds me of a statement by Alan Greenspan (I forget where he wrote/said it, but it stuck with me ) that he was shocked by the number of economists that have trouble differentiating between theoretical models and the real world of people, decisions, and data.I strongly suspect that if Alan Greenspan wanted to know why ticket prices don't go up under certain circumstances, he'd have a first-year intern pick up the phone, hunt down some of the people responsible for setting ticket prices for these performances, and ask them. Sure, you may not get an economically sound theory dropped into your lap this way, but it should get you a lot closer than endless pontificating over coffee and bagels.2.In another chapter, the author uses the Simpsons to illustrate a few points about benefits and fixed resources. The argument goes something like this: The only thing to do in Springfield is go to the park, so the city of Springfield puts in a new, publicly funded aquarium, which is free to visit.Now the Simpsons can go to the park or the aquarium, which initially sounds great. However, since the \\"cost\\" of standing in line at the aquarium will exactly balance the enjoyment of going to the aquarium over the park (short line, people join, long line, people leave, causing equilibrium), the Simpsons gain absolutely no benefit from going to the aquarium over the park. In fact, nobody gets any benefit from it, or any other publicly owned resources, because economic benefit comes only from owning fixed resources.This may be economically sound theory and modeling (I think some economists might disagree), but I suspect that if you asked the people of Springfield, you might find that they assign some value to the CHOICE of whether to go to the park or the aquarium, or the ability to alternate, rather than just go to the park every day.I'm not sure if, technically, choice itself is a fixed resource, but people do derive benefit from the ability to make choices. This is clearly shown in the business world. Also, while the Simpsons may be cartoons, most families and people are a bit more complex and can't just be load balanced like a busy network server.Real world people and families have attributes like boredom, enjoyment of new things, drug dealers at the park, a daughter who just saw \\"finding Nemo\\" and demands to see fish for her birthday no matter how long she has to stand in line.This isn't a problem with the model, which is great for describing an idea or making a point, or predicting something to be verified by empirical methods. It's a problem with the authors seeming certainty that this simple model can then be taken and successfully applied to the complex real world.You could also point out that, since the park is also publicly funded and is not a fixed resource, by the same logic it also adds absolutely no benefit to anyone over just staying home and staring at the wall all day.If you wanted to stretch this logic a bit, the author seems to be saying that your choice between a day at the park, a day at the aquarium, a day at the beach, a day at a national park like Yellowstone or Yosemite, a cruise on the ocean, or any other activity that utilizes public (not fixed) resources adds absolutely no benefit to you or anyone else over just sitting home counting the number of times your ceiling fan goes around.3.When you get right down to it, this isn't a book about economics, it's a book about the authors opinion on environmentalism. There is nothing wrong with that in itself, but this book makes a promise, that it is a book on economics, which it fails to keep.I fall somewhere in the middle on environmental issues, but positions aside, if you are looking for an interesting book on economics, this probably isn't it.What discussion on economics you find here is mainly buildup for the main argument, which is an angry tirade against anything and everything environmental, which ends (literally, the end of the book) in a letter that the author purportedly wrote to a kindergarten teacher, chastising her for teaching children about recycling.Ironically, the author talks a lot about equilibrium and balance in this book, in terms of economics. The only real balance I find here is that he seems to exactly balance out the rabid people that you find out on the extreme edge of environmentalism (as on the extreme edge of anything), by being almost exactly like them, only with an opposing anti-environmental opinion.He seems completely impassioned, angry, ignorant (though not of economics), and certain that anyone with a differing opinion must simply be stupid, since he is so obviously right.Again, there's nothing wrong with that, since it's his book.However, as a reader, I don't like to pick up a book that presents itself as an interesting romp through some light economics and then discover that it's really an angry sounding, extremist argument from either end of the enviro-political spectrum."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"I have never taken a course in economics, and I recently decided that I should learn something about it. The Armchair Economist is the first (and so far only) economics book I have read. Overall, I am glad I started with this book.Professor Landsburg states that many lunch time conversations with fellow economists concern what they consider to be interesting puzzles in economics: Why does popcorn cost so much at a movie theater? Why do grocery stores print coupons rather than just lowering the price? What happens if the government forces a plant to stop polluting? This book discusses these and other topics in a way that is easy to follow, and depending on your sense of humor, quite funny. (Landsburg's humor is sort of sarcastic, which I appreciate.)Landsburg does not claim to solve this economics puzzles in a real world, that would be much too complicated. Instead, he shows the lay reader how economists attempt to simplify the problem to be able to extract some truth from the situation. For example, he analyzes the effect of factory pollution on land prices, leaving out all other factors (such as public health).I especially appreciated the last two essays, &quot;The Iowa Car Crop&quot; and &quot;Why I am not an Environmentalist.&quot; Although I don't agree with many of Landsburg's conclusions, I am certainly glad that I started my economics studies with such an insightful, and interesting teacher."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"The Armchair Economist does an excellent job of explaining why the obvious answer is the wrong answer to many questions about the marketplace. It's a good read; some economics popularizations fail to couple examples to the real world, and this volume explains a lot of commenplace situations in a small space.I would have appreciated more of the math. I realize that mine is a minority preference, so I suggest to the author that he produce a companion volume with the same sequence of chapters as The Armchair Economist. Each chapter of the proposed companion volume would give the math that underlies the corresponding chapter of The Armchair Economist."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"A modern iteration of Bastiat's &quot;Economic Sophisms&quot;.

This book does an incredible job of presenting the essential tenets of economics in a memorable, witty, and easily understood manner. Equally as important, Dr. Landsberg explicitly defines the realm of pure economics vs. policy. An incredible, thought-provoking read. I would gladly trade three undergraduate economics courses for a detailed review of this book."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"This is an accessable, fun read. I also read Fair Play and More Sex is Safe Sex by Landsburg. He is the best author in this area."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"Steven Landsburg makes the world of economics fun and accessable in &quot;The Armchair Economist.&quot; Please read this book if you would like to understand an economist's outlook on life. If you like this, you will also like David and Milton Freedman's books with a similar tone."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"While the book has some interesting parables and anecdotes and is an engaging look at some problems from the &quot;man is a rational agent&quot; perspective, this mantra starts to get a bit tiring after a while (and is also starting to sound a bit dated with recent developments in the field).My main gripe however was the author's style. Arrogant and condescending, I found the book hard to get through at points - despite being interested in the content."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"I really enjoy Landsburg's style of writting. His many numerous examples of how to apply economics to everyday life are humerous, interesting, and instructive. However, I'm not a complete beginner to economics and I'd already heard or read many of the examples he gave which took away from a lot of the fun in reading the book.In addition, as I am a scientist doing research a major university trying to develop new theories to explain how to engineer better catalysts I must state that I didn't agree with his explanation of why some scientists produce more theories than others, etc. He didn't seem to believe that it was difficult to develop new original scientific theories which I strongly disagree with, and so I lowered my rating of the book from 5 to 4 stars.If you're new to economics then buy the book. It's great! But if you've been around the block a few times, you'll probably find it a bit boring."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"This is the first book that has moved me sufficiently to write a review on Amazon.I found it an entertaining read, with some though-provoking ideas often wittily written up. It is such a shame, though (and I read a review here from someone else with similar views) that the text is threaded so liberally with the author's private conceits. What a very smug and self-satisfied man.Again agreeing with a previous review here, in the end the sheer arrogance becomes offensive and begins to overshadow the arguments being put forward.I'm glad I read the book. I'm also glad, however, that I shall likely never meet Steven E Landsburg."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"I read the excerpt and the chapter titles and thought this author is brilliant! When I actually read the book, it was horrible. The author summarizes everything by saying, everything balances itself out because the market will revert to where it's supposed to be. For example, if everyone received a $1 increase in salary, then no one would be ahead of the game. He applies this theory to every topic that is previewed in the book.I had huge expectations which the book did not deliver. It's been a pain to just finish the book."},{"Title":"Armchair Economist","review":"There were some good concepts here, but the stories meant to use the ideas all went astray. Each application of an economic principle to the story changed the result, and when he stopped with one conclusion, I always wondered why he didn't take it one more step and reach the opposite conclusion. It seems that any conclusion wanted can be reached. His arrogant commentary left me distrusting his chosen conclusion. Maybe economic theory isn't so useful after all.Much better was 'New Ideas from Dead Economists.'"},{"Title":"Clinical Voice Pathology: Theory and Management","review":"This text is required for my graduate level voice disorders class for Speech Pathology. After reading the text, I found that it was poorly organized and difficult to read. This book does not provide a glossary and never defines many technical terms. I found myself reading the text with a dictionary open. I also found it odd that some of the voice techniques were randomly embedded in case studies. For example, the proper way to shout is located under a case study on phonotrauma in children.

She handles the religious subject matter skillfully; these are pages that you want to continue through, right to the unpredictable andintriguing end."},{"Title":"The Priest's Madonna","review":"\\"The Priest's Madonna\\" is a trip through time, into the heart of human mystery. Civilization and convention are presented as a veil and a cultural maze that two engaging characters use and avoid in their search for love and meaning. This is a suspenseful, exciting story, based on a real myth in the south of France. Hassinger's research is detailed and rich, and her intriguing characters grow out of her fascinating informaton about the area. A \\"must read\\" for anyone interested in how history and myth intertwine, frame and affect our lives."},{"Title":"The Priest's Madonna","review":"I enjoyed The Priest's Madonna on several levels. The author moved the characters and action through time so gracefully and created a wonderfully strong sense of place. And the way she went beyond the biblical accounts of Jesus' life to draw characters that seem so real was also impressive. But what I like best is the honesty about faith and doubts. What a refreshing perspective these days when so many people are so sure they have all the answers and they're right."},{"Title":"The Priest's Madonna","review":"In 1884 sixteen years old religious skeptic Marie Dernanaud and her family move to the nearby village of Rennes-le-Chateau when their home burned down. At about the same time Father Berenger Sauniere takes over the town parish. Berenger is a family friend having met Marie for instance when she was nine. Though fifteen plus years older than her, she found him fascinating then and even more so now as a teen; he reciprocates her feelings. However both hide their feelings for one another behind religious debates especially since he temporally lives with her and her family while the townsfolk renovate the church.The fixing up of the church leads to uncovering a tome, a map and a strange ancient stone carving. Excited and encouraged by the mayor's wife, Simone Laporte, Marie investigates the enigmatic artifacts found buried deep inside the church. She begins to trace a possible descent from a relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene while her beloved priest sells them out for shekels.This is a fascinating thriller that is at its best when Marie investigates the church mysteries, but loses some steam with too many subplots including a deep look at a Jesus-Mary relationship and the seemingly always Templar effect. The change over time of Berenger from idealistic charismatic believer to dishonest skeptic is deftly handled while the opposite happens with Marie. The deep look at first century Judea is also excellent, but with all this going on, Marie is overwhelmed though she is the center holding the tale together. Still fans will enjoy this Christian historical mystery.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Priest's Madonna","review":"Brought up Catholic the young nine year old Marie Dernanaud had no reason to doubt her beliefs and was in awe of the handsome, jovial friend of her mother, Father Berenger Sauniere. When at sixteen, a fire destroyed their home, Marie and her family moved to the beautiful village of Rennes-le-Chateau where their welcome was less than warm. Soon a new priest was assigned to the local parish bringing their old friend back into their lives Father Berenger and into their home.At about that same time the very curious Marie had formed a friendship with the enigmatic Mayor's wife who in lending her books opening up a new world and a difference of opinion over certain doctrines taught by the church. Adding to the Marie's confusion and increased physical feelings for Berenger, were Berenger's new-found wealthy patron and their religious debates over church doctrine.When renovations in the church uncovered clues as to long held rumors of the existence of a woman claiming to be descended from the bloodline of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, Berenger becomes guarded with each new discovery even as his illicit relationship with Marie intensifies.*** On the heels of a certain best-selling made into movie book, I find that a lot of authors seem to be jumping on the bandwagon in researching and creating their own theories on the possibility of the Jesus and Mary Magdalene connection. From the authors copious notes at the back of this book this author has certainly done her research in blending a large amount of historical fact into her fascinating well-written and highly imaginative fictionalized story.Running parallel with Marie and Berenger's story, the author weaves in Mary Magdalene's story as a follower of Jesus by representing them as they would have been addressed in the ancient Hebrew/Aramaic language of Yeshua (Jesus) and Miryam (Mary). Unconventional yes, but it seems to work in this body of work. Whether the insinuations of Jesus' bloodline are true or not, with Mary Magdalene - prostitute or not; wife or not; or another virgin conception - only God knows! Fascinating? You bet!The author did her homework in discovering that Berenger Sauniere was indeed a parish priest in the village of Rennes-le-Chateau (1885-1917) where during the church renovations he did, in fact, become extremely wealthy. Also, his longtime servant and companion, and rumored lover Marie Dernanaud, was known in the village as the priest's Madonna. The story is fascinating, bravely done and one that should hold the readers attention throughout! If Hollywood were looking for a sequel to that other well known about to be released movie this just might be the ticket!"},{"Title":"The Priest's Madonna","review":"While I love reading books, audio books have been the very convenient for me on those long commutes home. This audio book has been the best I've heard in a long time. The author ability to weaves both stories of Marie and Berenger along with Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene are simply riveting. While an author can put so much time and effort into researching and writing a wonderful book it's a terrible waste when the Narrator does a poor job of reading the book. I was delight that that was not the case for The Priest's Madonna. Anna Fields does a superb job of telling the story to the listener. She gives each character their own voice and personality and well.... it was captivating!I'll be frank, had I purchased the book and tried to pronounce any French words I would've been discouraged and wondered if I was saying them correctly. Anna certainly had no problem with French or Hebrew pronunciations. This was wonderfully written and beautifully told. A must for audio book lovers!"},{"Title":"The Priest's Madonna","review":"This is a beautifully written book. An absorbing, well-researched novel filled with mystery, romance and touches of humor.Set in southern France in the late 19th century, the novel tells the story of young Marie Dernanaud and her life in the village of Rennes-le-Chateau, her family, friends and fervent love for Father Berenger Sauniere.The forbidden romance between Father Berenger and Marie is believable and is one of the most striking aspects of this book. Their relationship was not an easy one, but rather full of confusion, anxiety and guilt. Beneath these struggles, however, was an unyielding love that neither could deny. This moved me significantly. Together, they embark on a journey of faith that leads them to question the bond between the divine and things of worldly origin.Entwined with the story of Father Berenger and Marie is a narrative of Mary Magdalene set at the time of Christ. Here, the author appears to jump on the current bandwagon of considering a royal bloodline originating from Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. I am Roman Catholic and do not take the notion of such a bloodline seriously. However, it is with this fictional aspect that the author neatly ties in the mysteries in the village of Rennes-le-Chateau.It is worth mentioning that Father Berenger Sauniere and Marie Dernanaud are not complete works of fiction. Though their legacies are interspersed with rumor and mystery, they indeed lived in Rennes-le-Chateau in the 19th century.The Priest's Madonna is a captivating read. Very few books will I consider rereading, but I will most certainly revisit this one."},{"Title":"The Priest's Madonna","review":"Do you like a good mystery? A love story? An historical novel? A theological inquiry? In \\"The Priest's Madonna\\" Amy Hassinger manages to give us all of these in a well-paced and lush novel that never suffers from an identity crisis. This book deals with some of the same themes as Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" but in a very different way. While Brown's book satisfies in the way an order of salty French fries satisfies after a night of overindulgence, \\"The Priest's Madonna\\" satisfies like a five course French meal with an excellent bottle of wine. Sophomore novelist Hassinger writes with a maturity that is extraordinary. She uses parallel and paradox to unfold the stories of Marie (and Berenger) at the end of the 19th century and Miryam (and Yeshua) at the time of Christ. Her female protagonists have that same quality of combined strength and vulnerability with which Margaret Atwood imbues many of her most interesting female protagonists. At times I found that I wanted a bit more development of Berenger's and Yeshua's characters, but in the end I concluded that because Marie's story was told from the first person and Miryam's story was told from the personal third person, the development of the male characters was just right to evoke that sense of mystery that the female protagonists found attractive in them. Reading this book left me with the same feeling and question I had years ago when I read \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\" - how can a book that is so descriptive and literary make me want to turn the pages so fast?"},{"Title":"The Priest's Madonna","review":"Hassinger does a great job presenting a clear, absorbing story centering on a relationship between an enigmatic priest who has committed himself to supporting the church, and a young woman who finds herself increasingly skeptical. The young woman's voice and the life of the 19th-century French town are convicing, and the author never lets the real-life mystery of Berenger Sauniere lead the story into ridiculous speculation. The pace never drags (a real achievement for a book with open religious themes), and the book's mysteries kept me hooked."},{"Title":"The Priest's Madonna","review":"I found The Priest's Madonna to be a compelling and delightful read on many levels. It is a love story, a mystery, an adventure, a treasure hunt, a meditation on faith, and a vivid historical reconstruction of both late 19th century southern France and Palestine in the time of Jesus. It is very well written and researched. I like things spiritual and this book grapples with the mystery of faith: how to keep it, how to lose it and how to regain it. Amy Hassinger convincingly inserts herself into the minds of two young women: Marie of late 19th century France and Mary Magdalene. Marie is a young intelligent passionate heroin confronted with the incredibly attractive person of a priest who is also a family friend. He contrasts so vividly with the narrowness of the local male population. She falls in love and struggles with the elicit nature of her love (the object of her love equally struggles). The details are totally compelling. The author has a great imagination. There is a parallel story of Mary Magdalene in which New Testament episodes are presented through her eyes. They are vividly recreated and some brought me to tears in their beauty. Just as Marie yearns for the priest, Mary Magdalene yearns for Jesus. This is a different, more human, but still divine Jesus. It was very interesting to learn about the Cathars. Their story is the historical background for the action in the main story and provides the connecting link to the Mary Magdalene episodes."},{"Title":"The Priest's Madonna","review":"Hassinger's second book shows the significant maturation of her craft. The Priest's Madonna, set in 1890s France, is indeed a literary novel - a romance noir a la Wuthering Heights that is also possessed of a Poirot-like mystery. It is deftly written and researched and evidences complex relationships between characters and to place. More importantly, however, it's a damn good read, something that can't always be said about the thousands of other literary novels that have flooded the market in recent years. Hassinger melds introspection with action - her characters do things rather than merely brood and wring their hands, and yet like real people, their actions do not always fulfill their desires. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in the all-too-rare combination of a thought-provoking, empassioned read with a fast-moving plot."},{"Title":"The Priest's Madonna","review":"When I first saw this on Amazon I thought ick. They couldn't find a better picture for the cover? I know people should not judge a book by its cover, but lets face it pretty covers attract people, and this one aint pretty.That being said, I have to give this book a glowing review. The writing was outstanding and the story was solid. I enjoyed the sexual tension between the characters. Each character was well done. The plot moved quickly. I had a hard time putting this novel down and finished it in two days. This book has interesting twists and turns and I believe anyone who likes historical fiction will like this book."},{"Title":"The Priest's Madonna","review":"While this book was well written, it took me months to get through it. It just didn't hold my interest. I had to force myself to read until the end. I found the author going back and forth with the two stories between Jesus & Mary Magdalene and the priest and Marie, distracting. I did not enjoy this book. It doesn't mean the book was bad; it just wasn't my cup of tea. I'm not going to recommend it because of my own personal tastes, but others, I see, did really enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Priest's Madonna","review":"Here's an historical romance that is both engrossing and thought-provoking. A skillful blend of fact and fiction, written in vivid, graceful prose, the novel engaged this reader on several levels:-As a tale of forbidden love between a woman and a holy man, it raises timeless questions about the relationship between intimacy and spirituality, worldly and divine love.-Well-researched, it offers a rich, persuasive evocation of ancient Judea and late 19th century France. The compassionate descriptions of Mary Magdalene are tender and moving.- As an entertaining story, it is a well-paced mystery with believable twists and turns and surprises that shed light on character.All in all, a captivating, satisfying read!"},{"Title":"The boke named The governour (Everyman's library)","review":"I was very pleased to find an etext version of this once well-known and now obscure conduct book written during the reign of Henry VIII of England.

Original and conceptual, the author Major General Jagjit Singh, a renowned General from the Gunners, outlines the role of artillery as a vital instrument of victory in war. In a remarkable portrayal of the power of the gun in past battles, he brings out that it was the army with a stronger artillery which won the day.The book traces the historical background to the Indo-Pak War of 1971, the military crackdown by Pakistan on its Eastern province, the escape of 10 million Bengali refugees into India and the eventual involvement of India in a third bloody round with Pakistan.In a style simple and lucid, combined with the professional touch of a front-line soldier, the General describes the battles fought on the Western Front, with an incisive evaluation in the case of major battles. Depicting these in graphic detail, he gives an account of the role played by Indian gunners, the Honour Titles bestowed on artillery units for their outstanding contribution and the courage displayed by individual officers and men in almost every single action.The book concludes with a few thought provoking views on India's defence preparedness - stressing on self-reliance in military hardware, greater interface between the politician and the military, full activation of the concept of a National Security Council, and the need to appoint the Chief of Defence Staff, while highlighting, in particular, the vital requirement to strengthen the artillery punch of the Indian Army.A valuable contribution to India's military history and national security."},{"Title":"Bushcraft: An Inspirational Guide to Surviving in the Wilderness","review":"British survival expert Ray Mears' newest book \\"Bushcraft\\" will give you good advice for when you wonder out in the wilderness. It covers all basic survival skills, from where to find food and water to how to make shelters and fire, and it does this for all kinds of environments, from the desert to the arctic. Although Mears himself looks like your average English office clerk, his knowledge of nature and survival, partly learned from hunter-gatherers like Australian Aboriginals and African Kung San bushmen, is truly impressive. Through a number of survival courses I did myself, I found out that the techniques described in Bushcraft work well, but they often do require quite some practice to master.The book is filled with attractive colour photographs from Mears' trips to remote locations like Alaska and the Honduran rainforest, also covered in his BBC television survival series. You have to realize though, that because of the book's weight and dimensions, it's not really a practical field guide for in your rucksack but more a book that you would comfortably read at home.And it almost looks like Mears was in a hurry to finish the book, because the last chapter, about finding food, ends rather abruptly and contains very little information on hunting and trapping while Mears acknowledges that these are fundamental bushcraft skills. Finally, a note to foreign readers, you might need a dictionary for translating the English plant, tree and animal names."},{"Title":"Bushcraft: An Inspirational Guide to Surviving in the Wilderness","review":"I have Ray's The Outdoor Survival Handbook, which is far more suitable as a real handbook.

Anyway, because it have far more informative illustrations and more verbose text, it's far easier to get a complete knowlege about basic surviving techniques, meanwhile the handbook may have a pocket in your backpack.It was quiet frustrating to get it after almost three months of waiting with the unquestionable evidences of its origin.

Aira is a strange and somewhat scattered novelist -- I am not sure if he has control over his forms, and sometimes, as in \\"How I Became a Nun,\\" he seems to want to relinquish control -- but his pace, his wit, his descriptions, and even his philosophic asides are tremendous. He is genuinely surprising. It's not just the plot twists that took me by surprise, it was individual descriptions and sudden parenthetical comments.An aside on philosophic asides. This book is full of them, but none are over 1/2 page long. they aren't laboriously planned and unfurled with trumpet fanfares, like some of Milan Kundera's. They aren't faux-philosophy -- dogmas and cliches masquerading as paradoxes and profundities, as in Cees Nooteboom or Javier Marias. And Aira's philosophic asides aren't arch, ironic, and elliptical, as in Umberto Eco. When Aira wants to say something about representation, reality, expression, or communication, he does so brilliantly and quickly.As an art historian, I wouldn't recommend this for understanding nineteenth-century painting, although there is some good material on Humboldt's theories of nature. No: it's fiction, and very inventive, odd, and unpredictable. If Aira can discipline himself the way Pynchon did to write \\"Gravity's Rainbow,\\" he will be one of the principal novelists of the next few decades."},{"Title":"An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter (New Directions Paperbook)","review":"Recently a friend of mine went to Buenas Aires and returned with this short novel.

In a very brief preface, Bola&ntilde;o also suggests the influence of Witold Gombrowicz, the enfant terrible of Polish/Argentinean literature.

Long famous in his native Argentina, his works are becoming available in English, in the case of AN EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF A LANDSCAPE PAINTER, through the fine translation by Chris Andrews. Aira is a writer of style, wit, immensely gifted descriptive prose, and a mind that pays homage to magical realism without mimicking it. He is an original!In this short novel Aira blends history with fiction in his recounting the adventures of Johann Moritz Rugendas, a gifted draughtsman and painter who is making his second visit to South America to paint the landscapes of Chile and Argentina from 1831 to 1847. Trained and influenced by the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, whose scientific vision of 'physiognomic totality' (definition of physiognomy:'a theory based upon the idea that the study and judgment of a person's outer appearance, primarily the face, may give insights into their character or personality. The term physiognomy is also used to refer to the general appearance of a person, object, or terrain, without reference to its underlying or scientific characteristics') Aria wished to apply to painting. Rugendas is accompanied by a fellow German Robert Krause, a man whose paintings by Rugendas' standards were poor but whose demeanor made him the perfect friend and traveling companion. Together the travel through the Andes, longing for adventure such as Indian raids to paint, and eventually wander into the pampas of Argentina where they encounter life altering experiences: Rugendas is struck twice by lightning and dragged by his terrified horse, an accident which peels the skin from his face leaving him severely disfigured - but undaunted. The remainder of the 'episode' relates how Rugendas, now requiring massive doses of morphine to control his pain, encounters Indian raids that he and Krause sketch and paint.In Aira's words 'An artist always learns something from the practice of his art, even in the most constraining circumstances, and in this case Rugendas discovered an aspect of the physiognomic procedure that had so far escaped his notice. Namely that it was based on repetition: fragments were reproduced identically, barely changing their location in the picture...the fragment's outline could be affected by perspective. As small and as large as the Taoist dragon....Repetitions: in other words, the history of art.' And just as Aira is able to address cerebral issues such as this and incorporate them into his character's mold, he is also able to write some of the most comical prose encountered in literature today. Aira's spectrum of writing skill, even in this small volume, is amazing. He is at once able to entertain with wildly inventive storylines while enhancing the reader's knowledge and wrapping it all in balanced comedic and dramatic terms. The next novel to be translated is HOW I BECAME A NUN - and we can only hope that the rest of his output is made available to us soon. Highly recommended author, highly recommended book! Grady Harp, June 07"},{"Title":"An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter (New Directions Paperbook)","review":"Holy crap, this is a masterpiece. A tiny, weird, 87 page masterpiece. Aira's portrait of Rugendas has an easy going, almost flat tone to it. Which might be why the incredible way he curls sentences about art and seeing around and through each other works so well. There is this ominous sense of space at work throughout the book, of the physical presence of the blasted, Argentinian pampas which is somehow always right in front of you, yet also delicately remote, somehow just past perception. Nearly every paragraph in this book has at least one deliriously recursive sentence which seemed to turn the whole world as the characters and as the reader perceive it, inside out. Very few writers are able to do that with such consistency, but for whatever reason, several of them come from Argentina. Aira writes from an odd little world that is somehow completely his own. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter (New Directions Paperbook)","review":"This intense little book by Cesar Aira is compelling and mysterious. At 87 pages, it is more a novella than a novel. And, like the Clint Eastwood film \\"Million-Dollar Baby,\\" it starts out as one story and turns into quite another story midway through.That initial story reminded me in many ways of the Andrea Barrett novellas in Servants of the Map. As with the British surveyors mapping the Himalayas, the German landscape painter Johann Moritz Rugendas, an historical figure, is drawn to spend long years away from his native land chronicling the lush and exotic world of Latin America in his drawings and engravings. The author describes his fascination with the flora and fauna, the geology of the landscapes he visits in Mexico, Haiti, Brazil and finally Chile and Argentina, where the action of this story takes place.From the beginning, however, Aira focuses on his own preoccupations -- how do we perceive the world, and how do our interactions with it shape those perceptions. Rugendas develops a style of landscape painting that his patron Alexander von Humboldt dubs a \\"physiognomy of nature,\\" embracing the whole of the world reflected in the painting.As the narrative proceeds and takes its turn, the role of our own subjectivity in these perceptions becomes paramount. How Rugendas perceives his surroundings and how he translates this into his art changes because of changes in his subjective view of the world. At this point, Aira informs us that Rugendas's \\"physiognomy\\" is what we would come to call \\"surreal.\\"Rugendas's fellow artist and faithful companion Krause is a foil for these reflections. He is a platform where the reader can seek refuge from the maelstrom presented by the changes in Rugendas.The novel, while tracing the real career of an historical figures, veers into the surreal. When the two Germans are forced to stay in a hospital in San Luis in the Argentine pampas, Rugendas tells Krause he had a nightmare filled with strange monsters. His companion informs him that this was no dream, that these strange beings, \\"half-man, half-animal, the results of cumulative genetic accidents\\" really did inhabit this hospital in the middle of nowhere. It was a revelation to Rugendas. \\"What an amazing coincidence! Or correspondence: it suggested that all nightmares, even the most absurd, were somehow connected with reality.\\"The painter was fascinated by the idea of being able to sketch an Indian raid in the area of Mendoza, a provincial capital just below the foothills of the Andes. Finally, he gets his wish and is present when the Indians emerge from the forests to raid for cattle and women. \\"The morning was truly glorious, perfect for a raid. There was not a cloud in the sky; the air had a lyrical resonance; birds were combing the trees. The lid had been taken off the world specifically to reveal the conflict, the clash of civilizations, as at the dawn of history.\\"In the brief space of this novella, Aira is metaphysical, scientific, dramatic, and, at times, surprisingly comic. His story of Rugendas is profoundly unsettling and yet it opens the reader to a new awareness of how we perceive the world around us.A short preface by the late Roberto Bolano, currently everybody's favorite Latin American author, describes Aira as one of the top three or four best writers working in Spanish today."},{"Title":"An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter (New Directions Paperbook)","review":"An Episode In The Life Of A Landscape Painterby C&eacute;sar Airatranslated by Chris AndrewsNew Directions, 87 pages. ($12.95)No one is eager to talk about it, but every reviewer faces the dilemma of how much attention to pay to prevailing public opinion. Fortunately, in the case of C&eacute;sar Aira--like Roberto Bola&ntilde;o and a handful of other wonderful writers--that's not a problem, because a critical perspective has yet to crystallize around Aira and the 30, or 50, or according to his latest translator, 70 novellas he's written in the last decade or so. That An Episode In The Life Of A Landscape Painter is a masterwork of story telling and prose writing cannot be disputed, but when it comes to explaining just what makes it so good, critical voices falter. What seems clear is that Aira's prose is simultaneously strange, unprecedented, and yet in some important way familiar. His methods remain unpredictable, yet the results quickly come to feel like a part of the reader, as if one has always been reading this book, or isn't now reading it but hopes to get back to it soon. Like we had been waiting for this experience, and now it's finally here.Part of the quality that makes Aira irresistible is sheer talent. He can write the kind of paragraphs that leave a discerning reader hungry to read them again, but out loud, and preferably to someone else. An anecdote early in An Episode hints at how such compelling passages arise. The protagonist's great-grandfather was trained as a clockmaker, but had to start over when an accident took his right hand. Rather than abandon the skills he'd practiced since childhood, he redirected them into drawing and painting with his left hand. Meticulous training, practical adaptation, and methodical deliberation gave him preternaturally precise draughtsmanship: \`An exquisite contrast between the petrified intricacy of the form and the violent turmoil of the subject matter.' Something similar may have happened to an experienced translator--Aira's day job--whose inner, creative turmoil finally overflowed the precise use of language he'd practiced daily for decades.What makes an Aira novella unmistakably his, in spite of the wildly inventive subjects and plots and the range of sub-literary genres he draws from freely, must be his approach to the actual process of writing. An outspoken partisan of el continuo, his term for constantly forward motion in a story, he has called his own technique fuga hacia adelante: flight forward. Painters among his readers will understand that an artist who meticulously prepares, working from sketches, preparing a ground, and finally filling in the colors, who examines the results and then makes changes as necessary, will get a different result from one who brushes paint on an unprepared canvas and takes directions from the spontaneous result. Aira's method is similar to the second, or to a brush-and-ink or watercolor process permitting no penitence. Aira composes episodically, supposedly in coffee shops, and should it go badly, he continues to write forward until the problem is resolved. The result, when he's \`hot,' is one of those sections that soars and rushes along, hypnotic prose that generates surgically precise sense impressions that can build to overwhelming intensity. Then when he resumes, he may very well be in a completely different narrative mood, and the result may be a change of direction, a philosophical digression, or (in one of the best-known cases) a sex change for the protagonist that goes un-remarked upon within the text.Johann Moritz Rugendas (1802-1858), the landscape painter of the title, was born and died in Germany. The men in his family had been documentary painters for generations, and Aira identifies him as not only the best of them, but the finest documentary painter of all. He is surely one of the most influential. How he became a painter, spent half his working years in Central and South America, and established his reputation on the work he did there forms the introduction to Aira's tale, in which the novelist shows how Rugendas' circumstances and his response to them, like his great-grandfather's response to the loss of his hand, came together to produce a watershed moment not only for him, but for art. Before him, the family business was painting the warrior caste in Europe and their battles. But Johann Moritz had the misfortune to come of age just after Napoleon's defeat, at the beginning of what he foresaw would be a long peace. Realizing his predicament, he left his teacher and enrolled in the Munich Academy of Art to study nature painting. Then as now, a graduating student was expected to take on a kind of thesis project, though Aira compares Rugendas' next step to Charles Darwin's decision to sign on for a sea voyage as the captain's companion. The failure of Rugendas and his new employer to get along is another deciding circumstance: while the expedition met with disaster in the New World, Rugendas was able to pursue his own interests.Aira tells this story as efficiently as a summary, but in more forceful prose, bracketing the names of factual objects with evocative adjectives and strong action. I couldn't help comparing this lithe, fast-moving story telling to where creative nonfiction seemed to be headed before being hijacked by memoirs wallowing in self-regard. A novelist's decision to take real people hostage as fictional characters can cause a deadening rupture in the reader's suspension of disbelief. Aira avoids this pitfall by carefully controlling his proximity to the painter. Rugendas took copious notes throughout his travels, which aided him in turning his thousands of sketches into finished works. He also wrote long letters to his family and colleagues. By anchoring his point of view to this documentary record, Aira delivers a convincing illusion that combines the verisimilitude of fiction with the factual accuracy of a biography.Rugendas returned to Europe and published a journal of his travels that brought him to the attention of Alexander von Humboldt, whom Darwin called the greatest scientific traveller ever, and who is known to us as the father of modern geography. Humboldt had already put forth the goal of setting down in one place everything known about the earth, with his priority on visual presentation as the most direct. He urged his theory on Rugendas and urged him to confine his art making to the tropics, where the density of mineral and vegetable data was richest. But a secret, life-long desire drove Rugendas: he wanted to explore the absolute emptiness that he anticipated finding on the Pampas of Argentine. Attempting to reach it led to the devastating title \`episode,' and subsequent events reveal how Rugendas' character enabled him to translate Humboldt's process for portraying the rain forest into a model of anthropological study and presentation. It's not as dry as that makes it sound, and the challenges of carrying fragile art materials in nature and the sequence of sketching, note-taking, and synthesizing images makes for a story that can stand beside the accounts of Monet, van Gogh, and company as they learned to paint al fresco half a century later.The popular imagination sees the artist as a romantic figure propelled by cyclones of inspiration, but Aira writes two to four novellas a year--some of them based, like this one, on 19th century history, others set in his neighborhood and full of surreal whimsy--and Rugendas is important to him because of the way, in the face of adversity, he got back on his horse with his sketch pad and returned to work. When the trackless plains of the Pampas presented him with new battles, this seventh-generation professional was ready to depict them, to rise above the fray and capture truth on both sides. He faces philosophical questions here, but ultimately what matters to Rugendas, as to Aira, is the work. Making art saves Johann Moritz Rugendas, and An Episode In The Life Of A Landscape Painter ennobles C&eacute;sar Aira."},{"Title":"An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter (New Directions Paperbook)","review":"In history, Johann Rugendas (1802-1858) was a documentary landscape painter who worked principally in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina. According to Cesar Aira: \\"His mission was one that, a hundred years later, would have fallen to a photographer.\\"In AN EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF A LANDSCAPE PAINTER, Aira imagines Rugendas undergoing both a physical and artistic crisis. In doing so, Aira shows Rugendas sensing the precarious status of an artist. And, he shows Rugendas aware of the limits of his style of representational art, which requires him to create \\"systematic interrelated\\" landscapes that intuitively convey \\"climate, history, customs, economy... flora, fauna...\\"For a time, Rugendas addresses this artistic problem by experimenting with oil sketching, a technique \\"...exploited systematically by the Impressionists only fifty years later.\\" But he also thinks he might overcome the limits of his style through the cathartic effects of catastrophe. In particular, Rugendas thinks that by witnessing, say, an earthquake or a raid by Indians, \\"...something... would finally emerge to defy his pencil and force him to invent a new procedure.\\"Well, long story short, Rugendas experiences a catastrophe and--poor guy--gets what he wished for. This is \\"the episode in the life of a landscape painter\\" and it enables Rugendas to take a new approach to sketching. Initially, his concept is \\"...that the lines of a drawing should not represent corresponding lines in visible reality, in a one-to-one equivalence.\\" Ultimately, this theory, the side-effects of a terrible accident, and the excitement of frontier life enable Rugendas to bring out the \\"hidden strangeness\\" in his creations, which \\"would be called \`surrealism' a hundred years later.\\"In describing the experiences of Rugendas, Arias captures the push-and-pull of artistic growth, as ideas and sensibility interact with unpredictable life. While I couldn't follow Rugendas through all his tormented insights, Arias is usually careful to ground them in terrific concrete writing. For example:\\"The tongues of flame flickered higher, splashing the Indians with golden light, illuminating a detail here, another there, or plunging everything into a sudden wave of darkness, animating the absent gesture, endowing mindless stupor with a continuous activity... Owls began to moan deep in the woods and the terrified Indians were captured in swirls of blood and optical effects. In the dancing firelight, their features drifted free.\\"Not for every taste but very good.

Seller sent on time, and book was in wonderful condition."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"In Purple America, Rick Moody renders the modern, suburban landscape in such vivid tones that he reminds us of the two Johns, Cheever and Updike, but his liberal use of stream-of-consciousness, his extensive catalogings of scientific and cultural lore, and his authorial observations have more in common with such post-modern literary icons as Thomas Pynchon and John Barth. What sets Moody apart from these writers, however, is his precipitous leap across the void of ironic distance, into a territory of unabashed, genuine, perhaps old-fashioned sentiment.Because much of the novel's subject matter is grim and even unbearable, Moody might have employed a less risky strategy of making the characters and their often dire dilemmas campy, or cartoonish. One of his major characters, for example, is a woman whose physical state has approached the vegetative, who has to be bathed and fed, who urinates on herself, who communicates with the greatest difficulty, but instead of putting distance between her and readers, Moody brings us up so close, with such precise and vivid details, that she becomes utterly real, and we experience the full range of emotions--pity, revulsion, admiration, love--that the characters close to her feel. Remarkably, Moody also creates humor from such characters and their situations, inviting readers to laugh frequently and heartily, not at the characters themselves, but at the absurdity which lies at the heart of such grave human affairs as love and death.Moody's achievement comes in a wash of brilliant language that renders both the concrete and abstract in original and sometimes startling ways. This novel isn't for those who think language should be invisible, that a house is a house and a car is a car and a writer ought to leave it at that. But for those who love descriptive writing that powerfully appeals to the senses, that is often beautiful and highly metaphorical, Moody's prose is a feast of riches, and a pleasure that lingers in the mind long after the final page is turned."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"In these quiescent days following the end of the Cold War, Rick Moody has given us a blunt reminder of what may be the most quixotic invention of the late 20th Century--atomic energy. As one reviewer put it, this is a dense, chewy book that, a la Richard Ford, lurches across coastal Connecticut during a powerful night and morning that follows. It is at one and the same time a poignant struggle between a damaged young man veering on middle age trying to come to terms with himself and his crippled mother--all of it occurring against the looming backdrop of an aging nuclear power plant that, too, is crippled. Everyone in the novel is in some fashion damaged by the genie of nuclear energy. While there are moments of transcendent beauty here--particularly Hex's wrestling with his mother's last wishes, I found the novel uneven and in the end unsatisfying. But that may all be because, in Moody's eyes, we have yet to resolve what to do about nuclear energy, a kind of blind corner that we cannot seem to escape"},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"Moody's novel is evocative, a masterpiece of mood and moment. I found the first chapter addictive and read it four times before proceeding with the rest of the book. In all, it proved a dense and chewy read, reminding me of the reasons I adored Faulkner, Welty, and Percy. Everything is opaque and yet redolent with deeper sensations, ones closer to the bone. While I found some of the plot twists unconvincing--the whole fight sequence in the middle was little more than a muddle--I delighted in the ways the plot hit me in waves, its thick rhythms only clarified in its deep, salty prose. I have already got two friends reading it--and expect to chat it up more among others"},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"Moody's prosaic characters inspire hand-wringing and a Mary Richardsonian &quot;Aw, Lou!&quot; at their every foible. You want them to make the right choices, or at least avoid the worst ones. They don't, but the story is not devoid of hope. A fine balance that makes it extremely difficult to put it down. (But what's with the italics?"},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"This is one of the most touching books I've ever read. If you want to know what it's like to live in suburbia, this would be a good start (also check out Davit Leavitt's Family Dancing). Rick Moody is a master stylist, rivaled only by E. Annie Proulx and Michael Ondaatje. All the characters in this book are refreshingly original; there are no heroes and no villains. Rick Moody delights in vivid imagery and clever metaphors (concerning a hamburger, \\"it's rareness almost an emergency, crimson and raw like a splatter wound\\"). There are moments of brilliant writing unmatched by any living writer. Don't miss the shocking ending. Could've worked without the techno babble about nuclear plants, and the only weak character is Louis the stepfather. But this is the greatest perfect imperfect book. Skip the potboilers and see what contemporary fiction is all about."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"Purple America is not the ordinary novel that you might be used to. It is by far one of the most beautifully written novels I have ever read. The lyrical style that Rick Moody uses can seem painstaking to read at first but once you get past the first page the writing opens itself up and pulls you in. With that aside, the story that Moody reveals is heart-felt and tragic. The words themselves, as well as the dramatic presentation will send you into a swirl of emotions from laughter to sadness, from anger to acceptance. Rick Moody's vision of a world set in suburban Connecticut is far from the norms that we know of. Or is it? The answer is yes and no. Rick Moody manages, through his main character Hex Raitliffe, to create a setting that can be familiar to everyone in some form or another. Hex Raitliffe has come home to visit his invalid mother only to find out that her second husband Lou has decided to leave her, leaving Hex the only person to take care of her. As the story opens we get the gruesome details of the daily routines that those who have taken care of, Billie, Hex's mother. At the end of the chapter Moody asks that if Hex is a hero for doing this than heroes are &quot;five and dime, and the world is crowded with them&quot;. Moody suggests a character that is like everyone else as they struggle with life's obstacles. Hex's character must not only deal with his mother but he must also deal with his past, his stutter, and his drinking problem. As if that wasn't enough Hex eventually finds out that his mother wishes for Hex to end her suffering. As mentioned before Moody writes this novel with a lyrical craft that is unsurpassed, but he also captures his characters inability to communicate with each other in a way that comes off as beautiful and sincere. As Hex still deals with his father's death at a young age, and becomes desperate to find Lou and get answers the story unfolds as not only a desire to have some fortune in life but also the desire for a family. Lou's story is told along side of Hex's and as you read you begin to see how much Hex and Lou are alike. Hex truly lives up to his name as he never can find relief in life. From, women, to his job, to his troubling childhood the reader can't help but take sympathy on Hex and root him on and hope that he achieves happiness. The novel draws many of its symbolism from color. Purple and its many shades become a separate personality in the book and it keeps pace with the emotional changes within the novel. For example as Hex finally gets a chance with the girl of his dreams the color of purple shifts to a bright fuchsia. The only way to find out if Hex succeeds is to read this novel. It will reward you with its poetic words and take you on a journey of self-discovery as does Hex."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"Rick Moody seems to be guided by a well-nourished vocabulary. His writing is highly intellectual and his language takes control of the story. In Purple America, this mastery of language often allows the narrative to replicate the plot. Moody's language grows sterile in sterile environments, jargon-like in medical situations, and introspective during focalization. Polysyllabic words and all, this book flows and easily casts its dark mushroom cloud on the imagination. If for no other reason, it's worth reading this book to track Moody's growth as a revolutionary writer."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"This is the most complete, nuanced, and beautiful work I've read by Rick Moody. It's jammed with his witty observations, scathing cynicism, and ironic beauty, and it's a great introduction to his memorable character development and unique writing style."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"I hate it when an author makes it painfully obvious how much thought he put into certain things. Names, for instance. \\"Hex Raitliffe\\" Oh- I get it! \\"Hex\\", because he's unlucky and things go wrong! Not clever, and certainly not subtle.Just one of the initial turn-offs, but the error sets the tone for the entire book. Many reviewers complain about lack of readability. That's because Rick Moody is very, very proud of his writing ability, and overdoes each sentence to death. Long, windy sentences with lots of colorful adjectives does not always make well-written prose. In fact, it rarely does.The novel got so bogged down in its own ridiculous story that I not only lacked any sympathy with the characters, but felt like I was looking over the author's shoulder as he intended them. The attempts at humor, such as the lovemaking scene, just fell flat. I didn't even crack a smile throughout the entire read, which is pretty bad for a book that really, really wants to be funny."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"aside from my count laslo references, this is a novel that I read in one day, the first chapter alone could stand as a masterpiece, the story has its faults but don't they all?"},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"While the narrative events in Purple America may take place in less than a day, the past weighs heavily on the characters and sometimes turns the narrative in on itself. Author Rick Moody shifts among the streams of consciousness of about a dozen different characters, focusing on four of them: Hex Raitliffe, his mother Billie Raitliffe, her husband Lou Sloane and Jane Ingersoll, an old schoolmate of Hex's. Moody imbues every paragraph with layers of details of each character's thoughts and the environment (temporal as well as spatial) each character inhabits. The inner life and outer reality of each character coalesces to form a unique setting for each character.Hex's existence is bounded by an alcoholic haze of rationalization. Hex may have been ignoring his mother for years, but now that he was taking care of her, he believed he was redeeming himself.Billie Raitliffe's life is extremely frustrated. She's essentially helpless, close to speechless and her husband has just walked out on her. However, her intelligence and memories of her life are both intact: &quot;She had been a talker. She had been able to put the awkward at ease; she had been able to comfort children; she had been able to sweet-talk truculent shopkeepers. But her voice was gone, was consigned to the netherworld of widowed socks and earrings.&quot; However, based on what little you have seen so far, you have to ask yourself if Billie was not guilty of major rationalization about her ability to &quot;put the awkward at ease...[and]...comfort children.&quot; Her own adult child Hex is the most ill at ease person in the novel, and, ironically, stutters badly, which makes any communication with his mother very hard.Of the main characters, Lou Sloane is the most &quot;normal.&quot; His environment is not limited to a dying body in an aging house or to an alcohol-addled stumble through life. He contemplates travel, how southern New England connects, and how his soon-to-be-former employer Millstone Nuclear Power Station interacts with the environment. While a little more future-focused than Billie or Hex, he is frequently ruminating on historical issues while thinking about his incipient retirement: ...the Boston Post Road, the oldest road in the country, relic of the colonies, stretching from New York up to Boston and then beyond, winding through the state of Maine, along that rocky coast and through the North Woods, through logging country, before vanishing into the Canadian hinterlands. The Boston Post Road-which antedated the federal monopoly-hotfooted it through the Indian turf, delivering it to the Pilgrims. Moody's characters are constantly &quot;digressing,&quot; but almost all of the digressions integrate real information about life in post World War II Connecticut.The one main character who seems to live the most in the &quot;here and now&quot; is Jane Ingersol. A bored divorcee, she meets her old schoolmate Hex as he tries to take Billie out to dinner. She tries to help Billie and she tries to help Hex, but is not successful in any case; Billie almost drowns, Hex's car blows up and he has sexual difficulties with Jane.The narrative winds back on itself around issues of environment, self-determination, and ghosts from the past."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"I don't know about the Cheever comparisons, but &quot;Purple America&quot; is brilliant in much the same way as David Foster Wallace's &quot;Infinite Jest.&quot; Best fiction i've experienced in years... albeit not for everybody."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"What a wonderful novel Purple America is. I deeply admire Moody's intensity, his choice of words, his ability to create a consistent character from failed boyhood to failed manhood. I especially loved looking for parallels between the decaying old Millstone nuclear power plant and the decaying old mother laying waste in her tub. Whether it was intentional or not is unimportant. It worked. I believe this novel will be studied and read for a long time."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"Purple America is the finest novel I've read in several years. Moody does just about everything right here, from the language (unlike some, I enjoyed the italics, which worked both rhythmically and to bring attention to certain _key phrases_ that might otherwise read as received-language cliches) to the characters (whom he obviously loves -- despite, if not because of, their dysfunctions) to the many layers of meaning in the tale. His take on America is dead-on: Americans, the &quot;chosen ones&quot; of a land that would place its faith unironically in something so ridiculous as Manifest Destiny, are finally reaping what they've sown. Everywhere, there are the toxic results of the choices we've made as individuals and as a society: in individuals such as Hex (love how &quot;Dexter&quot; -- as in &quot;dexterous&quot; -- has been warped here) and his mom and his stepdad, all of whom put far too much energy into achieving chemically altered states of mind; in the rel! ationships between individuals, which are tragically doomed to a lack of completion because of our human inability to fully communicate (love that neither Hex nor his mom can get out an intelligible sentence); and in society, which is poisoning the promised land in its endless need for &quot;more.&quot; But what I love most about this book is its subtle religious message (read the first line, then note the baptism in poison at the end); no matter how much these characters are in pain, how foolishly they act, there's still a grace to them, a feeling of hope for them (and by extension, for us, for America -- the country is sick, Moody seems to be saying, but there's still a chance it might pull through). Pulling this off is Moody's most admirable achievement. This is a great book."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"Purple America is an impressive book because of the many problems of American life that it takes on. It is the story of a man who returns to his childhood home to take care of his diseased mother, but must first come to terms with his own troubles. The issues that have sealed themselves in the past are brought to the forefront over the course of one weekend.The story of Hex Raitliffe is tragic, and it seems as if the world has it in for him despite his good intentions. What causes all the strife, however, is Hex's irresponsibility. He is an isolated person, afraid to reach out to anyone. He cannot handle the daily events of a normal person (such as renting a car) because he lies to himself and always seeks escape. He finds this in alcoholism and drugs.Lou is Billie's husband who has left her because she does not put any \\"effort\\" to stay alive. He is having trouble himself at the nuclear plant where an accident has caused spillage into the bay. This plant will serve as a powerful metaphor for the Raitliffe family.He meets an old interest, Jane Ingersol, who opens herself to him and becomes his first true relationship with a woman. Hex is much better at relating to women anyway, as can be seen by the poor relationship he has with just about every male he meets. Jane is strangely interested in him because he is so dependant.What makes this novel so lyrically beautiful and intriguing is the intense details to the thought processes of its characters. When we are inside the head of Billie, Hex's ailing mother, we see her disjointed and hopeless thoughts. When the focus is on Hex, we see how he rarely holds himself accountable. Rick Moody's craft for characterization is finely tuned in this work.Another comment made by Moody is the way family members communicate. In the Raitliffe family, this is at an extreme. Hex has a stutter, so no one usually listens to him. Billie can barely speak at all and must use a computer to talk coherently. Lou leaves him with only a note to explain his abandonment.We also see the breakdown of morals in America through the contrast between Hex's childhood and the present downfall. Living in New London, the Raitliffe's were traditional, affluent, and loving. Now, after a war, two fathers, and many years apart, the family is nearly destroyed. He and Jane visit a gay bar in a renovated church, a strong symbol of moral decline.Moody is very good at giving the reader clues to how to read his book. Most interestingly, he uses colors to represent different emotions. The varying shades of purple in the book can be seen as the things that influence Hex through his life - his lavender bedroom, etc.Purple America is not a book for everyone. It is often very depressing and very real, confronting some of the darker matter that finds itself into families. But that is what makes it so powerful as well. If you want a unique and moving look at where America is going, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"I have read a lot of mixed reviews on this book, but I must say that for the most part I loved it. It was the first book by Moody I have ever read, and I was stunned and enchanted by his consistent use of original descriptives and emotional tension.As someone who has recently dealt with a huge loss in my life I related somewhat to the protagonist, Hex, a man in his late thirties who hasn't done much with his life and is called home to care for his very sick mother. Moody captures the mood (no pun intended) here perfectly. Throughout the book, all of the characters go through several changes of heart...big, huge whiplashes in decision making, and Moody pulls the reader into their dilemmas, which is something that is so difficult to do as a writer. I felt empathy for all of the characters in this book.I will say that the second to last chapter could have been the last, although I see what Moody was trying to do. Also, the use of italics was, well, a little bit excessive. But those are both small things compared to the weight of the words, emotions, and happenings contained in this book. If you aren't willing to read about regular people who have been crushed by life dealing with difficult things, then don't read the book, but to me it highlighted the humanness of all of us, the way human regret, make rash decisions, and are all just looking for love. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"That Rick Moody's wordcraft is stunning cannot be denied. I had heard of him, but not read anything until he wrote an article for The Believer on the politics behind the National Book Award. He also had a wonderful piece in the Atlantic Monthly decrying MFA programs. Maybe it is because he and I are the same age and are both writers and musicians, but his writing speaks to me like few others do.In Purple America Moody chooses a strange picaresque about a family disintegrating on many levels. He uses beautiful rich language and ever-changing viewpoints to tell the story, with a very clever switch of veiwpoint at the end that shows the chops of a top-drawer writer. If forced at gunpoint I would compare this book to As I Lay Dying. Although it is told from the points of view of fewer characters, Moody definitely rides the fences of Faulkner country, and is able to put the reader so effectively in the mood of the character that you actually feel the character's emotions through his wordcraft. For example, one character stutters, and Moody writes e-e-e-e-each stutter on the actual page, forcing you to read each stutter, and hence experience the frustration of those listening to him, and his own frustration with his unfortunate impediment. By the end of the story you really want the stuttering to stop, but not as much as the stuttering character does, which feeds his actions that make perfect sense to the reader because the frustration is shared.Another thing Moody is able to do that I haven't really seen since Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis, is that he can write slapstick physical humor. There are scenes without dialogue that have you laughing out loud.Purple America is the rendering of an absolute master of narrative technique. He can make the themes of a one family the themes of all families, his language is dazzling and humorous, and he has no fear of the most basic human needs and desires. This book astounds."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"I don't know how people could have found this boring. But everyone is built differently, I guess.I found the lyricism of his writing deeply moving. I was totally captured by the internal workings of mother and son in this story. This is surprising, since on the exterior these characters seem to not warrant any attention. But mostly it is the style of his writing that is so attractive. Others have commented that they could not read the pages fast enough, but I swept through this book."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"I understand that maybe not all like P.A. because Moody's stories are complicated. If I look upon the story now, afterwards, I see that some might find it boring. I loved it! Couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"There is something about the writings of Rick Moody that invoke a sense of dread. A creepiness that settles over your entire body and makes you feel trapped in this suburban nightmare from which you can't wake up. &quot;Purple America&quot; has this quality in spades, and while the excellence of the writing itself could never be called into question, it still leaves the reader with one nagging question: is the realism in Moodys' novels an asset or a liability? Perhaps a little of both. While on the surface, Moodys' two most recent novels 1994's &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; and his new &quot;Purple America&quot; appear to be nothing more than suburban dramas of the kitchen-sink variety, they actually tend to delve much deeper into the messy complexities and horrors of modern family strife. Too deep? Maybe, as one-sentence will sometimes stretch on for more than a page, but this detail also serves to immerse us into these lives as fully as if they were our very own. &quot;Purple America&quot;, in the simplest possible terms, is the tale of Hex Raitliffe, a thirtysomething stuttering lowlife who puts his &quot;career&quot; and everything else on hold to return to the Connecticut home of his childhood, and, more importantly, to his mother-an invalid who fully intends to be dead by the hand of her merciful son by daybreak. Only things are never so easy, as Hex's mothers' power-plant employee husband and Hex's old high=school crush float into and out of the picture, much as the cast of our daily lives often tend to, and complicate things to the utmost degree. Spanning only 24 hours and brimming with the micro-details of ordinary life, &quot;Purple America&quot; is not an easy read. It seems to take place in real-time, as though the experiences of these characters are being experienced vicariously by us, the readers, and it isn't always a pretty life these people lead. But, on the other hand, isn't reality a welcome respite in a world where Danielle Steel is viewed by some as &quot;literature&quot;? $"},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"&quot;Purple America&quot; was the first Rick Moody novel I've read. It was very hard to put the book down once I started reading it. I was hooked on the story immediately, even though it was depressing. The attention to detail was meticulous, and seeing the story from the points of view of the different characters gave it depth that I have never seen before in novels. It was remarkable to read the thoughts of Hex's invalid mother, and it really involved me in the story because I actually was reacting to the way the characters were acting toward her. Additionally, there is so much more to &quot;Purple America&quot; than the story at hand. There were so many underlying meanings (for me, personally) throughout the chapters. The language flowed magnificently and kept my attention (a difficult task!). A writer who also incorporates humor in such a sad story has a true gift. When I got to the end of the story, I wanted more. Rick Moody's style of writing makes the task I have ahead of me (writing a PhD dissertation) look like a small task compared to what he has done. Congratulations, Mr. Moody! You've gotten yourself a new admirer."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"A marvellous novel written in thrilling language..one of the best American novels I've read in recent years. The themes might not be overly appealing, in terms of entertainment, but the razor-sharp evocation of consciousness of self-lacerating Hex and his 'intimates' kept me awake to every line."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"The metaphor of the leaking nuclear power plant is a little obvious, but Moody is great at evoking the quiet desperation of life in upper-middle-class American suburbia. Hex is a character who will exasperate you, but if you are or know a male in the early throes of middle age, you will recognize his flaws, foibles and attempts at heroism."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"Like his earlier work The Ice Storm, Moody has again peeled back the layers of a dysfunctional Connecticut family in the suburbs to reveal the dark, inner-most underside of their respective characters. In Purple America, all of the action takes place in a single 24 hour period as 37 year old Dexter (Hex) Raitcliffe comes back to his boyhood home to care for his mother, Billie, who is suffering from a debilitating neurological disease that is slowly depriving her of her ability to speak and move. Billie's mind is intact, but her fears of complete helplessness make her extract a promise from Hex that he will end her suffering before she is hospitalized as a complete invalid. He is surprised to learn, upon arrivng home, that stepfather Lou Sloane has left her with a callous note, apparently overcome with the pressures of caring for his wife, and by his forced resignation at the local nuclear plant as the &quot;fall guy&quot; after a containment spill.The action begins as Hex struggles to bathe, dress and take his mother to dinner, where he encounters an old schoolmate, Jane Ingersoll, for whom he held a torch twenty years earlier. The actions builds to a predictable breakdown over the course of 24 hours, with an interesting parallel story concering the horrifying scope of a nuclear spill at Lou's old plant. The book has changing narrators, as we encounter the narrative focus of Hex, Billie, Lou, and Jane over the course of the novel. All the while, Moody skillfully uses flashbacks to flesh out his characters a little more, and to provide some frame of reference for their present actions. I thought the flashback scenes involving young Hex and the pot-smoking carpenters who had been hired to renovate his room were especially good, although curiously long. I also was impressed with some of the stream of consciousness narrative of Billie, as she drifted into delirium.Ultimately, I was somewhat ambivalent as to whether I considered this a great, 5 star novel or merely a very good one. As with The Ice Storm, there are simply dazzling passages surrounded by occasional eccentricities that could use a touch of subtlety. Moody seems fond of using italics, but at times the reader is unsure whether the passages in italics are being thought, or spoken aloud, by his characters. Also, late in the novel as Hex is descending into drunken reverie and his mother is slipping in and out of the picture, I was unsure whether actions were dreamed or real, whether characters were home or at the hospital, etc. One reviewer here put it in perspective when saying that Moody's writing is akin to an off-duty cop driving home with the siren on. Sometimes less is more.I also was a little confused as to the motivations of some of the characters. While Billie and Lou were very richly drawn I thought, Hex was a shell of a human being, almost more believable as a teen in flashback than as a protagonist in the novel's present. Why Jane, who apparently didn't give Hex the time of day in school, would get involved in his mess of a life here was beyond me. Perhaps out of pity? And why was Lou's pal from the nuclear plant, Kowalsky, so concerned about Lou's marital situation?All in all, I was wrapped up in Moody's story, just like in The Ice Storm, and at times was overcome by his considerable writing prowess. He is no doubt a strong voice in contemporary fiction, a little grittier and more realistic than Irving and a little more coherent than Delillo or Pynchon. I recommend this book to anyone who liked The Ice Storm, and for those unfamiliar with either work pick em both up, Amazon charges less to ship the 2nd book."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"A yuppie novel filled with glib, ironic sarcasm.

More than halfway through it, I came upon a chapter that I thought was going to be from the point of view of one of the characters I found utterly boring. I set the book aside for a week because I dreaded hearing from this character -- usually if I set a book aside for more than three days, it becomes a coaster. But I had faith, so I eventually picked it up again and read the chapter -- yep, it was from the p.o.v. of a character I didn't like, yep it was tedious, and wouldn't you know it, it was the longest chapter in the whole friggin' book. It was hard to rally any enthusiasm after that. To the author's credit, Hex is a remarkably well-drawn character.

Unreadably thick prose with no letup. Where most trade paperbacks clock in at a minute and a half or so per page for me, I was spending ten to twenty minutes a page on this, and that's without the patented Julia Kristeva &quot;dictionary by the side to look up every third word&quot; necessity. It's just plain hard to read. And it shouldn't be-- it's a pretty simple story about a guy called home to care for his ailing mother. It's not necessarily bogged down by philosophy, or by reflection, or any of the things that make bogging down worthwhile; it's just hard to read. There's no real reason for it I can put my finger on. I even gave it a second (and a third and a fourth) chance thanks to a raging endorsement from Barry Hannah, one of the handful of authors who's actually written a truly perfect novel (The Tennis Handsome), but I finally ended up throwing it onto the fire to combat the high cost of heating the apartment with gas. (zero)"},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"Purple America is a book with two very interesting characters.....too bad they focus so much on Lou."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"Moody's prose reminds me more of old-timers like Updike, Steinbeck, and Salinger, than of his contemporaries. Why? Well, first of all, it's rich, layered, carefully plotted, crafted with care. Moody is patient; he's not worried about rushing to the end of a sentence, paragraph, or chapter just so he can execute a clever postmodern sleight-of-hand. He's more concerned with the process, the care that goes into describing a suburban backyard on an autumn night, or a crowded seafood restaurant. Postmodern prose jockeys who get off on wordplay, thwarted expectations, and other narratological trap doors might be disappointed with Moody. But I'd like to see more writers doing what Moody does: blending the best of the new and the best of the old.Purple America is a shift away from the realm of most postmodern prose: hyper and seemingy directionless narratives, cultural subversion, deconstruction of character and narrative. As I see it, Moody shares only the best devices of his postmodern peers. Like them, he is a young writer bred on the postmodern literary climate, who knows hardly anything else. But he also realizes the worth of comparatively &quot;conventional&quot; twentieth-century forms as explored by writers like Salinger and his ilk. In Purple America, I feel he has blended the best of both almost seamlessly. He admits that it's still all right to write a story with no disorienting chronological jump cuts. It's all right to write a story where characters' life histories are fully divulged, from birth to death. It's all right to write a story where a terminally ambivalent man is worried sick about his dying mother.The postmodern gestures are still there, but they don't ruin the novel because they don't obscure the narrative. They exist only in service to the telling of a compassionate and well-rounded story. Moody's writing is very deliberate: Every word is there for a reason. Puns and various double meanings don't just happen-you can tell he's not being glib; they're not just insouciant tricks, they are devices enriching their context, the story. Even during excruciating and emotionally difficult passages such as the introductory scene in which Hex bathes his mother, I welcomed Moody's drawn out and meticulous descriptive technique. He cares about the reader's total apprehension of and identification with a given event in the novel. Like Hex, Moody is a quiet, obsequious provider-eager to be of service to his audience."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"... the language is tricky at times, and he likes to get into those categorical lists, which may come across as tangential wandering, but to me its quite brilliant. The first five or so pages count as probably among the best writing I have ever read. Very meditative, like an incantation, a style which resonates throughout the book. I guess the only reason I'm writing this review is becasue this book needs to be read and studied; not enough people recognize its beauty. It's easy to read it quickly and not let it get to you. Read it slowly. A great improvement over Garden State, I think, and just as if not more satsifying than The Ice Storm. Please read it."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"Moody took on a huge challenge in building a book around a character without any obvious appeal and in a dark milieu. He manages the challenge brilliantly and has written one of the best novels I've read in years. I noticed another customer questioned the comparison to Cheever that some reveiwers have made. I think it is a very apt comparison, to all of Cheever's work, but especially to FALCONER."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"Reading Rick Moody's Purple America is like spying on a dysfunctional family's bathroom, you see everything. Read this novel at your own risk, for you will experience decay and destruction with little catharsis. The writing is as well done as you could ask. The characters are well rounded and believable. My only issue with this novel is that I came to the table ill prepared to handle the depressing narration. So, read it but realize what you are in for."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"Rick Moody's Purple America is a novel of suburbia, with a very '90s twist. All of the events in this book take place during one horrible evening, and include spousal abandonment, attempted euthanasia, kinky sex, drunken combat (and combative drunkenness), return home, and filial love (and duty). Despite the short time frame involved, the plot is not easy to summarize. The main character, Dexter (&quot;Hex&quot;) Raitliffe, has returned home to care for his almost totally paralyzed (but mentally sharp) mother, Billie, who herself has been abandoned by her husband. Billie wants nothing more than to die, but her paralysis makes suicide impossible. Hence her plea to Hex to do the deed. Hex, enraged over Billie's abandonment, sets out to find (and punish?) the husband who abandoned Billie, in a night filled with peril and unexpected surprise. Moody is a daring writer. While told in the third person, each chapter assumes the point of view of a different character. Moody's sentences range from fragments to periods which would make Cicero swoon (the second sentence in the book is more than four pages long). In a lesser writer's hands, these devices would seem forced, or simply fail. Moody holds it all together, and creates a breathtaking novel. This book requires patience and careful attention, but rewards both greatly."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"There are a number of valid complaints to make about the rigmarole that characterizes Rick Moody's distinctive type of writing - it's long-winded, it's morose, it's prone to sometimes arbitrary shifts into italics. Yet after finishing Purple America in record time, I realize that Moody's baroque and intricate hyperacute sense of detail and syntax (its 298 pages cover barely 12 hours) allows for an incredibly close understanding of his characters' consciousness, and leads to an experience of such precise sensory understanding, it transcends simple ideas of setting and location - it fully and specifically inhabits a life. It also, amongst all the Moody works I've read, renders his love of italics in the clearest light - each phrase hammering home the notion of phrases and words repeated in public consciousness, rendering the way voices, echoes, and ideas become essential in the formation of thoughts, emotions, and identity. Purple America seems destined for a few possible outcomes, and for a while you feel yourself inching closer to them, only to be thwarted, leaving certain threads dangling - a choice frustrating to be certain, but in the most rewarding way - you'll be left to agonize over Moody's precision of ideas and circumstances, tiny details leading to any number of enormous everyday outcomes. His final image of Hex Raitliffe is far from conclusive, but it is unshakeable, a precarious desperation given vivid charge and dimension."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"In following Hex Raitliffe and his distressed family through the course of one weekend, Rick Moody takes a slice of middle class suburbia and slides it, this microcosm of American society, under his magnifying glass to diagnose the ills of a decaying culture.The story in Purple America takes place over the course of one weekend, at the beginning of which Hex Raitliffe has returned home to suburban Connecticut to care for his deteriorating mother. While Moody slips the main character trough one mishap after another, he tours the realities of a mortal family as well as a diseased society. The book at times can be disheartening to read, because Hex Raitliffe is a sympathetic main character, but Moody's diagnoses for America points to rampant toxicity, radiation, the myopic misuse of technology, pollution, nervous overconsumption, and a male preoccupation with weaponry. By the end, when the remains of Hex's mother's body, a nuclear power plant, and nearly every human relationship has broke down, the author seems to have skipped any prognosis, deemed America past decline and created an autopsy for his bruised purple nation.Despite the sad underlying tone, this book should pull you in by the sheer force of the language. The first two sentences, describing Hex giving his invalid mother a bath, make the most powerful opening to any novel I've read. The book in many ways reproduces the promise of that first chapter. The language soars, but is used to describe the most everyday activities. The brilliantly written sex scene of Hex's awkward reunion with his high school crush is an example. One reviewer for this reason, and accurately I think, calls the book a &quot;domestic thriller.&quot; It is about the most ordinary of guys in an ordinary family, but in duress. It was interesting to read Moody catalogue the excesses of suburban living-inside the Raitliffe manse, the &quot;mahogany couch-with-end-tables, the carved Brunswick Craftsman-style pool table, the inlaid music cabinet with Victrola, the rosewood love seat and parlor set, the imitation British pub-style bar with Waterford crystal low and highball set, the early Magnavision monochrome television receiver, the floor-model French birdcage with stuffed parrot, and more&quot;-listing the material possessions that the Raitliffes and others in their neighborhood have amassed.In that sense, the book is a kind of elegy for a class. The purple of America and the purple that Billie Raitliffe longs to surround herself with is the classic purple of royalty, but Hex's family-his ill mother and skipped-town step father-never meet their &quot;ideal of rural paradise.&quot; Instead, words come easily to no one; communication within the family is stilted; Billie, the mother, resignedly talks through a computer; Hex stutters uncontrollably, and it seems they have just as little fluidity of access to their emotions. Billie wants someone to end her suffering. Her second husband, Lou, goes AWOL when he gets bored caring for a woman who doesn't want to live and her son balks at the possibility of euthanasia, choosing instead to stuff his face with a cheeseburger. Hex's sense of duty toward and simultaneous flight from the responsibilities of home create much of the tug and pull throughout the remainder of the book. And in Rick Moody's hands, it is a worthwhile, if not always upbeat, weekend to spend with the Raitliffes."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"This is the first Rick Moody book I have ever read, and based on what I'd heard about his style, I was prepared for some unconventional narrative structure. As it turns out, the only thing that's unconventional in this book is the lack of quotation marks around dialogue. Otherwise, this is some exceptionally strong story telling, employing all of the components of satisfying literature (conflict, crisis, resolution, character transformation) and some really creative, insightful writing. Moody has a unique narrative voice, to be sure, but it's far from being obtuse or inaccessible; it's more like painful interior dialogue, rendered in emotions and impressions that are simultaneously universal and foreign.There are two thematic backdrops that reinforce what is basically a story about disintegration: nuclear crisis (as experienced by the main character's deceased father and present day stepfather) and degenerative disease (as experienced by the main character's mother). Hex Raitliffe, the troubled, stuttering son summoned home to \\"assist\\" his mother, is in a degenerative state himself, and in the course of a day (the time period covered in the book) manages to bed his childhood crush, confront his runaway stepfather, get into a fistfight, blow up his rental car, and kill his mother -- or maybe he doesn't. I don't want to give away the last act.Tortured though he is, there is something positive and redeeming in Hex Raitliffe, and he manages eventually to bring out the best in almost everyone he encounters. I found all of the characters believable, but especially Hex, who Moody brings to exquisite and poignant life. His crises are ours, and in the end he reaches a conclusion most any of us would, even if we wouldn't necessarily follow the same path to get there. What made this book work for me was the vicarious adventure I experienced following his path."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"Certain metaphors ought to come with expiration dates, no less than milk or medicine.Rick Moody's third novel, &quot;Purple America,&quot; is an ambitious, funny, beautifully writtenbook whose prevailing metaphor -- the faltering promise of the nuclear age, and behind itthe decline of the American nuclear family -- has begun to curdle. The military andcivilian uses of atomic physics have been with us for only half a century, but somehowtheir fictional uses, irresistible over the years to numberless writers and filmmakers,already seem as inert as a spent fuel rod.This subtle handicap never keeps &quot;Purple America&quot; from succeeding as anuncommonly empathetic fugue of voices from what's left of the Raitliffe family ofFenwick, Connecticut, during one night in 1992. The novel starts with awkward,stammering, prematurely middle-aged Hex Raitliffe (christened Dexter but lefthanded)fumblingly bathing his paralyzed, vaguely senile mother, Billie, in the upstairs bathroomof their once-stylish home. &quot;If he's a hero,&quot; Moody writes with grace and compassion ofHex, &quot;then heroes are five-and-dime, and the world is as crowded with them as it is withstray pets, worn tires, and missing keys.&quot;For the second chapter, perspective shifts to Billie. In a pattern repeatedthroughout the book, we at first resist such a wrench, having spent the previous pagesinhabiting Hex's mind with an intimacy only very fine writing can create. But before longwe are Billie's, and the subsequent sidesteps into Billie's overwhelmed second husbandLou's company, or that of Hex's unforgotten ninth-grade love, Jane, are just as wrenching.We're sorry to leave each one of them, even as the next one waits.Reading &quot;Purple America&quot; can feel like dancing a quadrille with four verydifferent partners. On we go, propelled from consciousness to consciousness by Moody'sprodigious gift for ventriloquism and large, supple vocabulary, readjusting to each pointof view before trading it back for another.Along the way Billie asks Hex for his promise to help end her life, and Loutroubleshoots a crisis at the Millstone Nuclear Power Plant, where he works. The actionof the book obeys the unities, taking place over a single night on Long Island Sound, butthis doesn't keep Moody from flashing back twice to the letters of Hex's late father, whoworked on the Manhattan Project in what seemed the golden age of atomicexperimentation, long before it became such a Millstone around the national neck.These brief interludes hold the key to &quot;Purple America's&quot; portentous title, inwhich the colors of an atomic blast -- and of Billie's favored household decorating accent-- combine to suggest an America where purple now connotes garishness and violence,instead of the regal confidence it once did. The climax avoids sentimentality, perhapseven more rigorously than an emotionally invested reader might wish.Connecticut character studies and nuclear questions aren't incompatible, as JohnCheever showed in the classic short story &quot;The Brigadier and the Golf Widow,&quot; where anupper-middle-class man building a backyard bomb shelter ultimately confronts thepossibility that he wants the world to end. But in &quot;Purple America&quot; the cosmic stakes feeljust slightly extrinsic, an overlay, estranged from the urgency of the story. Occasionallymistrusting his considerable powers, Moody's like the off-duty cop who uses his siren toget home even when he's got the turnpike all to himself."},{"Title":"Purple America.","review":"The chronicle of the last days of a (literally) nuclear family-- _Purple America_ begins when Hex, the stuttering alcoholic son of the house, returns to find that his wheelchair-bound mother Billie has been abandoned by her second husband. Hex is left to sort out which of the family responsibilities (including a shocking request from his mother) he is both willing and able to take.The story is told in a shifting array of voices which carry the language and perspective of all the characters. Symbolism is the order of the day, with both of Billie's husbands having nuclear pasts and the varying shades of purple being used to create a thematic unity. The quality of the writing is difficult to debate-- at points where I had lost some interest in the story I found my attention carried by the craftsmanship involved in the language itself.There were times where I felt as though Moody didn't realize how strong of a story he had created (the mixed horror and pleasure with which Hex must tend his mother's useless body) and relied on the more symbolic elements at points where that reliance was useless and even distracting. The ending is often criticized, and I think that the criticism comes from that fact that while the ending functions very well on the symbolic level, it's less fulfilling in terms of the story. Instead of finally being drawn into Hex or Billie, the spectacular surrealism of the final pages had more the effect of putting me at a distance- perhaps exactly what was intended."},{"Title":"Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales","review":"I teach high school earth science in earthquake country. I always tell my students that no matter where they live, there is some disaster that could befall them, and that learning to live with the characteristics of a place is always a good idea. But some places are definitely worse than others, and I've wondered for a long time what motivates people to live in places of extreme danger. [Note to the readers of this review: everywhere in western California is earthquake country, but I bought a house with the least amount of flood and wildfire danger that I could find!] Braving Home by Jake Halpern has helped me get an answer to my question.Braving Home is very much in the style of writing popularized by folks like John McPhee. Halpern pours himself into his subject by insinuating himself into the lives of the folks and the places he's writing about for a week at a time [he always brings a tent, but never seems to use it]. Halpern writes with great respect for his subjects, even though it would have been so easy to write them off as crazy. Even though I would probably not choose to live in any one of these situations, I found myself envying something about each of the people Halpern features in the stories.Braving home should appeal to folks who enjoy travelogue, history, psychology, and natural disasters. I recommend you go to extremes with Jake Halpern and Braving Home."},{"Title":"Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales","review":"Ever since the death of Charles Kurault I have been searching for someone who can showcase people across this great nation with warmth, fascination and respect.Jake Halpern does that with style, grace and empathy."},{"Title":"Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales","review":"Jake Halpern's &quot;Braving Home&quot; is a delightful little travel book that explores the question of why some people cling tenaciously to homes in some of the worst spots in the country. Halpern's journeys take him to a North Carolina flood plain, an active volcano in Hawaii, the Malibu country, a barrier island in Lousiana and an isolated outpost in Alaska. Along the way, he meets and befriends some very unusual, but very down to earth people. Halpern's likability is the key to the book's success. It allowed him to get his subjects to open up to his questions and gives the book a good natured tone. In the end, he tries to find some common ground that they all share, but it is the journey itself that makes the book worthwhile.Overall, a quirky and amusing book that will be best enjoyed by armchair travelers."},{"Title":"Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales","review":"I'm not a big fan of non-fiction -- many of its authors either step too far away from their subjects in an attempt to recount the story as accurately as possible, thus transforming their books into nothing more than long newspaper articles, or they inject so much narrative warmth that I'm left wondering how much they fiddled with the truth.But Jake Halpern has struck the perfect balance with his book. His tone resonates throughout the entire narrative structure, just close enough to give you a sense of his role in this story, and yet maintaining enough distance to give his characters center stage. A wise decision on Jake Halpern's part, because characters are what makes this book so incredible.They are a collection of homesteaders in the truest sense, people who refuse to leave their home no matter how remote or dangerous -- from Babs Reynolds, a woman who lives in a tundra-surrounded tower in Whittier, Alaska, to Jack Thompson, the last man remaining in Royal Gardens, Hawaii, cut off from civilization by the steady encroachment of lava from a nearby volcano.This is non-fiction at its finest but it goes beyond that -- if art's ultimate aim is to evoke humanism, Jake Halpern's BRAVING HOME has done just that. When I finished the book, his characters could have been no more alive than if I'd known them my entire life.An excellent debut book from a clearly gifted writer. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales","review":"This is an amazing book that took me to places and people that I have never imagined existed.

Very dissatisfying.I spent some time looking on the web but some of the places he described have since changed (in some cases drastically) and I have not, as yet, found any photos showing some of the things he describes. In particular, Whittier Alaska is now inundated with thousands of tourists from cruise ships every year.

Halpern grew up in Buffalo \\"best known as a place people like to leave\\" & while he has a little experience with the long-term residents of his hometown, he himself has lived a fairly peripatetic life.The locales he visits includes Princeville, NC - the oldest incorporated African-American US town that was nearly destroyed by Hurricane Floyd. Whittier AK is primarily one 14-story building, perched on a ledge of a mountain with a single tunnel entrance for train/car access. The lack of privacy and dark, windy winters send most folk running after 3 years. Jack Thompson runs a bed & breakfast in Hawaii - it's not terribly busy, because it's surrounded by lava. Halpern visits the last of the Malibu homesteaders: the Decker family has lived in one of the area canyons since the 1880's and has never fled from a fire. A barrier island in the Louisiana delta has faced its share of hurricanes, yet may not last through the end of the century.Halpern proves himself more than a reporter - he stays with these \\"kooks\\" for a couple of days or a couple of weeks, showing them to be individuals with a strong sense of belonging, who can't imagine themselves anywhere else. His outlook is occasionally self-centered, but also provides insight into what it means to truly be \\"at home\\".Recommended to anyone interested in human-interest stories with a touch of the unusual & very little syrupy-sweet sentiment."},{"Title":"Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales","review":"This book took me to places I have never even imagined existed.

You always wonder what it would be like to live in an extreme climate and this book tells you about all the people who live in extreme locales from North Carolina to Hawaii. If you think it might be interesting to read about people living in towns ravaged by wildfires, erupting volcanoes or ocean storms, this is your book.Jake Halpern has written for the New Republic, The New Yorker, Commonweal and other magazines. He has lived in New York, Prague, Tel Aviv, Washington, D.C. and India and seems to enjoy visiting really dangerous places.The authors interest in people who don?t want to move seems to originate from a time when he wrote a story about Jewish settlers living in Hebron. When he returned to the United States, he wondered if the desire to keep one's home was more universal than originally thought. Jake Halpern has also been known to return to where he grew up in Buffalo, New York. As he says: \\"I kinda like it here.\\" The area is also inhabited by people who refuse to leave.Soon, he was writing a story about Centralia, Pennsylvania where the coal mines have been on fire for almost 40 years. He became intrigued by the thought that in a world of jetsetters, \\"permanent homes\\" still existed.In this book you get to vicariously experience the lives of brave souls who refuse to move. While the average American is moving 12 times during their life, some residents have said enough is enough and not even an eviction notice sends them packing. They remain in frozen outposts, submerged towns and other seemingly godforsaken places.Through Halpern's writing, you will journey to an underwater town in Princeville, N.C; The Lava-Side Inn, Royal Gardens, Hawaii; the Canyon of the Firefighting Hillbillies in Malibu, California; the Home of the Storm Riders in Grand Isle, Louisiana; and the Unique Indoor city/tower in Wittier, Alaska.If you get a job offer from any of these places, may I suggest this book?You can visit with Thad Knight who survived Hurricane Floyd and found peace returning to his old home instead of staying at the cramped gravel parking lot of the displacement camp. His story of survival is quite amazing. Not only did he have to get the power company to put his property back on the grid, he had to remove coffins from his lawn in N.C.The story of Whittier, Alaska is rather fascinating. Let us just conclude that if Babs Reynolds could survive her three husbands, Alaska is no problem. There is also some humor and stories of Brenda Tolman and her pet reindeers who try to escape into the snowbanks.Why anyone would continue to build homes in Malibu, is beyond me. Millie Decker has been fighting fires since 1928. Believe it or not, I could relate to beating the ground furiously with wet gunnysacks. I loved the story of the pet mountain lions!Researching The Lava-Side Inn sounds like a good reason for a vacation, although once you read about Jack Thompson operating a B&B; in the middle of a lava flow, it gets a bit tricky. It is interesting how Jake and Jack have a similar interest in people \\"Living on the Edge.\\" If you think walking on top of a lava flow is interesting, wait until you read about what happens when it rains.The story of \\"Island Storm Riders\\" brought back memories. These people are brave, brave, brave! Get out the kerosene lanterns. You will also learn why people are buried above ground. Those who are alive are not the only ones riding out the storms.It was interesting to learn about place identity,Projected Dates of Disappearance, to feel a sense of homesickness for places you have never been, and to remember various situations where you could relate directly to the experiences in this book. \\"Braving Home\\" reveals the true sense of home and gives you the feeling that we are all survivors, no matter where we live.Halpern's \\"traveling to dangerous places\\" writing is fresh, witty and he has a real talent for investigating the forsaken. You just have to love how stubbornly some Americans hold onto that place we call home. In the Epilogue he tells how he returns to each location.One of the most intriguing and heartfelt books on \\"home\\" I've read this year! You end up feeling like you were the one visiting all these locations. The writing is spectacular in its creativity and depth. I look forward to reading future books by this talented author.~The Rebecca ReviewHurricane survivor"},{"Title":"Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales","review":"There is no place like home. And you can be thankful that you have no place like the homes Jake Halpern has visited. He somehow became the &quot;Bad Homes Correspondent&quot; at the _New Republic_. He kept writing stories about towns being eaten by sinkholes, homes built over burning coal mines, homes where &quot;Welcome Home&quot; would have had a touch of sarcasm to it. In _Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales_ (Houghton Mifflin), the intrepid Halpern goes to live in five unpromising homes. He is in quest of the answer to why people would voluntarily take and keep homes in hellish or threatening areas. He does not find profound answers; they like their homes because these are their homes. He does, however, introduce us to some funny and strange characters, and shows us how they make themselves improbably at home.Princeville, North Carolina is a town inundated by Hurricane Floyd, but Thad Knight came back to his ruined home, and other citizens returned. Whittier, Alaska, is a peculiar town that consists essentially of one 14-story high rise, and about 200 people live there. They stay inside a lot of the time, because the temperatures are frigid and the winds are killers. To get to it, you have to drive through a tunnel over two miles long. Millie Decker is 82 years old, a former rodeo rider, and has an address that would be coveted by Hollywood hopefuls, in Malibu. She has not abandoned it for any of the infamous fires that regularly come her way, fighting each one by wet gunnysacks. Ambrose Besson is a Storm Rider on Grand Isle, Louisiana. Others take the bridge to the mainland, but he stays home and cooks with his fellow storm riders. Jack Thompson will book you a spell in his bed and breakfast in Hawaii. Of course, you have to trek across a live lava field to get to Jack's; &quot;... there is always the possibility of taking a bad step and falling downward into an active lava tube.&quot; The lava is all around and may well take Jack's house someday.There isn't much they can really do by staying. It does not make much sense, to others, but of course it doesn't have to. In the epilogue of the book, Halpern goes back to these strange friends he has made, and tells them about each other, and finds that they easily sympathize with their fellows in the book. Jack, for instance, upon being told about Thad Knight, says, &quot;It just sounds like another person who really likes his home and is willing to put up with whatever might come along with it.&quot; Most people are interested in conventionally making home life bigger and easier and inevitably more expensive and complicated. Read this amusing book about these mild kooks and realize that not all of them live in dangerous homes."},{"Title":"Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales","review":"I heard Jake Halpern interviewed on NPR and had to buy the book.

We get to know the people who live in relative danger and seclusion.What I found interesting was that many of the folks he brings us along to meet are more afraid of living in cities than staying in the extreme locations where they've been for years. Their feeling of stability living in an outwardly unstable environment tells us something about the power of home, the power of place in our lives.Halpern has an easy, flowing writing style that doesn't get in the way of the story and is very readable.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it quickly.

Halpern's writing style is disciplined and readable--an ideal combination for a journalist--with just enough of a sprinkling of the wicked turn of phrase to keep the reader engaged and laughing. Halpern brings his subjects to vibrant life, and makes me want to know what has happened to them since his writing. I look forward to a volume two. Perhaps Halpern could explore whether those who \\"brave home\\" are a dying breed? Is there a next generation of extreme inhabitors awaiting discovery?"},{"Title":"Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales","review":"Extremely entertaining! Fun to read! Interesting characters! Unmatched locales! I returned again and again to this wonderful book during my spare time. I'm not sure Halpern really comes up with explanations for why people live in such dangerous, out-of-the-way places, but his descriptions of those people and their homes are simply fascinating. Read it--and maybe you'll be looking to buy a home in Royal Gardens, Hawaii!"},{"Title":"Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales","review":"Jake Halpern takes on strange human habitats of our country and dives in to discover just why there are still people that live (or ever did live!) in these places. In each case, his chapter delves into the location, its uniqueness that makes it seemingly unhabitatible. These are places that are likely to be uninhabitable if not for human inventions like airplanes, air conditioning, indoor heat, and other modern marvels.His stories take us around the country, from a small flood-prone town in North Carolina, an incredibly isolated village (though it seems more like a commune) in Alaska, to the Mailbu Hills where among the luxurious wealth live a family of ranchers that continue to fight the region's frequent firefighters on their own. In each locale, Halpern spends a significant time there, and often stays over for a few days with people who are braving the odds to live in these extreme locales. This allows him to dig deep into their rationals for continuing to live in such strange places. For example, he spends time with a woman in a very isolated spot in Alaska who is trying to stay hidden from her husband. For others, such as an old man in NC, that is where he was born and raised and lived his whole life, for him there is simply nowhere else to go.These stories are funny, poignant and interesting. Each makes for a very interesting read and through the set of chapters (where each is like a story of its own) the reader gets to see just how strange and weird our country and its people can be... but not just strange, just how brave and devoted they can be.This is a must read!!!"},{"Title":"Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales","review":"Jake Halpern has written a remarkable first book. Not yet thirty years old, he's called numerous cities spread over three continents \\"home.\\" Like most of us on this highly mobile world, home represented little more than a temporary base of operations. Working as a fact checker for the New Republic, Jake became increasingly fascinated by the concept of home as a central part of one's identity, and by those people so rooted to a particular place they would do anything to remain anchored there.After extensive research, Jake set out on an odyssey that took him to Princeville, North Carolina, a town submerged by a flood; Whittier, Alaska, a community at the end of a two and a half-mile long tunnel, and a community where almost everyone lives in a single, 14-story high rise; the \\"Lava-Side Inn,\\" the last occupied home in a Hawaiian subdivision that's been cut off by a volcano's active flow; Malibu, California, where the descendants of pioneers still battle the wildlifes that sweep their region with alarming regularity; and Grand Isle, Louisiana, a lone outpost in the Gulf of Mexico where a few hardy souls always ride out the worst hurricanes.In these pages, you'll get to know the independent, self-sufficient, heroic souls that Jake met during his journeys. You're very much the armchair traveler as he invites you into his motel room, the front seat of his rental car, and into the homes and lives of these memorable people. This is a great book to feed the mind and the heart.--William C. Hall"},{"Title":"Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales","review":"Imagine living in a home surrounded by lava flows, or on a small island where hurricanes are common and the one road out will be covered with water well before the storm hits. Jack Halpern has given a view, not only of five very extreme living conditions, but also of the strong-willed people who tenaciously cling to the place they call home. It is hard to decide which is more memorable, the unforgiving land or the people who weather the elements. For these hardy souls, home is a place of roots and continuity, a tenuous place in reality but a concrete place in mind, a place that truly defines them."},{"Title":"Braving Home: Dispatches from the Underwater Town, the Lava-Side Inn, and Other Extreme Locales","review":"Many philosophers have attempted a definition of \\"home\\" as more than just the physical location where you live. Jake Halpern actually comes pretty close to that elusive definition in this enjoyable travelogue. Halpern visits some rugged regular folks who have made their homes in unlikely or dangerous locations. While this book is now a few years old, a couple of Halpern's stories have gained some new poignancy post-Katrina &#8211; those being Halpern's visit with the old-timers of a Louisiana island that could be literally wiped off the map by any major hurricane, and who have made a lifestyle of riding out the storms; and the story of a retired gentleman in North Carolina who refused to break his deep ties with his town and its history, even after a major flood destroyed his house. Here Halpern also reports on an odd small town in Alaska that is almost totally contained within a single high-rise and is also almost completely cut off from the outside world; a loner in Hawaii who perseveres in his house even after being totally surrounded by lava from an active volcano; and the diehard Wild West-ers who are still living oldschool style in Malibu and fighting back brush fires themselves. Within these narratives of hardy souls and their lives of creeping hardship, Halpern discovers why these folks stay in their precarious locations, and why each has a stronger sense of \\"home\\" than most of the rest of us. Halpern's attempts to get philosophical could be a little stronger, but he reports successfully on some very hardy and likeable folks.

He appears to be a truly amicable guy, and he gets his subjects to open up to him and invite him into their lives. Halpern doesn't just pop by for an afternoon interview, he gets invited to stay for days and immerse himself in these people's lifestyles. His connection with his subjects is evident in the fact that he gets invited back for repeat visits when his book is complete, and he thoughtfully includes updates on everyone at the close of the book. The reader can't help but be touched by all these people living in extreme circumstances, and I was sad to leave them when the book came to a close.Usually, I dislike when non-fiction authors expound on the philosophical reasons for their subjects' behavior. Halpern, however, did an excellent job tying together the common threads that made people refuse to leave their homes despite the risks. People who have been rooted in their home for generations as well as those who have been transplanted to their own version of paradise make similar arguments for staying in their homes no matter what.Halpern manages to find a Louisiana backwater in which trailers are constantly washed out into the ocean, as well as multi-million dollar homes on the Malibu coast that are constantly in fire danger and repeatedly re-built. The desire to \\"brave home\\" crosses economic and cultural lines across the country, and Halpern invites the reader to learn about some unique cases. Overall, this book is highly recommended based on the subject matter and on Halpern's excellent delivery."},{"Title":"Live Food - Dead Food","review":"I recently had the pleasure of previewing this wonderful book.

This book can be of great help to the composer or orchestrator who typesets his own music for performers, and may contribute to avoiding future publications of ugly computer generated sheet music which is increasingly presented to performers and conductors.Some of the content in the book is outdated and irrelevant to us today (though is a very interesting historical presentation of the traditions of producing sheet music), but there is so much other priceless information that is difficult to find anywhere today, and is a real wake-up call as you realize that many of the decisions taken by digital typesetting programs are not necessarily optimal for producing the best result, as there are many exceptions to the rules that these programs by default follow."},{"Title":"The art of music engraving and processing;: A complete manual, reference and text book on preparing music for reproduction and print","review":"Overall, the art of engraving, much like other industries, is fading for music.

However, nothing could make me forget the imaginative post-apocalyptic world that Reeve had created, in which massive Traction-Cities trundled across the wastelands according to the laws of Municipal Darwinism; eating any smaller city that crossed their paths. There was a massive death-toll by the end of the book, in which many of the principal characters had been killed (to the point of desensitisation), but our protagonists Tom and Hester managed to ride off into the sunset in the battered old airship \\"Jenny Haniver\\".\\"Predator's Gold\\" is set several years later, where we find that Tom and the horribly-scarred Hester are still together, taking on passengers and cargo to make a living. One such passenger is Professor Pennyroyal, a pompous explorer and adventurer with a penance for stretching the truth (think Gilderoy Lockhart) who join the couple as they flee to the Ice Wastes and are saved by the Traction City of Anchorage. The city is ruled over by the young Freya Rasmussen who makes a radical decision to return to the Dead Continent in the hopes of escaping the dual threats of both predatory Traction Cities and the Anti-Traction League.Unbeknownst to her, her city is being discreetly ransacked by a trio of \`Lost Boys' who answer to the mysterious thief-lord Uncle (who as another reviewer pointed out, deliberately bears less resemblance to the carefree boys of \\"Peter Pan\\" than to the wretches of \\"Oliver Twist\\" under the tyranny of Fagin) a man who has his own game to play in the rising tensions. But when Hester witnesses a foolish kiss between Tom and Freya she makes an equally foolish decision to betray the city. From here the action keeps rolling: escapes, intrigue, kidnapping, betrayals, battles... you name it and its here. As an adventure story, I would be hard-pressed to recommend anything more exciting than this. If you loved the adventure and atmosphere of Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy or Garth Nix's \\"Old Kingdom\\" trilogy (Sabriel, Lirael, Abhorsen) then Reeves's series is a must-have.Most interesting is Reeves use of political agendas and intrigue. The world is roughly translated into two groups: the Traction Cities and the Static Communities, who are bitterly at odds. The Static communities (headed by the Anti-Traction League) despise the parasitical scavenging cities, whilst the roaming Cities are arrogantly casual about their allegiance to Darwinism and their right to any prey that comes their way. Naturally, one would expect to be on the Anti-Traction League's side (after all, the thought of consuming smaller cities sounds barbaric to our contemporary ears), and yet the fact that Tom is a citizen of a Traction City and Reeves's deliberate admiration for their roving spirit throws the whole scenario into a hefty shade of grey.Plus, if we really analysis the situation, is there really a difference between the Traction Cities and the phenomena of the Western world's colonisation across the rest of the world (and its current insistence on globalisation)? Add to the fact that a branch of the Anti-Traction League - the Green Storm - is undoubtedly a terrorist network whose members wear \\"the shiny, smug expressions of people who know they are right\\", and the book suddenly takes on a level of depth and allusion that you would never expect in what appears to be a simple adventure story.Neither the Traction Cities nor the Static Communities are right (in fact most of the time they are very much in the wrong), and the conflict of the book is not which side wins, but whether Tom and Hester can survive the conflict that goes on between them, living long enough to make a decent life for themselves. This is a great set of books: read them!"},{"Title":"Predator's Gold (Mortal Engines Quartet)","review":"PREDATOR'S GOLD is the second book in the Hungry City Chronicles, an action-packed series set in a \\"city-eat-city\\" world. Philip Reeve introduced \\"Municipal Darwinism\\" in his first book MORTAL ENGINES, in which traction cities roll about the earth looking for smaller, weaker cities to devour. He also introduced the series' protagonists: Hester, a scavenger who has lived her life largely outside the bounds of the enormous rolling cities, and Tom, an apprentice historian.PREDATOR'S GOLD follows the continuing adventures of Hester and Tom, who have taken charge of the Jenny Haniver, an airship belonging to legendary aeronaut Anna Fang. They have spent the past few years traveling the \\"birdroads,\\" taking on passengers and cargo to earn their living.Their peace is short-lived when a new, radical wing of the Anti-Traction League (a rebel group dedicated to the idea that cities should become stationary again) tries to reclaim the airship for their own uses. Shot down and desperately in need of repairs, Hester and Tom land on the sparsely populated city of Anchorage, which is under the new leadership of Freya, a spoiled margravine whose parents died in an engineered plague. Freya, enamored of the tales of a lush, green paradise, as reported in the preposterous books of Prof. Pennyroyal, has directed her city towards the Dead Continent, across the uncharted ice of the arctic.Things take a turn for the disastrous when Hester, jealous of Tom's affection for Anchorage and the beautiful, plump margravine, commits an act of betrayal that sets off an explosive series of events. Murder, intrigue and resurrection of the dead steer the book toward an exciting conclusion.Those who enjoyed MORTAL ENGINES will not be disappointed. Having established \\"Municipal Darwinism\\" in his first book, Reeve is now free to explore and expand upon the idea. There is less violence in PREDATOR'S GOLD, but the book remains full of action and has several new imaginative twists. Among them are the \\"Lost Boys,\\" a group of parasitic thieves who attach themselves to unsuspecting cities and plunder them in secret. Despite a name that suggests Peter Pan's Neverland, the Lost Boys and their greedy Uncle have more in common with Fagin's gang of boy thieves in Oliver Twist, and are ruled by manipulation and cruelty.Also reappearing are the Resurrection Men, machines made using the bodies of the dead. While these horrifying machine men, and the fact that most cities are dependent upon poorly treated slaves, would suggest a moral agenda, one of the most fascinating aspects of the Hungry City Chronicles is that Reeve does not involve his main characters in politics or rebellion. Hester and Tom find themselves involved in their adventures accidentally, or because of personal reasons. Where most authors would be likely to be sympathetic toward the aims and ends of the Anti-Traction League, Reeve has instead created the militant Green Storm, who will stoop to terrorism to achieve their ends.The Hungry City Chronicles contains a lot of moral ambiguity and offers some excellent chances to explore the pros and cons of technology, and societal structures. The ending of PREDATOR'S GOLD leaves some intriguing possibilities for the following book in the series, already titled INFERNAL MACHINES. It is set for release in the UK next spring. Sadly, those of us living on the Dead Continent will have to wait another year before we find out what happens next.--- Reviewed by Sarah A.

In Anchorage, they find a teenaged ruler governing a dying city. Tom and Het meet new challenges, both personal and otherwise.In my overall positive review for _Mortal Engines_, I complained about several issues. Chief among them:1) The audience was unclear. The weak dialogue and simple characterization seemed like they belonged to tweens, but the rest of the book was more appropriate for teens.2) The middle dragged.3) There was an affair mentioned, seemingly for no good reason.Philip Reeve did an impressive job with _Predator's Gold_. The writing is more mature, with a clear teen audience. The dialog is more snazzy. The pacing is much better, with no long, boring middle act. The affair turns out not to have been an extramarital affair, but one that took place before the marriage of one of the characters. It also turns out to fuel a plot point or two. There is only one problem with the book, which is Het's surprise ending, which seems to clash with the timing of other events.Highly recommended.

(You should've seen me when I first got it, I was jumping up and down and screaming, people were starting to stare at me...)This is a great example of a sequel that does not fall flat on its face, but builds upon and enhances what was begun in the first book. I really enjoyed the character developement in this one, I felt like I ended up knowing the characters a lot better than before. I especially LOVE Hester, she's like an anti-heroine, but so perfect for what these books are trying to do. All the new characters are top-notch, and I'm so glad that they didn't ALL die this time, like at the end of Mortal Engines. The Anna Fang Stalker was particularly chilling, that whole plot line definately leaves a lot of room for a third book.This book is still as gruesome as the first one and can be more than a little scary for the faint of heart. I for one was shaking in my shoes, heart pumping and practically hyperventilating! But that's what makes this series what it is, it has the power to evoke these sharp emotions, making you feel you are actually in the book. Absolutely amazing, I'd give it 100 stars if I could.

This particular adventure of the only two survivors of the first book in the series drags a bit through its first half, but offers almost continuous action in the final half. The focus here is on the mobile city of Anchorage, which is off on an almost certainly fruitless search for a habitable, fertile region said to exist in the far north of North America, otherwise a barren desert. Anchorage is being chased by the monstrous predator city Arkangel. Meanwhile we learn of a secret organization of thieves, the Lost Boys, who manage to remain unseen and unsuspected whilst raiding the cities for supplies and valuables, and of a terrorist organization which is taking over the already terroristic Anti-Traction League, and pushing it towards even more extreme atrocities. As if that weren't enough a character killed off in the first novel has been revived as a kill-crazy zombie. Needless to say, teenage readers and adults will be kept on the edges of their seats as all the plot-threads converge and it appears the two survivors of the first book are cut down to just one.I enjoyed this so much I immediately picked up Reeve's LARKLIGHT series, which is aimed at much younger readers and thus cuts way down on violence, but offers equally imaginative settings, lovable characters, and incredible adventures."},{"Title":"Predator's Gold (Mortal Engines Quartet)","review":"Few cities are mounted on enormous traction wheels and set rolling across the arctic ice cap in search of pray. Equally few sequels are able to exceed their originals, but \\"Predator's Gold\\" does. The story opens two years after the events in \\"Mortal Engines\\", with Tom and Hester living a precarious existence as freelance air traders among the mobile cities of the North. Unbeknownst to them, other forces are at work which will soon throw their world into chaos. For the moment, though, their attention is consumed by Professor Pennyroyal, a globe-trotting adventurer with fantastic tales about his explorations across the dead continent.Philip Reeve packs \\"Predator's Gold\\" with as many fanciful inventions and discoveries as his first novel. The characters will explore not just new cities, but underwater domains and remote islands where a vicious band of rebels plots a new world order. The creativity never stops coming throughout the book's three hundred pages, and neither do the surprises. There is literally not a single chapter that doesn't pack a wallop at the end.But despite the fearce action and high adventure, the true treat in \\"Predator's Gold\\" is the people. Tom and Hester have been forced to grow up fast amid the extrordinary world of mobile cities, yet for all that they are still children as the novel opens, and they make childish mistakes. Two of these occur near the start, and the consequences will continue playing out for years to come. Newcomer characters are equally lifelike and important in the fate of Anchorage and other cities. Freya Rassmussen is very believable, but it's Professor Pennyroyal who takes the cake with his loudmouth antics and sometimes disgusting personal habits. Yet beneath that exterior, he has personal strength, and a role to play in the events to follow.\\"Predator's Gold\\" is everything you could want and more from the sequel to \\"Mortal Engines\\".

And even though he killed off almost every character at the end of the last installment, there were still a lot of possibilities for the sequel. Predator's Gold is an engaging and entertaining book, but I was still disappointed simply because it doesn't do service to Mortal Engine's grand scope and scale. Hester and Tom's adventures do take an interesting turn in the frozen wastes of the north, which is perfect for this book's plot as it seems to slow down and freeze in the middle sections. The depiction of the evil cities of Arkangel and Wolverinehampton was an interesting twist to the tale, but I wanted more from an incredible world which Reeve has yet to take advantage of.

His book is a revelation as well as a tool that everyone should have.Finding a job with a decent salary is a struggle. More people are going to college, and expectations from job candidates are rising. Mr. Hawk is is right; being qualified isnt enough. I listened to his book and was immediately inspiierd to put the information to use. Listening to the book isnt't nearly enough; you have to pay attention and rehearse. Preperation is a must.My brother just graduated from University of California at Santa Barabara. For the first time in his life, he felt afraid. He feared he would end up waiting on tables. Having spent so much money and time, away from home, on his education, that would' ve been a complete waste.So, he and I listened to the book, and practiced what we had learned. Step by step, we rehearsed being interviwer and interviewee. This exercise and the brilliant insights paid off immediately. My brother rose above the rest of the applicants, and got a job at one of the most successful technology companies in Silicon Valley, California. Mr. Hawk's book armed my brother with the skills and confidence he needed to stand out, to be noticed from among the rest of the applicants, and to get hired. I used the book to get a full-time job, here, as a resident services coordinatior. I am only 22 years old, and I am in the top 40 percent of UK residents making a good salary.

Advice that might have made sense in the 1950s, but that will cripple your career if you follow it in this century. The author imagines a cozy, predictable, unchanging business world that yields success to rigid, top-down, head-in-the-sand, command-and-control organizations, and to workers who model themselves as square cogs in square wheels, closing themselves off to innovation and to communication, thought and life beyond their own departments and corporations.

This book is completely unhelpful in these economic times because savvy candidates (particularly those who were successful before and but for the economic downturn) know to say these things already and perspective employers know it.That being said, I would recommend for my children to hear this in high school and then again upon graduating from college.

I kept waiting for the part where he actually talks about the INTERVIEW. The entire thing concentrates on either completely obvious information about how to behave like a human being WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE A JOB, or how you should praise your boss, because HE reigns supreme. And you know this is out of date, because every time he refers to his boss, he says HE, almost in a tone that implies that your boss must be a man, because what a ludicrous idea for a female to be in charge! He also spends a pretty considerable time talking about how to treat your \\"subordinates,\\" which in itself is pretty condescending, but I'm pretty new to the workforce, and if I had subordinates, I probably wouldn't need to be listen to your worthless audiobook! Also, he said \\"who-ine\\" so many times I nearly smashed my mp3 player against a wall.So, if you want to learn how to kiss ass, and slither your way to the top, and get the \\"corner office\\" which he is always talking about, then this is the book for you.

The book also goes out of its own scope and talks too much about how to change, tweak (or freak, if you like) your personality to achieve some career advancements.

After completed this book, you will get the more clearer view of the panzer force. The pictures are clear and many of them seem to be seen here for the first time. The one disappointed thing is the rather large amounts of wrong identification of the types of AFVs and weapons in the pictures. The quality of printing and binding are of high standard."},{"Title":"Panzer: The Illustrated History of Germany's Armored Forces in WWII","review":"I actually own a copy of this book, and while the photos are good, the person or persons unknown are truly among the clueless when the topic of identifying German armour comes up. After only a cursory examination of the book I was absolutely floored at the sheer quantity of photo identification and factual errors that plagues this book. They start on page 2 and continue on with a total of six type-written pages of errors that I caught. Errors like that on pg 94 (bottom) where the unit symbol shown is for the 11th Panzer, and not the 7th as identified, and no, Rommel didn't command this unit in France as it served on the Eastern Front. Bad research couched as fact in print. Or the caption that lists a dimunitive Panzer II \\"Luchs\\" as a Panther which weighed twice as much. Or the caption on Pg 155 that lists a halftrack whereas the picture shows a Steyr RSO full-track. Other errors are more subtle but just as wrong: how about the picture on page 139 showing a \\"Tiger\\" -which is actually clearly a Panther, or the \\"Tigers on their way to Kursk\\" on p 116: problem is that the Tiger on the middle of the two pages is a mid-production that didn't exist in July 1943. How about the purported interior shot of a Tiger on p 170 (top) which is actually a well-known shot of the inside of a sdkfz 253 halftrack! And the list goes on for those inclined to look. The point is that while the book contains many new and unique pictures, the photo-identifiers are often suspect and should be questioned more often than not. I never did get around to reading my copy as I was so stumped by these many glaring mistakes. As such I can't address the accuracy of the text, but I was extremely disappointed by the mistakes I did uncover. I hate to appear overly picky on such matters, but they simply make so many of these mistakes that the book's credibility is suspect by the informed and, unfortunately, will be accepted as fact by those less knowledgable on the matter. That is enough reason for a reprint with significant revisions.

It completely draws you into the perverted world of Lovecraft which is filled with death, horror, ancient devil-worship, and wonder. If you want to feel the isolation and fear in your soul, you must explore what is in my opinion Lovecraft's best."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"Having read two books chocked full of REAL Lovecraft short stories, I was looking forward to a \\"book length\\" story of his horror. Sadly, I was fooled by a \\"Derleth Knockoff,\\" and should have known better.For real Lovecraftian horror read, \\"Call of Cthullu,\\" \\"The Shadow over Innsmouth,\\" \\"Dagon,\\" \\"The Thing on the Doorstep,\\" \\"The Picture in the House,\\" \\"The Outsider\\" and you will be rewarded will true chills down your spine... not this insipid drivel.The first section, which is told in third person narrative isn't too bad, and sets up the story nicely. It is actually a fair representation of Lovecraft, however, there is not a word of dialogue uttered for 39 pages!! Now once the dialogue starts, the story starts to move, and that familiar Lovecraftian \\"buildup\\" starts.However...just when things are getting interesting, Derleth moves to the next section which is told from Dewart's cousin first person narrative. I found the change in narrative styles in mid story a little disconcerting, but I managed to adjust, and found it interesting, but I was still waiting for the pay off.Then Derleth ineptly moves to the third section, which is first person again, but told from the perspective of assistant Winfield Phillips. The previous narrator(Dewart's cousin Steven Bates) is summarily dispatched via a NOTE in one paragraph. Derleth obviously wrote himself into a trap with his narrative, and couldn't figure out how to bring about Bates death in a suitably gruesome and terrifying way as the story was currently being told from the wrong perspective. How could the narrator know of Bates horrible fate as he wasn't present at the scene. Thus the death of a major character has little impact or horror that it should in a story such as this.The biggest issue I had with this third section was itseemed \\"dumbed down.\\" the narrator goes into a long tirade of Mythology, and explanation, which if the reader was paying attention, would have already figured most of it out from the previous two narratives! Then, Dewart is summarily shot, and buried, and the \\"horror\\" comes to an end. The third section was a complete let down from the build up of the previous two. There was no payoff in the end, and absolutely no shock value at all as the narrator took great pains to over explain everything.The best I can say about this is that there is some reasonable \\"Mythos\\" background, albeit slightly contradictory that might interest the Lovecraftian enthusiast."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"This book is actually written by August Derleth, after HPL's death, supposedly off of notes Lovecraft had sitting around.

Derleth studied the works of Lovecraft but NEVER did he write in collaboration with the master of horror. August Derleth's first story wasn't written until the early 1950's. Howard Philips Lovecraft died in 1937. August Derleth has many failed attempts at immitating Lovecraft and prints Lovecraft's name on the cover of all his books because if people knew that Derleth wrote the stories, they wouldn't buy a single copy. If you wish to read horror by the greatest horror author of all time, be sure to check the coyright lines for each story. Stray from the failures of Derleth and follow the guiding light of Lovecraft."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"Wow, I never knew books could just drone on and on like this on did. The only reason i gave this book two stars instead of one is because it has it's interesting points. The last half of the last section of the book comes to mind.

I'm no scholar or philosopher. I did not major in english or literature. I know next to nothing about the work of HP Lovecraft or those using his mythos as a basis for their literary compositions. Honestly, I barely ever read. What I do know is art and video games and after hearing Lovecraft's name dropped frequently in both circles I decided to give him a try.I chose this particular book because it was cheap and I liked the painting depicted on the cover. What I ended up with was a very entertaining, thought provoking, inspirational book and a desire to read more of his work. If you have heard the name Lovecraft and always wondered what the fuss is about, pick up this book."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"First, there's Lovecraft's own text. It's an outrageous exercise in adjectives, and a classic of purple prose. The, there's Something in the woods. It's been there for hundreds of years, even when not there, waiting to be summoned again. And, when it's summoned, people vanish. Then they reappear, or their broken, distorted, and half-frozen remains do, under bizarre circumstances. For all that, the story is more about hints, half-guesses, and that thing at the edge of your vision, the one that never wholly materializes and never really leaves you.Although it's a thin book by today's standards of thud factor, it builds well. Three successive voices tell three phases of the story, with a new narrator beginning when the previous one is lost to human and humane reason. There's real subtlety in the plotting, even if the language is as florid as any.I normally have reservations about posthumous collaborations - too often, I wish the originator had been alive to defend his work against later tampering. This one works well, though. Derleth knew Lovercraft, to the point of being his literary executor. If anyone knew Lovecraft's mind (a big \\"if\\"), it would have been him. I didn't notice obvious seams between the patches created by each author; the tone and pace held well. Still, I can't wholly trust the later writer to carry out the original's full intent, especially the intent of a mind like Lovecraft's. That's just me being pedantic, though. This is a classic example of the Lovecraft horror story, a kind that today's authors can't, and must never try to raise from the crypt in which its unholy remains had been imprisoned. (Oops - sorry. It does sort of get under your skin.)//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"I really enjoyed this book. If you like Lovecraft stories, then it is worth reading. Derleth did a good job at creating the proper mood and enough suspense to keep you wanting to read more."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"&quot;The Lurker at the Threshold&quot; is listed with H.P. Lovecraft as the first author--in fact, one finds August Derleth's name only in the small print on the back cover. This is a shame, for two reasons: first, it tends to hide the fact that the book is almost entirely made up of Derleth's writing, since Lovecraft's only (and posthumous) contribution was a sketchy outline in his notes; second, while Lovecraft was far from a great writer, or often even a good one, his best work was miles above this bit of trash.The book is divided into three parts that fail completely to make a seamless whole. In the first part, a third-person narrator describes the arrival of Ambrose Dewart at his ancestor's home in Rhode Island, near Lovecraft's invented towns of Arkham, Dunwich and Innsmouth. He begins to carry out research into the life of his ancestor, and finds dark intimations that he was a sorcerer or conjurer of some sort. In the second part, the point of view becomes that of Dewart's cousin in Boston, who spends some time with Dewart and provides his own point of view on the strange mental state that appears to have come upon the man. In the final section, we are presented with the narrative of an assistant of some sort to a learned professor in Arkham who is called in to clean up Dewart's mess.The third section reads like a sloppy, last-minute wrap-up by a writer too lazy to see his story through. The professor is, conveniently enough, an erudite scholar of just the sort of occult weirdness that Ambrose Dewart has let overtake him, and so we are treated to long paragraphs of explication as to just what sort of powers he is dealing with. [As a side note, it is worth pointing out that the explication here is indicative of Derleth's rather belabored systematization of Lovecraft's &quot;mythos,&quot; with references to &quot;elemental&quot; beings and like inventions that really fail to fit in with Lovecraft's original vision, such as it was.] The situation is resolved with only the mildest of struggles, and the final paragraph utterly fails to carry any of the horrific import Derleth clearly intended it to have, especially if you have only the foggiest of ideas of exactly what &quot;Yog-Sothoth&quot; was supposed to be.The remainder of the book is run-of-the-mill Lovecraftian pastiche. Overall, &quot;Lurker&quot; is worthwhile, and then marginally so, only for Cthulhu completists and lovers of Lovecraftiana; anyone else is advised to stick to the original--&quot;The Best of H.P. Lovecraft&quot; is a fine starting point."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"This is one of Derleth's (in)famous &quot;posthomous collaborations&quot; with HPL, where he took a few scraps HPL did and slotted them into his own story.Sadly, Mr Derleth's Mythos stories (both the posthomous collaborations and the stuff he took all the credit for) tend to all have the same plot: some guy moves into an ancestor's house, it turns out that the ancestor was an evil cultist, the guy repeats his ancestor's Cthulhu-worship. Yawn. Lovecraft did it once, and did it better, in &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot;.Fortunately, Derleth pulls of the repeated plot a lot better here than he did elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"The newest acquisition of Ambrose Dewart is a the Billington's mansion, which belonged to an ancestor of Dewart... a quite strange ancestor, involved in mysterious rituals .

August Derleth finished the book and filled in all missing chapters.. probably the greatest &quot;post-mortem&quot; cooperation! Read it!! --George"},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"BEWARE! Carroll &amp; Graf are lying to you! This book is really by long-time friend of H.P.'s August Derleth! DO NOT BE FOOLED! I was, and I'm frankly a bit pissed, but nevertheless...It's true: Derleth merely uses a few snippets of Lovecraft's stuff to embellish it with his own. Granted, it is a fine book, but it really should say, at least, &quot;by Derleth and Lovecraft.&quot; It's false advertising - no more, no less. The text is approximately 2% Lovecraft's!!! But enough bitching, it's a great book, quite chilling.."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"I purchased this book under the pretense that it was written by Lovecraft. After hearing so much praise about HPL, I couldn't wait to start reading it. After the first few chapters, it became a chore to read. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. It was like eating a bowl of tofu when you expected Captain Crunch. When I finished it I was convinced all the hype about HPL was blown out of proportion and that he was nothing more than a less than mediocre author. Little did I know he didn't even write it! It took me over 3 years to find this out. When I finally did get my hands on an authentic Lovecraft book I was floored by the way he drew me right into the story-the dark and shadowy world of Innsmouth. Don't buy &quot;The Lurker at the Threshhold&quot;. Save your time and money and be sure to check the copywrite before you buy any Lovecraft book(Derleth is sneaky)."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"August Derleth's &quot;posthumous collaboration&quot; with his idol H.P. Lovecraft (despite the credit, Lovecraft's contributions are merely snippets of his writing journal) is just all over the map, trying to tie three unrelated plot strands together through the usual Derlethian haunted house mumbo-jumbo. Some chilling sequences, but Derleth has jimmed so much mythos information into the story that it reads less as a horror novel and more like some junior high school kid's diary of all the &quot;neat stuff&quot; in Lovecraft. Derleth did this much better in his short stories, especially &quot;The Dweller in Darkness.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"Still having the ending fresh in my mind, I must say that it would be hard to write a more disappointing ending except by just failing to write one altogether. The story was all building up to one epic ending, and instead of a satisfactory delivery it feels like a fizzling white-wash that leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth and a desire to smack the author.Get anything else by Lovecraft. This isn't entirely written by him, but also August Derleth who must have concocted that awful ending."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"Of all the reviews written here about this long out of print work I am astonished by all the misinformation written by so-called fans. Most of this comes from very young readers, I am assuming, who know little of the pulp magazines and are confused by paperback editions of books that are recycling stories and novels that have been around for a LONG time. Derleth never wrote a story until the 1950s? What hogwash! His weird fiction appeared as early as 1932 and the bulk of his weird fiction and mystery novels appeared throughout the late 30s and into the 1940s. Never collaborated? No, not in the flesh. But he knew Lovecraft while he was still alive, for heavens sake. But most of the \\"collaborations\\" were based on notes and plot outlines found among the dozens of papers Derleth and his friends inherited. \\"Buy anything by Lovecraft especially something from Arkham House.\\" This book was ORIGINALLY Published by Arkham House in the 1940s! A publishing house I might add, created by Derleth and his pal Donald Wandrei. Readers should be celebrating the republication of a book that is highly sought after by collectors. It's a lot more affordable now at a mere ten bucks! It's hardly trash or garbage. Untidily written perhaps and derivative yes. But most of this fiction is derivative anyway. All the writers in the genre borrow from each other and little of it shows any real originality. Rehash after rehash. Readers and fans of this genre ought to read LURKER AT THE THRESHOLD for its literary historic value and keep in mind that Derleth's arch, sometimes annoyingly, baroque style is meant to evoke a mood of long forgotten era. I kind of like this quaint stuff. It sure beats the heck out of the gore-fests crammed with dismemberment, disembowelings, torture and sexual perversity that pass for horror these days."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"It's a good read. It's not an action-packed, thrill-a-minute magnum opus, as it seems some wish it wouldve been. It's a rich, Gothic story... not trendy modern neo-Gothic.

It's enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"This is a fairly good novel and one of the betterMythos works August Derleth ever wrote. Yes, I said AugustDerleth. H. P. Lovecraft is given credit on the cover,but he only supplies two short fragments that are abouta page's worth of material each and were probably notintended to go together. The rest is entirelyAugust Derleth's work. In all fairness, this is Carrolland Graf's problem, not Amazon Book's."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"Do you like slow-paced Gothic horror? If so, you're going to like \\"The Lurker at the Threshold,\\" a leisurely paced novel concerning British gentleman Ambrose Dewart's descent into madness upon returning to the Massachusetts estate his family all but abandoned in the 19th Century. This isn't the best example of such a book, but it does have its pleasures and would have made a nice black-and-white thriller with Vincent Price back in the day. As such, I can recommend this if you like the style and aren't looking for endless arrays of grisly phantoms popping their skulls into your face every 20 pages or so. I've read it and enjoyed almost every minute of it.However, this novel most certainly is not a true collaboration between authors H.P. Lovecraft and August Derleth. That's where the trouble starts. Anyone truly familiar with Lovecraft's writing style is going to instantly realize that the byzantine sentence construction, the eldritch wizardry of the imagery, and the often archiac and cerebral language we associate with Lovecraft just aren't there. (Derleth, to his credit, writes dialogue better than Lovecraft did and adds some human touches usually lacking in Lovecraft's characters.) Derleth seems to have used just a few paragraphs by Lovecraft as the springboard for an entire novel, padding it out with some paraphrased language from other Lovecraft stories such as \\"Charles Dexter Ward.\\"This doesn't make the novel bad, just misleading. And a lot of unsuspecting people read this book and developed an opinion of Lovecraft that has nothing to do with the author's actual work. Why on earth can't the publisher include a foreword letting us know the truth behind the collaboration? I doubt it would hurt sales, and it would help to mend some broken fences.As might be expected, Lovecraft's infamous Mythos provides some color to the supernatural happenings. Persons more expert than I will have fun picking apart how Derleth's versions of Lovecraftian locations and monsters differ from Lovecraft's takes on the same creations. To me, the references work in adding some mysterious overtones to the story. To you, they may serve only as reminders that Lovecraft wrote much more frightening work elsewhere, especially in \\"The Dunwich Horror.\\"It's hard for me to get excited about this novel one way or another, but it's a pleasant enough read and as a Lovecraft fan I had to own it."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"I first read THE LURKER IN THE THRESHOLD when I was a young Mythos fanatic in the early 1970's, and I loved it. At that time I loved all things Mythos. Moft of ye reviewers here know that this book is the work of August Derleth, not H. P. Lovecraft. The publishers of this book have been criminally deceitful in putting only Lovecraft's name in large letters on the front cover, a crime for which they should be prosecuted. Derleth was a strange man who liked to play practical jokes -- he would sometimes write stories in Arkham House books that were supposed to be by Robert E. Howard or J. Sheridan LeFanu but were actually by Derleth. But I do not think that we can regard THE LURKER AT THE THRESHOLD as a hoax, for I believe that Derleth meant it to be an authentic tribute to his hero, H. P. Lovecraft. Derleth would lie about the origin of the book (claiming that it was a novel left unfinished by Lovecraft, when in fact Lovecraft left no novel unfinished at his death), but then state plainly that the novel was completely his work based on notes left behind by HPL.Derleth attempted to sell the novel to WEIRD TALES but it was rejected due to length, and so he published it himself through Arkham House. It has often been mistaken as the work of H. P. Lovecraft, but I don't think that was Derleth's original intention. He was obsessed with bringing Lovecraft's name into the limelight, and he succeeded brilliantly. I think THE LURKER AT THE THRESHOLD has stayed in-print since its initial publication, a remarkable feat.If you are looking for a book by Lovecraft, don't buy this book. But if you want a fairly good and imaginative novel in the Cthulhu Mythos tradition, one that is rich in imagination and well-written, this is a good book for you. The huge mistake made by Derleth in the writing of this book was his delusion in thinking that it is, in its narrative voice, \\"like Lovecraft.\\" It is nothing of the kind, and Derleth was completely misguided in thinking he knew how \\"to write like Lovecraft.\\" He wrote like Derleth -- and Derleth was a good writer of weird fiction. The story is imaginative and creepy -- and it is certainly Lovecraftian, which merely means that it is a work inspired by the weird fiction of H. P. Lovecraft. I rank it as the second-best of Derleth's fake \\"collaborations with\\" Lovecraft, my personal favourite being \\"The Survivor.\\" I return to THE LURKER AT THE THRESHOLD often. It holds my imagination and is a delightful Mythos novel, effective and sinister and original for its time. The Cthulhu Mythos did not exist as we know it today at the time this book was written--this being one of the first extended works that helped to form what eventually became the Cthulhu Mythos. Although I feel that Lovecraft's name should be removed from the book, I will happily admit that I love the novel for what it is.Begging to remain,Ever thy hmbl obt srvt,W. H.

I enjoyed this book,and will add it to my Lovecraft collection."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"This book begins with an heir to a haunted family dynasty reclaiming his ancestral home and quickly doing some research into his ancestors and their contribution to mysterious noises and disappearances. He digs through old histories and newspapers in order to put together the puzzle of what happened in those weeks leading up to his great great grandfather leaving the country and never coming back. And then the scene shifts to his cousin who ALSO researches old tomes and family documents. Seriously, that's what actually happens in the thing. More research. And in the third chapter, there's EVEN MORE research happening.Oh sure, there's a lot of the Lovecraft touches like the lurkers from beyond space and time and the old gods and our pal Yog Shoggoth but really most of the book is all about the research and the hunting through hoary old books. It's like a graduate student fantasy but instead of digging through archives and looking for all those receipts and diaries in order to discover Aaron Burr's tax record or evidence about the affects of the New Deal, you get to discover an ancient religion in which the deities are ready to get to you. And they are possessing your grandfather - and that weird indian.Of course, you can't really avoid the problems with Lovecraft including the bad dialogue and the casual racism, but for the most part this is a pretty entertaining read about nerds doing research. And some have noted that the ending is a bit anti-climatic but I thought it was awesome. And rather hilarious."},{"Title":"The Lurker At The Threshold","review":"I highly recommend this book.

There was always a sense of creepiness, something not quite right going on all the time, even with casual conversations with the locals. I loved that.

Agent Tom West connects this assassination with the murder of FBI agent Michael Ballard ten years ago. In common is J. Edgar Hoover's fingerprint at the scene of both homicides.Assisted by Agent Christine Peal, Michael begins to find a link to events started in 1969 with a rare occurrence of FBI and CIA cooperation by concurrent assassinations in Cameroon and DC, but one of the witnesses requiring elimination escaped. As the two Feds begin to uncover a conspiracy that envisions taking over the country, they realize that this is more than a case of revenge. They must first solve the conspiracy that leads to some of America's most powerful leaders before they can capture the \\"Hoover killer\\". Either side of the puzzle contains individuals who would prefer to see Agents West and Peal removed officially or preferably dead.THE HOOVER PRINT is an exciting political thriller based on the concept that history is linear so that a minor, almost unnoticed event beyond an immediate family's awareness, can still lead to major impact years later. The story line is loaded with detail that surprisingly enhances the belief in the non-stop action as genuine. Readers will empathize with the killer and root for the Feds to uncover the truth because the audience will want to know how Hoover is reaching out from the grave years after his death.

It all starts when a harried detective stops a girl from committing suicide and asks her to step in the place of a dead woman in order to solve a mystery. From then on you have mayhem, danger, and sweeping romance. Trust me, this is a great book--especially if you're a little bored and depressed yourself!!!"},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"For those who had enjoyed children adventure books like those written by Enid Blyton or Capt WE Johns, this book wouldhave fit right in.Unlike other novels by the writer, this book is not a mysterybook but an adventure book. There is no who-done-it, thoughthere are few clues left around, there is no crime actually defined.Scientists from the West have gone missing. When the wife of one such scientist went on a holiday, supposedly to recover from the trauma, British agents had her tailed, suspecting she could lead them to the whereabouts of the missing scientists. But when her plane crashed and she was seriously injured, the trail appeared to go cold. Enter Hilary Craven, a suicidal woman who bore a passing resemblance. Offered a more exciting way to die in an almost certainly fatal missiong, she eagerly took the chance.Not knowing what she could expect to find, the British agents could brief her little except to play-it-by-ear. As they hoped, she was accepted as the supposed wife, and led to be with her supposed husband. But as closely as the British agents trailed her, the adversary was a step ahead to outsmart the shadowers and Hilary found herself in an unexpected place, with even more unexpected encounters.Would she survive, or would she be exposed as an impostor? The strangely diverse people she had for travelling companions on her way to the lair of the enemy made her wonder if the whole business was what it really appeared to be.In Hilary, the writer had a perfect character for such a mission, a person who had no desire for self preservation, and could mold herself into another being who had a dual purpose in life, one as a impostor wife, another as an undercover agent.To paraphrase a line from a popular song, when she fooled the others, she fooled herself as well and through the ordeal, she actually became the force which pushed others to cling on to hope, and eventually, regaining her sense and purpose of existence.A highly enjoyable book, in the cast of adolescent adventure but written for adults."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"This 1955 novel is a departure from her more well known cosy series books. This one has none of her more familiar characters like Poirot or Marple, the setting is mostly the North African desert and centers on a James Bond type conspiracy complete with secret hideout and mysterious, fabulously wealthy mastermind.Hilary Craven has been defeated by life, her daughter has died, her husband has left her and she has nothing left to live for. She has decided to leave England and in an out-of-the-way spot in Morocco end it all. Circumstances intervene and instead of a quiet end in a lonely hotel room Hilary finds herself cast in the role of secret agent.This is a rather standard thriller type novel. Although a departure from Christie's usual fare there are still many of her more familiar motifs. The 'hero' is a single woman off on a adventure (like MAN IN THE BROWN SUIT), there is also a 'master criminal' (like the Tommy and Tuppence series or PASSENGER TO FRANKFURT) and much of the action takes place in an isolated, contained environment. As always in Christie's work the clues are all there for the reader to follow right up to the surprise ending."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"I read this book a number of years ago and am still fascinated by it. I think that this is one of Ms. Christie's best books."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Whenever Agatha Christie stepped away from her usual detectives Hercules Poirot and Miss Marple, the entire tone of her novels would often shift from mysteries (often called \\"cozies\\" on account of their English village settings) to espionage/conspiracy thrillers. This is especially true of \\"Destination Unknown\\" which spans several countries and a lengthy passage of time, with special agents, government officials and wealthy masterminds making up (most of) its cast.It deals with the scenario of several international scientists disappearing without a trace. International governments are getting concerned as to where they've all gone, and whether they're being kidnapped or going of their own volition. The most recent disappearance is that of Thomas Betterson, who leaves a potential lead in the form of his wife Olive. The officials in charge of the case are certain that she knows more than she's letting on, but are finding her a tough nut to crack...Hilary Craven has nothing to live for. After her daughter dies and her husband leaves her for another woman, she prepares to commit suicide. However, she is just about to overdose on sleeping pills when she hears a knock at her hotel door. It is a perfect stranger who saw her buying a large quantity of sleeping pills and who has a proposition for her. If she does in fact long for death, why not go out in a blaze of glory? British agents have been tailing Mrs Betterson to Morocco hoping that she would lead them to her husband, only for her to die in a plane crash. Since Hilary has a passing resemblance to the dead woman, would she be willing to take her place and hopefully discover what happened to the missing scientists?The set-up is ridiculously unlikely, and yet utterly compelling. Christie draws out the suspense of where Hilary is going and what she will find when she gets there to perfection, crafting a dream-like atmosphere that is nonetheless grounded in reality by the devastating planning of the secret organization that whisks Hilary and her fellow passengers into the unknown. It would be hugely remiss to discuss what it awaiting Hilary on her strange adventure, but I suppose it's fair to say that after such a magnificent setup, any revelation comes as something of a disappointment. Yet perhaps that's the point, as Christie once again draws upon her oft-used theme of the inherent small-mindedness of megalomania and the strength of those dismissed as ordinary.\\"Destination Unknown\\" is certainly not one of Christie's best books. Though most of her mysteries demand a re-read in order to pick up on the clues and red herrings strewn throughout the plot, the enjoyment of \\"Destination Unknown\\" hinges on the suspense of Hilary's journey. Once over, there's little reason to revisit it, despite the last-minute shoehorning in of a mystery that is only tangentially connected to the rest of the plot. There are a couple of loose ends and some characters that remain unaccounted for, but on the whole it makes for an intriguing but light read.Much like a cross between \\"They Came to Baghdad\\" and \\"Passenger to Frankfurt\\" (with a dash of \\"Toward Zero\\" thrown in, what with a wannabe-suicide finding a new purpose in life) Christie draws heavily on her own travelling experiences to map Hilary's journey and her own belief system to explore the nature of power, freedom, progress and knowledge - raising some weighty philosophical questions along the way."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"I know this book has an indifferent reputation and it is sometimes compared unfavorably to Christie's preceding thriller, THEY CAME TO BAGHDAD. But over the years I've come to prefer DU to BAGHDAD, maybe as I've grown older and more reflective. The insouciant and devil may care heroine of BAGHDAD, Victoria Jones, was once more appealing to me, and the social comedy of that book remains a delight. But now I am in a Hilary Craven state of mind. If you ask me, Hilary Craven is one of Christie's greatest accomplishments as a character, and her gradual transformation during the events of her \\"ritualized suicide\\" is so skillfully done it's hard to see how it could be improved.At first she is a frightened, despondent mess, as a result of catastrophes in her personal life, a broken marriage, and the death of her only child, a little girl. She keeps obsessing about Brenda, the dead girl, and visualizing the pathetic tiny mound of her grave. She decides to commit suicide and nothing is going to stop her. Christie takes you deep inside Hilary's mind, and her decision seems perfectly rational and even moral, and then fate knocks at her door. In a way we've heard Christie tell this story before, because a would-be suicide turns into the hero of TOWARDS ZERO, and we get some idea of her philosophy on the subject--don't kill yourself because of the butterfly effect, and you never know when you might save someone else's life if only you live. DESTINATION UNKNOWN shows signs of Christie's interest in French existentialism, and the questions it asks are pretty deep ones. What is the price of personal freedom? Is freedom an illusion? In paradise--real or imagined--is there any freedom of choice? If humans are infinitely adaptable and can get used to anything, where is the spark that separates us from the animals? Is identity itself a learned response?"},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Hilary Craven, the heroine of this story, wishes to commit suicide. The sleeping pills are on her bedside table and all is ready for self-imposed death when a knock on the door changes her plans. A young man tells her the story of a nuclear physicist who has disappeared. Hilary, intrigued by the drama, agrees to impersonate the scientist's wife and begins an improbable masquerade that leads her deep into Africa to an unknown destination.This is a book you will probably want to read in one sitting because of its breathless excitement which culminates in a surprising ending."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"As an unapologetic, die-hard Christie fan, I loved this book. However, it was one of her later ones and is not a murder mystery. Rather it is a sort of spy thriller. The story is that scientists have been disappearing from their posts all over the world, just after WWII. A wife of one of the disappeared men announced her intention to take a trip for her nerves. On the way she dies, and the police set up another red-haired woman who resembles her to take her place. This imposter is taken on a journey to an unknown destination in Africa to meet up with her husband. The trip was described so well that I fell into it and almost felt as if I were along for the ride. I think it had to be based on actual trips she took herself. Once she reaches her destination, she finds herself trapped with a man who is not her husband but who is willing to keep up the pretense for reasons of his own. How she is finally rescued and falls for one of her fellow captors concludes the story. The plot has the trademark Christie twist at the end, but it is admittedly not the mystery she is known for. The remarkable thing about this book is that Christie finally indulges her desire to express her philosphies of life, which she always wanted to do, but was restrained by her publishers. I marked the bits of philosophy which really didn't relate to the plot and found many of them. A lot of this book sounds autobiographical and may reveal more of Christie's true self that her official autobiography. Absolutely fascinating and irresistable to a Christie fan like me."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Another one of Christie's espionage potboilers contains one of her best female protagonists. Hillary Craven starts out a tragic figure and becomes by the end, a clever, determined and complex character. Slight comparisons to Passenger to Frankfurt, which expands on the disappearing scientist thread more chillingly. As usual, Agatha tops off the adventure with some nice final twists."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"A thriller type. Her knowledge of the middle east from her husband's excavations, Max Mallowan, puts her--and us--in the picture. Wonderful fun.Often underrated by Agatha purists."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"In the 1920s and 1930s Agatha Christie often created novels that were more \\"thriller\\" than \\"mystery\\"--but as time passed she became less and less interested in such material. 1954's DESTINATION UNKNOWN (also published as SO MANY STEPS TO DEATH) is one of her few such novels from the latter half of her career.The novel has a topical story line that references the Cold War, defections, and even the notorious House Unamerican Activities Committee. In the aftermath of her child's death and a painful divorce, Hilary Craven travels to the Middle East in an effort to escape her past--and when this fails determines to kill herself. But her attempt at suicide is foiled when she is confronted with an intelligence officer aware of her intention, an intelligence officer who makes her an unusual proposal: if you are so determined to die, why not do it in a way that would serve your country? A nuclear scientist has defected; his wife, rushing to join him, has died in a plane crash. And Hilary, intrigued, agrees to take the wife's place in an effort to trace the missing scientist and uncover the intent behind his disappearance. It is a mission from which she is unlikely to return alive.Although the premise is interesting, the resulting novel reads rather like the outline for a minor Alfred Hitchcock film. Christie writes with her usual expertise, but the characters here are not greatly memorable and the story itself falls down a bit toward the novel's conclusion. Still, it is a fast and fun read, and fans of the writer will likely enjoy it as a change of pace from her more typical fare.

Nevertheless she succeeds in continuing her trip, but is not fully aware into which beehive she stumbles.First of all it must be stated clearly that this is not a detective story, but an atempt at an espionage novel. When Agatha published Destination Unknown in 1954, Ian Flemming had just created his famous James Bond character in the novel Casino Royale. Although Agatha clearly has the intention of making the plot flamboyant and bursting with action, she never succeeds in coming close to the fantastic plots that Flemming created. It is clear that the specialty of the Queen of Crime lies in the typical whodunit with Poirot and Marple as the key-characters and not in novels of espionage. The plot of Destination Unknown is straightforward and, although some admirable attempts were made to surprise the reader, lacks the level of suspense that normally characterizes this type of thriller.This book certainly does not belong to Agatha Christie's highlights. But then again, it is still remarkable that seen the enormous size of her oeuvre, she only wrote but a few really bad books."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Ok, Agatha Christie is my favorite author, but this has got to be the worst book she's written; I wish I could give it a 0. I thought it was a murder book by the title, but once I read only 1/4 of it, I knew it was boring and confusing; by the time I got to the middle of a page, I forgot what I read one page before. I almost began wishing Hillary HAD decided to kill herself. I got this book among 8 more books by Agatha Christie, and even though this is the first one I began reading, I know it's the most boring. If you like Agatha Christie like I do, get books that look interesting; believe me, this one isn't"},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Too bad you can't give a book 0 stars, I would if I could. I read this book and found it SO boring (this might be because I read it when I was 10). I couldn't remember what I had read at the top of the page before I go to the bottom! This just proves how boring it was. And believe me, I was reading other mysteries at the time so I know a good one when I see it. Agatha Christie was NOT a good one."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Destination Unknown is possibly my favorite Christie novel. It is filled with twists and turns and follows an incredibly likable woman named Hilary Craven who must pretend to be someone she is not. She is faced with a mysterious journey where each step takes her closer to danger and further from her previous life. Her goal is to find a missing scientific genius who has vanished into thin air. The reason for the disappearance is absolutely impossible to deduce until the very end. One of the main themes of this book is: the acceptance of inevitable captivity."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"One of Christie's more atypical books, Destination Unknown is much more of a spy thriller than a traditional murder mystery. Brilliant scientists are mysteriously disappearing from all over the world, and the British secret service races to discover where they've gone and why.Hilary Craven, a strong and lovely young Englishwoman who is traveling to Morocco to escape from the desperate tragedy of her life, finally realizes that she is trying to escape from herself and the pain she carries with her, so she decides to end her life. Hilary's blazing red hair turns out to be a surprising gift, however, and at this point the Secret Service makes contact with her. Hilary is sent off into the ancient cities of Africa on a wild and dangerous mission replete with the near-certainty of failure and death.Destination Unknown is a colorful and vivid spy thriller remarkable for its well-paced character development, as Hilary progresses from brokenness and utter despair to strength and courage."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the Greenway Ed edition? There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead (SO MANY STEPS TO DEATH) editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Bantam, Berkley, Signet, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"I'm not much of a fan of the thriller genre - there's usually so much detailed intrigue that I can't even keep up with what's happening, let alone figure out what's really going on. So hooray for Agatha Christie! Her thrillers are plot-focused (rather than designed to show off how clever she thinks she is), admirably economical, and contain some really appealing characters.Hilary Craven is a woman who has lost her husband and child, and is seeking escape by travelling to Morocco. But once there, she discovers that her problems are within her - that there is no escape. She decides to end her life, but is interrupted by the practical Mr Jessop. Jessop has previously been encountered investigating the disappearance of Thomas Betterton, another brilliant scientist who has vanished without a trace. He suggests that if Hilary is so bent on death, she could make herself useful to him while she seeks it. Deciding that she's up to the challenge and convinced that death is what she really wants, Hilary impersonates the wife of Thomas Betterton and heads off into the unknown. She waits for Mrs Betterton's mysterious allies to contact her and take her to join her \\"husband\\", knowing she will be beyond help if her ruse is discovered. And once she is contacted, then the fun really begins.Hilary is a great character, the mystery she gets caught up in is a satisfying one, and as with all Christie novels, there is a great sense of era as the concerns and foibles of the 1950s (when this book was written) are brought to life."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Most of Agatha Christie novels are murder mysteries. They follow the usual murder mystery formula. Someone is murdered. Enter the detective who must solve the mystery before the murderer strikes again.Destination Unknown is different. It is more of a thriller than a mystery. There are deaths, but it is different. And in a total good way. This was a nice break from the murder mysteries and kept me reading until the last paragraph.Definitely recommend it for all Agatha Christie fans."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Destination Unknown is a departure from Agatha Christie's usual work in that it is not a whodunit set in England. Instead, it is one of her espionage-type works. (I say \\"espionage-type\\" because it starts out feeling like a cold-war spy thriller, but ends up being something else. I won't say any more so as not to spoil it for anyone).Of course, there is no Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple here, nor is there any of the slight quirkiness and charm that is often a trait of Christie's mysteries. Instead, Destination Unknown has a more serious feel that shows well Christie's writing skill.I enjoyed this primarily because I liked the main character, Hillary Craven. Main characters make or break books, and in this case I connected with Hillary right off and that affinity and connection held throughout the rest of the book.As mysteries go, I have to rate this one as slightly better than average. The book starts out with strong suspense and good pacing that continues up until Hillary arrives at her \\"destination.\\" From that point the story stalls slightly until the end, when Christie throws in twists and turns in rapid succession. The whole plot is far-fetched and not very realistic, but it is fun and entertaining and keeps you wondering what is going to happen.The narrator is so-so. She does well enough with most of the voices, although I didn't care for her hoarse, whispery rendition of a couple of the male characters. She didn't do all that well with the American voices, either, but then I have yet to hear a British narrator who can do an American accent well.All in all an entertaining story, with Christie's typical happy ending."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Not the usual Christie fare, this spy story keeps you in suspense from page 1. I thought it was well done, although the plot is highly improbable. Like most Christie's work, it focuses more on the psychological aspect than anything else. The writing is good. I could see several serious philosophical questions addressed, in a light style through the conversations and thoughts of the protagonists. Being a scientist myself, I truly appreciated this piece."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"I listened to this during a long drive from the Bay area to southern California and it certainly made the miles go faster (without my vehicle speed going over the legal limit).I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the character voices were excellently produced.I will certainly look for more titles from this producer."},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"Most of Agatha Christie's books deal with established characters, such as Poirot and Marple. But, there are a few that stand alone. Interestingly, most of them focus on powerful people who want to rule the world. Destination Unknown and They Came to Bagdad are two of the best known. Some of her works featuring the power-hungry also include an established character (The Rule of Four and Poirot).In Destination Unknown, written during the height of the Cold War, the reader could be lulled into thinking at the outset that it is a cold war novel between East and West. The reader will be fooled! It is instead a novel about scientists and others seeking a utopian world where they can work unfettered by governments. Eventually they discover the illusiveness of their searcb and become pawns in a \\"new society\\" created by a megalomanic.Christie mixes a touch of murder and international intrigue into this great read!"},{"Title":"Destination Unknown","review":"It's nice to take a break from Poirot and Marple. Usually, when Christie gets away from her usual detectives, you get a story that has plenty of adventure and a much more interesting story. A harried detective sends a girl ready to commit suicide on on a hunt for some murderers...dressed up like a dead woman. Needless to say, your heart is racing thru-out the whole thing. Buy it, especially if you feel bored or rather depressed yourself!"},{"Title":"Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter","review":"...was the supreme revelation of the Eleusinian Mysteries.The Mysteries, if you aren't familiar with them, were an initiatory ritual dedicated to the grain mother, Demeter, and her daughter Persephone, who married the lord of death and agreed to split her time between the upper world and the lower. Thousands of Greeks lined up to receive initiation year after year, and afterward they raved of a beatific vision that completely dispelled their fear of death. But they were sworn to secrecy about the things they saw in the Goddesses' temple, and so there are no records explicitly saying what happened there. Many scholars have studied the Mysteries, and at the end of their essays thrown up their hands, figuratively, and saying there is no way we will ever know what the revelation was.Kerenyi does a wonderful job, in this scholarly book, of trying to put his finger on the nature of the vision. He starts by ruling out things that it could not have been. Poetic sources vividly describe the abduction of Persephone/Kore, and her return to her mother. There were no secrets there. Thus, the Mysteries must not have centered around either of these events. He then uses archaeological and literary evidence to piece together a surmise about what the Mysteries really were. So many little things, in Kerenyi's hands, add up to become significant. Why won't Demeter drink wine during her mourning period? What is the meaning behind the scene where she puts the boy in the fire to make him immortal? What about tantalizing poetic hints that Demeter, like earlier mother goddesses, might have descended to the underworld herself in search of her daughter?In the end, Kerenyi's theory works quite well. The Mysteries could very well have been much like what he describes. And yet, even if he's right, there is still something mysterious about the whole production. We might have finally figured out what the priests and priestesses of Eleusis showed to the initiates. But we have to use our imaginations to recreate the feeling it must have given them, the meaning it must have held, in a less cynical age than our own."},{"Title":"Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter","review":"Keneyi's extensive research of the historical written and lastest archaelogical findings on Eleusis is impressive. The text is liberally documented with numerous illustrations that help create a visual perspective. Keneyi sets the stage with a geographical, historical and mythological background, introduces us to the Lesser Mysteries at Agrai and leads us to the Sacred Way on the trail of the grieving Demeter searching for her missing daughter, Persephone. We are titilated by hints of the &quot;visio beatifica&quot; that confers immortality. We are surprised by the rigor of the preparitory austerities. Piece by piece Keneyi recontructs the puzzle, and yet, one of the greatest sacred rites of all time, ultimately remains a mystery..."},{"Title":"Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter","review":"I recommend this book as a formidable try to unravel one of the most important ancient pagan mysteries, that survived for more than a thousand years in the Ancient world.For Kerenyi, the core of the mysteries was the message that 'a birth in death was possible', also for human beings. This message was 'shown' through the ancient myth of the search of Demeter for her ravished daughter Persephone. She finds Persephone under the earth, where she gives birth to Dionysos. The hope of life in death was symbolized through Demeter's offering of the grain, that will grow again. We can see this important hapenning on a stele in the Ancient museum of Athens.The initiated had to fast and were given a drug (the kykeon) just before the procession.Nearly all Roman emperors were initiated (with a special place for Marcus Aurelius).One of the initiated was Plato, who speaks about it in his work 'Phaidoon'.The influence on Christianity by the mysteries cannot be underestimated, for Plato's theory of the soul was adopted by the Church.A compelling read."},{"Title":"Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter","review":"Right up there with Jung and Joseph Campbell is a man named Carl Kerenyi. An exile from his native Hungary, Kerenyi wrote extensively on Greek mythology and played an important role in its revival. Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter, fourth in a series of related books, is his attempt to reconstruct and interpret what really went on in the Eleusinian Mysteries.Like Jung and Campbell, Kerenyi writes from the perspective of psychology and humanism. At the same time, he distances his view from that of Jung in his introduction. Although Kerenyi uses the term \\"archetype\\" he does not mean it in the full Jungian sense. He speaks rather of \\"archetypal facts of human existence\\" (p. xxxii). The meaning of this is about as difficult to pin down as that of Jung's archetypes, but seems to refer in this case to the inescapable fact that all humans have mothers, and that mother-daughter relationships bear certain basic resemblances. It seems to communicate an appeal to human universals, without relying on the collective unconscious on the one hand or existentialist philosophies on the other. From this perspective, he attempts to recover what went on in the mysteries.There is little in his reconstruction that is conclusive, and to an extent he is upfront about this. He says \\"My book should act as the kykeon of Eleusis in all probability did: as a stimulant\\" (p. xx). In other words, he intends to suggest and inspire, not to declare fact. This must be kept in mind by the reader, as Kerenyi has a slippery way of posing arguments. For example, in chapter two he concludes that the ineffable secret (arrheton) of Eleusis was a certain goddess, and the only evidence he provides at the time is the epithet \\"ineffable maiden\\" (arrhetos koura), which only she possesses. Kerenyi then defers further evidence till later, saying \\"This becomes comprehensible only as we gradually penetrate to the core of the Mysteries\\" (p. 26). But he never does put forward any more evidence, and the mere repitition of his thesis, stated in no uncertain terms over and over, threatens to lull the reader into agreement. This is a shaky foundation indeed for one of the core elements of his reconstruction. It is necessary to bear in mind this matter of style to avoid being misled.What is most impressive about Kerenyi's Eleusis is the vast range of material pulled together. The entire gamut of literature, vase paintings, numismatics, and archaeology comes together to form this picture of Eleusis. Often it is quite difficult to discern what that picture is exactly, but nevertheless there are stimulants for research on every page that would take a lifetime for the amateur Classicist to accumulate. This is the greatest strength of the book.A much lesser strength is the reconstruction itself. Kerenyi's conclusions are based on a wide variety of disjointed material, lined up and juxtaposed in interesting ways but hardly connected into a logical argument. Truthfully, I cannot put any faith at all in his hypotheses, except by recalling that they are intended as \\"stimulants.\\" They do inspire, to be sure.This book is recommendable to anyone looking to expand their Eleusinian horizons beyond the Homeric Hymn to Demeter. There are so many obscure and specialist references presented here that one cannot help but benefit. Those looking for clear, reliable answers will be frustrated, while those hungry for directions for contemplation will get their fill."},{"Title":"Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter","review":"This is an excellent book, favored especially by many women who find the mother-daughter archetype something that they want to explore. There are many excellent facts of great interest to those seeking to know the background of Demeter's Mysteries.The first edition of this book was in 1967. I think it holds up pretty well. The reviewer who calls himself \\"flygadfly\\" thereby identifying himself with the ancient philosopher Socrates, states that the information is outdated. To expect current values and philosophies to exist in a book that was published 37 years ago is an illogical expectation.I really love this book. It has an honored place in my home library.-Gem"},{"Title":"Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter","review":"Perhaps it is the translation into english keeping this a very fresh read on a beautiful and little understood subject. The heavy handed black & white version we are all familiar with is replaced with a genuinely approachable discussion. Reflecting the many slightly altered dieties in present day pantheist religions he jusxtaposes the various tidbits that have filtered through time into a beautiful kaleidoscopic inquiry. He uses multiple sources, art as well as writings. This enlarged scope of view enables many possibilities. The vitality of the religion its offerings and mystica are brought forward in the effort to flesh out the flowing energy that is worshiped as Hades here & Plutous there. Pluton the child offering the cornucopia from the earth goddess beneath to the earth goddess above and variation by example. Without the restrictions of a mono theist mindset more interesting possibilities are delicately explored and the natural fusions of this religion over many generations is given breathing room. Wonderfully written and full of appreciation for the hidden mystery it comes much closer to expressing the inter relationship of ourselves, nature & the work of faiths to clarify human life than is present in Fraser, White, Campbell & wikipedia. Agile astute mind, he grasps the needs religion fulfills and proceeds from there unhurriedly, carefully looking for clues across cultures, language, places, rites, herbs, plants, elements, pottery and chants or music. He doesn't dismiss vital details in favor of hard ideas.Recommended to pantheists & anthropology lovers as well as anyone interested in Greek myth."},{"Title":"Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter","review":"This book is a sincere attempt to piece together the secret of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Pouring over the Greek myths, history and the social institutions, Kerenyi tries to ferret out the truth behind the mystery. He works hard, and gets very close but in the end it is all conjecture. That said this was a marvelous book. It is clear the Kerenyi knows his Greek mythology and history, and his conclusions are logical enough to be possible. I have been obsessed about the secret of the Mysteries since I first learned about them and Kerenyi's book gets you as close as one can get to an extinct secret ancient religion."},{"Title":"Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter","review":"Ker&eacute;nyi's scholarship *might* include a touch of fantasy, but on the whole, it is well-researched, and he provided documentation for his claims through extensive footnotes.

Kerenyi, in all his works, offers a piece-meal, unsupported archaeologically, imaginative creation of what he WISHED Greek Religion could have been. Kerenyi seems to have had an image in his mind, and he assembles anything and everything from different time periods, locations, and rituals in order to &quot;prove&quot; his theories. A closer, archaeological reading would show a high percentage of his &quot;facts&quot; contradicting each other - how can you support Hellenistic mystery cults with evidence from non-Greek Minoan Crete? It'd be as if one made a connection between Southern Baptist Christianity and Native American religion, solely because both functioned in similar geographical locations. Just a warning! Kerenyi is really easy to become enchanted with, but not accurate."},{"Title":"Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter","review":"I was quite excited to see this book & read the comments. Princeton University Press doesn't publish much classics, and I had high hopes for this volume.

It really is despicable of Princeton to tarnish their reputation with their Bollingen imprint, and I feel like a sucker to have wasted my money on such a preposterously worthless book, and I wish that Amazon.com would put a warning label on the Bollingen imprints, so clearthinking people can be more careful when ordering.

His short novel Helena is set in the late Roman empire, long before those categories existed, at least as we know them. It is about the mother of Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, and her search for the True Cross in fourth century Palestine, after a life of imperial politics that took her from one end of the known world to the other. She was not active in politics, but born and married into it, being the daughter of a British Celtic chief (whom Waugh names Cole)and the wife of Chlorus, a Roman aristocrat and soldier who was the father of the future emperor. The first two-thirds of the book is a beautifully written fictional account of her life at the top, and we discover that after all there was an upper class with bohemian hangers-on not unlike Britain's in the last century. Waugh creates a completely convincing imperial court that is treacherous and sophisticated, and a very convincing saint who discovers her purpose in life in it. The supporting figures in the novel--a tutor; an architect; a humble, over-worked bishop; a pair of coniving witches--are among the best things in the book."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"This is a very different sort of historical fiction. Waugh does evoke the time and place of the fourth Century Roman Empire but he never leaves you to really imaginatively enter into that world. He's always at your side, nudging the careful reader in the ribs to share a laugh at the expense of self-important intellectuals or effete no-talent artists trying to pass off their lack of ability as refined aesthetic sensibility. Some laughs, he throws in just for the fun of it and because he can (look for the thinly veiled nursery rhyme allusion on page 32).There are a handful of passages that are worth the price of the book all by themselves: the account of Fausta's demise, the conversation between Constantine and the architect and artist working on his triumphal arch, and the prayer of Helena to the three Magi at the grotto in Bethlehem on the feast of Epiphany, to name just a few.This volume is highly recommended, though much different than Waugh's more traditional biography of Edmund Campion, which has its own sort of excellence."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"Evelyn Waugh is known for biting caustic satire and misogyny. He thinks nothing of killing small boys or tiny animals while scoring points against the bounders of society. His fiction contains more heartless, designing women then the back catalogs of ELO and Hall & Oates combined.\\"Helena\\" (1950) is one odd novel from such a man. Satiric quips come thick and fast, but there's a rare and deep sense of emotional investment, too. And the hero is the title character, a woman named Helena who finds herself the victim of a designing husband for a change but shakes off her disappointment in search of something true and eternal, a hunger that eventually leads her to Christianity and sainthood.Catholicism is the other thing Waugh is known for, and his trumping concern as far as \\"Helena\\" is concerned, a spiritual novel from the least spiritual of religiously-inclined writers. \\"The church isn't a cult for a few heroes,\\" Helena is told by Pope Sylvester, advising her on what becomes her quest, to uncover the fragments of the Cross of the Crucifixion and bring them to the European heart of the Empire. \\"It is the whole of fallen mankind redeemed.\\"While based on the real life of the mother of the first Roman emperor to reputedly embrace Christ, Waugh takes some liberties. Helena starts out here a British princess, horse-mad and lusty, who catches the eye of the Roman royal Constantius. Waugh's treatment of ancient customs isn't too far afield of how he serves up early 20th century London. When Constantius asks Helena's father for his daughter's hand, and mentions he has a chance of becoming emperor, the father isn't all that impressed.\\"Some of the emperors we've had lately, you know, have been nothing to make a song about,\\" Poppa replies. \\"It's one thing burning incense to them and quite another having them in the family.\\"Waugh employs this sort of anachronistic tension throughout his narrative, presenting Helena's contemporaries as social strivers not at all different from the people of Waugh's own day (and ours.) He also writes some of his most affecting prose this side of \\"Brideshead Revisited,\\" beautiful visions of nature, the ancient world, and a boy who comes home from fishing \\"to lay his dripping creel before his mother, proud as a dog with a rat.\\" Readers of Robert Graves' Claudius books will recognize a similar style to Waugh's depictions of court intrigue, romance, and life and death.Like another of Waugh's books, \\"Handful Of Dust,\\" this is slightly flawed in pace and tone but a riveting read throughout, very different from his other novels yet in tune with Waugh's overall sensibility. Waugh called \\"Helena\\" his most successful novel, a verdict few share; yet it certainly represents a worthwhile stretching of his talents and ably communicates the sense of grace and purpose he drew from his faith often lacking even from his more famous works."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"Normally, an Evelyn Waugh novel is funny from beginning until the dark end, which is typically still funny but often with some in-your-face bit of reality that bites._Helena_ is far from a comic (or dark comic) novel, yet it still has all of things that make a Waugh novel so good: the realistic dialogue, solid character development and detailed description that helps give the novel depth.It's more like _Brideshead Revisited_ because of its more serious, dramatic feel, but if you like Waugh, you'll like _Helena_ (especially if you hang in there for an awesome ending)."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"Helena is one of Evelyn Waugh's lesser known works, but it deserves to be more widely read. It is a fictional biography of St. Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine. She is supposed to have discovered the True Cross and identified the sites of Calvary, Jesus' Tomb, and other episodes in the life of Christ.Helena is a good example of Waugh's ability to write clearly and wittily and also of his deep Catholic faith. Most of Helena's life is clearly legendary, but nevertheless Waugh does an excellent job of bringing her to life and giving her a definite personality while demonstrating her (and his) deep religious devotion."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"Waugh tells us in his Preface that his story of the Empress Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great, is legend - and among the various legends he could draw on was the one prevalent in Britain, popularized by Geoffrey of Monmouth, that Helena was the daughter of an English kinglet, a vassal of Rome, whose court was at Colchester. (Other stories have her born in Asia Minor.) It is not a legend, however, that she was married for a time to the Roman general Constantius, and Constantine was their son. Constantius was politically ambitious, and eventually, in 293, became Caesar to Maximian, Diocletian's co-Emperor in the West. To achieve this position, he had divorced Helena in 289 and married Maximian's daughter. Helena and her son were sent to the court of Diocletian. In due course Constantius became Emperor, and on his death, his troops proclaimed Constantine as Emperor in 306. His rival and co-Emperor Maxentius was defeated and killed at a battle in 312, prior to which, so legend has it, Constantine had a dream to say he would conquer under the sign of the Cross. After his victory he issued an edict tolerating Christianity which had been savagely persecuted by Diocletian. In 324 he made Christianity the official religion of the Empire, but himself is believed to have been baptized only on his death-bed in 337. Helena, however, had been baptized at some unspecified earlier time. In 325 Constantine bestowed the title of Empress on his mother, and in the following year the old lady, now in her late seventies, went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and, again so a famous legend has it, miraculously discovered the True Cross, a part of which she brought back with her to Rome.Waugh builds his story around these part-legendary, part historical events. Most of the book reads easily, as one would expect of this great stylist. The dialogue often has colloquialisms of the 1950s. But the relationship between all the members of a very complicated family are hard to follow, let alone to remember: even though this is a novel, an appendix giving a family tree would have been welcome.The portrait of Constantine as Emperor is half farcical, half terrifying - a picture of a moody, paranoid and unpredictable dictator who has several of his close relatives murdered. The book was first published in 1950 - did Waugh have the parallels with Stalin in mind?Waugh gives to the young Helena a somewhat tomboyish but also an educated British girlhood. She married Constantius out of love, but is portrayed as accepting the waning of Constantius' initial affection, his secretiveness about his political activities, and then the divorce in a pretty matter-of-fact way: while Waugh lets himself go in expressive descriptions of the countryside and of the then shabby city of Rome, his emotional tone is cool. His portrayal of Helena as a young woman is much more vivid than that of the older one - until in the last two chapters, dealing with Helena's pilgrimage, the ironical tone of the rest of the novel dies away, and Waugh paints a touching picture of Helena's sincere devotion and of her spirituality. The legends surrounding the finding of the True Cross - including one Waugh has invented himself - are not mocked. Waugh was after all a devout convert to Roman Catholicism."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"This book is not exactly what one might expect from historical fiction. Most books of that genre spill much ink filling in extra details of important historical events. Waugh, however, has a different purpose: he would like the reader to view sainthood in a different light by seeing the path to sainthood that St. Helen trod. As such, he glances over some seemingly important details: he doesn't even try to recreate the events surrounding Helena's conversion to Christianity, and he introduces her desire to find the True Cross practically as an aside. I found Waugh's focus in this book a bit quixotic; most of the book is focused on Helena's pre-Christian life, and the chapters on her life after converting seem an afterthought.Yet reading this book is thoroughly enjoyable; Waugh's humor runs throughout the book. In fact, \\"Helena\\" is worth its price just for Fausta's speech to Helena after Helena arrives at Rome. It begins with a discussion of Pope Sylvester:\\"Sylvester? Oh yes, of course you'll have to meet him. It's only polite. And of course we all respect his office. But he's not a man of any personal distinction, I assure you. If he's ever declared a saint they ought to commemorate him on the last day of the year.\\"(For those not aware, St. Sylvester's feast day is celebrated on December 31st)Fausta's speech continues for some pages and is laugh out-loud funny at many points. These type of humorous interjections make this book, if nothing else, the funniest historical fiction you'll read. It will also make you think a bit more about what it means to be a saint; Waugh's contention is that the saint must do that \\"one thing\\" which God has called him or her to do - nothing more, nothing less. There are worse definitions of saints than this, to be sure."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"Waugh called this book \\"far the best book I have ever written or ever will write\\". I would amend that to 'far the best thing he ever tried to write.'Briefly, the book recreates the life of Helena, mother of the Emperor Constantine and credited with finding the cross of Christ hidden at Jerusalem after the crucifixion.The book's style oscillates between a fictional historical novel and a traditional Life of a Saint. The first three-quarters documents Helena's life, from her hypothetical youth as a Briton chieftain's daughter, through her marriage to Constantius Chlorus, a high-ranking Roman officer on a secret visit to Britain, her raising of Constantine, their son, to her semi-recluse life in Illyria and Treves, until Constantine's accession to the throne and his seizure of Rome. The mood of this section is one of cynical futility: Helena, despite hobnobbing with the highest people in the empire, really has no reason to live except tend her villa and while away the time.In the last quarter of the book the real story starts. Constantine defeats and kills his rival Maxentius and takes Rome, and Helena for the first time in her life visits the city - to find a hotbed of intrigue with her son at the epicentre. Despite having become a Christian in the interim, Helena does not appear that much affected by Constantine's behaviour, not even by his killing of his son Crispus and his wife Fausta. She seems to shake a weary head and then think up something new to do - go to Jerusalem and find the cross of Christ.Then, according to Waugh, she becomes a saint, living in spartan simplicity at a convent in Jerusalem, waiting at table, praying for hours on end, fasting. Waugh does not attempt to delineate the process by which she was tranformed from world-weary indifference to fervent sainthood. Just one day she is a cynic, the next a saint. My impression, on reading this section, is that Waugh does not understand the psychological and spiritual reality of sainthood - what makes an individual a saint within him or herself, as oppose to how it might appear to observers.Waugh never quite shakes off the satirical cynicism his other books are noted for, with its sense of the futility of human endeavour. At times his Catholic component rises to the surface: 'But as the news [of the Edict of Milan granting peace to the Church] spread everywhere in Christendom, from every altar a great wind of prayer gathered and mounted, lifted the whole squat smokey dome of the Ancient World, swept it off and up like the thatch of a stable, and threw open the calm and brilliant prospect of measureless space.' But it never really permeates the novel, whereas the intrigue, ruthlessness and careless neglect of men of power, does. Waugh is more in his element describing what is wrong with the world rather than what is right with it.Constantine is portrayed as a monster of egotism, suborning the Church and its treasures to his own glory (including making one of the crucifixion nails into a bit for his horse). His faults are as Waugh describes them, but there was an undercurrent of sincerity under Constantine's political calculation that grew stronger as the years passed. I don't believe everything this emperor did was done purely for political advancement and self-glorification. He could not give to God what he knew was required of him, but he spared no effort in giving everything else. He was a complex man, made more so by his ambiguous position as pagan Pontifex Maximus and supporter of Christianity. For Waugh he is just another Nero.As a final note, I think Waugh is offsides in his treatment of Helena's husband, Constantius Chlorus. In his foreward, Waugh states, \\"I have given Constantius Chlorus a mistress, although he was reputed to be unusually chaste.\\" This fictional mistress is maintained by Constantius for several years, then murdered by him. Why create that slur?The book is well-written and readable, but in my opinion misses the mark. A pity as there is so much fictional potential in Helena's story."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"\\"Helena\\" is not a typical historical novel--it is too self-conscious in its purpose, and Waugh fills the dialogue with Britishisms (\\"What a lark!\\" and \\"dearest Mummy\\"). It does, however, contain a subtle and emotional portrayal of how Helena, mother of Constantine, finds Christianity and the true cross. This is not a novel that will make you feel as if you are experiencing the time period, but it may speak to your emotions, despite its rather contrived form."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"Prostitute, stable-hand, or British princess? The legends swirl around Helena, wife or mistress of Constantius Chlorus (\\"The Green\\"), a Roman officer who is eventually created co-Emperor. In this delicate, hilarious fantasy Waugh takes the advice of his friend and fellow convert to Catholicism, Ronald Knox; he goes \\"up the nursery stairs\\" to find Helena in rhymes of Old King Coel and tales of princesses in towers. Along the way he finds an ardent, imaginative, and entirely lovable girl who marries the dour and priggish Constantius, and is discarded by his ambitious divorce and re-marriage to become co-Emperor. In middle-age she sees her son Constantine become Emperor, extremely eccentric \\"Christian,\\" and murderous tyrant. She retains her passion for life, and falls in love with the Church newly emerged from persecution. Waugh repeatedly refers to Heinrich Schliemann's similar attitude towards Homer and the legends of Troy. Stubbornly as any child, she searches for the solid objects of Christianity: A real, cheaply-constructed wooden cross; a smelly cave used as a stable in Bethlehem; stairs from a Roman governor's residence. Nothing is legendary or metaphorical to Helena, who identifies with the Magi, those royal astrologers journeying so far, compounding with the infanticidal Herod, presenting their curious gifts, and fading into legend. Her souvenirs are in the crypt of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme in Rome, once the household chapel of the palace her son gave to her, wistful as a child's toys and as moving."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"This is an oddity for Waugh -- but well worth reading.I was impressed by his historical research to begin with. The author admits where he filled gaps in the known facts with his own inventions. It has all the mastery of writing that Waugh was known for and is full of wit but not the biting sarcastic wit of much of Waugh. Altogether it's a heartfelt and gripping read."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"Perhaps a little to idealized about Helena, but less so than the L.O.S. Waugh's book feels like how he imagines Helena to have been, and you'll feel it too."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"While he considered it to be one of the most important books he ever wrote, Evelyn Waugh's \\"Helena\\" is not one of his stronger outings. Originally published in 1950, Waugh makes no bones about his Catholic faith. His take on Helena, the Roman noblewoman who was Constantine's mother and the reputed founder of the True Cross. There are moments, especially in the last fifth of the book, when Waugh writes some of the most moving and insightful passages he ever crafted on religion. But Waugh undermines his book by making Helena talk like an English girl of the twentieth century and some strange attempts at humor (including a tortured routine on King Coel and bringing in the \\"Old King Cole\\" nursery rhyme). Waugh's not so subtle comparisons between the Roman Empire at the end of the third century and England after the war fall flat. To have Helena talk like one of the girls in earlier Waugh masterpieces like \\"Vile Bodies\\" seems a little forced and readers might tune out the more serious parts of the book. Waugh is, as always, a master of prose which redeems the book a great deal. While a solid book, \\"Helena\\" does not rank as one of Waugh's major works and readers unfamiliar with him should look at other books first."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"An unsettling view of the period and characters. Helena was Constantine's mother. Her story as told by Waugh was sad, mostly unfulfilled, with her true worth never revealed until her old age.Full of different takes on a well known subject."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"This is really two books. The first is a well-written, engaging historical novel that provides a context to the life of Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine I. That book is interesting, conveying Waugh's trademark wit as well as flowing prose. I really liked THAT book quite a bit.As time goes on, Helena is converted to Christianity and then goes off on a search for the true cross. That's the second book, and it is a hagiography of Helena that may appeal to Catholics. I did not read this book for a strictly religious reason, and thus was disappointed in how Waugh abandoned his former prose in favor of stilted, formulaic dogma. This edition does come equipped to convey Waugh's state of mind and compelling interest in writing this book, which helps to provide a context for the effort.Waugh calls this is favorite work, and the edition documents that this was the only book that Waugh felt comfortable reading aloud. Considering the body of work he assembled, I cannot agree with his assessment. I also can't recommend the book, though I will say if one is Catholic with an interest in the lives of the saints, this would be an interesting read. For an average Waugh aficionado, this is a good start with an uncharacteristically clumsy ending."},{"Title":"Helena (Loyola Classics)","review":"\\"Constantius [Caesar of the West] ruled sedately in Gaul. Constantine [his son by Helena] followed the fortunes of Galerius [Caesar of the East] and the Eastern army. Beastly Maximian [Emperor of the West] bullied the Italians and Africans. The work of the empire prospered, frontiers everywhere restored and extended, treasure accumulated, but out of sight on the shores of the Propontis [where the emperor Diocletian ruled], where the vested chamberlains stood like dummies, motionless as the stuffed thing that had hung in the Persian court [the emperor Valerian, whom they had captured and killed and displayed stuffed], and the eunuchs scuttled like pismires when a soldier passed them; in the inmost cell of the fetid termitary of power, Diocletian was consumed by huge boredom and sickly [he] turned toward [the thought of] his childhood's home.\\"--p. 96.This paragraph is a sample of the best of Waugh's artistry in \\"Helena,\\" and a fair sample of the momentary difficulties the reader will perhaps encounter. The characters I name as a convenience will be familiar to the reader. Where I have added emphasis you will note the strong counter-indications undermining the notion that the empire is doing very well. The eunuchs scuttle like noisome ants; Diocletian, central to the vast power of the empire, is like a termite in a cell of termites. Far from glorying in his successful struggle to power, and enjoying it, he finds himself powerless over his own boredom. From this perspective he can only look back to his childhood, enthralled by the empty reality of the lifelong ambition and the excitements which drove him, when realized.The story of Helena is not biography. It was in large part Evelyn Waugh's to invent. Because of this I don't think it represents his usual very high level of accomplishment. The story of her finding true cross follows a version of the myth. I don't mean that it is untrue, but that it is by no means true fact it in all of its details.Helena (Loyola Classics)"},{"Title":"Platz der Leibstandarte: A Photo Study of the SS-Panzer-Grenadier-Division \\"Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler\\" and the Battle for Kharkov January-March 1943","review":"As the title of the book says, it is a photo study of the Waffen-SS divisions that fought in the battle for Kharkov. One word to describe the book would be awesome. The collection of photos is truly amazing and one can tell that each photo was delicately and faithfully reproduced from the original prints or contact sheets. Many of the photos have never been published previously. The types of photos range from combat, staged shots, rest, award ceremonies, and the behind the scenes type activities. After looking at the pictures, one will be able to get some sort of idea of what it was like to fight in the harsh Russian winter. All of the photos were taken by 'Kriegsberichters' or war journalists who were right with all the soldiers in the thick of the fighting. Not only are the photos excellent for study, but also as reference for reenactors and the like. Other features in the book include the following. An introduction that explains where the photos came from and some technical data about the photography employed. A nice synopsis of the battle of Kharkov to give you an idea of the overall picture. Superb captions for each photo written by George Nipe. Lastly there are eight short biographies of some of the more famous LAH commanders, like Panzermeyer and Jochen Peiper, with impressive color portraits painted by Marco Ortelli.

Even rarer still are pictures that capture in sequence the entire event. Such is the case with this volume. From start to finish the reader is presented with a sequence of photographs that literally document aspects of the complete campaign for Kharkov in the winter of 1943.The pictures are also notable for depictions of many well-known and other lesser known figures of the Leibstandarte, Das Reich, and Totenkopf divisions. Of particular interest are those photos showing a young Jochen Peiper in action. This photographic volume also has a remarkable series of photos showing the fate of a Soviet horse drawn column as it is overtaken by Peiper's Kampfgruppe. Not a happy ending to be certain, but a very real glimpse into the realities of combat on the Eastern Front. In fact, one must wonder how similar the context of the events that would occur at Malmedy over a year later, when an American column would be overtaken by another of Peiper's Kampfgruppes. Certainly, the pictures in this book show a no quarter given attitude for the advancing German kampfgruppe.For the generalist, this volume will be an interesting look at German formations in action.

No one should live out their miserable little lives without being able to say, &quot;I've read Catch-22.&quot; This is a true literary masterpiece, a classic through and through, a book so superior I should be ashamed to even try critiquing it. Joseph Heller shows himself a true master of the English language in this spellbinding satire, his look at the nonsense surrounding the logic of the American military system. Catch-22 is brought to life by a remarkably diverse cast of characters, all of them interwoven into a plot that unfolds and comes together with relentless perfection. Heller lets us see not only through the eyes of his main character, the paranoid bombardier Yossarian, but gives us a glimpse inside dozens of other vivid personalities, plunging us into their thoughts and dreams and hopes and fears and desires. Their stories, told with such a sarcastic and surreal edge, go far beyond the bounds of outrageousness, yet the unarguable truth they represent holds the potency of a maxim. Catch-22 is guaranteed to grip you, entertain you, and astound you. Its story is certainly complex, but so profound as to leave you recalling each and every detail as an individual climax. This book never slows down, never settles into boring normality, and is never to be forgotten by me, nor by a lot of other people -- I'm sure -- who have had the gift of opportunity to be exposed to such magnificent literature."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Thirty years ago this summer after my freshman year of college I started to read Catch 22. Everyone was reading Catch 22. I don't really recall why, but I never finished it. This summer I picked up the book on tape because my high-school daughter was assigned to read it. I'll finish it this time, but now I know why I left the book unfinished that summer. Reading it is turning into a chore.I question whether this book holds up as a classic. True, there are plenty of moments of biting satire and superb black comedy. and yes, the phrase Catch 22 did enter the language and that concept is brilliant. But the book is 400 pages of the basically the same thing over and over. There is virtually no characterization -- Heller is incapable of it -- and not much of a plot either. One cannot keep the characters straight; they all blend together. Yes, it is about war, but Heller/Yossarian really comes across as a misanthrope -- everyone in his world is weird and worthless. I don't want to spend more time with any of them, but I've got two-thirds of a book to go. Voltaire did something quite similar to Catch 22 in Candide, but he kept his story to about 100 pages. Heller probably should have done the same."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I decided to fill in the gaps of my knowledge of classic American literature--I didn't grow up in the US, so I hadn't read most of the books US students would have read in school. I was scratching my head over this book after several chapters and gave up on it after several more. It seemed to me that at the time it was written, the book may have been a powerful anti-war statement and perhaps an example of a writing style that hadn't been seen before, but I found it very dated, lacking context, and little more than a sequence of caricature vignettes and slapstick devices. Maybe I failed to appreciate it because I'm not American, though I have a decent knowledge of US history and I've been living in the US for more than a decade."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I found Hellers work abysmal. I read it (and bought it) because I'd never read it, and heard from others that it's worth it. They lied.

It's kind of tough to keep all the characters straight too, but by the end of the book you will be able to.The book is very illogical and absurd, which is one of the things that makes it so enjoyable, though some readers may find it trying when characters say or do things that they think make no sense.

It demonstrates the absurdity of war and bureaucracy in a very humorous manner. What I find to be the most appealing part of the book is the way in which the &quot;catch 22&quot; is re-enforced throughout the novel and you realize the concept is applicable not only in the militarty but also in the govermnent, at work, and even at home. You grow to know and love the characters and thier little quirks, and are sad to see them go.

A must read for every good reader."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I have recently gone on a WWII frenzy. NOt long ago I learned that my grandfather was a medic in many of the most important battles, including the Normandy invasion and landing. I began to read this book mostly because so many references had been made to it in my college literature classes. As a bonus, as I reached the half-way point of the book, the movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; was released, and for the first time the world saw an unscensored re-creation of WWII... For those of us who weren't there, the world came alive. Returning to the book, I could not stop reading because now I had actually seen what terror these men were facing each day. This is a must read for any fan of literature. Naturally some will hate it because of it's comic sense of war, but the utter reality is not gone from this book. What more could the majority of us want if we felt that thousands were trying to kill us... deep inside most of us would become Yossarians, and make any ! possible plea to return home, no matter how hopeless it may seem."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"What this book lacks in artistry it more than makes up for in energy, and in those great moments of Lewis Carroll logic. Any book that exposes the moral bankruptcy that is warfare in our time as beautifully as this one does deserves classic status. But I sure wish I could throw out all those redundant adverbs Heller uses to describe how his characters talk, he said helpfully."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller writes Catch-22 to show how abusrd and pointless the idea of war is. Yossarian is an American bomber in Europe during WWII. Being sane and intelligent Yossarian tries to get out of his duty to stay in the war as a bomber. He tries to use the idea that he is insane and get a letter from the doctor to prevent him from flying. The doctor says if you are insane, then they have to ground you and anyone who is flying in the war and doesn't try to get out is insane, but the minute you want to stop flying or get out of the war, you are sane so you have to continue to fly.The characters in this book also portray how in a war you have some people that are only looking out for themselves and want to make a profit. One character in particular who sticks out is named Milo Minderbinder. Milo will do anything in order to make a profit. And, &quot;with Minderbinder enterprises everyone owns a share.&quot; But when someone wants to claim that share they get an interesting surprise. Overall Catch-22 is an amazing book and is a must read in order to know where the phrase Catch-22 comes from."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"..is for a pleasure of reading. And make sure that you enjoy it since it's the whole and only point of the book, if there is any point at all.J. Heller was a kind of writer who would produce something that his readers could enjoy from the bottom of their hearts.Many reviewers here and elsewhere tried so hard and too hard to make a serious solid stuff out of this book (i.e. trying to make it a masterpiece of twist philosophy..bla..bla...bla) which is actually just fine as long as they can still enjoy it.This is a lovely book. Please love it. You can criticize it anyway you like but please do not despise it.And for those people who gave and will give this book less than 4 stars just because it couldn't satisfy their philosophical-twisted minds. All I can say is that they remind me of &quot;Clevinger&quot; who knew everything about literature exept how to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"After reading the book Catch-22 I have a few comments and questions. First, I loved the book. The idea of turning a war into a comedy makes an interesting story. The complexity of Yossarian and other characters really draws the reader into the book. I would like to know if you know if there is any real truth to the story. I am interested in finding out if Joseph Heller, the author, experienced these events as a basis for his story. If you have any answers or have any e-mail addresses of people who may, please respond. Thank you."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I found myself laughing more then I thought I would with this book. Buy it becuase you want to see humor in a crazy situation."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is the story of a fictional bomber squadron on the Italian island of Pianosa. The characters are many and diverse, and their problems even moreso. But wow - this is quite unlike any other novel in the history of American literature. We sympathize with only a few characters, mainly Yossarian and the chaplain, the seemingly only sane characters in the entire novel. Everyone else - all of the generals, majors, colonels, captains, pilots, privates, PFCs, etc. - they are all just a little bit off their rocker, and it can make for such an interesting reading experience. We are being shown the true madness of war - the concept of \\"patriotism\\" and all armed conflict is challenged, because, as Yossarian says, it matters not what side they're on, because both sides want you dead.Sometimes the dialogue is absolutely hilarious when two of these \\"insane\\" characters get together for a conversation. And other times the narration makes you double over and wretch in disgust, (e.g. Yossarian tending to Snowden's wounds and that eventual outcome - if you've read you know to what I am referring). Now I wasn't alive when this was originally published, but I can only imagine the praise that it would have garnered. Nothing has ever so perfectly captured the madness and irrationality of war. And Catch-22, now a part of our national lexicon, was the pretense (in this novel) used by our \\"insane\\" characters to argue their point and keep the men fighting. If you haven't read \\"Catch-22\\", this may be making no sense. I leave you with only an example, because it almost defies explanation. Yossarian is a bombardier who doesn't want to fly more missions (the number to get you a ticket home is continually being raised). Learning of a proposed dangerous run to Bologna, he sneakes into the map room and moves the pins on the map. The next day commanding officers see the map, think that they've taken Bologna already, and cancel the mission.You'll constantly be furrowing your brow, but in the end, as I did, you'll understand what Heller's been saying all along. And you won't ever look at war in the same way."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I credit this book with my newfound enjoyment in reading. I found that although the book has some deeper meaning about the affects of war on the human psyche, for the most part it was tremendously funny. The best relation I can give is that normally when you watch a movie or show that you find funny, you usually don't laugh at loud the entire show, however you still find the jokes funny. This book made me laugh out loud numerous times. This is a perfect book and a must read for people who want a step back from meaningful, soul searching books and to find a novel that is simply entertaining to read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"i read this book after having it recommended to me several times and it is well worth reading. a lot of it is simply infuriating, full of backflashes, repetitive jokes and crazy word play. but all of that doesn't matter because the story and the great characters overcome these downfalls every step of the way. this isn't so much a book about war, more an insight into the lives of the people involuntarily involved in it. yossarian, the main character, believes that everyone is crazy and everyone in turn believes that he is the crazy one. yossarian would rather die than be killed and struggles everyday to avoid being involved in this war that others seem to revel in. it's beautiful and sad and i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 is definetly one of the greatest war novels ever written. It manages to be hilarious, ironic, violent, gruesome, sad and prophetic throughout the enitire 463 pages, sometimes throughout one chapter. The book isnt really about war, its more about a group of insane poeple in a bomber sqaudron and one character who is the sane one...or so it seems. It is also about how much danger there is in our everyday lives and all the truths we try to ignore. Soem may not like the ending, but it reall is perfect. Buy it"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"What can you say about a book that has had so much influence? It's clearly deservedly classic. But it isn't a real pleasure to read, at least not for me. The prose is so dense that you have to read every word. You can never predict where a sentence or a paragraph is going. Heller makes sudden, neck-snapping changes from the cutely ridiculous (like the squadron commander refusing to see people in his office when he's there) to really heartbreaking. The genius of the book is not in the humor, which to me at least started to get old after a while--the genius is in his assault on the bureaucratic mind and the way he captures the feeling of men trapped in the inhuman machinery of war. It isn't the most enjoyable thing in the world to read, but it should be read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22's basic purpose is to show the chaos and stupidity of war. It also shows that wars aren't fought only against the enemy, but against ourselves. They are fought on the bases against clashing egos and people with no sense and those with too much sense. A person who would enjoy this book doesn't have to be just a fan of war novels. A book like this can appeal to a vast number of persons because it is so fun to read. It can also appeal to those who like the unusual and thought provoking.Yossarian is a bombardier who seems to be the wrong person in the wrong squadron. When he censors letters, he cuts about everything out and signs the aliases \`Irving Washington' or \`Washington Irving'. When he presented with a medal, he marches down the ramp naked. But it seems every time Yossarian is close to completing his tour of duty, the mission number is raised by five. While many crews in other squads are going home at 50 missions, Yossarian's group is at 80 and counting. So Yossarian decides enough is enough and refuse to fly more missions. This creates quite a stir between him and his superiors. This creates chaos in the squadron with the threat others will soon refuse to fly. Yossarian offered a deal: He can return back to the states and no one would have known about this or, due to insubordination, desertion, cowardice in the face of the enemy and several other charges, he will be court-martialed. We see various colorful characters throughout the book, including General Dreedle, Colonel Korn, Colonel Cathcart, Lieutenant Scheisskopf, Nately, Hungry Joe, Major ------ de Coverley, Nately's whore kid sister and Major Major, among many others. Not many of these characters have importance to the text. However, some of them make the book more fun to read and others add to the backdrop.\\"The enemy,\\" retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, \\"is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.\\"This quote (Which also appears in the amzon.com review above) is important in that it shows the two sides of which war is fought. For example, the number of missions is continually raised by the squadron's commanding officers, thus increasing the squadron's chances of getting killed. The quote also shows the meaningless of war. Why should you care about who wins if you are dead? Or who is really the enemy in war?I wasn't sure as to what style Heller used. The book is not organized confusingly, but its tone changes throughout. We are presented with thrills, drama, horror and humor. Perhaps this is meant to show how well mixed our own lives are It can be called an anti-war novel, but unlike Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, Catch-22 is a satire. There are some audiences that may not like Catch-22. Like I said, it has varying changes of attitude plus has somewhat explicit content concerning sex and language. Also, the novel has rather large cast of people and not all of them have importance to the story line. Nevertheless, except for romance and possibly mystery, Catch-22 has enough elements to appeal to a wide audience.I have tried to review Catch-22, but I think that no one review can fully comprehend Heller's work. I'm sure that there is some more depth in the novel than I have touched on in this analysis. The novel has to be read and read again and again before it is fully understood. But this is what good novels should do. Catch-22 I liked because I like war novels and because it leaves much to think about. If there is something to dislike about it, it seems to me that the book's end leaves an open gap, possibly for a sequel that never came. Also, at over 400 pages, this is a very long read and takes some getting into. But once you do, the book doesn't stop and delivers in whole. Thus, I recommend Catch-22 (And would give it ten stars if possible) for its anti-war message, its themes about humanity and for the fact it's just so fun."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"If you like Seinfeld and the Movie Pulp-Fiction you will love the jumbled plot and crazy characters of this book. Highly recommended, I've read the book several times and it still amuses me!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22- saddening, thought provoking, hope inspiring, and really rather good. no, not everyone dies, even though it starts to appear that way. i dont usually care for war related things that often, but this was worth reading. It takes a humorous and cynical approach the pointlessness of trying to escape war and the headaches it can cause. Catch-22 is the ultimate devil in this book and it consistantly pops up. The story follows one man and his struggles to survive in an insane and hopeless world. Add in a bunch of pilots begging to get home, a doctor who is technically dead, and a mess seargent who uses logic that surpasses everyone else's minds, and you have one motley crew. A book of laughs, tears, puzzlement, and thinking, Catch-22 is a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When I first read the title of this book, it brought to mind all the wonderful comments I had heard about it. I knew I had to see what all the fuss was about. I was a bit intrigued after the first chapter, but I wasn't quite sure it was worth all the hype. As the book went on, I began to dislike it more and more, loving it all the same. It drove me nuts with every turn of a page. I was immediately thrown off by the absurd conversations depicted. I didn't understand how you could only go see someone in their office when they weren't there. But, I quickly warmed up to the idea that the book was just not going to make sense. The whole concept behind Catch-22 is that there is no logic; you have to find a way to use the illogical ways of the system to your advantage. Though I complained throughout most of my reading, I can say that I definitely enjoyed the book. It's one of those that will mess with your head; you just can't let it get to you. However, if you are planning on reading it, I would make one suggestion: make a list of characters and short descriptions as you read, or print a list from the internet. There are about 38 characters, not including some minor ones. If you do not find some way to keep them straight, you will find yourself flipping back pages all the time to remember who someone is."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"...I had heard the term \\"catch - 22\\" for years, and I knew there was a book of the same name. That's all I knew. Then, one afternoon while listening to National Public Radio, probably NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Gross, or Radio Times, I heard one of the guests describing Joseph Heller's Catch - 22 as an exceptionally great American novel. I was almost finished with an Anthony Robbins self-help book when I heard the NPR interview, so I walked to the prison library to check it out. Heller's Catch - 22, a Voltaire-like satire of the military's rigidity had me laughing from page one.Heller uses a dry wit to poke fun at the obsequious, phony interactions between military personnel. As Voltaire's Candid brought to surface the hypocrisy that comes with institutional thought patterns in general, and organized religion in particular, Heller makes readers laugh by bringing his protagonist into contact with his superiors, his equals, his subordinates, and civilians. As a federal prisoner, I live in the midst of the same culture Heller describes. Catch - 22 reminds readers that institutions and the insular culture they propagate cause many of the personnel who work for institutions to forget that we're all human beings and not part of a bureaucratic machine.Heller uses each chapter in Catch - 22 to dramatize another ludicrous episode of military life. We laugh while reading how individuals become blinded by their positions and the power that comes with rank. In several chapters we follow one ingenious military man as he exploits the greed of human nature to build a massive military-sanctioned black market enterprise, the syndicate, in which \\"everyone has a share\\"; enabling them to profit through layered global transactions that frequently deal with war-time enemies. In other chapters Heller entertains us by exposing the insecurities and pettiness of high-ranking officers; it's funny to see those whom the officers belittled and stepped on earlier become direct superiors later in the novel.Heller's Catch - 22 is so powerful that he book's title became a dictionary work defining paradox. It not only made me laugh, but also inspires me as a writer. One day I hope to emulate Heller and Voltaire by writing a satire in the same vein, exposing the absurdity and waste of the criminal justice system in general, and prisons in particular."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The book Catch 22 by Joseph Heller is not like any other book that I have read. Usually when I sit down to read a book and find it hard to stay with I give it up. This book is like that. In the first hundred pages you start off in an Italian Hospital and then you are out in the war and back in the hospital. This book does a lot of jumping around and is hard to get started. I found that after the hundred pages there is a lot of humor and it becomes an enjoyable book.Another reason to like this book is because of the main character Yossarian. He makes this book more enjoyable to read because of how humorous he is. At the end of the book the army tells him that he is free to go if he talks good about what is happening, Since Yossarian doesn't believe in what is happening he runs off and frees himself. He does this because he knows that if others go to war they can die and he doesn't want that to happen.Catch 22 teaches the reader to watch out for higher-ranking people trying to pull a fast one by trapping them in a no win situation."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 is a book about a great American bomb squadron during World War II. The book is about what it is like to be an American pilot in another country during the war. Yossarian, who is the main character of the book, is basically a very crazy person just because of all the experiences he has had with war. He has seen so many of his friend die that he does not want to fly on any other missions because he thinks that he will die. He is very nervous as to what will happen in the future, so he basically goes into the hospital so he does not have to go on any other missions. One of the main problems is that the number of required missions keeps getting raised, which means for him that he will be stuck there until he gets them done, but he does not want to go on another mission and refuses.During the book, Yossarian comes up with many plans to help him get out of the war and to get back home. All of the plans that he makes up, always get destroyed because of catch 22. Catch 22 is a kind of statement or rule that the men in the war have come up with for certain circumstances they are put under. Every time he tries to get out of the war, there is always someone or something that is stopping him, and that is the catch. Eventually toward the end of the book, some of the higher ranked men ask him to fly the less dangerous missions, and they will have other men fly the dangerous ones in his place. He still disagrees with this because he does not want the men to be put in a spot where they see the same that he has seen. This is Yossarians main problem in the book. He wants to save all of the men in the war from dying or from seeing the horrible sights of the war that he has seen. This would mean that in order for Yossarian to save the men is for him to fly the dangerous missions. Every time he flies the missions, he is getting more insane because he is putting himself in the places that the other men would die in. This for him is self sacrifice, and that is what is making him so insane throughout the book.During the book, Joseph Heller, the author, does a great job in explaining the circumstances and events that happen in war. He does a very great job in describing all of the characters and how they all feel. He also relates all of the feelings of the characters, to the real life feelings that people would have while in war. The main theme of the story is that Yossarian has to sacrifice himself in order to save the other men in the war. This is the problem, because it makes him more insane throughout the book, but in order for him to save the men, he is forced to choose one of the two things that are put in front of him, and that is the catch. Throughout the book overall, Yossarian has himself caught between two things that are both bad for him. So overall, the theme of this book gives a good idea as to what can happen to a man that is put in the horrible consequences of war. I think that the overall book is very well written, because the author can make the reader feel sad about the war one minute, and happy about it the next, and that is what is so great about the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is the story of a bombardier named Yossarian, who is a frenzied officer in the air force who believes that thousands of people he hasn't even met are trying to kill him, which is somewhat true, but they are really trying to kill everyone. His superiors have no compassion, and like other people of great power believe that Yossarian and other officers are there to serve them. Everyone thinks Yossarian is crazy but the only thing he is crazy about is staying alive. Whatever he does he cannot seem to escape the tragedy of catch-22. This gut-wrenching novel, which attacks the cracks in the dehumanizing military service of WW II, reminds us once again of all that we have taken for granted in our world and should not. This long novel took me awhile to finish but it was worth the effort. Every teenager should read this and find the deep meaning of catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller's novel \\"Catch-22\\" takes place during war. American twentieth century literature that shares with its readers the truthful anecdotes of people's lives in the war. I think that was the best part of the book was the humor and irony. The book brought life in a time of death and war. Even in the seriousness of war, this book manages to poke fun at the craziness of people's lives. It showed how the people that we consider great war heroes are not always as they seem.Here are these great war heroes doing various missions, trying to claim insanity so that they do not have to fly. If it was not for the idea of catch-22, they would all have been landed. Not to mention how many times Yossarian lied he was sick to go back into the hospital. Then there is the great leader Cathcart who freely volunteers his men for missions all the time. There is also the fact that the war heroes of this book are so flawed in their own character. Or when we think of war heroes, we do not think of the trauma people go through in war. Yossarian did not wear his clothes for the longest time bcause he could not handle the blood that was shed on his friends clothes that died during flihgt.Another thing that stood out was the format of the book. Every chapter seemed to have a new character with a new and exciting story. \\"Catch-22\\" really jumped around a lot. Even though it could be a little bit confusing at times, the book still managed to make sense and get its point across It was nice to read to the end and see how everything had come together. Joseph Heller really managed to make every section of the book connect and smooth over in the end."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"A person's enjoyment of &quot;Catch 22&quot; might depend on their current views of the war. Regardless of what those feelings may be, they will most likely be strengthened after reading this book. It is sometimes considered an anti-war book, but anyone who disagrees with that would probably consider it honest and comical. The main character Yossarian is not fond of war. He learns early on that the real &quot;catch&quot; is that a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to participate in the missions, not if he requests to leave. Anyone who is smart enough to request to go home proves their sanity. Yossarian spends the entire novel trying to think of ways to be relieved of his duties. He just barely escapes a couple of opportunities to be sent home, which only adds to the several elements of humor, satire and irony.I read &quot;Catch 22&quot; for a high school assignment, expecting it to be another serious and dramatic book similar to the majority of the works I have read throughout high school. It is basically the opposite. I wish it had be required reading because it introduces elements of humor and irony that many students have not been introduced to in works of literary merit. It evokes many questions, sometimes deep and philosophical, sometimes trivial, of the true meanings of life and war. I would've loved to have many class discussions about this book because each student would have different views and opinions to share.While I don't consider it the best book ever, it certainly is enjoyable. Although elements of war really don't interest me, probably due to current events, I was entertained by the humor, irony and sarcasm, which helped to make many of the character, especially Yossarian, extremely relatable."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"For me, there is something a bit too unlinear about this novel: it seems a compilation of character sketches interpersed with a general &quot;feel&quot; for the military at the time. The pros are: character sketches detailed and funny; and an occasional paragraph of great comedic brilliance, which are SO wonderful that one keeps reading hopeful for the next one. The general anti-military feel for the novel was probably more attuned to the times in which it was written, we having seen in our times how necessary it is to have a military, and the noble sacrifices of military people. On the con side: the dialogue is unlikely in many places; the names of the characters very unlikely (as though pulled out of the too-creative hat); and a style that skims along a little breathlessly, as though punctuation amounted to grammatical error rather - what it really is - the finest point of style. And yet on the whole it is that wonderful, cynical American sense of humor that pulls it all off, just as it does for other American novels, such as Iacovelli's Lily Snow, Cheever's Falconer, and Henry Miller's naughty and otherwise sterile novels."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"i don't even know where to start--just thinking of this novel brings a loony smile on my face. i've read this a couple of years ago while i was on fieldwork, and i remember being on the receiving end of worried and even stupefied stares from my friends whenever i had this book on my hands--there were times (a lot of times, mind) when i'd just laugh outright as i read thru the exploits of yossarian, major major (and then more majors), milo minderbender, nately, and other illustrious (or not) characters. their eccentricities are often amusing, beffudling, heartwrenching, and even enlightening.but besides the humor, there are a lot of issues in the story. people will be given a glimpse as to how it's like for soldiers to be in the thick of war, how they are slowly, subtly changed from the inside-out. heller has masterfully encapsulated the dynamics between and among ranks of soldiers, and even those people outside their outfit that they come in contact with, and what influences they have wrought against one another. morbidly fascinating, excruciatingly merciless, and awkwardly honest, catch-22 deserves to be in everyone's literature..."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"If you were a MASH fan you will clearly see this novel as wellspring.The humor is Marxian ( Groucho not Karl ) and you will see that there is nothing new. I am 150 or so pages in and among the chestnuts tackled so far are military tours of duty, farm subsidies, unscrupulous doctors, mindless bureaucracy and Texans.A particular sentence made me burst out laughing which is uncommon for me when reading, especially bearing in mind that I was 17 hours into a 20 hour journey from the UK back to the US.This is a great piece of writing and while I can understand its not appealing to everybody, Heller is a great artist and thinker."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"A group of my friends went to Stockton State College to see a theater presentation of Catch-22. We all decided to reread the novel;all of us had read the book in high school english.The times have changed. There is a very pro military culture in the United States today. I think Heller's satire is probably closer to the truth about the efficiency of the military. The people who 'liberated' Iraq will be postal workers in about ten years. And not very good ones either.There are good wars that must be fought, one must concede. Most of the time,however, it is just male ego and ambition run amok. You might say, what if everyone felt that way?Then I'd be a damned fool to feel otherwise."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This novel is a brilliant commentary on the absurdity of war, the stupidity of bureaucracy, and the nature of man's existence. Its serious message is told in a comic style, and the chronology ebbs and flows throughout. It is a long novel, but well worth reading through."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Have you ever heard of the phrase \\"Catch-22?\\" This phrase originally came from Joseph Heller's amazingly hilarious novel, Catch-22.Catch-22 is one of the greatest books I've ever read. The protagonist of this tale is Yossarian, a daring bombardier stationed in the Mediterranean during WWII. He is struggling to complete his required missions to finish his service in the Air Force. Each time he comes close, however, Colonel Cathcart raises the number of missions. For Yossarian there is no escape: Catch-22, the sinister rule that resides in the heart of the book, makes it impossible for him to evade his duties. Catch-22 states that any man who flies his missions is crazy, and therefore could be grounded, but only if he asks. As soon as he asks he is no longer considered crazy but sane, and must fly his missions.I highly recommend this historical-fiction novel, but only to those 13 and up because of some mature content. It also can be challenging to follow because it has many subtle flashbacks and big vocabulary words. There are a few themes in this book, but the one that stood out the most to me was perseverance. Joseph Heller has also written a sequel to this book, Closing time.Sitting here and reading reviews won't do you justice, though. So go on, get up and grab a copy of this insanely funny book and start reading!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"A friend recommended this CD to me and it was a great recommendation. Jay Sanders does an amazing job reading this book. He provides interpretation that goes beyond the book and makes the book seem even more ironic and entertaining. Parts are laugh out loud funny. He changes his voice to match various characters and really brings the characters to life. I think his voices and interpretations for Yossarian and Milo are great. The part of the book describing events following Orr's crash landing and the time in a life boat is truly hilarious, made more so by Mr. Sanders's retelling. If you have read the book (which everyone should as it is a bit of genius and a great commentary on the absurdity of life) get the CD, if you have not read the book, get the CD. I think this is one of the best CD versions of a book I have ever heard."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is the greatest novel of its kind. In all of humorist literature no author captures the moments of its characters so fully. All of the characters jump out from the pages with their realistic qualities and depth of construct. The humor follows through serious and tragic circumstances to help the reader realize the ludicrosity of war.This is the great predecessor to the pop-culture phenomenon of M*A*S*H.Not only are you left rolling with laughter at the events of Catch-22 as well as the illogical baseness of military thought, but you are left shaking your head at the parallel of unimaginable events to modern historical events. The treatment is timeless and the laughter is limitless.The advantage of this edition, as with all Everyman's Library editions, is the quality of binding and thorough chronology of the author as a preset to the text."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"A very, very funny book.

It consisted of a lot of humor, that kept me reading, since the book is about 450 pages long. If you read this book you will find that it is hard to follow until the last 3 chapters when everything comes together. It would be nice if there was a sequel to Catch 22 since the book ends so suddenly.Yossarian, the main character, was the most fun to read about, he had many conversations and incidents that just kept you guessing. Sometimes the book would focus on different characters such as Major Major Major and Milo Mindbender, but that wasn't to bad since they were also very interesting to read about.You should definitely read this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"For the most part, this book was good. It took me a long time to read, but I eventually finished it. I though the plot line was great, and the characters were hilarious. The contradictions that characters made only fueled the fire to make war seem ridiculous, and for the most part, it is. The last 150 or so pages is where the book really starts getting interesting though."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is more about people than it is about war. It is more about life than it is about death. It is more about Yossarian and Nately (and his old man) and Sheisskopf and Major Major than it is about World War II. Hell, I even took my username from my favorite character in this book (as well as literature universall), Milo Minderbinder.I have heard from many that Heller has not approached this brilliance since. He once, when asked why he had not written another novel as good as Catch-22, said, &quot;Well, nobody else has either.&quot; That just might be true. This book made me look at people with all their quirks and their inconsistencies and try to laugh instead of argue. It helped me look at our world with a smile and a laugh insead of a frown and a spoonful of critisism. Parts were hilarious, parts were poignant.Its story is far less important than its character (as made evident by the format). In every character you see something in yourself. In Yossarian I saw much of what I would like to have the guts to do. I saw common sense. It was also a manifestation of Orwell's famous quotations, &quot;Sanity is Not Statistical.&quot;Read this book: laugh, cry, think, be enlightened.{{{milo}}}"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is an excellent book chronicling the experiences of an American bombardier in WWII with objections to sacrificing his seemingly infinitesimal self in order to win a war. The prose is stirring and although the vocabulary can be difficult at times, it forces your mind to create a vivid picture of the scenes. The hilarious characters make you laugh out loud. My favorite scenes were with the two CID men with Major Major and the scene where Yossarion pretends to be a man who died in the hospital for the family of the victim. It was seemingly almost entirely a comedic piece until the last thirty pages, in which the reader arrives at the startling revelation that nearly all of the enormous cast of characters has died. Though it took me a long time to finish, I would gladly read it again."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The best way that I can find to describe this book is Abbott and Costello's infamous &quot;Who's on first?&quot; routine. The entire plot and interaction between characters is a mish-mash of miscommunication. The characters run the gamet of absurdity. From the main character Yossarian, the bombardier who thinks that everyone is out to get him personally because they are trying to kill him in a war. To the private, who is running a black market between countries and enemies, selling anything and everything he can get his hands on. To the colonel who feels that the success of the army depends on whether or not he can provide a good parade. The list goes on and on.The plot weaves back and forth in time and can get somewhat confusing at times, but then again if you're not on your toes this whole book could get away from you. I found the best thing to do is just find a quiet place and let yourself get absorbed in the ridiculousness. The best way to sum up this satirical look on war is this: &quot;Catch 22&quot; IS a catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller has created something amazing in Catch-22. It is a modern classic. The novel will spend 400 pages dragging the reader through the mud, only to to conclude with one of the most satisfying endings I have found in literature. The tone will oscillate between ironic and morose, jubilant and melancholy, and Heller makes no apologies for doing so. The novel ultimately questions the validity of war and so-called camraderie, loyalty, and patriotism. This is a wonderful book with a message that will resonate with the reader for a long time after the story comes to an end."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is the one thing that keeps an entire bomber squadron in WWII still flying. The book constructs a vivid portrayal of the experiences of Yossarian and his comrades and their reasons for insanity. Their only goal is forging plans that can keep them on the ground and out of their planes. There is a limit to the number of missions the squadron must fly, but as soon as enough men reach it, it is simple raised. The squadron is caught in a never-ending circle broken only by death. The ironic Catch -22 is their only path towards freedom, it keeps them flying because it is Catch-22. The book is a great read the humor in the book runs abound along and the irony behind catch-22 creates great plot twists. Yossarian will continue to live for many years."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I read this book and loved it! It is by far one of my personal favorites.

I rank this as one of my top 5 favorite books and the best satire I have read or seen. The book can start out to be a little hard to read at first with dozens of characters and a timeline that goes back and forth without notice. But once you get thru 100 pages or so the plot starts to come together and it's pure genius stands out. No other book I have read makes better satirical comment on the Human nature than this book and the humor used will make you laugh out loud while reading. The closest comparison I can give this book is the movie &quot;Life of Brian&quot; by Monty Python. If you liked that movie read this book and vice versa."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is a very funny novel about Yossarian, a solder that flies for the Air Force.

Funny is not just a way of saying it made me giggle. Really funny novels are funny because they provide surprising insight into the way human beings truly are.

Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf is the funniest contemporary novel because it has similar amazing insights -- but it's not a war novel, and who knows if it will have the relevance that Catch-22 does fifty years later, but anyway I just love both these books."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Screw Tolstoy, this is the greatest war book ever written.

A modern classic by any measure."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Hillarious, Moving, Disturbing, Flawless. Catch-22 is notthe greatest book I have ever written, it is, though, thebest. Heller's revolutionary plot structuring drivesbeyond time and place, to meaning. After the first fewchapters the book seems to be going every directionpossible, but after a few more it becomes evident thattime has very little consequence in the book, but that thesignifigance of each segment, which Heller repeats overand over again to the beat of some furious, wildlybrilliant drum is the deciding factor in his plotting.The insane structure all the while parallels the hero's,John Yossarian, or anti-hero's more accurately, frenziedattempts to break away from the madness of society and toattain his supreme goal, to live (even if must die in theattempt.) He assaulted by Capitalism, in thepersonification of Milo Minderbinder, the man who'sbusiness crosses all battle lines, supports every man,woman, and child in Europe, and robs them dry at the sametime; to Col.

This book means more to those of us who have matured because the institutional insanity so cleverly articulated by Heller in this novel is more pervasive today... and not just in the the military. I think it takes decades of living before some of the truths in novels such as this meaningfully reveal themselves.

Virtue and sanity are what's left over when you've tired of all vice."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"By wrapping his story in the context of war, Heller amplifies our tendency to treat others as a means to an end and to interpret our surroundings as intentionally hostile to our own objectives.Does Heller say more than this? Probably, after all, he introduces a lot of colorful characters, albeit most superficially. But it takes a lot of patience to wade through his oxymoronic prose and roundabout narrative style. At times I found this entertaining; at others I did not. It was probably during these latter instances where I missed the book's other messages on love, capitalism, war, sex, and everything else that others have gleaned from its pages. Admittedly, war is tragic, and sometimes life seems pointless and self-defeating, but as Major Danby explains near the end, sometimes we just have to focus on objectives larger than ourselves.In short and in an attempt to imitate Heller's style, I would describe Catch-22 as a comical and tragic book that uplifts and depresses you. Its constant absurdity is transcended only by its momentary seriousness. Would I read it again? Parts of it, most definitely. The whole thing, probably not."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When a piece of literature gets stuck into a culture, you know there's really something to it. Having read CATCH-22 when in high school, I decided to revisit it in this crazy George Bush-world we now live in. The parallels are frighteningly surreal. But let's not get political.This is the story of one man's fight to exit WW II in one piece. His name is Captain Yossarian and he finds the war-torn world to be a place of contradictions and ignorant men of power. Flying missions over Europe, Yossarian's commanders continually up the number of missions that must be flown before the men can be circulated back to the States. Yossarian realizes he'll never stop flying these terribly dangerous missions because whenever he gets close to his final one, his CO's up them (a Catch-22 in itself). The ridiculous qualities of war are thrown at Yossarian as we witness his conflicting tragedies through comedic/ironic eyes.In his do-anything-to-stay-alive fashion, Yossarian enters the hospital as often as possible with stomach ailments, or by trying to be deemed mentally unstable. Neither works, of course.Pinning medals on naked men, rowing to Sweden with a tiny spoon, and living with a dead guy who never made it past his first mission, Yossarian's gambits know no bounds.Heller's writing style is something of a marvel, too. His own prose is done in Catch-22 fashion, making the reader laugh and cringe (Example: \\"Don't interrupt.\\" \\"Yes, sir.\\" \\"And say \`sir' when you do.\\" \\"Yes, sir.\\" \\"Weren't you just ordered not to interrupt?\\")It's amazing that even today the term Catch-22 can be heard muttered by people who don't know the reference from which it originated. Try asking someone what a Catch-22 is and they'll likely be able to tell you, but many probably won't know where the term came from. I think we owe it to Joseph Heller to keep this pun alive, especially with what's going on in the Whitehouse right now.Oh, darn! There I go again. Sorry..."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"There's a war on, everyone is crazy, and none of the airmen who has flown close to the mandatory number of missions seems very happy when someone raises the number of mandatory missions. There's a way out: all a crazy airman has to do is to ask the doctor to ground him. But there's a catch.\\"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.\\"Thus Joseph Heller introduced a new term into the English vernacular. Catch-22 is a view of the world in all its absurdity and contradiction. It's a novel that explores critical issues like war, identity, and the struggle of the individual against bureaucracy run amok--all while being tremendously funny.The story centers around Yossarian, a bombardier trying desperately to save himself; men he knows keep dying because they're sent on one dangerous mission after another in an effort by their commanding officer to show his zeal and to be promoted.Each chapter in the novel is entitled for a character or location in the story, allowing us to focus before moving on to the next part of the story. In this structure, we learn the absurdity of the situation, the apparent inability of anyone to stop the wheels of the bureaucracy, and the success of those who exploit it to their own ends, all while proclaiming themselves to be working for the greater good. (Everyone, after all, has a share.) Then there are the efforts to achieve recognition by the sincerity of the form-letters sent to the families of the airmen killed. And the work of a schemer trying to get his picture the Saturday Evening Post.Some call it bitter or critical of bureaucracy. I call it an honest look at the results of consolidating power. Catch-22 is a brilliant work, well-deserving of its reputation as a classic of American literature, one of the best novels of the twentieth century, a thoughtful commentary that apparently heeds the advice offered by another brilliant explorer of the human condition from a century before.\\"If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you.\\" --Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. The book was very witty and had me laughing several times. The story wasn?t anything special, in fact it was sad, but the author wrote in such a way that that made the book humorously enjoyable. The concept of the catch-22 was strewn throughout the book, and the apparently insane main character of the book, Yosarrian, proved to be one of the few sane characters in the book. I saw two weaknesses in the book. First, there are too many characters. I could not keep track of all the generals, colonels, captains and majors. Second, the book was trashy in parts. These parts of the book were unnecessary and did not settle well with me. With all that said, the book was horrible for being so great."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I read Catch-22 on the beach before many a Fijian sunset. The fact that i couldn't take my eyes from the page to admire the surreal postcard display before me has to say something about this book. I stayed up til four each morning because i never wanted to stop reading. This is just ONE OF THOSE BOOKS. Heller's vision is of such a complete story, a beyond-history, where events are visited and revisited and new light is shed on them, but the omnipotent power of the author is felt in the filtering of accurate details throughout. I just found Heller's control over his narrative mesmerising. Aside from this structural point, Catch-22 would be nothing without its characters. I don't remember ever delighting so much in the exploits of so many characters. An entire air-force base, virutally, is evoked in chapter after chapter of brilliant scenes and funny histories.Watch out for: Hungry Joe, Major Major, Milo, Orr, Doc Daneeka, The Chaplain, Sheissekopf, aw heck, i won't list the rest, but they're all good!Particularly relevant now, and in any time of war in the future (sadly, the fact is inevitable), is Heller's portrayal of the madness of war. Anyone can say it, anyone can glorify it, but Heller was actually there. He served as a bombadier (Yossarian, his protagonist, does too). But its not just the war, its any government, any big business, any SYSTEM, which oppresses you, beats you into submission and makes you do its dirty work at the expense of your life love and liberty. The SYSTEM that you can't escape from, no matter what - and as soon as you want to escape, it uses this against you to shackle you back to it again.Despite this, though, like other truly great books, you don't get the sense of being badgered by it. You laugh along with the third-person narrator and you read about characters and story. You don't ever feel that you're getting a book of straight ideas: always a dry, suffocating thing. He isn't telling us a anything, he isn't teaching us anything, he's showing us something - and allowing us to make of it what we will. Heller has made a book with an overriding theme, a satirical novel, but he hasn't written another Bible. He presents a situation, he doesn't pretend to have all the answers. The only thing he knows for sure, is that war doesn't solve anything.There are no words to describe the sort of funny Heller's book is, except maybe laugh-out-loud. I don't remember laughing so much at a book.Like Catcher in the Rye, Catch-22 is a book which will make you feel throughout and after you're finished both happy and sad: happy that a book like this exists, though shocked that it fell into your hands, but sad over the fact that you doubt you'll ever find another as good.If in doubt, though, try Vladamir Nabokov's Lolita and Catcher in the Rye. Remarkable, lyrical, hilarious books are indeed hard to come by."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"On the one hand, Catch-22 may be beating a dead horse under the circumstances that it is trying to convince the reader that not all soldiers serving during WW2 were perfect and that many were trying to escape their duty, but on the no-so-literal side, the book is an amazing insight into the twisted rules of most establishments and organizations, notably and especially those which are \\"American\\".At a surface glance, Catch-22 appears to be about one Captain Yossarian, a navigator serving in Italy during World War 2 who is constantly trying to find ways to get out of combat and return home due to the fact that his commanding officer, Colonel Cathcart, is constantly raising the number of required bombing missions for each pilot. The context of the story follows Yossarian's various crazy attempts to escape the hellhole he is trapped in, as well as the insane antics of the other soldiers in his squadron and the numerous backstabbings and alliances that occur. By the time you reach the middle of the book, you'll be questioning if there is even one sane man in the entire squadron.That is the surface look. When you look underneath that, Heller has taken all the loopholes and injustices of the military and served them up for any somewhat intelligent person to see and therefore to use, in order that they won't get themselves caught up in a net of contradictions and lies, essentially falling into the all American trap of joining the military. (Little did Heller know how many young men would do just that less than 20 years later in Vietnam.)However, that is still not all. Under this second skin of the military lies an even deeper message that goes even beyond how distrustful and wicked the military can be, and that is the horrid truth that establishments all across the globe are using the same twisted procedures and insanely irrational rules to keep those who are a part of it in check. The fact that there is not only one message hidden under the surface of the plot, but an even deeper one embedded in that is truly genius, and I do not use that word lightly.With the universal truth about establishments and their catch-22's (essentially a lose-lose situation), there are also many other messages in tow throughout the novel about the morality, decency, and existence of man. The chapter titled \\"Nately's Old Man\\" serves up a decent argument about war and the ultimate future of America and hereby all nations, and the chilling chapter \\"Snowden\\" brings the entire existence of man into question in a disturbing scene taking place during the death of a soldier on board a plane. Some may view Catch-22 as an irrelevant novel to anyone who wasn't alive in the 1950's due to its WW2 theme and overall plot, but deep down inside, theire is a truth to this novel which has stood the test of time. No true reader of literature would dare pass this up."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Usually I prefer shorter novels, ones in the 200-300 page range. However, at the recommendation of my friend, I decided to give Catch-22 and it's 450+ pages a chance. Looking back, I can't thank my friend enough for this recommendation.Catch-22 follows the people and events surrounding one Captain Yossarian, a World War II bombadier stationed off Italy. All he wants to do is live while, through his eyes, everyone wants to kill him. Even the people on his side are out to kill him. As the number of missions he must fly keeps rising, Yossarian keeps coming up with new ways to avoid his inevitable death.This book is littered with a cournicopia of interesting characters. Each one gets their own chapter (and in some cases, multiple chapters) and Joseph Heller manages to mesh them all together to form an interesting (albeit sometimes hard to follow) plot. At first it seems like the book isn't going to really go anywhere but before you know it, it's there.This book gave me a good chuckle on numerous occassions. Whether it was one of Yossarian's crazy schemes to get sent home or the officers' constant struggle to gain recognition (and promotion), there is never a dull moment."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Great book as always. It's bigger than some previous versions. Good if you like the feeling of flipping solid pages."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is the story of Yossarian, a member of the US air force in World War II. The story loosely chronicles his time on the base. But mostly, it's an extended exercise in ridiculing military processes, thought, and actions, and at demonstrating just how crazy war is. The ridiculously exaggerated characters and their foibles make the story. They're so bizarre and chaotically presented as to almost make it difficult to follow -- but the humor is so excellent that it doesn't matter. It's a long book, worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"As the author ofSnaggler's Paradise (Wickedly funny... Mark Rainstone Reviews)(highly recommended) put it, \\"Being crazy is the only sane thing in the world.\\" Joseph Heller's Catch-22 has stood the test of time. Regardless of a wartime setting, the novel's strength is about the offbeat characters that inhabit Heller's world, most of whom reside within us all, or those around us. A lasting piece of work and a good read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I've read this book three times over the years, and I sometimes remember bits of it at odd moments. It is very funny and profound. I once read that many years later, Joseph Heller was asked why he had never written anything as good again. He replied \\"Who has?\\" He had a point."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I've always been interested in reading this legendary book, just not 450-pages interested, so I was pleased when my book club selected it and I was \\"required\\" to read it. Unfortunately, by the time I got to the end, I was much less pleased. I found the book's much-vaunted humor to be tiresome in the extreme, the characters far too cartoonish for me to care when bad things happen, and the entire enterprise to be about twice as long as necessary. Which is not to say there weren't some things to like: the non-linear, non-chronological structure is kind of interesting at times (unlike some, I didn't find it confusing), the convoluted machinations of war profiteer Milo Minderbinder are kind of amusing, and the sly insertion of anachronistic elements to signal that the book is about Korea and not WWII, are all worth mentioning. But the book leans far too heavily on extended circular conversations that reminded me of nothing so much as a series of Abbot and Costello \\"Who's On First?\\" routines. To be fair, a number of my fellow book club members couldn't read these without audibly giggling, but I (and others) found them to be very painful going. And it may be that the book just hasn't aged well, or has been succeeded by so much tighter satire (M*A*S*Hfor example) or ridiculous wars, that it just can't reliably have the subversive effect it must have at the time it was published. For military satire that's more contemporary, and to my mind at least, funny, try the excellent Gulf War farceFobbit."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"For quite a few years I've ignored this book simply because its a work of fiction and who needs that when there are so many quality true stories out there to read? Well I recently bit the bullet and read this book to see if it lived up to the hype. It sure did. What a rich and engaging cast of flawed but interesting characters! They reminded me of some of the men I served with, especially the young and romantic Nately. His naivety mirrored that of not only my friends but also my own self at that age (though I was much to innocent to try and romance a prostitute!). I would highly recommend this book to anyone in need of a laugh at the insanity of war."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I was really introduced to this book by reading John van der Ruit's &#34;Spud&#34; novel. It was very funny in places and, as one who served in the Air Force, much of the scenarios showed that the author understood the context well! I will admit that I started to lose interest after a while as the author tends to spend whole chapters on individuals; some of them grabbed me and others were rather boring. On the whole, an entertaining read that explores human fickleness, the rigidness of societal structures and the absurdity of war."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I read this book because I read it in high school and never got to finish it. I wanted to read it again and get to the end this time. Funny and a little irreverent. Yossarian lives!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I wasn't too excited to start this book. I had to read it with my class at school and, well, we usually don't read very good novels. This one was...okay. The entire novel was a satire-making fun of war. There were a few parts that really made me laugh, but sometimes the book seemed to drag on and on with the corny jokes! And sometimes it didn't make sense just because the author didn't feel like making sense in order to prove a point. I know that's a certain style, but it irks me.I liked how the characters were well defined, if annoying at times. I know, I know-they're supposed to be this way. I'm just not used to reading any book like this one.I'm giving \\"Catch 22&#8243; 2/5 stars: 1 star for the fact that it made me laugh [sometimes], and the other for the combination of it being a classic book [then it must be good enough for people to read XD] and having great characters."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Having previously red the book several times I knew precisely what I was getting. I continue to loan my books to friends and relatives requiring that I purchase it again to re-read it. Not entirely a BAD idea because with each new reading I get new entertainment value from the book. VERY well written with a dry sense of humor concerning a very SERIOUS moment in history. It is a very sensible spoof on army life during world war II with various things taken to their ultimate extreme to wring out the often buried humor. I suspect this will not be the LAST time I read and enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The amazing CATCH-22 essentially has three overlapping narratives. One shows senior officers who are comically unsympathetic to the interests of their men. Some of these, such as Colonel Cathcart and General Peckem, are careerists who make decisions according to self-interest (or stupidity and self-interest). Others are incompetents, such as Major Major Major Major and General Sheiskopff, whose authority far surpasses their ability. To me, the careerist officers, while satirical, seemed as real as any modern bungling boss, working smugly in the corner office.Milo Minderbinder, a genius trader and capitalist, is the dominant character in the second narrative. Technically, Milo is the mess officer at Pianosa, where Yossarian is based. But he has parlayed this job into a food supply syndicate and has become a major commercial player throughout the entire war zone. Milo is a profiteer and entrepreneur whose greed distorts, and sometimes overshadows, the war.With Milo, Heller shows a world of surrealistic capitalism that thrives as the men in the bombers die. But for me, Milo didn't add much. His adventures make twisted sense. Yet they hit only one note and don't really ripen into something more profound. Milo is the least successful part of this superior and complex book.The third narrative in CATCH-22 shows the men who fly in the bombers. Here, Heller's work is outstanding. There are men who can't shake the presence of death (Yossarian, Dunbar, Hungry Joe, and Dobbs). There are true believers who accept the mission and its risks (Clevinger and Havermeyer). There is a rich kid (Nately), a reckless hotdog (McWatt), and a doomed alcoholic (Chief White Halfoat). And there are the horrible fatalities (Snowden and Kid Sampson), whose deaths are gruesome and arbitrary.Heller's work with these characters is absolutely first-rate. While they have cartoonish aspects, each is distinct and each has a surprisingly moving story. Heller also writes about their combat missions with you-are-there intensity. Finally, he connects the reader emotionally to the plight of these characters, especially in the final 150 pages, when the power and poignance of his narratives merge and really hit home. Then, you feel the consequences when you learn that, say, Milo has substituted aspirin for morphine in McWatt's plane on the tragic and high-risk mission to Avignon. \\"There there,\\" murmurs Yossarian. \\"There there.\\"CATCH-22 is a long book. There is repetitiveness in its humor. Its iteration of events is occasionally maddening. But keep at it! CATCH 22 deserves its must-read reputation (although seventh place on the ML Best Novels list seems high). Regardless, this is a terrific novel."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is so good, my weak attempt at a review is not going to do it justice. But I'll try.I knew before I was half-way through that this is going to be a favorite and I plan to re-read it immediately. The writing is so fresh, the character studies so sharp, and the satire so relevant in today's increasingly bureaucratic (corporate) society, no wonder it was so hard for me to find a used copy. It's definitely a book I plan to hold onto and enjoy re-reading every year.Anyone who's ever worked for a big corporation (like myself) can identify with Heller's hilarious and angry take on bureaucracy. Gen. Peckem's quote reads like a line from Dilbert or Office Space:\\"Just pass the work I assign you along to somebody else and trust to luck. We call that delegation of responsibility. Somewhere down near the lowest level of this coordinated organization I run are people who do get the work done when it reaches them, and everything manages to run along smoothly without too much effort on my part.\\"It's sad how true that is in real life.But this book is not all satire. It has a big heart. I often found myself laughing and crying at the same time. I can tell Heller cares deeply for his characters, even when he makes high comedy out of their sad fates (such as what happens to poor Doc Daneeka). He's brutally honest about the horrors of war, and laces them with enough humanity to really break your heart. It all makes the climatic \\"miracle\\" that much more satisfying. It's a satire that ends with a message of hope. And I like that.Many people call this book ant-war, but I don't think it is. It really comes down to the last conversation btw. Yossarian and Danby. The ideals of war can be good - who can argue against rescuing Western Europe from Nazi domination. But it's the method of war - and all the evils that go with it - that makes no sense. Are these evils worth the ideals? It's a catch-22. And it's a dilemma that applies to life in general, not just to war."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller, who was an American bombardier in WWII, tells the story of a character in the same situation, John Yossarian, in his historical, satirical novel, Catch-22. The title refers to a military rule in the book in which circular logic is employed to keep air-men flying their missions, despite their best efforts to avoid them. It illustrates perfectly the message of the story: war is insane, and inane bureaucratic operation sustains it.I began reading the novel with optimistic expectations, mainly from the critical acclaim it has received over the decades, but also because the title's concept seemed a clever premise for a novel. However, as I read chapter after chapter I became disheartened. The jokes were not funny, they made no sense, and the characters rambled on insanely about seemingly unimportant topics. By about page 100 I was seriously considering moving on to something else, but then a colleague of mine saw it in my hand and said, \\"Catch-22, great novel, isn't it?\\" This guy was highly-educated and a veteran educator - was I missing something? \\"Actually,\\" I replied, \\"I'm not really getting into this one.\\" He smiled and nodded knowingly: \\"It took me five tries to finish it. The first hundred pages are tough, but once you get over that stretch it's really worth it.\\" Taking him at his word I trudged on, and I am deeply grateful I did. He was correct, as the story gradually began to come together brilliantly and by the end I decided that it was perhaps one of the most solid and intelligent novels that I have yet read.There were reasons for my troubles, and I fear that many give up with a sour impression of the book due to them. The novel is told from differing points of view, and the story is nonlinear. Events are told repeatedly by different people, often out of sequence, and are revealed more and more in their entirety each time further details are offered. This results in the completion of a set-up to a joke whose punch-line has already been told. It allows the reader to laugh at and understand later a situation which previously seemed frivolous and unfunny. It also changes one's perspective of characters that at first seemed insane, but are later found to be the sanest.Catch-22 offers many instances of poignant insight and telling observations. One of the most relevant to our own time involves a conversation between the American character Nately and an elderly Italian man:\\"You put so much stock in winning wars,\\" the grubby iniquitous old man scoffed. \\"The real trick lies in losing wars, in knowing which wars can be lost. Italy has been losing wars for centuries, and just see how splendidly we've done nonetheless. France wins wars and is in a continual state of crisis. Germany loses and prospers.\\" (Heller 255)And later...\\"There is nothing so absurd about risking your life for your country,\\" he [Nately] declared.\\"Isn't there?\\" asked the old man. \\"What is a country? A country is a piece of land surrounded on all sides by boundaries, usually unnatural. Englishmen are dying for England, Americans are dying for America, Germans are dying for Germany, Russians are dying for Russia. There are now fifty or sixty countries fighting in this war. Surely so many countries can't be worth dying for.\\"\\"Anything worth living for,\\" said Nately, \\"is worth dying for.\\"\\"And anything worth dying for,\\" answered the sacrilegious old man, \\"is certainly worth living for... How old are you? Twenty-five? Twenty-six?\\"\\"Nineteen,\\" said Nately, \\"I'll be twenty in January.\\"\\"If you live.\\" (Heller 257)Despite what justifications can be made for war, how else can war look to one who witnesses the carnage first-hand but to be absolutely without reason? And though certain wars may be just, certainly not all battles are. This is the experience of Yossarian.The novel contains the heart-breaking reality of war coupled with the zaniness of people on the brink of sanity's edge. It is real enough to be relevant, but surreal enough for the reader to laugh and enjoy without qualms of conscience. For those who have been inhibited by the confusion of the first hundred pages of the book, I beg you to return once more for the long haul. The journey is well-worth it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This was a very popular book when it first came out, and millions of copies were sold in the paperback version in the 1960s.However, the reviews were mixed. The Sunday Times, for example, thought that the book was far too \\"repetitious\\" and it lacked \\"craft and sensibility.\\" But a reviewer from the Herald tribune in New York thought it was \\"a wild, moving, shocking, hilarious, raging, exhilarating, giant roller coaster ride of a book.\\" Those two reviews summarize the basic traits of the book. I am quoting Joseph Heller (above) who wrote a piece on the reviews for his book.The reviews were not unanimous because - and this is a simplification that I make here - this is not a novel in the purest sense as one might think of a novel such as Madame Bovary. It is not a well balanced work of art where one has a few strong characters and a strong plot. Rather, it is a wandering story or a series of short stories all linked by a common protagonist. The hero, Yossarian, is an air crew memeber in a bomber wing which is stationed off the coast of Italy during World War II. The book has a series of strong characters, all held together by a weak plot; it is a series of very funny portraits of various characters in the bomber wing. Each chapter is about a different member of the wing: various colonels, generals, fellow crew members, the chaplain, etc. It descibes their actions, motivations, and inner thoughts.The book describes how they cope with the isolation, the pressures of war, and the ambitions of the regular officers, especially the colonels who want to become generals.So, this is a great piece of literature but perhaps not the great American novel. It took Joseph Heller about 8 years to write this story of World War II, and we assume that he has drawn on his knowledge of the bomber wing from his own time in the air-force. It is irreverent humor which leaves the reader laughing out loud on many occasions during the read.The only other similar book that I have read is Slaughterhouse Five, but the present work is much longer and more complex.This is an interesting and entertaining read that can be read in a day or two."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When I first started to read Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" I expected to get the typical war story. I didn't think that it would offer me anything new because I have seen and read several war stories. But as I progressed further into the book, I realized that this novel is unique and is unlike anything else I have ever read.The novel is based around a bomb squadron stationed on a small island near Italy. The main focus is on one of the members of the squadron named Yossarian, who is going insane because he is caught in the middle of World War II and people that he doesn't even know are trying to kill him. Yossarian tries desperately throughout the novel to get out of the war, and along the way he meets up with many interesting characters. And that is what makes this novel unique: the characters.Heller does an amazing job of developing every single person in the novel, giving them all a personality type of their own. Every personality in the novel adds a little something to the story. From Orr's obnoxious traits to Doc Daneeka's pessimistic outlook on life, all of the characters come together to show the horrifying truth of the madness of war. If one of the characters was missing, the novel just wouldn't have the same impact.The characters also do something besides helping to develop the story; they provide insight on many aspects of life. The discussions between characters in this book made me realize many important things. This book shows people that they shouldn't take things for granted or take advantage of people. Heller does this by showing the effect that it had on the characters that did those things. This novel is a real eye-opener.Heller also achieves a feat that many other authors haven't: a perfect blend of horror and humor. Although the novel is full of disgusting depictions of war, I often found myself chuckling. And at some points, I laughed out loud, which is something I do only if I find something truly hilarious. For example, about halfway through the novel, Yossarian has to constantly look over his shoulder because he is being stalked by a prostitute who is trying to kill him for something that he didn't even do.Overall, this is an outstanding novel. Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" is a masterpiece that should be read by anyone and everyone. It is a perfect blend of the horror and hilarity that is full of insight. It's definitely one of the best novels that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"&quot;Catch 22&quot; is one of the funniest books anyone's ever read. I use that phrasing intentionally because pretty much everyone who's read it, it seems, considers it one of the funniest books they've ever read. In fact, it's difficult to imagine anyone not finding this book utterly charming, despite the obvious dark themes which any novel about war will address. Nearly every single character in this work is hilarious, though they are extremely varied-no two are alike. This book shouldn't take very long for anyone to read, even though they'll probably be interrupted constantly by their own incessant gut-laughing."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"As a high schooler, I would recommend &quot;Catch-22&quot; to anyone who isn't intimitated by larger books. This book is a novel about war and its prospects, morals, and the effects it has on the people within it. The narrator focuses on the events occuring in the camp of Pianosa, located on an island off the coast of Italy. The main character, Yossarian, gains morals and fights the system during World War II. It is very good a keeps the reader's attention. It's a nice variation from most dull high school reading, and I would rank this book right up there with &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;. If you are a high schooler looking for a challenging book, I would most certainly recommend &quot;Catch-22&quot;. (Didn't that sound like it came straight out of Reading Rainbow?)"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 was a very intriguing book to say the least. The main character, Yossarian, seemed to be a bit of an oddball, which kept all of the story lines quite interesting. At times Catch 22 can get rather confusing as Joseph Heller jumps back and forth between one story and another, not really making any smooth transitions between them which tends to throw you off as a reader. The entire story is based during World War II and much of it is spent in different countries around Europe. You, as the reader get to travel with Yossarian from country to country while he makes deliveries, bombing runs, and becomes acquaintances with many people, including a hooker that he becomes quite fond of. Much of the story has humorous sections that leave you laughing and wanting to read more only to find out what type of antics Yossarian will perform next, including a time when he decides to become a nudist on the military base at which he is stationed. Overall, Catch 22 is by far one of the best books I've ever read. It keeps you on your toes with humor and action, along with a plot that only thickens as you read further into the book. I recommend this book only to more advanced readers, however, as it can get quite complicated to understand."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is funny. This book is the greatest parody of war ever written. This book is a work of genius. I am amazed every time I read this book at how apropos the title is and how Heller manages to weave his main point, the absurdity of war, throughout every story in this book. There is the classic scene in which the phrase Catch-22 is coined. You can only leave the war if you are crazy, but if you have the mental capacity to want to leave the war then you must be sane. An impossible situation for Yossarian, but what character does not live his life in accordance with absurdity? Major Major tells his secretary that no one is allowed in to his office to see him while he is in his office. Chief White Halfcoat can not settle down anywhere because men searching for oil will uproot him to dig for crude wherever he sets down. The man in Yossarian's tent can not be removed because he never signed in, but he can never sign in because he died before he was able to. Milo strafes the men of his own division for money because the money he is making is for the men. And all this time Snowden lays dying in the back. Throughout all this absurdity this haunting little story line continues to appear about Snowden lying in the sunlight at the back of the plane shivering to death. This is the most crucial moment in the book, for it is when Snowden spills his guts (literally) to Yossarian that the war becomes all too real. People are dying, real people, people that Yossarian knows, and he is powerless to stop it or explain it. It is during Snowden's death that Yossarian subscribes to this code of absurdity as all the other characters have in order to somehow cope with the concept of war. There is a brilliant scene in which some new recruits come in to camp. They are young and innocent. They set up their stuff in Yossarian's tent. They light Orr's wood, which was never to be used, and warm themselves over it. They take the nameless man's belongings and simply chuck them outside, ignoring the logic trap which has kept this dead man alive for so long. They are oblivious to the way things have been working in the world of this book because the war is still only a concept to them. There is no need for them to buy into absurdity fully, for they have yet to come across something they cannot cope with. Their Snowden is still alive, and their world still makes sense. Catch-22 is not merely a funny book with quirky characters. It is a testament to the only sort of mindset in which a war can make sense, the mindset of absurdity."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Captain John Yossarian is a bombardier for the 256th Squadron, stationed on the island of Pianosa in the Mediterranean. He's sick of having people try to kill him. He 's finally realized that anyone willing to fly into the face of enemy fire must be crazy, so he wants to go home, but there's a catch:There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. 'That's some catch, that Catch-22, he (Yossarian) observed. 'It's the best there is,' Doc Daneeka agreed.And so he's stuck flying more missions (and ever more as the number of missions required keeps getting increased.)Serving alongside him in the 256th are:Col.

It is at heart an antibureaucratic polemic. While the specific target is the military, the attack is universal.It is especially interesting that this is a novel of World War II. One of the more vacuous tribal drums that is beating beneath today's culture is for the cult of the Depression/WWII generation, or as Tom Brokaw's book call them, the Greatest Generation (see Orrin's review). There's this quaint myth that somehow the folks who lived through the Depression and fought in WWII were an especially selfless or patriotic crew. They certainly look good in comparison to the wholly self-centered Baby Boomers, but books like this and the works of James Jones &amp; Kurt Vonnegut offer a welcome antidote to the notion that they marched happily off to a war to save the world without a thought for themselves.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller died on December 12, 1999. Boy will we miss him.There are only two ways to look at &quot;Catch-22.&quot; One side believes that it is a demoralizing work that compromises the integrity and honor of the United States military. The other side argues that this is a classic work of fiction to be enjoyed by generations to come. Who is right?Both sides are. I can honestly say that Heller's hilarious, upsetting, poignant, and disquieting work is one that I am proud to have in my library, even going so far as to say that it is truly one of my favorite works. Seeing as I serve in the US Air Force, one would ask, &quot;How can you so thoroughly enjoy a book which so blatantly criticizes the military and all that it stands for?&quot; To this I reply, &quot;That's the point.&quot;Stationed on an imaginary island off the coast of Italy called Pianosa, a disgruntled World War II bombardier is desparate to get out of the Air Force because he believes that everyone is trying to kill him. For most people, this plot wouldn't hold up in a 463-page novel, much less a short story! However, Heller's superior characterization (the squadron commanding officer's name was Major Major Major Major) and ability to make the most basic situation ironic (an aircrew member who is diagnosed insane is unfit for flying per Air Force regulations must actively request to be taken off of the flight roster, but if he is sane enough to make such a request, then he is deemed fit for flying) leads me to wonder why the book isn't even longer.The characters will tear at your emotions like a Cuisinart. You will both love and hate them at the same time, especially the conniving Milo Minderbinder, who had his own squadron bombed to further the causes of his international black-market goods cartel, a cartel which he runs with the use of the squadron's planes.Joseph Heller is now gone, but his legacy lives on. We salute you, sir, and your tale of Yossarian the bombardier shall never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"No book written in my lifetime has had a greater impact on my thinking or provided such a rich reading experience as Catch-22. More than just an antiwar screed, this sprawling novel with its intricate plots and huge cast of characters is a complex story of survival in an absurdly tragi/comic war. It manages to be both hysterically funny and saddly moving while forcing the reader to look differently at such concepts as 'honor', 'heroism', 'patriotism' and 'cowardice'.As several reveiwers have pointed out, the book is slow to start. Part of that has to do with the author's need to seduce the reader to his peculiar veiwpoint, to introduce the numerous characters and to set the stage that will make the absurd seem normal and the normal seem absurd. Once perceived, the structure of the book is a joy to experience. The recurring interrupted flashbacks, the seemingly unrelated subplots and digressions, the cast of characters, each stranger than the one before, all reveal more and more as the book progresses so that by the end one feels enmeshed in a real story of real people - though it is totally crazy. As if Lewis Carroll had written The Inferno instead of Dante.Some of the scenes and characters are as inventive as anything ever writtn and remain vivid in the mind long after the book is finished. Yossarian is a complete person, but much that he experiences is fragmented and bizarre. The 'soldier in white' (all readers will remember this one) is a perfect example of Heller's genius. This scene is both horrifying and hysterically funny, and goes to the heart of the book's message.Joesph Heller died yesterday. I will miss him because there will be no more Heller books. But in truth, though he continued to write and produced a series of interesting novels (including a sequel to Catch-22), nothing else that he produced came close to having the magic and the impact of that first one."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"For starters, forget everything you've ever been told about novels. Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is in a category all by itself. This laugh-out-loud tale of an American bombardier during the second half of World War II redefines what a novel can be. Yossarian's tale leads you through a series of encounters with numerous characters which include the craziest of the crazy, sanest of the sane, and even a Major named Major who bears a slight resemblance to Henry Fonda. Heller gives you a hilarious commentary of sinister bureaucratic rule that is no less than marvelous.The book takes place on the island of Pianosa (Pianosa is a real island, but Heller has taken the liberty to make it much larger for the sake of his novel) that sits off of the coast of Italy. Yossarian's main goal throughout the novel is to stay alive, or die trying. He is puzzled by the fact that millions of people that he doesn't even know yet want to kill him. His only hope is to be grounded, but the only man who has the power to do so, Doc Daneeka, refuses. Backing the doctor up in his assertion is Catch-22.\\"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. \`That's some catch that catch 22,' he observed. \`It's the best there is.' Doc Daneeka agreed.\\"(46) The concept of Catch-22 is an ever present theme, and its circular path of logic is referred to time and time again.Joseph Heller does a wonderful job exposing the corruption in our society. We are graced with flashbacks within flashbacks, followed up with flash forwards and even more flashbacks. This highly illogical order of events could have spelled disaster. In the hands of a lesser author this hilariously satirical piece could have turned into a jumbled mess, but Heller commands the stream of consciousness in a manner that can only be described as genius. The events and stories don't fall into place until the end of the novel, at which point the fog is lifted and everything becomes clear. The circular logic of the Catch-22 is even apparent in his writing technique. \\"The Texan turned out to be good-natured, generous and likeable. In three days no one could stand him.\\"(9) Upon closer examination of the novel one can see that Catch-22 is a very serious piece of literature. Heller uses our sense of humor to expose us to a grotesquely cruel world with a blatant disregard for human life. A world not all that different from our own, shown through rose colored glasses, distorted just enough to miraculously provide us with a clearer picture. Through Yossarian's fight to survive, he seems to be un-patriotic by your grandfather's standards, but the tenacity in which he fights for what he truly wants he provides with a sick twisted role model. His ideals add to the corruptness of those around him. \\"\`What would they do to me,' he asked in confidential tones, \`if I refused to fly them?' \`We'd probably shoot you,' ex-PFC. Wintergreen replied. \`We?' Yossarian cried in surprise. \`What do you mean, we? Since when are you on their side?' \`If you're going to be shot, whose side do you expect me to be on?' ex-PFC. Wintergreen retorted.\\"(59) As the plot continues to unfold, Heller provides you with a government that grows increasingly more evil. The complexity of the order of events keeps you glued to the text, if for no other reason than to be able to understand where Heller is heading with this story. As a reader we are provided with a surprise ending which in turn explains everything.All in all Catch-22 is a literary masterpiece. It flirts dangerously with the line between humor and absolute horror. In a world infatuated by cruelty, inhumanity, and absolute carnage, Heller provides us with a new look on an old idea, the morality of refusal. In not accepting the rules associated with Catch-22, Yossarian is able to rise above the cruel world that he is a part of and gives us hope when all is thought to be lost. Catch-22 is a must read staple of contemporary literature, a masterpiece of its time."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Though I have posted dialogue from the book, it DOES NOT contain spoilers!Obviously I am in the minority when it comes to rating this book, but I guess I'll add my opinion to Amazon's hard drive in the hopes that it will help someone to make a decision on this book:I really tried to read Catch-22. I have wanted to read it for about three years now, and have always heard good things about it. I went in knowing only what the term 'catch-22' meant, but nothing else.The first thing that struck me about the book was the humor. I was laughing and giggling for the first few chapters during the humorous dialogue that is rampant throughout that section. I cannot define the humor as deep, as it all seemed just a bit silly. That would be fine for me if it were in small doses - I get plenty of silly humor from my friends - but the book just beats it to death. I'll even demonstrate an example:There are no spoilers:*******************************************************************\\"In sixty days you'll be fighting Billy Petrolle,\\" the colonel with the big fat mustache roared. \\"And you think it's a big fat joke.\\"\\"I don't think it's a joke, sir,\\" Clevinger replied.\\"Don't interupt.\\"\\"Yes, sir.\\"\\"And say 'sir' when you do,\\" ordered Major Metcalf.\\"Yes, sir.\\"\\"Weren't you just ordered not to interrupt?\\" Major Metcalf inquired coldly.\\"But I didn't interrupt, sir,\\" Clevinger protested.\\"No. And you didn't say 'sir,' either...\\"******************************************************Ok, maybe Mr. Heller is trying to show that commanders aren't listening to the soldiers or maybe he's trying to demonstrate that the commanders are stupid, I don't know. Regardless, what I know is that this type of humor is repeated continuously through the first 80 pages and by that time it is completely overused.Ergo, my recommendations for the prospective reader therefore is this:If you think you can handle the described type of humor in large quantities, purchase this book. If you are unsure, rent it from the library. If the above dialogue seems disinteresting, I would search elsewhere for your next book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"War, for all its glory, gore, bloodshed, tragedy and horror, in the end is often one continuous story of insanity and inanity. People find themselves in circumstances that to the outsider, might seem quite funny. So goes this book; Catch-22, by Joseph Heller. Probably one of the great 20th century classics in war literature along with \\"Farewell to Arms\\" and \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\", this is the ultimate tragi-comedy of WW2. Based on the life of a group of bomber pilots based in Italy; the story focuses on Yosarian, and his group of buddies who do their best to survive the war, execute their missions, avoid their commanding officers, lay with hot nurses and escape vengeful widows of slain comrades. As the war progresses and their comrades are killed in bunches and spurts, the remainder find various ways to cope with the emotional loss and the inevitable sense of doom. They all want to go home alive; but the only way to go home alive is to fly a required number of bombing runs. But each bombing run exposes you to death from enemy fire. So here is the catch; fly your runs as quick as possible, hope you survive each one, so you can go home after the last one. Or, try to postpone each flight you have to take knowing that you will live longer in the short run, but also knowing that you eventually will have to fly them. The risk with the latter is that you might also get killed in other ways on the ground; example is Yosarian's friend - Hungry Joe who suffocates to death in his sleep because a cat slept on his face. In between the author shows in funny detail the life of soldiers, and those civilians who have to put up with them. The loss of life throughout the book keeps the tears flowing after you stop crying from the absurd comedy. This book is quite a classic of 20th century English literature, though it is probably not appropriate for anyone under high school."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is one of those rare books that absolutely everyone should read; I reccommend it unceasingly to anyone and everyone. Though it is long, it is very readable, and you'll probably go through it quickly because it's so entertaining. Aside from its sheer fun and humor however, is the true message behind the book. It is often cited as being one of the great ant-war novels - and, indeed, it is just about flawless in this respect - but it goes much deeper than that. Catch-22 is really a book about paradoxes, and the sheer (necessary) insanity of modern life. The title itself is now a common - and oft-heard - refrain in the English language, and many might be unaware of its original source. The dictionary defines &quot;Catch-22&quot; as &quot;a problematic situation for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule&quot; - and that is exactly what the novel presents: situations showing the sheer necessary insanity of modern life. (War is one such - perhaps the most obvious - instance, but there are many others. This book offers satire on other subjects as well - i.e., federal aid for farmers.) And could life as we know it exist without this inherent madness? The question might be a lot more difficult to answer than you think. The premise of this book can also be summed up in a phrase from another great author, Fyodor Dostoevsky, &quot;If everything on earth were rational, nothing would happen.&quot; That is what the book tries to say. It is not merely a simple anti-war book, despite what some shallow-headed readers and reviewers might say. I suggest that you read the book with an open mind: it's well worth it. The book is quite hilarous as well - the satire being very sharp-toothed. The book does not have a plot - indeed, it does not even attempt to tell a story, at least not in the usual sense. (Nearly) every chapter is named for a character in the book, and that chapter gradually portrays some of that particular character's crazy antics. Little bits of plot are glimpsed here and there, and then revealed gradually. The book is very non-linear and quite scattershot. It's similar to the way Kurt Vonnegut writes. I reccommend that everyone read this book. Quite aside from its near universal praise and the fact that an everyday word has sprung from it, it was in the Top 10 (#6, I believe) on New Modern Library's Top 100 Books of the 20th century. Put it on your reading list."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Heller's book has held such widespread acclaim that it's premise is actually considered a new word in the English Language. Catch-22 according to the dictionary is \\"a situation in which a desired outcome or solution is impossible to attain because of a set of inherently illogical rules or conditions.\\" Joseph Heller created the idiom and I believe its widespread use in the English-speaking world is proof that this book is genius. The books protagonist is named Yossarian and he is a bombardier during World War II. What is most baffling for Yossarian is that everyone is trying to kill him, people he knows and does not know personally - the Germans, the pilots that fly the planes, the Colonels that force him to be there.What's most baffling is that Yossarian cannot find a logical way to remove himself from the situation. The Doctors tell him that he may be grounded if he's crazy. If he continues to fly the missions he would be crazy, but if he asks the doctors to ground him for being crazy they could automatically deduct that he is quite sane and trying to preserve his life. That's the catch. Catch-22 - there is no possible situation that could work - a Lose vs. Lose circumstances.Lets just say that Heller thinks little of the situations that men and women must endure during their military careers during a time of war. The book is poignant, funny, and very readable. It's a long book, but I was sorry to see it end. For me - Yossarian will still live on and continue to persevere and fight against these Catch-22s! On a macro scale, we must ask ourselves why we glorify the victories (or losses) that our country undergoes during a time of war - have we won or have we lost the battle - or does it matter? Did we both lose? In other words, war is a Catch-22 - nobody wins. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"A true story:Some time ago, I was in the Marine Corps, scheduled for a deployment in Iraq. After six months of maddeningly boring pre-deployment \\"training\\", I had become somewhat scornful and skeptical of, not to mention endlessly disappointed, frustrated and disillusioned with, the military. All of this had me extremely depressed.During the few days of leave (just a few days; military policy is to give two weeks of leave, but we only got five days, and this is just one of the ways they screwed my unit over) between the end of the \\"training\\" and the movement to Iraq, I went to visit my brother.During the visit we happened to pass a bookstore, and he offered to buy me a copy of Catch-22. He thought I might identify with it. I replied that I was sure I would. I'd heard of the book, of course, but never read it, and figured that if it was as ingeniously satirical as everyone said, reading it at that point in my life might just drive me over the edge. I was afraid it would hit too close to home, and so I refused his generosity.I went to Iraq, which turned out to be even more maddening than the \\"training\\", stayed there for five months without incident, returned home and retired from the service just as soon as I could. And then I read Catch-22.As I was safely retired at that point, it didn't hit particularly close to home. It's well-written, and very effective in making its point. Unfortunately for me (and for any reader who has first-hand experience with the military) it's the most obvious point possible, and so most of the book's humor and absolutely all of its shock value are completely lost.In many instances the book is simply too true to be funny. There's hardly anything in it that didn't sound exactly like real life to me. Time after time, my reaction to the various absurd incidents of bureaucratic inertia, institutional asininity, and higher-up incompetence was a simple shrug. I'd seen it all myself, so why should Heller's fictive recounting of it seem like a revelation?"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"\\"Catch 22\\" is unlike any other book I've ever read. It is hilarious, absurd, shocking, disturbing, and one hell of a ride. I can understand why it holds such a place of high esteem in the canon of 20th Century Literature. The story revolves around John Yossarian, an American bombardier stationed on the island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean, during World War II. Yossarian no longer wants to fly missions, and attempts to find a way to get out of further bombing runs. The problem is catch-22, the unwritten, unofficial rule that states that an insane crewman can be grounded from missions, and a man who willingly continues to fly combat missions must be insane. However, if he makes the necessary formal request to stop flying such missions, the very act of filing the request proves that he is sane and, therefore, is ineligible to be grounded. Caught on this bureaucratic hook, Yossarian keeps flying missions while Colonel Cathcart, the squadron commander, keeps raising the number of missions the men must fly before they can go home. This is one of many bureaucratic absurdities that Yossarian encounters, and the ridiculousness of bureaucracy in war is one of the major themes in this book.Bureaucracy can create a unique type of madness in war. Trivialities (such as clerical errors) grow to be of extreme importance, while critical matters (matters of life and death) are marginalized. Soldiers are marched off to their doom with a false sense of duty, bravado, and patriotism, worrying about trivial matters, while giving no thought to survival. Yossarian labels this for what it is - insanity - and decides that to survive in an insane world, one must become insane. His insane survival techniques lead to some truly enlightening moments of lunacy, which are quite fun.The first half of \\"Catch 22\\" is biting, satirical, and has some truly hilarious moments. Heller uses slapstick humor and situations to get across the esprit de corps that soldiers in combat share. However, as the story progresses, it suddenly spirals from the comically absurd to the brutally cruel and irrational. In the last few chapters, the story takes a steep emotional drop that catches the reader by surprise, dragging them off a cliff into a dark emotional abyss. The story's sudden and abrupt turns to the cruelty, inhumanity, and unfairness of war is done in an understated manner which amplifies the irrationality of the situation. The reader comes away feeling the anguish and despair that Yossarian feels as his friends die, disappear, or commit atrocities abhorrent to Yossarian.Heller does an excellent job of communicating the inhumanity of war and the madness of bureaucracy in war. He shows that a bureaucracy, ran by cruel or insane men, can utterly destroy the rights of an individual, sometimes with the passive or active assistance of the individual themselves. The circular, non-linear story line is a little off-putting, but it allows for the reader to view situations from several different points of view which gives enhanced breadth and depth to the story."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Generally, when students recieve a list of books to read for school, they can expect to spend many nights toiling away at what teachers think is fine literature. I had no great expectations of Catch-22 when I bought it. I had chosen this book because I had heard the expression Catch-22 used before, and figured it must be somewhat intresting if it was a fairly common expression.The first two or three chapters went slowly like most books, somewhat difficult to understand why the Yossarian character was signing documents under other people's names. As the book progressed Joesph Heller becomes, in my mind one of the greatest comic geniuses of all time.Ever joke in this book is a long-running joke throughout the book. Everything that could go wrong does. The theory of Catch-22 is so realistic it is comical. The entire book shows the horror of war, but creates a laughable atmosphere about it. There are several dark, and even grusome scenes in this book, however Heller seems to take a comical approach to all of them starting jokes about them the next chapter. The jokes in this book never end, each joke is seen again and again, until the very humorous end.Don't be mistaken, although this book had me rolling on the floor laughing several times, it is also a great historical drama about life during World War 2 and the realism of fighting and Yossarian's fear of death for fighting something he doesn't belive in.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to all readers, as it is a Classic and is some of hte most enjoyable 400-something pages you'll read, more than likely, several times."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I rarely write a review, but the performance of Jay O. Sanders in Catch-22 Audio CD version is so impressive that I just have to.The book can not be an easy read. I don't think I would have gotten trough it. Some of Heller's chapters/paragraphs are intentionally repetitive although funny. Difficult to follow at times. But with the help of Sanders who manages to give the various characters distinct voices/intonations, it is so much more enjoyable. Amazing what a good actor can do.If you have trouble with the book - get the audio CD narrated by Sanders!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 delivers the tragic story of a wide variety of American soldiers during World War II in a way that is both heartbreaking and hilarious.Similar to the way that Catch-22 doubles back on itself, the book's dialogue is loaded with endless double entendres and a unique style of speaking I will call \\"catch talk.\\" Many of the men, such as Yossarian, Orr, and Natalie all have conversation riddled with sexual innuendo. Catch talk most commonly occurs when Yossarian is present. When his commanding officers become furious with him and they attempt to punish him, Yossarian suggests that in order to avoid making the company look like it has insubordinate members the officers should simply promote him. The officers quickly write the idea off as ludicrous and continue trying to find a punishment for him. Soon, however, they realize on their own that punishing Yossarian would look bad for the company. Then one of the officers comes up with the brilliant plan to simply promote him and make the entire company forget about the issue. Thus, catch talk occurs. One party begins the argument arguing one way, and the talk then deviates to something different, but then reverts back to the original statement. This style of speaking catches the readers' attention and creates something unique that the reader can identify about the book.Yossarian was one of the most original characters I have ever heard of. Playing the protagonist for a good portion of the book, he at times is also the antagonist, as he inhibits the goals of some of the other main characters. Similar to the looped idea of Catch-22, Yossarian can be quickly classified as one of the most insane people in the book (he curses himself for forgetting to bring his machine gun to the officer's club in order to massacre everyone). But on closer inspection, Yossarian is in fact one of the most sane people in the book. While all other officers act perfectly sane on the ground, they are considered insane because they ignore their instinct to survive in the air. Yossarian, on the other hand, acts insane while groundside but then is perfectly sane in the air. Everyone acts calm while flying, while Yossarian is panicky and wants nothing more than to get the hell out of the fight.With its unique conversations and the one-of-a-kind Yossarian, Catch-22 was a hilarious and tragic adventure that gives a unique perspective on the war."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is quite simply a fantastic book and a must read for anyone who appreciates modern classic fiction. Funny, insightful and tragic. The book begins in quite a funny manner as you begin to meet the characters, although one by one, tragedy befalls them and you can only smile at the sour irony of their situations. I personally likened it to the MASH TV series in many respects finding parallels between Yossarian, the main character of Catch 22 and Hawkeye from MASH. This is of course my own personal feeling and Im sure that people would be happy to point out many differences between the two characters."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Perhaps the greatest satire on war, \\"Catch-22\\" presents many characters with extraordinary personalities, the most important of whom is Yossarian. Witty and cunning, he constantly tries not to avoid being killed while serving his duty in WWII. He meets many people and goes trough many trials in this book. One such trial occurs very early in the book and uses the book's title phrase Yossarian finds a catch in the system that says that soldiers will be sent home who are crazy enough not to fly an airplane into combat. The doctor tells Yossarian that he must first tell him that he is crazy, and then must have someone vouch for his insanity.Yossarian assumes that he will be dismissed, but the Doc adds one more stipulation: if someone asks not to fly because they are crazy, they can't be crazy because anyone who doesn't want to die must be sane. This, Doc Daneeka notes, is a catch-22. The phrase \\"catch-22\\" now appears in the dictionary because of this book. If that fact does not suggest the importance of this book, I don't know what will.This book is funny from beginning to end. It shows a lighter side of war. Most books don't refer to the human struggle during wartime but \\"Catch-22\\" uses humor to show how the conflicts between one man and the solders fighting along side him affect him in war. This book will be able to make you laugh about some very serious issues that effected people during WWII."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"What is there to say about a book that so many before me have reviewed?

I don't care to pick at classics, so I won't. Should everyone read this book? Yes. Was it good? Yes, I would say 3.5 out of 5 stars.

It has lots of short stories that doesn't relate to any of the other stories and they are usually pretty boring. Third this is none sense. It doesn't have a major theme or anything and it's just talking about air force men being board of the war and just being crazy. It's like writing every detail of your every day life.

Heller is seemingly willing to expend untold pages of drivel to bring off a joke, as in how Major Major became Major Major Major.

Awful! While there are a few parts that are humorous, I thought the book as a whole was horribly tedious. If a student wrote a paper/essay like this he/she would get batted across the head. Verbosity reigns supreme in Heller's work, with tedium a close second. The attempts at humor are feeble. I suppose in the interest of being well-read it might behoove some to read it...certainly not for enjoyment. A shame really, because the basic premise is interesting and, yes, thought provoking. Perhaps I am in the minority, but I don't understand all the hype."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The emperor has no clothes, and Joseph Heller has no writing abilityI read this novel, all 42 chapters of it, for several reasons.1. Upon searching for the greatest novels of the 20th century Catch-22 was always either number 1 or number two. I guess it IS number two because this novel (If you can even call it that) was S**T! I rename it, Catch Number 22. Once I start a novel, I finish it.3. Because it's a \\"classic\\" I knew the pretentious fake fans would cry foul if I said I hated it yet never read past the 5th chapter, when i realized I was reading toxic waste.If you're truly honest with yourself you CAN NOT say this was a good book. It was not a novel as I already mentioned, but rather a patchwork of asinine conversations, adolescent meaningless humor and plain old pointless babble. Several hundred people gave his drivel 5 stars, while another 30 some-odd honest reviewers, both honest with themselves and with others, gave this one star. I wish I could have given -773 stars.At first I thought the novel, as many others are, was a slow starter. I thought the silly language would break and become...what's the word I'm looking for? GOOD!I have read the reviews of the 1 star voters and found myself nodding my head yes, and strangely, the reviews were better reading than the 430 something pages of garbage.I can agree with the reviewer who said the book was an insult to those who have fought in VERY meaningful wars, as my father did in WWII, the war the book is based on. I agree with the one who said this was a CHORE to read. I'm no Kim Peek when reading, but I'm no slowpoke either. This book took my 2 MONTHS to read. I read ONE chapter a day then would discard it for 2 or 3 days and pick it up again, I hated the sight of it and left it in the toilet where I usually read it, I thought it would be happiest in its natural habitat."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Sorry, people. For some reason this book has been branded a classic simply because...well, I'm not sure why frankly. The satire hits you over the head until you are dizzy (unfortunately not with laughter), the plot is cellophane thin, the message completely muddled. The book flows as smoothly as a trainwreck. There are some witty commentaries but overall don't believe the hype. This book is an outdated bore."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I read this book and all I can say is...it was simply a disappointment. I realize it was satirical...however the characters seemed 2 dimensional and unrealistic, and after a while there behavior and responses were so predictable, I soon lost interest and the book became a slog. I personally feel if Joseph Heller wrote it later on in life he would have had more life experiences to draw upon and could have written a much better novel."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"If I could, I would've given this book no stars at all.

But if I like it for being unlikeable am I actually liking it?Catch-22.The actor who read this audio edition did a fantastic job so it was easy to keep track of all the characters- and there are a ton of them- because he gave them perfect voices. really likeThe circular logic and story telling fit perfect with the catch-22 theme- a phrase coined by the author, btw. really likeThe portrayal of the abysmal lack of care for the individuals who were actually putting their lives at risk for- well, nothing really- made you just as frustrated as Yossarian. Flawlessly written. really likeEverything was a bureaucratic catch-22 for the lead character Yossarian and it was hilarious in its ridiculous logic. really likeEspecially because, more than anything, he wanted to stop seeing death all around him and that's all he ever saw. really like- but not because I liked what character was going thru. (Insert Top Catch-22 here.)The ending- had you cheering for the poor sap because finally, finally he was gonna find his freedom from the nightmare he was living, however odious it would be to a modern US military man. not sure what I think about that one- But in the end- gonna go with really liked.Finally, unless you have been in the military as an enlisted man, or worked in a cubicle, you wont get this book.

It was as good as the first time around.My favorite theme in the book is the \\"language/words theme,\\" all the incidences where characters' conversations turn out to be a catch-22.This is a serious story told with hilarious humor. I love the way the first 400 or so pages spiral you into the story; character by character, anecdote by anecdote, you slowly learn more, and you get closer to the \\"truth,\\" which is then revealed in the next 50 or so pages. Shocking, hilarious, brilliant. Still fresh."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book has been so thoroughly reviewed by so many but I just wanted to add my opinion as well. I was too young to read it in the 60s when it came out but I recently heard Joseph Heller's daughter being interviewed on Public Radio discussing the 50th anniversary of the publication and decided that I should certainly read this classic novel. I am so happy that I did! At first I was captured by the humor of the situation and Heller's hilarious and satirical description of life in the military in Italy during WWII but the further I read, the more horrified I became. The book is absolutely brilliant in that just beneath the humor is the absolute horror of war and military leaders who were completely incompetent and primarily concerned with their own private or hidden agendas. The book reminded me of M*A*S*H in many ways. I strongly recommend that anyone who has not done so already buy and read this book. This particular edition (The 50th Anniversary Edition) was epecially interesting as it had \\"The Story of Catch-22\\" in the back as well as excellent critiques by other writers in a section entitled \\"Other Voices.\\""},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Is there any book quite like this one?Catch-22\\" is my favorite novel. Of all time. To adapt an old saying, if an infinite number of monkeys were to type an infinite number of words for an infinite amount of time, THESE would be my favorite 170,000-odd words they could possibly type.There are other works that attempt to emulate this one, and many may receive some of the same adjectives when reviewed--zany, heartfelt, comic, tragic, classic, passionate, absurd, painful, hilarious--but, simply put, there is no book like this one.Even Joseph Heller couldn't escape his masterpiece. Though the author--a self-admited plodding writer--wrote several more novels, there was nothing to equal his triumph here. Such is the price of such an early tour de force.That said, \\"Catch-22\\" is certainly not for everyone. The novel is often...NON-SEQUENTIAL: It skips forward and backward in time (see \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\"), to great effect;VIOLENT: Occasionally extreme and shocking;BIZARRE: A captain named Major Major Major, for example;ILLOGICAL: Even if you discount \\"non-sequential\\" and \\"bizarre\\";ANTI-HEROIC: The protagonist cares for nothing more than his own skin;COUNTER-CULTURAL: The U.S. generals are painted as insane and vain, even bombing their own airport;ABSURDIST: A character stuffs his cheeks with crab apples, to name but one;TRAGIC: There are moments that left me tearful;HILARIOUS: Any sequence involving the phrase \\"Catch-22,\\" for instance;While all of the above is true--and perhaps because of it--there is no reading experience like this one. I read the novel when I was a high school sophomore, sometime around 1968, and in some ways liken the experience reading it to my sensations as I watched the movie \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\"--I might not have always understood what I just witnessed, but I knew it was unique, important, and transcended other works.There are some people I've met who have told me they would not read the book simply BECAUSE so many other people constantly reference it that they now believe themselves to be inured. I would liken these naysayers to those who avoid followers who continuously allude to, say, \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\\" tirelessly tryng to one-up fellow \\"Grail\\"-ers by quoting dialogue line-by-line. I, too, have been around those devotees when it comes to such works, patiently sitting by (or, I admit it, even joining in) while they quote this character or that scene with the reverence of the true disciple.But this is that kind of book, a watershed novel that pre-dated other great works of literature or movie or TV like, say, \\"M*A*S*H\\" or \\"Hitch-hiker's Guide\\" or \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" or \\"The Gone-Away World.\\" It is a truly great anti-war classic that reads like an amusement park thrill ride, ushering its reader on a cavalcade of experiences and emotions that should leave the appreciative breathless and angry and thrilled, but never apathetic.Like with any great work, the reader who finishes the book should find that his or her own understanding of the novel will vary from others', and I am willing to admit that some may not appreciate the work like, well, I do, but I would find it hard to believe that the book will not create in them a unique emotive experience. There is so much happening within this novel that any one aspect of it warrants investigation: the general who cares nothing for his men other than risking their lives to get his own praiseworthy article in the Saturday Evening Post; the officer-turned-capitalist who convinces the commanders to remove parachutes and replace them with IOUs, or replace food with cotton; the innocent young soldier who is willing to give up his life to save a cynical whore who cares nothing for him; the shy major who will only allow office visitors when he is anywhere but actually IN his office; the living doctor who has been declared dead and now walks around like a spectre; the pilot who continuously ditches his plane for practice...See? I'm doing it myself.Read this book. It is the one true classic that I can honestly say I have read and re-read and read again, and still hope I live long enough to read it twice more. It's that good."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is a marvelously written, inexhaustibly depicted, vividly portrayed, and sarcastically alluded novel that dazzles with mind-blowing vise and addictive charisma!I picked up this book in a bookstore by accident. Before I bought it, I only heard of this book somewhere too distant too recall. One day I was walking around a bookstore with a friend, and suddenly bumped into the title \\"Catch-22\\", and a comment saying that it is a good novel came up to me. I eventually bought the book out of that impulse.In fact, when I was reading the first few pages, I had a difficult time getting used to the atmosphere that was looming around all the characters in the book, as well as the general tone of absurdity that is everywhere, and the hilarious logic. However, once you get used to the tone and move on in the story, you will be exposed to a world of dark comedy and heart-breaking scenes.When I was reading the book, it was very common that one sentence can make you want to cry, laugh, fume and think at the same time. Jacob Howard has said that some literature scholars claimed that Joseph has \\"shouted\\" the words on the paper instead of \\"writing\\", this is an accolade in terms of the emotions that mingle across sentences in the novel. I feel that the the emotions have been woven so well across the entire world that is behind the words, that every single sentence, every single adjective, is powerful enough to pierce directly to your heart and touch the truest and purest materials there, and at the same time create the kind of resonance that make you unwilling to put the book down while pondering upon the meaningfulness of most of the stuff that are prevalent in today's world."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I picked this one up because I wanted something funny to read.

I won't go into details about the plot to avoid spoiling anything.I doubt this is even necessary, but I do feel that I need to warn some readers that this isn't a book for kids. It's about war and the army, and nothing is spared- death scenes, of which there are plenty, are gruesome and tragic. Prostitutes and loose women are extremely common topics. Lastly, war profiteering and betraying your own country in war for profit makes up a large part of the plot. This is all to say- 16+ at least.

It has a lot of dark humor but there are definitely moments that will have any person laughing very hard. There is a good deal if symbolism in this book as well, some very subtle others are in your face and it makes the book that much better. Even if you aren't looking for something so deep this book is still for you. Even taken at the most superficial level Catch 22 is a great read. It can make you cry, laugh hysterically, or become very angry. By the time I finished this book I loved all the characters. If you have seen the (somewhat) recently released movie just know the book is 1000 time better.

Set during World War !!, it combines eternal relevance, pathos and humor in the gripping story of a most interesting character."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The novel \\"Catch-22\\" was written by Joseph Heller to show how crazy the Air Force made people during World War Two. The characters are trapped in the Air Force by the catch known as Catch 22, it was meant to stop crazy people from compromising missions by preventing them from flying. What the catch really did was prevent anybody from being grounded (sent home). The catch works where if someone was crazy all they had to do was ask somebody to ground them, the only problem was that when they asked to be grounded the catch said that the person was no longer crazy and could not be grounded. This along with the number of required missions constantly being raised prevents anybody from leaving the Air Force. Being forced to stay takes its toll on the soldiers as they slowly lose morale and drift into madness. The main character, Yossarian, realizes that there is no escape other than death, which he, more than anyone, wants to avoid. This prompts him to plot how to avoid going on missions.Heller writes this story not in any particular chronological order, and instead connects the chapters at random in order to portray the insanity that the characters experience. The story is analogous to a jig-saw that is given ten pieces at a time. The reader must remember was has already been said and connect it to what has just been said. Heller's writing style of using a plethora of ironies and hyperboles adds to the satire of the book, which isn't so much satirizing WW2, but war in general. His way of writing the character's dialogue also contributed to the insanity that he was trying to portray. The characters speak in what feels like circles, where the character says what the last character said in a slightly different way. After a while of this, the conversation loses its original meaning and makes even the reader question his sanity. The novel effectively satirizes World War Two and possibly all other wars, and conveys themes of power in bureaucracy, the inevitability of death, and a loss of religion."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"For the price a very sweet deal. have had it for 2 months now and no problems. would buy again from this company"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is being used for an English lit course.

Oh yes, death. There's plenty of that amidst all the madness!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I loved Catch-22. There is so much greatness here, that it's hard to know where to begin. Many people have a hard time with the storytelling method that jumps back and forth into time. Everyone is used to books that move mostly from beginning to end, with ocassional \\"time jumps\\" only if the character POV changes. Heller uses a different organization method. He organizes by topic, and the narration is almost as if an interlocuter tosses out subjects and people to a war veteran and he tells everything he remembers about each one.I think Heller does this so that the reader doesn't focus on the \\"war events\\" such as battles and missions, but instead we focus on the personal stories and experiences of the different soldiers in Yossarian's bomb unit. The book is absurd from beginning to end. Of course, the absurdity of war, and the absurdity of cooperating with war, is the whole point. What's amazing is how Heller saw this on the heels of WW2, a conflict most people considered completely validated as a \\"just\\" war by Nazi atrocities. Catch-22 seems like the voice of Cassandra when we look at the American wars that followed.My favorite character of Catch-22 was Milo Minderbender, the 27-year old business prodigy whose antics seem perfectly applicable to today. I think Milo most compelling episode came when he contracted to bomb his own airbase, and everyone forgot their objections when he showed them how much profit he earned in the deal. The other Milo anecdote I truly loved is when he got mesmerized by cornering the Egyptian cotton market and ended up stuck with product he couldn't unload. Milo then tried to convince everyone in the unit that chocolate covered cotton was edible and that it was their duty to learn to like it.There is simply too much here to include in a short review. Do yourself a favor: read it, laugh, and read it again. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Read this book!I remember Catch-22 having a cult like following among my older siblings and their friends. Catch 22 seemed to have a wide influence in popular culture yet was not a best seller when it was first released. Heller's humourous war-time Kafkaesque nightmare retains its relevancy forty years on as a political and social commentary. No book has made me laugh and cringe so much at the same time.Technically, its probably not the best book I've read but probably one of the most important and influential.A must read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"So, here's the thing. I know this is supposed to be one of the seminal works of American literature, and blazingly funny to boot. And while I have no doubt Catch-22 will maintain its place in the canon regardless of anything I write, I found the whole thing quite tedious.Perhaps that was Heller's point: that war is tedious, that war doesn't make sense, that the only way for a soldier to survive a war with sanity intact is to develop a sense of the absurd and act on it. But after 144 pages, I knew I didn't care enough about Yossarian or any other character to follow the absurdity for another 300 pages.Thus, a two-star rating simply because I didn't care."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The ad in The New York Times for Joseph Heller's Catch-22 overpowered the eye, while the text overpowered the mind of its readers. The book revolves around one catch, Catch-22, which states, \\"a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he formally requests to be relieved proves that he is sane and cannot be relieved\\" (45). The catch changes meanings several times throughout the novel; but always clearly conveys the satirical tone of Heller's work.Heller, a bombardier during World War II himself, begins his novel with the main character, Yossarian, in the hospital. He had vowed not to fly any more combat missions. Readers are introduced to a variety of other characters: Orr, Yossarian's roommate; Clevinger, Dunbar, Havermeyer, other bombardiers; Doc Daneeka; Hungary Joe; Major Major, and many more. Each chapter focuses on a different character. The novel follows Yossarian on his combat missions, leaves in Rome, and stays in the hospital. Throughout, readers are told of Yossarian's fear.Heller's Catch-22 is worth the time to read. Heller clearly conveys the feeling bombardiers have during their combat missions.\\"There was no established procedure for evasive action. All you needed was fear, and Yossarian had plenty of that, more fear than Orr or Hungry Joe, more fear even than Dunbar, who had resigned himself submissively to the idea that he must die someday. Yossarian had not resigned himself to that idea, and he bolted for his life wildly on each mission the instant his bombs were away\\" (50).Seeing the machinery that could kill you at any second would take many hours of mental conditioning just being able to remain calm. No one would be able to get used to the flak. In a way the catch states that as long as soldier possesses fear, he is sane.Heller uses a disrupted stream of consciousness to help create his tone. The novel covers huge leaps of time. At one moment, the novel will be before a mission called Avignon, but suddenly will be right after Ferrara, a mission that happened long before Avignon. What one comes to realize is that the chronological order does not matter. The novel is more about the fear felt by the men and the different ways each man copes with fear. More importantly are the repeated images and concepts.Yossarian's fear never ends, which is why some of the imagines and concepts are repeated. One such image is the soldier in white. When Yossarian was in the hospital, a soldier was brought in during the night that had a complete body cast on. He later died of his injuries. As Yossarian's fear is always with him, so is the memory of the soldier in white. Yossarian could easily picture himself as having \\"two useless legs and two useless arms\\" (10). Yossarian did not appreciate the reminder of what could happen to him on any of his missions. Another repeated concept is the namesake of the novel, Catch-22. Catch-22 changes meanings throughout the novel. For Yossarian and the men, the meaning has already been stated. For the citizens of Rome, a city occupied by American troops, \\" \`Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing' \\" (407). Troops could evict people from their homes or force a restaurant to close and the Italians had to follow the orders, only because they could not stop the troops. What the men are afraid of changes for each man, but they are all afraid. Hungary Joe is afraid of going stateside, Nately of losing his beloved whore, and Yossarian of losing his life. Many repetitions appear in Heller's Catch-22, these are just two examples.Heller also portrays the fear felt by the men by telling the novel in a third-person point of view. When a reader only experiences one character's viewpoint, the reader can have difficulty judging what may be exaggerated or underestimated. With the third-person, readers enjoy objectivity. For instance, one could come to the conclusion that all of the soldiers are afraid. For example, Havermeyer is a bombardier that will fly in straight, drop his bombs, and fly out with little or no evasive maneuvering. However at La Spezia, an Italian port where the men encountered very heavy antiaircraft fire, \\"even Havermeyer resorted to the wildest evasive action he could command when he saw what a vast distance he had still to travel to escape\\" (375). Readers realize that the fear that Yossarian feels is universal. However, Yossarian is the prime example of what fear can drive a person to do.Yossarian is driven to many unusual actions because of his fear of dying. He pretended that he had a liver condition so as to stay in the hospital.\\"Yossarian ran right into the hospital, determined to remain there forever rather than fly one mission more than the thirty-two missions he had. Ten days after he changed his mind and came out, the colonel raised the missions to forty-five and Yossarian ran right back in, determined to remain in the hospital forever rather than fly one mission more than the six missions more he had just flown\\" (165).He also walked \\"backward with his gun on his hip and refused to fly any more missions\\" (392). Yossarian was willing to start injuring people from his company, just to keep from flying.Heller's novel, Catch-22, deserves its place as one of America's classic novels. The book explores the mentalities of the men putting their lives on the line for America. Heller's past influenced his writing of the book, and his use of several literary devices form his message. The catch is that people will take advantage of a person, just because that person cannot stop them. He was able to mold his novel into a classic by asking one question: what's the catch?"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The words I used to describe Catch-22 are bleak, black, and absurd. Heller's brand of absurdist humor creates some of the most poignant moments in literature and some of the most hilarious (there are many, many laugh out loud places here). It is basically the story of Yossarian, a bomber, in the closing months of World War II. He can't understand why thousands of people he hasn't met yet are trying to kill him. And it goes from there. Loaded with absurdist humor. It does turn darker towards the end. This is a very densely packed book, every page loaded with information. It's not a book you can lose concentration while reading. But it is well worth the time and energy it takes to read it. Definitely one of the best books ever written."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This dark comedy of World War Two takes place on the small island of Pianosa, off the coast of Italy. The main character, Yossarian, is an American bombardier, and like his squadron, spends much of his time either flying dangerous bombing runs over northern Italy, sleeping off his exuberances in Rome, or going on some hilarious comical escapade through which Heller is able to satirize the American military bureaucracy.At first glance (or the first reading), this novel appears to be a random collection of character sketches, loosely arranged around Yossarian and containing only confusingly humorous conversational drivel. But on the second reading, everything makes sense and it is possible to see how the comic absurdity changes from light and fun at the beginning into a dark and melancholy satire by the end of the novel.Joseph Heller first published this novel in 1961, and since then the phrase &quot;Catch-22&quot; has entered into the English language as a &quot;paradoxical problem or situation.&quot; In this book, Catch-22 is an obscure military regulation that allows for an illogical and absurd system to exist.Completely illogical logic and embarrassingly simple complexity await the individual who undertakes the reading of this excellent novel, which has become both an amusing comedy and a pensive tragedy at the same time.Bottom line? Catch-22 is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This uproarious satirical novel by Joseph Heller prompted me to think of Robert Crichton's 'The Secret Of Santa Vittoria', another novel blending WWII and comedy. Published in 1961, 'Catch-22' was the forerunner of Richard Hooker's 1968 novel, 'Mash: A Novel About Three Army Doctors'. It's not about Army Doctor's in Korea, but about Army Air Force pilots and bombardiers during WWII stationed on the small island of Pianosa, west of Italy. In order to understand the insanity of this story, the reader has to comprehend what Catch-22 means. In chapter five, Doc Daneeka explains to Yossarian ( main character ) and Orr, his roommate, why he can't ground them due to insanity: \\"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.\\"That's some catch, that catch-22,\\" he observed.\\"It's the best there is,\\" Doc Daneeka agreed.\\" This catch was why none of the bombing personnel were able to avoid flying mission after mission.The main character is Captain Yossarian, a bombardier who is convinced he is going to die on a mission. In chapter two, he explains to fellow officer, Clevinger why: \\"They're trying to kill me,\\" Yossarian told him calmly. \\"No one's trying to kill you,\\" Clevinger cried. \\"Then why are they shooting at me?\\" Yossarian asked. \\"They're shooting at everyone,\\" Clevinger answered. \\"They're trying to kill everyone.\\" \\"And what difference does that make?\\" Yossarian's fear of dying on a bombing raid was enhanced by his group commander, Colonel Cathcart. His lack of compassion was buoyed by his desire to be a general and more importantly, to be featured in 'The Saturday Evening Post'! If the Air Force wanted 40 missions before you could go home, the Colonel wanted 45. Every time someone came close to obtaining the target number of missions for being sent home, Colonel Cathcart raised the required number again. The Colonel is only one of the complex characters in this novel.I have many favorite characters and situations in this sometimes disturbing, but whimsical story. The first is Lt. Milo Minderbinder, the mess hall officer. From day one, he wheels and deals like no other war time entrepreneur. He gets away with his shenanigans by telling everyone that they have a share in his enterprises. In chapter 22, he explains his egg business: ...\\" I make a profit of three and a quarter cents an egg by selling them for four and a quarter cents an egg to the people in Malta I buy them from for seven cents an egg. Of course, I don't make the profit. The syndicate makes the profit. And everybody has a share.\\" He gets into so many businesses that he even deals with the Germans! In chapter 24, he takes a contract from the Germans to bomb his own base: \\"This time Milo had gone too far. Bombing his own men and planes was more than even the most phlegmatic observer could stomach, and it looked like the end for him...Milo was all washed up until he opened his books to the public and disclosed the tremendous profit he had made.\\" Then he says in the same chapter: \\"I'd like to see the government get out of war altogether and leave the whole field to private industry. \\"As the Milo character gets deeper into the book, it only gets more humorous.My second favorite is Major Major Major Major, the squadron commander, who looked like Henry Fonda! People who met him were always impressed by how unimpressive he was! In chapter nine, we learn: \\"With a little ingenuity and vision, he had made it all but impossible for anyone in the squadron to talk to him, which was just fine with everyone, he noticed, since no one wanted to talk to him anyway.\\" In chapter ten, we find that: \\"Major Major never sees anyone in his office while he's in his office.\\" But you can see him, if he is not in his office. If you try to barge into his tent, he goes out the window. I know it's confusing, but his first, middle and last name was Major, thus the four 'majors' when he got promoted to, you guessed it, Major.This book is a riot.My third favorite is Major-------de Coverley, Major Major Major Major's executive officer. Throughout the novel he has a blank for his first name. His function is uncertain at best. He basically pitches horseshoes all day, kidnaps Italian workers, and rents apartments for his men to use on rest leave. As soon as he hears of a city that the U.S.Army has captured, he's on his way there, usually at the head of the procession in a Jeep. No one ( friend, or foe ) knows who he is! But the reader knows that he is there just to rent apartments for his men. His picture appears in many publications, as if he is is leading the conquering army. I'm telling you this book is a gas.There are two subplots that are absolutely hysterical. The first involves the Chaplain's hostile assistant, Cpl. Whitcomb. The corporal comes up with the following generic condolence letter: \\"Dear Mrs., Mr., Miss, or Mr. And Mrs. Daneeka: Words cannot express the deep personal grief I experienced when your husband, son, father, or brother was killed, wounded, or reported missing in action.\\"This one was sent to Doc Daneeka's wife, even though the Doc wasn't dead. Col. Cathcart feels this letter will prove his concern for his men and finally get him in The Saturday Evening Post. He promotes Whitcomb to sergeant! The second subplot revolves around our hero, Yossarian. After Yossarian tells Lt. Nately's whore that Nately was killed in action, She tries to kill Yossarian and she relentlessly pursues him chapter, after chapter. Nobody knows why she wants to slay him, but it is funny.The reader will also meet: Chaplain Tappman, who is intimidated by everyone; Nurses Cramer and Duckett; Hungry Joe and his screaming nightmares; Chief White Halfoat, who knows he is going to die of pneumonia; Aarfy, the navigator; and Huple, the fifteen year old pilot, just to mention a few. How Joseph Heller kept track of all these characters is unbelievable.There is so much going on in this book that I had to take notes to remember who is who, and who did what.This is a great American classic and should be read by book lovers of all genres. The great American author Studs Terkel states in the \`other voices' section of this book: \\"You will meet in this astonishing novel, certainly one of the most original in years, madmen of every rank: Major Major Major, on whose unwilling frame the gold leaf is pinned because of his unfortunate resemblance to Henry Fonda; Doc Daneeka, who is declared dead despite his high temperature; Hungry Joe and his fistfights with Huple's cat; ex-pfc Wintergreen, who has more power than almost anybody.\\" Enough said?"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Heller's satiric tone is a refreshing break from most classical literature.

Belongs in the pantheon of American fiction - oh, wait, it already holds a place in that august company."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"First and foremost, Catch-22 is written in a circular fashion, often ignoring chronological order to aid in the atmosphere of apparent logical irrationality. Many a reader has been turned away by this lack of sensical ordering. However strive on, just as a CSI detective starts with only half the picture, as you travel through this book, all becomes clear.There are two different appeals to reading Catch-22. The first is the lighthearted satire, mayhaps similar to what many of us have found in the comic strip \\"Beetle Bailey\\". In fact, you could open this book up randomly to any page and sample the hilarity without embroiling yourself in an immense and thought-provoking novel.The other path is the hidden meaning which each and every one of the 50 odd characters portrays. The profound absurdity of war and the needs of the individual versus the needs of society are debated mercilessly. This book is not truly anti-war as the war itself often seems more of a backdrop to the main story, however Heller strives to emphasize the desires of the individual versus the greater payoff to society . The main character, Yossarian, desires the end of the WWII but not at the cost of his own life. The greater enemy of the novel is often not the Germans, but the bureaucracy of the American army or as Yossarian says, \\"The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on, and that includes Colonel Cathcart. And don't you forget that, because the longer you remember it, the longer you might live.\\""},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I almost didn't include this book in my reading list - thank goodness I did in the end!Although set during a war, the theme is about survival, insanity and humanity.The language is disturbingly funny and can drive anyone crazy.The story is not told chronologically, which makes it a slightly difficult read, but the book relies largely on its characters and the way that Heller sets it out presents better pictures of each character. At the beginning of the book we get the impression that everyone is crazy, Yossarian most of all. But as the story unfolds we realise that it's all just a hopeless attempt to survive the madness of their era, nobody is fool and least of all Yossarian.I'm currently reading it for the third time - definitely one of my favourite books now. The story may be too entangled to understand at first, but the characters come vividly to life and stay with you."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When I first picked up Catch-22, I expected to be bored to death by yet another long and dull novel about war. Within the first chapter, I was surprised to find that the book was funny in a darker and satirical way.At first I thought that this book was about the insanity of war and it's crazy bureaucracy, but upon further reflection I have found this novel to be more about moral decisions and ethics. Sure, Yossarian wanted to be sent home from the war, but he would not okay General Peckem's and Cathcart's theory that it is acceptable to continually raise the number of flight missions, which would endanger the lives of others in the squadron. This huge moral dilemma is the climax of the book, and when Yossarian makes the ethical choice and sacrifices his guaranteed safety for the overall good, the reader is left with a contented feeling.I am glad that I got the opportunity to read Catch-22. I strongly recommend the book to anyone and everyone who has the time to read and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Set in the closing months of WWII,Catch-22: A Novel (Simon & Schuster Classics)follows Yossarian, a bombardier who has decided that everyone is trying to kill him.This book is not just a military satire, it's focus is much bigger that that.

I had no idea what to expect when I picked up Heller's masterpiece and perhaps that was part of the wonderful-ness: it was a total surprise.

Heller keeps the plot, and storyline right above the surface of the pages. He has you learning of one character make reference to one you will learn of later in the book, or one you just passed. The satire is fulsome, and majestically original. The book refreshes the reader in a way very few books can. It is disconcerting when one realizes this is one of a kind. Authors should take a stab at further developing Mr. Heller's gift."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This was a very popular book when it first came out. Millions of copies were sold in the paperback version in the 1960s. There are a few different versions on the market. The present version has an introduction by the author in which he describes the process of getting the manuscript accepted for publication, and then he describes the first book reviews after it came out. It was his first novel and he received a $1500. advance. The book was written after he taught English composition at Penn. State and while he was working in the advertising business in New York City in the 1950s .When the book first appeared, the reviews were mixed. The Sunday Times, for example, thought that the book was far too \\"repetitious\\" and it lacked \\"craft and sensibility.\\" But a reviewer from the Herald tribune in New York thought it was \\"a wild, moving, shocking, hilarious, raging, exhilarating, giant roller coaster ride of a book.\\" Those two reviews summarize the basic traits of the book. I quote Joseph Heller himself who wrote a piece on the reviews in the introduction.The reviews were not unanimous because - and this is a simplification that I make here - this is not a novel in the purest sense as one might think of a novel such as Madame Bovary. It is not a well balanced work of art where one has a few strong characters and a strong plot. Rather, it is a wandering story or a series of short stories all linked by a common protagonist. The hero, Yossarian, is an air crew member in a bomber wing which is stationed off the coast of Italy during World War II. The book has a series of strong characters, all held together by a weak plot; it is a series of very funny portraits of various characters in the bomber wing. Each chapter is about a different member of the wing: various colonels, generals, fellow crew members, the chaplain, etc. It describes their actions, motivations, and inner thoughts.The book describes how they cope with the isolation, the pressures of war, and the ambitions of the regular officers, especially the colonels who want to become generals.So, this is a great piece of literature but perhaps not the great American novel. It took Joseph Heller about 8 years to write this story of World War II, and we assume that he has drawn on his knowledge of the bomber wing from his own time in the air-force. It is irreverent humor which leaves the reader laughing out loud on many occasions during the read.The only other similar book that I have read is Slaughterhouse Five, but the present work is much longer and more complex than that book.This is an interesting and entertaining read that can be read in a day or two."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Every superlative has been attached to this great satirical piece -- masterpiece, laugh out loud hilarious, enormously funny, original genius, devestatingly witty, terrifyingly insightful, etc, etc. This one of a kind book deserves all these tags.A novel of WWII bomber crews, it is all about war and people in general, with all their foibles and quirks.

It's well worth your time to read it if you haven't and reread it if it's been a while.The brilliance of the book, in my opinion, is that it maintains several themes strongly through sarcasm. Reading the novel feels like watching a M*A*S*H marathon, that's high praise in my book.Power designs itself to remain in power and greed is the ultimate excuse for any crime. Those out of power can be trampled upon and abused and killed so long as it's done in the name of greed - and that doesn't even need to be disguised. And, the sad part is that it's all true. There isn't any truth in this book that's less relevant today than when it was written 40 years ago.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 is a satirical masterpiece of 5 central themes: insanity, the brutality of war, free will versus determinism, moral debasement, and death. Each character is a unique archetype that embodies a supporting idea. The ideas include the cyclic run of Catch 22, the absurdity of a non-sequitir world, the ridicule pinned on sychophants, hypocrites, the sexually imprisoned, the logical lapses of high military officials, the religious officials that lose faith, all of which culminate in a heap of drama, irony, humour, and social commentary.Another key idea at the crux of the novel is time. One of the reasons that I was able to enjoy reading the novel after already having read it before was the complex chronological structure. The novel is not chronologically consistent in any pattern: it isn't written from beginning to end, vice versa, nor in media res. Rather, time is jumbled in a mess, which enhances the entire effect of life under Catch 22: and confusing, helpless mess.The novel is also held together by black humour. Heller pokes fun at many areas in the microcosmic story that are inherently not funny at all. With skill and genius, the novel is a work that discusses grave topics in a manner that is light yet effective, humourous but poignant.I was at Barnes and Nobles just yesterday and Catch 22 had the center poster spread. Like, omg."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Throughout Catch - 22, Joseph Heller utilizes diction and irony to satirize the inner workings of the Armed Forces. By exercising his command of the English language, Heller comically portrays the Army in a way that makes the reader just have to laugh. The easiest examples of this comedy are some of the names the characters in the novel receive. The character Major ------- de Coverley is a symbol for the lengths the military will go to simply keep a secret, no matter how unimportant it may be. Throughout the entire novel Heller never once tells the reader de Coverley's first name. Another character that further illuminates the problems that plague the Army is Major Major Major. When this character enrolls in the Armed Forces, he serves as a symbol of how the military promotes it's soldiers, not by merit, but simply because the &quot;bigwigs&quot; feel like promoting someone. By promoting Major Major Major to a Major from a Private simply because some General thinks that it sounds good, creates a ridiculous situation that enables the reader to laugh at the Army that created it. Aside from his excellent word choice, Heller fills Catch - 22 with massive amounts of irony to instill in the reader a sense of hilarity toward the Armed Forces. When Yossarian is attending a question and answer session he and some other pilots as questions that have no answers such as &quot;Why is Hitler?&quot; This leads Colonel Korn to ironically proclaim that the only people who can ask questions are the people who never ask questions. Soon after, because no one was asking questions, the classes where considered worthless because Colonel Korn did not consider it necessary to try and educate people who never questioned anything. This shows how the Army will do something so stupid as give Colonel Korn orders, which achieve nothing, and call this a success. Also when Yossarian is sick in the hospital, the army makes him switch beds because the family of a man who just died has arrived and want to see him. Now, instead of telling the family that their son is dead already, they tell Yossarian to play along. But when the family comes to talk to him, Yossarian doesn't tell them that he's their son, he tells them that his name is Yossarian not Guiseppe. Normally people would think that perhaps they have the wrong person, but they persevere and take it in stride that he claims his name is Yossarian. The brother constantly reminds them that Yossarian is Yossarian but the parents don't listen because don't think that the army would lie to them, and yet in reality it did. Another good example of irony is when Doc Daneeka dies. On paper it shows that Daneeka was supposed to be in the plane that crashed, so Sergeant Knight assumes Daneeka is dead. Yet, when the doctor protests to Knight that he's alive, Knight just ignores him because he knows Daneeka is dead regardless of what Daneeka himself says. Here Heller is making fun of how the Army deals with people strictly on paper and not as the people who they really are. Another example of this is when Yossarian sits in the hospital bed with the wrong nametag, because he wants to sit next to his friend Dunbar. After extensive talks with a psychiatrist, Yossarian is ruled to be insane, and is to be sent home. But because of the wrong nametag and the fact the Army deals with people on paper, the person who's name is on Yossarian's nametag is sent home while Yossarian, the one who actually is crazy, is made to stay and continue fighting. To show the corruption of the Army, Heller uses situation irony when Milo Minderbinder bombs his own squadron for a profit. Now instead of being punished like the reader would normally think he would be, Milo is congratulated on how much money he made because all the bigwigs get a portion of the profits that Milo makes. By his word choice and hilarious irony, Heller creates a comedic atmosphere perfect for his satirical portrayal of the Army."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Most people claim this book is a &quot;war novel&quot;. However, like Apocalypse Now, war is merely the setting. This book is about life. More importantly, the &quot;absurdity of life&quot; as someone has said. After reading this book, I began to see through the &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot; of society. An excellent piece of literature. You'll be better off for having read it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"In &quot;Catch-22&quot;, Joseph Heller paints an incredibly ludicrous, and simultaneously realistic, view of one man against the military-industrial complex. His writing style is difficult to get accustomed to, however once the reader starts thinking like Yossarian, every page is a welcome adventure. Joseph Heller weaves his tale with great skill, taking the reader from ironic situations so funny you *will* laugh out loud, to mind-numbing tragedy on the same page. My personal favorite? Colonel Cathcart, and his 'feathers in his cap' and 'black eyes'. I recommend this novel to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor, rest assured you will have your eyes opened."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 lays out an entirely radical yet competent way of explaining war, or rather, of explaining the inexplicability of war. Portrayed through confusion and satire, Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is simultaneously humourous and cutting. Given to similarly amusing and sickening, Heller says all there is to say about the insanity and inhumanity of war.Catch-22 opens during World War II with John Yossarian, a bomber in the Air Force, most fixedly in the hospital with liver problems. However, Yossarian is not actually sick, but is feinting disease to isolate himself from the death of war. A naturally high temperature leads doctors to believe Yossarian is sick when he is not. When Yossarian finally leaves the hospital and goes back to his unit, he finds himself stationed on the island of Pianosa, near the Italian coast and the Mediterranean Sea. It is not clear whether the hospital scene comes before after the next part Yossarian narrates, because his narrative jumps back and forth through time. It is part of the confusion which controls the reader's perception of the nonsensicality of war. Out of the hospital, it seems like nobody seems to truly understand that there is a war going on except for Yossarian. In fact, Yossarian is so set on the death involved with war that he believes that everyone is trying to kill him specifically. He finds it infuriating that &quot;millions of people&quot; are trying to kill for no fault of his own. As he says in an argument with Clevinger about the pointlessness and misdirection of war, &quot;The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.&quot; In this perception, Yossarian is unique and practical, decisively demanding that his life is more important than national ideals or abstract principles. He is completely determined to gain immortality or die trying. The largest perceived threat on Yossarian's life at the moment is his air missions, and so attempts to find a way to be grounded. Yossarian asks Doc Daneeka if he would be grounded if he were found to be crazy. Daneeka tells him yes, but there's a catch: Catch-22 says that there's a rule that says for any pilot to be grounded for reasons of insanity must first ask to be grounded. However, anyone who asks to be grounded must obviously be sane. This is Yossarian's first encounter with Catch-22, but it comes back to meet him and others again and again. The most poignant description of Catch-22 is given near the end of the book by an old woman mourning in the ruins of what was once a city. She sums it up by saying that &quot;[The soldiers] have the right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.&quot; This is portrayed through every bureaucratic move throughout the entire novel. Higher ranking officers do things to their subordinates simply because they can, or because they believe it will give them a good reputation or promotion. Yossarian and his companions are simply inhuman resources for their blindly ambitious superior officers to take advantage of. Their officers would rather their men took pictures of their bombing runs that looked impressive rather than actually accomplish anything. On top of this, the men can never leave, because higher ranking officials simply raise the number of missions they are required to run before leaving. In this way, all the men are retained within the authorities control. All this is done simply because they can. Because &quot;they have the right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.&quot; Catch-22 is, in essence, the law that makes war and murder &quot;legal,&quot; the mind-set that moralizes any immoral act, the entire mechanism under which the army can feasiblely run. Without Catch-22, war could not exist, because of morals, values, ethics, individualism, and anything else that governs rational human thought.A perfect example of the completely nonsensical nature of the surroundings is the power positions. In this story, the mess officer Milo Minderbinder is the one of the most powerful people in the world. He has such a hold on economics that he practically control the entire world. He bombs his own camp as a result of a deal with Germany, he employs the use of every air force in the world for his monetary benefit. Because he controls so much of the market, he manages to buy a shipment of eggs at 7 cents an egg and sell them at 5 cents an egg and still make a profit. He manages this because he is in control of both the company which buys the eggs and the company which sells them. Through subtle and ridiculous manipulation of the market, he probably has more control than any other person in the world.In sharp contrast to this whimsical, comic nature of Milo is the gory, reoccurring scene of Snowden. Yossarian began his downward spiral into cynicism with the death of his copilot Snowden. Throughout the novel, the story slow unwinds of the traumatic experience of Snowden being shot while with Yossarian, and Snowden dying slowly in Yossarian's arms with his entrails splattered all over Yossarian's uniform. Snowden's final words were simply &quot;I'm cold.&quot;Catch-22 is, in my opinion, one of the greatest books written on the insanity of war. The mechanisms Heller uses in his novel to portray confusion which may be hindrances only enhance the entire read of the novel. While many war stories manage to encompass the horror and meaninglessness of war, few if any other manage to do so with so much wit and humour. Nothing is more sickening then to find yourself emotionally connecting the horrible death of a human being with the abstract orders of an ambitious power seeker. Heller's story of the pursuit of life and the tragedy of death finds both the core values and issues at and, as well as the humour and insanity forever present in that never-ending reality: war."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is simply the funniest book ever written. It is, in places, a deeply dark satire of the futility of war; where the lives of ordinary men are risked for the unattainable ideals and pointless pursuits of others. The reason that this book is so impossible to put down is that one moment it will have you rolling on the floor in laughing hysterically and the next crying uncontrollably over the tradgedy of the characters' situation. If I could only own one book, it would unquestionably be this one. If you read it once you'll read it a thousand times. Buy, read, enjoy.

It's an allegorical critique of Capitalism and the whole Western system. In the twilight of socialism that has descended since the fall of Communism, the book's critique seems unduly harsh, but the warning message is worth remembering.What is &quot;Catch-22?&quot; There are at least a dozen examples in the book, and seem very difffernt. What they have in common is that each one is really saying &quot;the rules of the system prevent reform of the system.&quot; Examples include &quot;you can only enter the Major's office when he isn't in it,&quot; and &quot;you can get out of the war if you're crazy, but if you ASK, it proves you're not crazy.&quot;Milo, the arch Capitalist, is in many ways the worst villain in the book. Milo traffics with the enemy, steals medical supplies (leaving his worthless IOU), and even contracts to bomb his own side. The corruption of Milo's money reaches far up the chain of command, and many of the worst absurdities are tracable to Milo's schemes.The only way around the system is to break the rules -- to overthrow it. The new recruits who throw out the personal effects of the dead man in Yossarian's tent show how in a small way; Orr demonstrates it in a large way, and the fact that Orr ends up in Sweden points to socialism as a solution to the problems of the capitalist world.Obviously, in today's world, the example of Sweden doesn't look so appealing, and the Capitalist West has shown substantial ability to reform itself inside its own rules. Still, the book is a great read, and the lesson is worth learning, if only as an example of what we have avoided -- and need to continue to avoid."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22, which, Shakespeare-like, added a new word to the language, is a funny book on one level, but not so funny when viewed from a different angle. Many reviews and opinions of this book mention the phrases &quot;anti-war&quot; and &quot;pacifist&quot;. I do not see anti-war sentiment in this novel (a la Johnny Got His Gun or All Quiet on the Western Front)- rather, I see a criticism of the military itself. While the doings of Milo, Cathcart, Major Major, etc. are a bit exaggerated, they simply reflect common procedure not just in the service, but in any large bureaucratic organization... think about your own work experiences!I found the book to be a bit tedious near the end (the whole incident with Nately's whore and after); it is almost as if Heller was afraid to go &quot;all the way&quot; with the experimentally hilarious style which carries the book up until that point, and settled for a more traditional ending.

So I do. Every time life gets to be too much, I follow Heller's advice and run straight for the solacing lunacy of Yossarian &amp; Co.

It is so entertaining and so moving that you, like me, may return to the first page right after you finish."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 was easily one of the greatest masterpieces I've had the enjoyment of reading. The book will make you laugh, cry, and make you eager to read on. Of course though this book along with every other book imaginable isn't for every audience out there. For one thing veterans are sure as hell to hate it since the whole book makes a mockery of the military, and I also feel that people who are acute to profanity and sexual situations [are there such people?] wouldn't like to read this book. Young people such as myself are sure to love the book though; if they like to read to begin with. On a final note, I'd also like to say that Yossarian's cynicism reminds me very much of the character Holden Caulfield, the boy from the story The Catcher in the Rye (which is another one of my personal favorites). To those people who've read CITR then Catch-22 is for you."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"To the reader from main Street USA (who I strongly suspect either didn't read the book, or didn't understand it)1 - The Military IS evil - though not neccesarily the individuals within it.2 - not evertone in the military is an idiot - just the ones that aren't evil3 - Not everyone who mocks the military is heroic - but anyone who does it as well as Heller (or Yossarian, if you like) certainly isthe reason you hate this book is because you and your philosphy are its targets. I am sure Heller would hate a reactionary idiot like you to like the book. if you did, he'd have got something wrong."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Who needs plot when you have plenty of fascinating characters and plenty of examples of wry humor. So this book didn't have a regular plot. If it did, Heller wouldn't have been able to show the aspects of his characters and the scenes that he did. This book was a successful blend of comedy and life lessons. People complain about not agreeing with the theme of the novel. Which theme? There was more than one. Depending how you looked at this novel, you would come away with many new outlooks on life, or disappointed because you only found one theme and disagreed with it. Heller's writing style is unique and clever. Buy this book. Don't listen to the people who hated it, or the people who loved it like me. Read the book and draw your own conclusions. (One thing is for sure, as long as you keep an open mind, you'll love it.) Now go read this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 is quite simply one of the best books I have ever written. Each character is as normal as he is insane. While the way the book is written might take a while to get used to after about 50 pages any reader will be captivated. The story while a satire really makes you think about the whole idea of war in general as being honorable yet insane at the same time. For while it seems honorable on the surface to fight for what is right everyone's life is at least somewhat driven by self motivation and survival. After reading &quot;Catch 22&quot; you will view the world and everyone around you differently. For &quot;Catch 22&quot; while fictional often seems all too real."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The characters are all exciting to read about.

The novel through juxtaposition conveys the madness of war and illuminates yossarians battle about who is the enemy, the people shooting at his plane or the people who keep sending him out into the face of danger. Heller has captured not only one mans reaction to a war but a whole host of characters and how they individually deal with a war situation. the book also covers topics of propoganda, neo-liberal reforms, madness and sexual starvation and its effects. this is a book i would recommend to anyone who has a taste for confusing humour."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Sorry. I didn't like it. I tried to read it for school and found it incredibly hard to get through. The writing is bad and the jokes are not that funny.

Buy it and let Joseph Heller surprise you with his weird and wonderful way of writing."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is quite possibly the best book that I have ever read. Heller's first novel isn't a classic because it's old or the dying fart of some well-respected author--its a classic because its hilarious and at the same time dark, because its meaningful and at the same time completely irrational. Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy fans rejoice, because this is the book that sired it. This is what black humor ought to be--and frankly, everyone who's read this book knows it! It's zany, its fun, but its also worth your time. Catch-22 turns life--and war--inside out and laughs at it. Its philosophy: \\"to live forever or die trying\\"! Read it; you couldn't possibly be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"What more can be said about &quot;Catch-22?&quot; It's one of those classics that is such a staple, you grow up with it as a part of the cultural fabric. As a student of literature and culture, I think it's an absolutely brilliant satire; as a sarcastic person with an odd sense of humor, I find it immensely pleasurable to read and re-read. The first time around, it can seem pointlessly bizarre, and it's easy to lose sight of the fact that satire is an extremely difficult genre to pull off well. And &quot;Catch-22&quot; pretty much wrote the book (no pun intended) on satire. What's frightening is how prescient it is, how uncomfortably close to truth satire is. Re-reading &quot;Catch 22&quot; during the war with Iraq is a supremely creepy experience. But I guess that speaks to how important it is as a work of literature. If you haven't read it, you should. If you have, you should read it again."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch22 is the phrase used to describe the ironic paradoxical injustices that all humans must face. This is one of those books that hold a faint prestige for the reader, like upon finishing it, they enter a secret club, the catch22 club! You start to see Clevingers and Milos and Major Major Major's (who happens to be my favourite character!) everywhere.I know some people who think that this book makes the world and humanity ugly, but I think that's just cos the book has opened their eyes to the ironic injustices of the world for the first time. I think it makes the world beautiful, because all the characters, even the slimiest of them, are struggling so hard for what they want against all those ironic injustices, Captain Black to prove Major Major is a communist, Yossarian to get out of the army, Milo to make as much money as possible. And the basic innocence that all these characters have is the only reason why they can do the terrible things they do. Milo getting paid by the germans to bomb his own camp, CHief White Halfoat threatening Flume's life for a joke but causing Flume to live in eternal fear, every man who killed another in WW2, every man who ran the other way in fear for his life. It's a homage to humanity's innocence. The whole book says to me, \\"Look at all the horror and terror we are capable of, yet look at our frailty and stupidity, and beneath it all, a tenacity to keep going.\\" This book doesn't make light of war, it vindicates humanity of war.Anyway of course there are many other aspects to the book, its one of those books that can mean many things to the reader.Also an interesting thing to add, apparently \\"MASH\\" was based on this book. Although MASH is not nearly as dark, it still has many of the bsic themes and foible-filled characters."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It's just one of those books you don't want to put down. I'm real picky when it comes to books catching my interest, but this book made me laugh so hard on so many different occasions that it seemed like an episode of Seinfeld. I've never ever laughed out loud at a book until this one. I highly recommend this and can't wait to read the sequel Closing Time."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 is a book about a great American bomb squadron during World War II. The book is about what it is like to be an American pilot in another country during the war. Yossarian, who is the main character of the book, is basically a very crazy person just because of all the experiences he has had with war. He has seen so many of his friend die that he does not want to fly on any other missions because he thinks that he will die. He is very nervous as to what will happen in the future, so he basically goes into the hospital so he does not have to go on any other missions. One of the main problems is that the number of required missions keeps getting raised, which means for him that he will be stuck there until he gets them done, but he does not want to go on another mission and refuses.During the book, Yossarian comes up with many plans to help him get out of the war and to get back home. All of the plans that he makes up, always get destroyed because of catch 22. Catch 22 is a kind of statement or rule that the men in the war have come up with for certain circumstances they are put under. Every time he tries to get out of the war, there is always someone or something that is stopping him, and that is the catch. Eventually toward the end of the book, some of the higher ranked men ask him to fly the less dangerous missions, and they will have other men fly the dangerous ones in his place. He still disagrees with this because he does not want the men to be put in a spot where they see the same that he has seen. This is Yossarians main problem in the book. He wants to save all of the men in the war from dying or from seeing the horrible sights of the war that he has seen. This would mean that in order for Yossarian to save the men is for him to fly the dangerous missions. Every time he flies the missions, he is getting more insane because he is putting himself in the places that the other men would die in. This for him is self sacrifice, and that is what is making him so insane throughout the book.During the book, Joseph Heller, the author, does a great job in explaining the circumstances and events that happen in war. He does a very great job in describing all of the characters and how they all feel. He also relates all of the feelings of the characters, to the real life feelings that people would have while in war. The main theme of the story is that Yossarian has to sacrifice himself in order to save the other men in the war. This is the problem, because it makes him more insane throughout the book, but in order for him to save the men, he is forced to choose one of the two things that are put in front of him, and that is the catch. Throughout the book overall, Yossarian has himself caught between two things that are both bad for him. So overall, the theme of this book gives a good idea as to what can happen to a man that is put in the horrible consequences of war. I think that the overall book is very well written, because the author can make the reader feel sad about the war one minute, and happy about it the next, and that is what is so great about the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Craig LeamanCatch-22Catch-22 shows many things that relate to isolation because the people I the book are always arguing with each other and never give anyone on the same squadron the right support they need. But the funny thing is they get by because they know that they are going to have to live with each other for a while, which leads to a state of depression in the squadron.But the only thing that Yossarian wants to do is get out of the military and go home. Yossarian gets very angry with people because he doesn't want anyone bugging him because he is a man that likes to be alone and stay in his own world which is shown by isolation. A sign of isolation shown on this book is when Yossarian always has some sort of problem with himself. This is shown by isolation because he is a man that is very lonely and wants to get out the military. Catch-22 makes Yossarian feel very depressed because the military always bumps up the missions needed to leave the base. So Yossarian always goes off on his own because he knows that he will be there for a while.Another sign of isolationism is when all the people in the book become incoherent because they are unsure of what to do to make themselves get along with one another. This is isolationism because they take it out on other people while making themselves feel bad about how they are going to live the rest of their lives and at the same time taking their problems out on other people.I believe this book should be read because it offers a lot of action and humor. The men in the squadron are always fighting with each other but somehow they always seem to pull it off and get along in the end. It also offers a lot of drama because when Yossarian's roommate dies many people are effected by it and don't know how to deal with it. But at time the book can be boring because it rambles on about describing when Clevenger says how Yossarain is crazy. It goes on for about a page and a half. That is the only boring part of the book. All round I thought it was a book that offered a lot of information on what war life was like at that time."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"\\"My military experience was beneficial and enjoyable, almost entirely. Even those last missions when I was scared stiff became a rich experience because they were suspense. It was not boring.\\"(Joseph Heller) Heller's experience is part of what enriched Catch-22's exceptional portrayal of World War II and Yossarian. Catch-22 was meant as a classic from the time it was published. Describing the corruption of society through the main character's, Yossarian's, experience in World War II. The in-depth analysis of peoples' view of gain for only themselves made Catch-22 destined for success from the very beginning.The story is that of a bomber pilot, Yossarian, who endures the hardships of fighting the war. He must deal with the superior offices constantly raising the required number of missions each man must fly to be sent home whenever he is close to release. He must also live with the men in his squadron dying left and right which is his greatest let-down.But, finally he has a chance to escape. After flying 71 missions and seeing all his friends die in combat he refuses to fly. This invokes a deal from his commanding officers since he is causing such a problem among the rest of the men fighting. All he must do is like his commanding officers and he can be sent home a hero. Yossarian agrees to this but deep down he disapproves. As he walks off though he is stabbed and is brought to the hospital where he discovers his only surviving friend is in Sweden. He then sets his mind to leave his troubles and find his friend, Orr, in Sweden.Catch-22 is a terrific work for how it unmasks the corruption of society. Constantly, Yossarian notices the people around him seeking their own personal gain. Colonel Cathcart, raises the number of missions, endangering and enraging his own men, just to make his squadron look good. Milo, the mess hall officer, is always making deals on the black market and even goes to the length of bombing his own men to make some money. At the conclusion of the book, when Major Danby cried, \\"Jump!'&#65533; Yossarian jumped. Nately's whore was hiding just outside the door. The knife came down, missing him by inches, and he took off.\\"(463) When Yossarian jumped he obeyed his instincts which showed a change in his attitude toward the world in the rest of the book.This book is excellent for the revealing of peoples' intentions. The numerous encounters with corruption Yossarian experienced made this reviewer think how many of those similar situations exist today. After reading Catch-22 it is a wonder how this society does not fall apart though the vivid explanations the book puts out for the readers. Now, however, this reader has gained a greater appreciation for analyzing the situations he comes across."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I'm hesitant to call this book an anti-war novel. I think that's too simple of a generalization for a novel that deserves a much more in-depth look. For me, Catch-22 in about the human condition which leads us to experience fear, selfishness, anger, anguish, loneliness, pain, and every other imaginable emotion. I think the greatest thing about this novel is that Heller, in about 90% of the novel, seems unconcerned with passing judgement and instead chooses to give us the raw reality of these characters and lets the rest be decided by the reader.Heller creates a chaotic athmosphere filled by exotic characters that are never censored. The narrative is consistently odd but it never seems to stray too far from its purpose, or plot. The first three quarters of the book are hillarious, followed by a somber, pensative tone completely brutal and unforgiving. You don't realize how quickly it goes from a satirical, cynical place to a completely harsh reality. The transition is amazing and the result a complete shock to the reader.This is a wonderful piece of literature. Heller lets his characters speak for themselves and he lets their actions create the moral statements of the novel. That in itself is a huge accomplishment.This is a great book regarldess of your view on war."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is a great peice of literature. Filled with wit, humor, and sadness it makes reading about such a terrible thing like war enjoyable. Reading about Yossarian and company's journey trough World War II was slow at some points, but I am glad that I forced myself through these moments and read on. It picks up twards the end and makes for a great read. I was forced to read a novel for a high school project, but I am glad that I picked up this book, it does not only tell about the war, but it takes you through a great story at the same time. It shows the courage of Yossarian and others as they fly in and out of dangerous mission day in and day out. Anyone who liks books about war is sure to love this novel, it truly is a great book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is a great book that should be re-read annually. It is a mordant and sarcastic black comedy that shows the folly of war and the foibles of that most bureaucratic institution of all, the U.S. military. In this time of a never-ending &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;, this is a book that should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I read this book as an assigned novel in high school, around 27 years ago. I tried and tried to get into it, but couldn't get past the first chapter.Face it, the first chapter ain't the best in the book. The first two people we meet are the Texan and the Soldier in White. The dullest people in the book--the soldier in white, by definition!One day, I had an essay due on Catch-22. I'd cribbed most of the contents from other sources, but needed a few quotes to add credibility and bulk. So I opened the book somewhere in the middle and started to read at random. I think the chapter I picked was the one about Milo. And I was hooked. I found several quotes, submitted the essay, and returned eagerly to the text to read the rest for my own satisfaction.Maybe all of you who find Heller's narrative structure disjointed should do the same. Or simply treat the whole thing like a book of essays and read them at random, saving the one in which Nately dies for last, naturally. (It's labelled \\"Nately\\", BTW)Isn't it funny? After all these years I can still remember all the characters, many of the jokes, and can certainly remember the point.

Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"As a member of the \\"Viet Nam\\" generation who never went to war, I can understand how I might have thought this book was \\"Right On !\\" 40 years ago ... if I had read it back then.But, I only got around to reading it last month at age 60, and I have to say, it left me rather cold and unimpressed.My Dad was a B-25 pilot in WWII flying missions overseas. He was in pretty much the same situation as the characters in \\"Catch-22\\".Over the years, he has provided me with many insights that have helped me understand what it was like. He has both humorous anecdotes about military inefficiency and tales of what it's like to fly over enemy territory while people on the ground are trying to kill you.Absolutely nothing he has ever told me gives me any indication that the fictional situation described in the novel \\"Catch-22\\" is anything other than extreme exaggeration for the purpose of making a point.Of course, the point the Joseph Heller is making is valid at a certain level.But, his heavy-handed way of telling his story is so completely over-the-top that it just sort of misses the mark in my opinion and because he is so willing to hammer his point home in such a fashion, he compromises his credibility."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I was always told that this book was the ultimate in tongue-in-cheek humor. Unfortunately, although I found parts of the book both insightful and funny, it came across as rather dated. Perhaps with the growth of a more sophisticated and subtle approach to this genre of humor, Catch-22 is showing its age. Quite frankly, I got more out of watching re-runs of MASH (which probably has some of its roots in this book) then from reading this narrative. The fact that it doesn't have much of a plot adds to the frustration. A good read to get the sense of the time in which the book was written but, overall, old hat."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I first read Catch-22 in high school, and ever since have held it to be my all-time favorite book. So it was with some trepidation that I cracked it back open as an adult. Would it hold up? Thankfully, it did more than hold up; it turns out that it's even better than I remember. It's not just Heller's brilliant, through the looking glass logic that makes Catch-22 so remarkable, even though that logic leads to innumerable laugh-out-loud hilarious passages and too many brilliant sequences to count (my personal favorite may always be the sudden moaning outbreak). Had the book merely been a brilliant and hilarious piece of satire, I would have enjoyed it, but it wouldn't be the classic that it is. What makes Catch-22 absolutely unforgettable is the deep layer of melancholy and rage that underlies the satire and drives the book. I've always held that one of the hardest things to do in any medium is mix genres, and I'm always impressed when someone does it well. In Catch-22, Heller mixes drama, comedy, romance, and war story together without even blinking, and slides so effortlessly between them that you go from laughing to horror in the blink of an eye. It's this juxtapositioning that gives the book so much of its power - the transition, for instance, from Yossarian's insane arguing with Danby to the horrific fate of poor, doomed Snowden remains one of the most effective and haunting passages of any book I have ever read. There has never been another book like Catch-22 - even Heller never wrote anything this brilliant again (although Something Happened is a minor gem of an altogether different sort). But given how incredible this book is - how funny, how touching, how haunting, how powerful, how brilliant - who can complain? With its spectacular and wonderful set of characters, its trenchant and hilarious take on the military mind, and Heller's masterful writing, Catch-22 remains the finest book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 was unique among the other World War II novels that I have read. The characters, such as Yossarian, Milo and Major Major Major were quirky and satirical and, though many aspects of the story relating to World War II were embellished and fictionalized, Joseph Heller was still able to convey a powerful message; war is illogical and absurd. Heller's style of writing often seemed unstructured and many of the events that took place made no logical sense. Milo, in his enterprise which played a large role in the novel, was able to buy goods and then sell them for less money but still make a profit. The preposterousness of this situation reflected Heller's overall message about war; war is illogical.Though Heller used satire and humor to describe a very grim time, he successfully conveyed a sense of hopelessness and despair in the men fighting the war. Yossarian, the protagonist of the story, remained positive throughout but because of his repeated flashbacks to the death of one of his comrades, Snowden, we see that beneath Yossarian's upbeat exterior, he was in fact severely traumatized. In one of the final chapters of the novel, Heller vividly described Snowden's death. Because this was such a sharp contrast to the prevailing satirical tone of the novel, this scene becomes much more powerful and imbued a sense of utter despair.Although I found most of the characters and many parts of the book humorous, I also found the book long winded. The book was often repetitive and, though this was done intentionally to be humorous, I became bored with the book. Also, I found some of the dialogue very confusing. Overall, Catch-22 was intriguing but did not capture my attention."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 was written before MASH became a TV show.

Indeed, Yossarian lives!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is the definitive modern satire and deals with all of our society's 'pet themes' like racism, human idiosyncrasy, the horror of war, bureaucratic obtuseness and imprisoned lives. The distinguishing feature of this novel however is how much FUN it is to read: a pleasure from the first chapter to the last. Heller's caustic, poignant humor had me chuckling at least once per page throughout, something no other book has ever done for me. The acumen he displays in exposing our often circular reasoning was particularly memorable and is immortalized in the phrase Catch-22.The book is far from a technical masterpiece - it is certainly not written in iambic pentameter - but the simple, lucid style and accessible register facilitates the progression of the story perfectly. As Albert Einstein said &quot;Things should be as simple as possible - but not any simpler&quot; and Heller honours this axiom very well. The only &quot;difficult&quot; element of style is the non-chronological plot structure, which can be confusing at times. Yet, even this serves a purpose, that is, to create an atmosphere of confusion that adds to the overall effect the novel has on the reader.The delightful entertainment value of Catch-22 is an essential element of, and adds greatly to, its central virtue: the satiric exposure of human inadequacies. However much fun the novel is to read it remains a social commentary that - below the surface - is as frightening as any Stephen King novel. Heller strips reality bare, eliminating the hue of our opinions, the bells-and-whistles and comforting rationalizations; forcing the reader to look at the world - and himself - impartially. Pablo Picasso once said that &quot;Art is a lie that makes us see the truth&quot;, and Heller's artistic masterpiece shows us that reality is more frightening than fiction and after reading this novel I'm sure you'd agree."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book can be difficult to read because it is filled with humor. You will constantly be rereading paragraphs to make sure you read correctly. Heller will show you some of the silliness of humanity and western culture.

Heller's text of Catch-22 is a recipe for delicious humor and refreshing insight that make the bitter pills he's pushing down your throat slide down so much more smoothly, almost too easily. As an author, Heller will not rest until you, as the reader, are his equal as a cynic. He pulls it off masterfully, too, his persuasion of patriots into perversion of their most beloved creeds, his destruction of the reader's regard for respected traditions and accepted notions about America. Through the words of the brash, self-centered Captain Yossarian as well as the from the perch of omniscient narrator, Heller tells it like it is (says he). The world is a petty place, and survival is job one. That Yossarian, as the antihero, would shamelessly sabotage the arrangement of a dangerous support mission rather than risk his neck to help out others reflects a Darwinian influence that resounds without compassion. &quot;The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on,&quot; rants Yossarian as he argues with the overly intellectual Clevinger. Yossarian displays no qualms as he announces, with conviction, &quot;It doesn't make a damned bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead.&quot; What makes Heller's work in this novel so excellent is the fact although his ideas are morally bankrupt and bleak, he masks their horrid faces masterfully with his ingenious strokes of hilarity. The outstanding comedy put forth by Catch-22 is surely enough proof that Joseph Heller is none other than the Devil. And we should all love him for it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Book Description The novel Catch-22 shows a unique view of World War II. The Story is told in third person and focuses on a colorful character named Yossarian. It takes place in Italy during WWII. The men in the squadron attempt to do their missions and survive. However they keep getting caught in absurd rules that present a no-win situation. The story unfold turning from hilarious comedy to a serious plot. The book is very entertaining as the men try to beat the bureaucratic military system.Review Catch-22 provides extreme entertainment and with a wonderful plot and hilarious comedy. It is a classic satire. It provides a new point of view for war, showing the craziness and absurdities of war. The book starts off being kind of hard to follow with Heller's unique use of paradoxes and oxymoron's. That plus the fact that the story is not told in chronological order makes it a little rough at first. However once into the book it is one of the best books ever written.Catch-22 is a set of rules that the men in the airforce have to follow. At first some of them are confusing and contradicting, but once the reader has a feeling for the style it becomes funny. Everything contradicting everything else the characters soon go crazy. If one wishes to find out what a catch-22 really is then should read this awesome book by Joseph Heller."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Ignore the length of this big book -- it's like a series of wacky SNL skits fused with a morbid and very cynical worldview, and it goes by very quickly...."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"&quot;Catch-22&quot; is a work of unquestionable brilliance. That said, there are many reasons why you may not want to read it. First, if you have succumbed to the mass-market myth that all good pieces of fiction must have a contrived, cookie cutter plot, which yanks whatever characters therein around like chess-pieces, this is not for you. Second, if you have a short attention span and prefer to read fiction that skims along at reckless speeds and never dips below the surface of anything, this is also not the book for you. Finally, if you think that all fiction should be filled with ridiculous gravity and straight-faced stupidity and don't understand the concept of satire, this book should be avoided at all cost.If you do not fall into one of the above categories - READ THIS BOOK! It will be one of the most delightful experiences of your life. It is a long book and effort is definitely required to read it, but &quot;Catch-22&quot; rewards ever ounce of effort. Almost every page is packed with a new, fresh and challenging scenario, one which tackles the issues Heller deals with head on. The beauty of Heller's razor sharp wit is that it cuts down the very heart of the matter, clears away the distortions of emotion and preconcieved opinion, bringing everything into perfect focus.This is no normal piece of fiction. Many of the characters are faceless and nameless, puppets playing their role in Heller's elaborate production. They are symbols, as are the sometimes fantastic setting and always fantastic scenarios. That is Heller's point. He had no interest in writing a typical piece of fiction, the kind that could be easy consumed, digested and disposed of. This is a book that takes control of you and doesn't let go, not even after you've put it down. This is a true original, a true work of art."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I've read a lot of books, and i must admit that this is the best one! I just finished this book 10 minutes ago, and i know i will read it again numerious times!

I wasn't able to guess the ending of the book until the very last sentense. Even second to last sentense makes it feel totally different."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Heller's book is unique. It's funny. It's sad and terrible. His vocabulary is huge. The man can write. His story moves. The characters are insane and know it, at least some of them. Yossarrin is the real rebel without a cause. I really enjoyed this book and wholly recommend it for those willing to give peace a chance."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I have to say that of all the fiction books I have read, this is quite probably the best. The quirky logic and pacifist bias appeals to my sense of humour very much. This, combined with the strong feel of madness and nonsense, combines to make a literary work of art. The theme of madness can be well illustrated by Milo's (the fictional mess officer) syndicate, which seems to make a profit while somehow taking terrible losses. I must object to M. Besselink's view, although we are all entitled to our own opinions, but I think that this is a novel that cannot be read if you are not ready for it. Many people will dismiss it as ridiculous and over-complicated - they ought not to read it, as such genius should not be scorned. A must read on the basis that it is a modern literary classic, and will remain so as long as we retain the military and armed conflicts exist."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is truely a wonderful book.

You have to read it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I don't know what took me so long to read this. It's been on my must-read list for years now. It's a comic, tragic, disturbing, stream-of-consciousness comment not only on military life, but on humanity.

Not that I have any real expereince with the problems covered in this book, being only 14, but I do appreciate its wry and exitentialist views, which tend to lighten even the darkest scenes (especially the last few chapters in hte book) with its juxtapositioning and genius at its utmost highest. Well, there is my opinion, little good it will do the potential buyer, but I still hope that someone reads this and realizes what a wondrous book this is, and that they should read the book for the sheer humanity that you can extract from it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I was looking at the past reviews of this book, interested to see the expected raves but more interesting was the critics of this book, yes it is anti war..but in a tongue in cheek way a soldier would see war. The politics that send him to fight another are soon forgotten in a battle or the bordom of a war... he will hate his leaders who are keeping him away from his loved ones, soldiers in a drawn out war loose the first excitment of this adventure, they see dead and the horrors of war. The characters who are tied up in this insanity see nothing of the big picture, only their daily dramas, they have the right to think all is insane.So this book reflects this, it shows how us normal people survive in a very unusual situation."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"In today's society, the term catch-22 has become a cliche, however, when reading the novel, one becomes more aware of its true meaning and the desperate situation in puts many pilots, such as Yossarian in.Heller's novel Catch-22 is a satircal comedy about world war II in which Yossarian, the main character, is frustrated because people he hasn't met keep trying to kill him while he is bombing their town. Although the plot sounds a little odd, Heller ties together stories of pilots in Yossarian's squadron into his own life to allow his readers to realize that war is truly a horrible thing.Catch-22 is a satire in that not only is it funny and ironic, but the situations presented are exaggerated, though not made up. From Milo Minderbender's philosphy of &quot;everybody has a share&quot; to Cathcart's attempt to avoid religion and God in prayers, readers will find themselves laughing, a little shocked, and touched.I highly recommend this novel not just for war novel readers, but for everyone who is interested in reading a novel truly worth the time."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"THE cleverest book EVER written.

In my bookcase by an alphabetical coincidence Heller is next to Hasek and it has always seemed to me to be a very appropriate pairing: John Yossarian and Jozef Svejk, the two great antiheroes of the 20th century, both gamely trying to stay alive despite the best efforts of boneheaded superiors to kill them for the greater glory of whatever the cause du jour is. For those who dont like the narrative style I suggest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms, which is easier to read and is also antiwar; for those who don't like the politics of Catch-22, well, what can I say? You either get the joke or you don't. There is a word for people like you: Nately&quot;How old are you? &quot;I'll be 20 next July,&quot; Nately said. &quot;If you live,&quot; the old man said.

So then I found it on Kindle and finally I had the chance to read it. I admit I chose it because I'd heard so much about it, though I'd never read critiques, so I didn't know the specifics. I just knew it was famous. And, well, I guess it was a good thing that I didn't know anything about its plot because it blew me away. For one thing, I never thought it was going to be this funny. Heller takes absurdity and ridicule to hilarious levels. This books manages to break your heart, lift your spirits, and keep you in stitches, sometimes all of the above within two or three consecutive pages.The plot is haphazard but it keeps coming back to major points: a little detail that may seem absurd crops up later as a pivotal moment.The serious side of it, on the other hand, left me thinking about the ridiculousness of war (yes, even WWII) and how certain aspects of it keep coming up every time men take up arms against their contemporaries. For example, the opportunistic, greedy characters with little or no scruples and the soldiers who end up being heroes even though their actions were inspired by nothing other than pure cowardice. Many people have come out against this book, calling it anti-war, but I think it opens up a different perspective and it makes you stop and think about how much mere accidents play into what the government tries to sell us as well-thought out strategies.Heller raises absurdity to the level of art. I highly recommend this book if you want to laugh out loud and be moved."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When I read this book I was rolling with laughter at the sardonic wit that infused it.

Unfortunately his best hope is proving that he's crazy - but no-one crazy would want out of the army right? Catch-22!The novel is pretty heavy going, given the prose is like endless catch-22 jokes, and Heller has fun throwing the timeline around, frequently jumping out of scenes and scrambling the book almost beyond anything close to linear. Things get a little easier after page 200, and around page 400 we finally get chapters that stick to one time segment...Heller doesn't bother with typical plot-drivers like understandable/likeable characters, and has no compunction about driving his creations from the heights of euphoria to the deepest pits of despair.Surprisingly in amongst this mess, are some of the most vivid enthralling scenes I've ever read, especially the climatic flight scene towards the end, and I almost wonder if the intention of the novel is to build up to Heller showing off his literary skills for this one moment.Of course there is meaning to this novel - aside from mocking the military, Heller comments on human nature, particularly our contrary natures.

I'm not some pacifist, violence is evil type of drum beater. Sometimes violence is necessary. Far too often, however, even with the best surface intentions, the machine of bureaucratic incompetence enters the fray, and makes everything both surrealistic, and incomprehensible. This book points that out. It doesn't find fault with the ongoing war, per se, just with the way it is run. At the same time, it brings up plenty of intriguing questions. The sharp witted protagonist,Yossarian, time and again points out the futility of trying to argue with any single minded authority figures. Sad, serious, and hilarious, all at the same time.

Although many say that the book's dark humor and existential discussions of the absurdity and cruelty of war have been surpassed by other subsequent works by new writers, I still believe all the others merely stand on Joseph Heller's achievements.

The \\"serious\\" sections about Yossarian's bombings and the precariousness of life are can't-put-down passages, often moving.Heller really shines when his novel asks who, exactly, is \\"crazy.\\" Is it Yossarian, the WWII bombardier whose antics (such as running around naked for days after a comrade's death) and determination to \\"save\\" his life make him crazy in the eyes of everybody else? Or is it everybody else, who seem startled and even repulsed by the idea that it's obscene to die at the hands of people who don't know you, for the whims of officials who also don't know you, for a cause that can't be even vaguely defined?Overall I thought Catch-22 was full of original comic asides even as it gives a suspenseful, yet disjointed, narrative. It puts across a potent message about our tendency to \\"just go with\\" things we really shouldn't put stock in.Complaints: Even though I know Catch-22's length is probably a satire of the idea that novels can capture real life's complexity, that doesn't really compensate for the fact that the novel really IS bloated. Heller uses three adjectives and an adverb for everything: \\"A lissome, blond, sinuous girl with lovely legs and honey-colored skin laid herself out contentedly on the arm of the old man's chair and began molesting his pale, angular, dissolute face languidly and coquettishly.\\" That sentence has thirty-four words and, incredibly, at least twelve of them are modifiers. There are many like it. Also, Heller has a jarring habit of using the word \\"obsequious\\" quite frequently.Sometimes the novel's sentences swelled to such lengths (and with so few commas) that I found it difficult to absorb any information at all. For example, see Chapter 23's eight-line, paragraph-long first sentence.Oddly enough, I thought Milo (who is apparently a much admired and thought-about character among Catch-22 enthusiasts) was very boring and flat. I dreaded the chapters that gave gratuitous attention to his enterprise. My favorite characters were the doctors, who seem irritated and perplexed just because people get sick.My last nitpick is my feeling that Heller stopped short with his ideas about pain in the novel. I'm certain he was a very intelligent man, so I don't know why he railed so much against God permitting suffering when it's fairly obvious that unpleasant experiences often form (and better) people more than pleasure does.

It had an incredible affect on me. It is incredibly funny, yet very sad in parts. Especially for example when you do finally find out what happened to the gunner, Snowden, in the mission to Avignon. Or when Yossarian walks through Rome.The ideas concerning the ridiculuous nature of war are as topical now as they were in the 1960s. Actually, of course, Joseph Heller's presentation of the insanity around him predated the Vietnam War, and I wasn't around at that time to truly judge the feeling then.The dialogue is laugh-out-loud funny at times, as is the juxtapostion of events, as for example when Clevinger complains of confusing cause-and-effect in staring at the bomb-line on the map south of Bologna, willing the line to move itself and for the squadron to not have to fly the mission. In fact, the whole chapter in which this incident occurs, \\"Bologna\\" was the funniest in the book for me, with the rain beating down and the mission continually cancelled, Chief Whitehalfoat stealing a jeep to drive home, and Yossarian telling his pilot to turn around. And then, of course, Bologna was a milk-run; no glue gun there.Anyone who has not read this book and is mystified by what is going on at the moment and since 2003 should read this book. It's not going to change the world, but it is food for thought.Also highly recommended are the next two of Joseph Heller's novels, \\"Something Happened\\" and \\"Good as Gold.\\""},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Other people have written much better, and more detailed, reviews of this book, but its true hilarity and power (which I have heard is quite different than the movie, which I've never seen so can't comment on) simply need to be experienced.

The plot takes place in the heat of World War II on the small island of Pianosa, which is eight miles south of Elba. It follows the journey of an American bomber Yossarian, who is encroaching upon the first of his middle-aged years. The story introduces a myriad of characters that very much influence and have the ability to control the fate of the many bombers including Yossarian. In an attempt to escape this unappealing and rather petrifying fate, which is known to be Yossarian's \\"journey\\", the protagonist matures as a character that will eventually escape a catch-22 with the last sentence.The novel, which was filled with irony, spoke brutally honest words, which in different circumstances would have been considered taboo. \\"...A world boiling in chaos in which everything was in proper order\\" (154) is one of many instances where Heller's ability to successfully bring together two words of opposite meaning is displayed. Joseph Heller is a literary genius whose novel will never age with time."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This didn't live up to my hopes re-reading it twenty years on from the first time - but that's not too surprising given how I relished it then. I suppose much of the pleasure was in how much it shocked and stung - something it's not going to do twice. It's hardly a book that needs any more discussion, so this is more just logging my response. Catch 22 was a wonderful foil to the stiff-upper lip jingoism of so much war literature and cinema, and Heller hilariously pilloried the dubious and at times absurd morality of the military. However this isn't just for laughs - we're not talking Hogan's Heroes farce or McHale's Navy peacetime shenanigans - the humour is as black as it comes. Just as you're wetting yourself laughing at something ridiculous part of you realises this is too close to reality, and the guys falling down dead aren't just cartoons.This book just overflows with manic wit while managing to powerfully confront some big establishment issues. Unfortunately the next book I tracked down of Heller's, Something Happened, was just an embittered humourless mess. Somehow the same apparent lack of discipline enhances Catch 22.A tricky thing these days, but may you come to this wonderful book without any prior knowledge or expectations."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Jay O.

From the sociopathic commanders to the stupidity of the mission requirements increasing endlessly and unnecessarily, all of the hilarious absurdities cataloged in this novel are daily realities for anyone involved in the military. Well, they WOULD be hilarious if they were mere fiction."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Being that I like to read, and am often looking for new books to read, I became interested in Catch-22. This is probably because it's considered by many to be one of the greatest books of the 20th century. So I went and grabbed a copy from a local used book store, and took a look at the back and the inside and read many great reviews calling the book \\"entertaining and hilarious\\" and that it portrayed \\"a strong, heartfelt message\\". Naturally, I thought it would be great.Dead f***ing wrong. This book is absolutely awful. Not only is it horrifically boring, but it's downright annoying. The lack of a real storyline alone makes it unreadable in my opinion, but as if that weren't enough, there's more to this piece of crap that just makes it torture to read. It's plagued with horrible, repetitive dialog and ridiculous characters (that I guess is supposed to be humorous) that makes you want to skip to the last chapter to see how this abomination of the English language ends. The book also has a few running jokes that make you want to stick a fork in your eye. A perfect example: the main character, John Yossarian, is always saying that millions of people are trying to kill him. Oh, I get it. Because he's in the Allied forces, the Axis forces are trying to kill him. Kind of amusing, right? Not after he says it twenty times. Also, there's a character named Major Major Major Major. Hilarious.And I'm sorry, but I think the message of the book has not really aged well. War is Hell? What? I had no idea! (Sarcasm). And even if the message of a book hasn't aged well, that doesn't make the book bad. An example of this would be Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, another satire that takes place in WWII. Again, the message is a bit dated, but at least that book is well written and entertaining. Not only that, but the message is supported by a first-hand account of the bombing of Dresden, one of the most horrible events of the war in Europe. In Catch-22, the anti-war message is backed up by five hundred pages of a lazy air-force captain complaining.So overall, this book is garbage.*Warning. Contains spoilers*And just one more thing, I hate the ending. He decides that he won't endorse a statement that the pilots need to fly eighty missions in exchange for a trip home because it puts his fellow pilots in danger. On his missions he drops bombs willy-nilly. Yeah. That doesn't put anyone innocent in danger or anything. Hypocrite."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"With the United States currently in a position of faltering patriotism, Catch 22 was a very difficult book to read. I felt that it transcended time boundaries, and the horror of war that Heller effectively described in World War II could be held applicable to the current situation our country is in. Through humor and circular logic, Heller accurately portrays the concept behind Catch 22 as not just being a military law, but how those with power can justify their actions over the powerless. Each character Heller introduces to the reader is easy to relate to, for each represents a different type of conflict that each individual undergoes in his or her life. Milo Minderbinder's character represents the temptation of big business and profit which still drives and corrupts people to this very day. The chaplain, representing the loss of religious faith when faced with the hard circumstances of life and war, relates to many people in their questioning of a God in the midst of hatred, terrorism, and useless death. Colonel Cathcart, representing corrupt military and governmental bureaucracy, is a portrayal of how many people in life desire to uphold their status and power at the expense of those below them in the social ladder. Lastly there is Yossarian, a character portrayed by Heller to be both crazy and pitiable, is motivated in his actions solely by his longing to survive and his right to life.What impressed me the most about this book was Heller's complicated writing style which was in itself a tool to portray to the reader the ridiculousness of the whole justification and reason behind the concept of Catch 22. Whereas Heller uses the military law prohibiting bombardiers from avoiding flying combat missions as the actual embodiment of the Catch 22 trap, Heller's haphazard writing style and interaction between characters is a Catch 22 in itself. In this way, Heller makes Catch 22 extend beyond the war to apply to life itself, and the traps that we encounter in our journey to save ourselves amidst tough circumstances.Heller succeeds tremendously in giving a moving portrayal of the atrocities of war while maintaining a humorous and satirical tone. The reader will go through ups and downs, from laughing at the ridiculous dialogue between characters to being shocked by the useless death of many of the characters due to the inevitable death occurring in war. Though I was confused most of the time through the circular logic Heller portrays throughout the novel to emphasize the trapping quality of Catch 22, at the end of the book I was horrified and moved by how World War II can destroy people's lives."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Anybody mind if I break up the love-fest for this piece of anti-establishment drivel?

It's for people who just say &quot;War is bad&quot; without really thinking about why it's bad.The book is basically Dilbert in World War II. As in the comic strip, all the people in charge are unbelievably stupid, don't care about the people they command, and are extremely selfish. The common soldiers are of course much smarter than the commanding officers and try their hardest to get out of work. Their unwillingness to fight is justified (by the book, anyway) because their commanders are just so evil and stupid. Everyone's behavior is cartoonish and annoying.This edition of the book includes a preface by the author in which he, instead of saying anything useful, writes mostly about how everyone thinks his book is wonderful. Well, it's not."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joesph Heller goes about the business of numerical postulating and rehashing. I see nothing artful or original in a soldier who sees twice but rather it is repetitive for the sake of it and J.D. Salinger quite easily trumps this banal device, and Heller's entire novel, in \\"For Esm&eacute; - with Love and Squalor.\\" So, it is clear: this brief short story encapsulates the entirety of WWII. As a point of comparison, Norman Mailer's, \\"The Naked and the Dead\\" is made a collection of typed pages best left beside the typewriter.The author's story line is transparent, in a bad way, and any attempt at exposing the mystery of the military man's psyche is telegraphed by Heller, the beginning and end become the same. Catch-22 is rather about smoke and mirrors, a second-rate magician's parlor tricks. It is conceptually weakened by the over arcing, anti-finessed characters. Each goes about with a sledge hammer banging out Joesph Heller's ideology, an artificial artifice. It would never be published today by a known house and caught in his own 22, Heller would, need do and left to, the self-publishing ocean of unread authors.Chris Roberts"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I forced myself through one hundred pages of this book and then I stopped.

Gather round muggles and read this review, or else the person that you've been dating will leave you for that professional football player and your parents and/or children will disown you and you'll be forced to live in the basement with that balding, 43 year old starwars geek. Catch-22 is about John Yossarian. He's an American soldier during WWII. However, don't mistake this book for your average war literature, because it's not. This book is CrAzY! From the get-go, you'll be confused. Not because you can't read but because the book isn't in chronological order, which gives the impression that Joseph Heller was having a seizure while writing this book and the editors didn't catch it. In my humble, yet clearly superior, opinion, this book is far too long and filled with meaningless content. There are some very important lessons to learn from the book, unfortunately, the book puts you to sleep before it can convey the moral of the story. You need to be some mythical, god-like English teacher to be able to finish this book without throwing it at the wall in frustration. The characters are insane, so insane that, at one point, I was actually wishing the German bombed the crap out of Yossarian and those around him. The book is funny. However, you need to be clinically insane to get most of the jokes, sadly, contrary to popular belief, I am not. Every time I read a piece of comedy from this book, the scene from Napolean Dynamite would flash in my head, where Napolean would slap someone on the cheek and run away. It's funny but after a while it gets old and feels as though you're being slapped on the cheek, which isn't fun at all. The humor fails to salvage this poor book and only hard-core literature analyzers will appreciate it and call it a work of art. I say pass this book up and read that Harry Potter book again for the 34th time."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The story of Catch-22 is a story unlike most war stories. With new characterization in every chapter, a different type of story is created that is unlike any other. If I were to rate this story though, I would give it a \\"1\\" for being the worst book I have ever read. The story of Catch-22 lacks major elements needed in a story to make that story exciting and understandable.The story is about a bombardier named Yossarian who is serving in World War II at a station in Pianosa,Italy.The character of Yossarian is uncaring and selfish, and all he cares about is being able to go home to America when he completes all his missions.Another thing is that all the conversations in the story tried to make all the characters seem funny, but actually I think it made the book more boring.All the other characters in the story also are very much like Yossarian in the same respect.I thought this was an unengaging book with all its unimportant conversations and description of characters with no plot.Also, the unintelligent and nasty characters added to the pain.I could barely even read the book because it bored me to death.This book should not be a classic #1 bestseller, but the worst and most pointless book of all time."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is without a doubt the best book I've ever read.

I really don't know what changed between my first and second starts, but having finished the book, I can count myself one of the countless under its spell. Right now I consider this the best book I've ever read: the off-beat humor sometimes caught me off guard with inconspicuous deftness, the characters are worth knowing, the poignance worth experiencing. Perhaps it's close to my own world-view (read: left-field and cynical). But I urge you to give it a try (or two).I'm always absurdly curious why someone differs in opinion from me, but those who panned this tremendous novel never bothered to state more than their (by itself insignificant) dissatisfaction.

Heller mixes vivid scenes of slapstick comedy with genuinely shocking incidents without the usual jarring that is found whenever an inexperienced author attempts the same.Heller's real accomplishment is his cast of characters. Most authors just stick with one or two central characters, but Heller gives us a whole battalion of men, each with individual weaknesses and strengths. Also, unlike so many other war stories, this is truly memorable - for years afterwards you'll recall with a smile Milo's impossibly complicated scams, Natley's desperate search for his whore and Yossarian's wry outlook on life.In fact, there are only two problems with this book: firstly, as the book draws to a close, Heller appears to be in a desperate rush to get rid of his characters (presumably so that when Yossarian attempts his final escape, there's not that much tying him back). Secondly, the chapter &quot;The Eternal City&quot; is just awful - it reads like the book Adrian Mole is writing in Sue Townsend's &quot;Adrian Mole: the Wilderness Years&quot; and is so totally depressing it doesn't gel with the rest of the book.Still, two minor glitches in what is surely one of the most superlative books of this or any milennium."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I had a friend who didn't like this book because she took it way too seriously. Don't follow her lead, follow mine and the rest of the free world's, we know what we're talking about. If you lighten up and prepare yourself for a very funny satire, you're in for the literary treat of your life. Heller makes so much sense when he pokes fun, and the situations he puts his characters in are ludicrously funny and outrageous. If you find yourself asking questions like, \\"How could there be a person named Major Major Major?\\" or waking up at 2am in a sweaty rage, catatonically screaming, \\"It's inhumane for Colonel Scheisskopf to want to bolt his soldier's arms to their legs to make them march straighter!\\", and yes, Scheisskopf DOES mean what you think it means, then you may have this book mistaken with Heller's other famous piece, \\"Absolute True Facts About World War II and the Heroic Soldier's Related\\"*.

Joseph Heller's novel, Catch-22, is renown for being one of the greatest satirical war novels of all time. Heller's novel possesses great depth. The book is obviously anti-war but it also attacks many other problems that lie within our society. Heller attacks bureaucracies, capitalistic corporations, and other organizations that use individuals to benefit themselves. Heller's novel is directed to anyone who is fed up with being used as a tool of success for another person. The book is directed to anyone who is against war. Catch-22 is also directed to anyone who wants a laugh. In his novel, Catch-22, Joseph Heller successfully portrays an anti-war masterpiece using humor, corruption, and hope.In order for someone to fully understand Catch-22, he or she must understand the context of the novel. This novel was written in the 1950's. This was a time where many Americans viewed World War II as a heroic success. Those involved in the combat had differing views on the subject. Joseph Heller was a bombardier for the Air Force during World War II. Catch-22 is based largely on Heller's experiences in the war. Through his novel, Heller is expressing his detest for war. An element that one must take into account when reading Heller's novel is that he wrote Catch-22 using extreme satire. The reader must not take everything written seriously or he or she will not grasp the message Heller is trying to convey.Heller's novel Catch-22 revolves primarily around the actions and feelings of the protagonist, Yossarian. Yossarian desperately wants to be grounded. He can't be grounded though because he asked to be. Since he asked to be grounded that proved that he was indeed sane. If a man was insane he would want to fly more missions, therefore he could be grounded. Even if a man were insane and decided to ask to be grounded he could not be since he asked to be grounded therefore proving that he is actually sane. The preceding passage describes Catch-22. \\"Doc Daneeka replied, \`Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy\\" (55). Yossarian spends most of the novel faking illnesses and finding other ways to get out of flying. It is near the end of the novel when Yossarian takes a walk through the eternal city of Rome. Yossarian is in Nately's whore's apartment with all of the girls (prostitutes) missing except for one old lady. This lady explains another aspect of Catch-22. \\"Catch-22 says they have the right to do anything we can't stop them from doing\\" (417). The woman is referring to how the soldiers came and took all of the girls from the apartment. Once the woman says this to Yossarian he realizes that Catch-22 doesn't truly exist. It is an inexistent rule used to control people. After Yossarian realizes this he retreats to the city where he sees all of the horrors of the world. It is in Rome where he is arrested for being in the city without a pass. After he is arrested, Colonel Cathcart and Colonel Korn gave Yossarian a proposal. They will send him back to the States if he pretends to promote the war. \\"Be our pal. Say nice thing about us here and back in the States. Become one of the boys. Now, that isn't asking too much, is it?\\" (436). Yossarian accepts the proposal but breaks it. He cannot promote the war effort. Instead Yossarian decides to run away to Sweden. Yossarian runs because he can no longer be controlled and is ready to live a life of freedom.There is no doubt to whether Heller successfully executed his goals in writing this novel. It is evident through his writing that Heller truly detested the war and everything about it. He successfully uses humor in discussing a controversial issue. Catch-22 suggests many problems within the United States Militia. One of these problems is the traumatic affect of combat on soldiers. This idea is present through Yossarian and Snowden. Snowden was a young bombardier who died in Yossarian's arms. In result, Yossarian is always having flashbacks to the moment of Snowden's death. Although Heller's novel covered many issues it didn't touch on many common themes within war novels. One idea that is not present in Heller's writing in patriotism. None of the men in the novel act like they are fighting for their country. They don't show pride in what they do. This can be expected though since it is an anti-war novel. Heller distinguishes himself from other anti- war novelists in the sense of style. Unlike others, Heller uses satire to express his feelings on war.Although Heller's novel is entertaining and comical I don't entirely agree with his stance on issues regarding war. Through his writing Heller seems to find everything about war to be wrong. I personally feel that war is indeed wrong but is essential at crucial times. It seems as though Heller feels war is the worse thing on the face of the earth.In his novel, Catch-22, Joseph Heller successfully displays his beliefs on war. He touches on ideas such as corruption, deception, and violence in his novel. Heller was one of the first people to write an anti-war novel and did so even though he was a former member of the Air Force. Heller uses satire magnificently to illuminate on certain idiotic aspects of war. Catch-22 is a masterpiece of literature and everyone owes it to themselves to read it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 tells the tortuous story of Yossarian, a WW2 bombardier, who starts to lose (or regain) his sanity after a member of his crew is killed during a bombing mission. As Yossarian loses more of his friends to enemy fire, bizarre accidents and strange twists of fate, the storyline becomes ever more convoluted and the characters ever more bizarre.At its heart, this book is about how soldiers handle war. How they justify their actions and how they live with the constant threat of death or injury. Heller illustrates the confusion and senselessness of war by using bizarre events and crooked logic. The book is filled with black humor and quickly moves from one outlandish event to the next.In my opinion, this book has two major weaknesses. The first, is one of the hallmarks of this book: Heller builds his sentences to suggest an idea, only to immediately contradict himself. I found this to be very amusing for the first 100 pages or so, but this style simply became tedious afterwards. The second problem is the book's non-chronological plot. Heller keeps skipping back and forth in time and this makes the book hard to read and the plot difficult to follow.I found the book's real strength to be in its amazing and phenomenally well developed characters. Yossarian, Doc. Daneeka, Orr, Major Major and many more, are all extraordinarily alive and yet fundamentally flawed.Did I enjoy this book? Yes. All in all, this is a book worth reading, but don't expect an easy read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is damnably funny. But it suffers as Monty Python's &quot;And Now For Something Completely Different&quot; does - without a defined plot, it is incapable of sustaining a compelling narrative. Its midsection is bogged down with situations invented solely to amuse. It begins wonderfully and ends well, but the middle lays on the black comedy too thick. Heller tries too hard to be funny, and it turns repetitive, which makes it difficult to read all the way through.There are many, many characters. For a comedy they fit their purpose, but as a novel some are simply superfluous, inflating an already long book to even longer proportions. Scheisskopf, for example, in addition to being needlessly vulgar (German for &quot;s**t-head&quot;), has no effect on the plot, nor influence on any characters. Had Heller exercised his right to excise, he could have safely clipped 100 pages. Do we need 2 separate chapters on Milo's escapades as a celebrated food smuggler? Ideas once fresh run foul by the final 3rd of the book's length.Yet Catch-22 is brilliant, despite these surface flaws. The humor is definitely funny the characters memorable, if ersatz, and the rapport between soldiers seemingly real and certainly surreal. But only brilliant, not genius. Slaughterhouse-5 is genius - similarly, it paints World War 2 as absurd, poignant, and occasionally home to black humor, but Vonnegut's book dives deep into a few subjects while Catch-22 chooses to skim lightly over several."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The only way to endure a book about war and the constant hell of bombing runs, to my mind, is if it is desperately funny in a black-humor sort of way. Joseph Heller's masterpiece is exactly that. On an Italian island during WWII, Captain Yossarian and a whole base full of nuts are trying very hard not to get killed, while trying to finish enough of their tour of duty to be sent home, which means they have to go into danger in order to avoid it. Makes no sense? Neither does anything else in this book, except the dangerous, subversive kind of sense that suggests the whole thing -- the war, the military, even authority itself -- make no sense either. I love this book because it takes a serious subject and weaves in non-stop humor; the modern equivalent is the very funny Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf, which will have you belly-laughing as you consider the impacts of genocide.

Another \\"war\\" story, complete with machismo and death and fight scenes. Having finished the book, I now know that it is a \\"war\\" story , complete with the pain, the camaraderie, and the illogic of warfare. \\"Catch-22\\" is not meant as an accurate portrayal of WWII, but instead as an farce; a parody in which it is petty local politics and self aggrandizement motivate the fighting, and the higher ups are more ashamed of \\"black eyes\\" than casualties. Hmmmm, maybe it is more true to life then I thought...With the abandonment of logic comes a high degree of frustration. I was so frustrated with this book that I stopped reading at several points. Many of the situations are so ludicrous that you cry out in anguish. But that was Heller's intention - he wanted me to feel just a hint of the frustration the main character, Yosarian, felt as he tries to get discharged from an Army that is as much Orwell as it is Eisenhower. So I embraced my frustration, and laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of it all.Joseph Heller died while I was still only half way through the book. In a way, it was fitting - he seemed to me just another character, falling prey to the war predetor. But Heller lives on in this story."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"In case you didn't know, the word stressed spelled backwards is desserts. Similarly, the words taco salad spelled backwards is dalas ocat, which to the astute mind, makes absolutely no sense. We highlight this important point to foreshadow the fact that much of Catch-22 doesn't make any sense either. That being said, don't think for a second that Joseph Heller's most popular novel isn't one of the funniest ever written.Who in their right mind doesn't yearn for a little dysfunctional military comedy every once and while? We do, we do! You've got to be alert (and slightly insane) to keep pace with Captain John Joseph Yossarian and the rest of his bombardiers. The reward however, is a hilarious account of military Bureaucracy and a few other things that go well beyond our humble comprehension, but are enjoyable nonetheless.Catch-22 has climbed to the top of several lists, including The Modern Library, Time, and The Observer. Furthermore, it came in at a respectable 11th place in the UK's Big Read campaign. We loved the book for its unique voice and fast pace. The novel will make you cry, laugh, and then wonder what you were so emotional about in the first place. No catch, just a good story."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I bought this to re-read for my Book Club. I had read it many years ago and had loved it. Now, a couple of decades +, it just didn't hit the same level. I guess it's true that life changes your perspective on the past."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Being a fan of M*A*S*H in its myriad of forms, I've often heard comparisons made to \\"Catch-22\\" so I finally decided to read it, and I'm glad I did. \\"Catch-22\\" has a great deal of dark humor as well as some outright silliness. It is a brilliant satire on war in general which is set in Italy during the waning days of the Nazis in World War II. My one criticism of the book is that some jokes tend to get repetitive at times.The story focuses mostly on a U.S. Air Force squadron who go on a number of bombing runs doing their best to stay alive and do many crazy things to avoid going on more bombing runs. At the center of the crazy group is Yossarian, a bombardier who is convinced that everyone is out to kill him. Despite actions such as appearing to receive a medal in the nude, in some ways he seems like one of the most sane in the group. His friends include Milo, a bombardier who, instead of flying missions, runs a syndicate which buys and sells almost any goods you can think of; his syndicate also provides services, which at one point included bombing his own squadron! The head of the outfit, Major Major, wants to be liked by the others but they treat him badly because of his position; consequently, he avoids people, only allowing people to be sent to his office when he isn't there. Even the higher-ups prove to be nutty with Generals Peckem and Dreedle spending their energy competing against each other rather than fighting the enemy.The book shows how insane the military bureaucracy itself can be, embodied in the concept \\"catch-22\\". One example of a catch-22 in the book is when Yossarian tries to be discharged by reason of insanity he's told he cannot be discharged because the fact he's trying to prove himself insane means that he isn't. Military silliness is also shown with how concerned officials are with seemingly unimportant things such winning parade contests and bombing a target so it makes for a nice photograph of the explosion.Many characters come and go with several killed in combat. Heller makes all of them three-dimensional so you grow to either love or hate them. The writing contains a variety of humor - silly, intelligent, outrageous. There are several running jokes, though I feel sometimes they are overused, such as repeated explanations of how Milo's syndicate sells one kind of goods to one group in order to buy other kinds at all sorts of prices. In addition to the humorous moments, the book has examples of the horrors of war. Not everyone makes it home and nobody is the same afterward. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to any fans of classic literature, war comedies, or satire."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 presents an unsentimental vision of war, without romantic pretenses, glory, and honor. Instead, we find a nightmarish comedy of violence, bureaucracy, and paradoxical madness. The story is told as a series of loosely related mini-stories in no particular order. Leadership continually raises the number of missions required for the men to go home - it makes the leaders look good. The leaders pay more attention to the quality of aerial bombing photographs than the actual bombing results.The M.D., counselor, and chaplain values each become subverted by their war duties. The doctor ends up providing useless treatments, the counselor unavailable for appointments, and the chaplain loses faith in god. All three are rewarded by the hierarchy, and none are punished.Yossarian, the central figure, focuses on his own survival, faking various illnesses and troubled by the death of Snowden who had died in his arms on a bombing run. Yossarian discovers its possible to be discharged because of insanity, only to also learn that by claiming to be insane one has proven himself sane. That's 'Catch-22.'Meanwhile, mess officer Milo Minderbinder gets fabulously rich through trading by his various companies, including at one point with the Germans who subcontract with him to conduct a bombing run on the American base. Eventually, Yossarian goes AWOL, is offered a court-martial or discharge - the latter if he supports the leaders' new mandate for 80 millions. Yossarian avoids the moral temptation by fleeing to Sweden.Only someone who had spent combat time in the military could write with such devastating irony - a great book!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When I moved to the US and wanted to read more American literature, the novel that people recommended to me most often was not, as I had expected, Moby Dick (which few seemed to have read) but Catch-22. Now I have finally got around to reading it and (unlike with Moby Dick) was not disappointed.The anti-hero, the anti-war sentiment and the black humor are all very characteristic of the 60s, especially 60s Britain, so it is not surprising that the novel was popular there before American readers warmed to it. Unlike other anti-war works of the period however, this one was written by a veteran and based on hard experience, rather than - as was more usual at the time - by someone who had never experienced war and was determined never to do so.The movie versions of this and MASH were both released in 1970. The latter was released first and was a much better movie, and so Catch-22 remained under the shadow of MASH for some time, and perhaps still does. Readers familiar with the MASH movie and TV series, who read Catch-22 now, may not have the same sense of novelty that the early readers had.The events of the story are to some extent modeled on Homer's Iliad (and to a lesser extent The Odyssey) which Heller was reading at the time he wrote Catch-22. It's not essential to know the Iliad in order to enjoy this story but, if you don't, you'll miss a lot of the references and not get the most out of it. Having said that, there are plenty of other references - literary and mythological - and I'm sure I've not picked up anywhere near all of them in one reading.Interestingly, the title has become part of the language with a meaning that is not strictly reflected in the book. Catch-22 as a 'no-win situation' is described early on, but the phrase recurs throughout with a more general meaning, that of an arbitrary and even fictitious rule. As so often, the novel does not really say what people who have never read it think it does.The continual use of paradox - paradoxical judgments, contradictory statements and situations, and so on - can sometimes become too contrived and can sometimes fall flat. It may be overdone for some readers' tastes. But on the whole it works very well, giving the book the appropriate ironic tone throughout.The structure of the story is extraordinary. The same events are related many times, from different perspectives, providing layers of narrative that finally reveal the whole picture. As part of this continual retelling, the phenomenon of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, and related phenomena, feature in the story, both implicitly and explicitly. The timeline is thus non-linear, going back and forth continually. The result is a unique and compelling literary experience.This is a profound, funny, often disturbing novel that should be near the top your reading list.[PeterReeve]"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The title has entered our language as a description of certain situations into which we might fall. The humor in this work is wicked.The focal character of this book is John Yossarian, a bombardier in the Air Force who wants to get out of combat duty. He runs into Catch-22: to get out of duty, you must be unfit to fly. But to want out is to show that one is sane--hence, not unfit!The book, by Joseph Heller, is an interesting take on behavior and decision-making within organizations. Bureaucracy is one target of Heller's writing.The style is exasperating! The work goes back and forth in time; different characters' perspectives are involved. Multiple iterations are used to explain the ongoing storyline. This can be challenging for readers but it also creates an interesting ethos in the work.But, in the end, this is still well worth reading, even many years after its original publication."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"By this time everyone knows what a Catch-22 is - we're inundated with them every day - but in case you're not sure, it's a circumstance in which the very thing you need in order to get you what you want is the very thing that will prevent you from getting it. In short, it's a double bind.The first Catch-22 ever publicized is, of course, to be found in this book. Yossarian, the protagonist and a World War II bombardier, wants his squadron doctor to certify him insane so his superiors will ground him and he won't have to fly combat missions. The doctor agrees that Yossarian is crazy, for a variety of reasons. All that's lacking is for Yossarian to ask to be grounded. If he does that, however, the doctor is required to take that as a sign that he has a normal, healthy aversion to being shot at, that he is therefore sane, and that he must therefore fly more combat missions. Oops.This is far from the first or last such incidence of utter lunacy in this book. The chaos begins well before the story kicks off. It actually starts at the author's note, which states that the real island of Pianosa lies in the Mediterranean off the Italian coast and is far too small to accommodate all the incidents set there in \\"Catch-22\\". So you start reading, with the idea in mind that the story on paper is, if anything, less real than other books, and the activities of the characters seem to bear you out - for instance, within the first few pages the narrative describes a captain with whom Yossarian has stopped playing chess because the captain is a good chess player, and the games are therefore so interesting they are foolish. And you think \\"Aha, this is a farce\\". Then Chapter 2 starts with the line \\"Outside, there was still nothing funny going on,\\" and you remember that Yossarian and his buddies are in imminent danger of death every day. Farce, my foot.Joseph Heller had a real gift for the goofy detail - he could have written sketches for Monty Python - and it was a stroke of genius for him to set his first novel during World War II, because the pressures of wartime prevent the story from dissolving into a set of disconnected episodes. The author came up with a few other strategies to lend his story a framework, most particularly Yossarian's recurring recollection of what happened in his plane to a young gunner named Snowden. In speaking of this incident, he generally turns it into a bad joke, asking \\"Where are the Snowdens of yesteryear?\\" during mission briefings whenever someone asks if there are any questions. The question is a riff on the refrain of a poem by the medieval French poet Villon - \\"Where are the snows of yesteryear?\\" - the verses of which seem to be about the loss of beauty and love, or maybe innocence. As for Yossarian's question, when you find out what happened to Snowden, you learn that Yossarian isn't quite as nuts as you might think. Let's just say that his question has to do with lost innocence also, and let it go at that.As a matter of fact, you can read all of \\"Catch-22\\" as a series of confrontations between innocence and whatever seeks to destroy it, another good reason for setting it in wartime. This probably explains why there are so few combat scenes in the novel, and maybe why this is an air unit rather than a ground unit. It allows Heller to tell his story at one remove from genuine blood and death, at least until the novel's climax, and concentrate on the conflict between the innocent and the cynical. Yossarian makes a good central character because he's almost the only one who finds a way to fight the cynics around him without becoming cynical himself. It doesn't work forever, but it keeps Yossarian out of the snake pit long enough to learn another strategy from a most unlikely supporting character, and that's how \\"Catch-22\\" manages to end in some sort of triumph.So that's one possible reading of this ridiculous story - ridiculous on its face, that is. You can also read it as an attack on postwar bureaucracy a la Kafka's \\"The Trial\\", or some kind of anti-imperialist manifesto, or I don't know what, but please don't forget that it's also a comedy of manners, however unlikely that sounds. And just to give you an idea of how lightly you can take this book, we know that the phrase \\"Catch-22\\" is pretty nearly random. Joseph Heller wanted to call it \\"Catch-18\\", but his publisher made him change the number to avoid confusion with the contemporary bestseller \\"Mila 18\\", and he picked one that sounded euphonious to him. That's how much heavy significance there is to this novel - first and foremost, it's meant to be funny, and it succeeds exceptionally well.Joseph Heller gave an interview once in which he envisioned Buck Henry, who wrote the movie screenplay, flipping through \\"Catch-22\\" in despair and moaning \\"There's no PLOT here!\\" Technically speaking, that's probably true, but it doesn't matter. Its structure and theme make this novel hang together more than well enough. As we follow Yossarian from his desire to avoid combat by simply refusing to cooperate (following in the footsteps of his great predecessor, the Good Soldier Svejk), to his desperate attempt at keeping his sanity and his moral compass while tied hand and foot by the last great Catch-22, we come to realize that like a lot of light farces, this one has some pretty deep roots. Evidently the little island of Pianosa, at least in Joseph Heller's imagination, is plenty big enough for a great tale.Benshlomo says, Sometimes goofing off is better than preaching sermons."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"MASH is definetly the one word to describe this book. I can't imagine that the sitcom, MASH, wasn't inspired by this book. You can even pick out certain characters although they are sometimes blended together or split apart. Although, MASH would have been limited to Cinemax if it was an accurate copy. There are a lot of sex scenes in the book.I don't think I have ever read any book that made me laugh out loud more than this book. Some of the humor was very silly (like MASH), but I couldn't help laughing.Catch-22 is about pilots in war and there are some war related scenes that are gruesome, but not too often."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I've always thought that people who don't like CATCH-22 are humorless fascists.Joseph Heller (1923-1999) was a poor Brooklyn kid who joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942 and ended up on the Italian front, where flew at least sixty combat missions--most of which he described as \\"milk runs.\\" Always interested in writing, he began to publish in the late 1940s and was well regarded as a short story writer. In 1953 he began a piece that he thought would be short story or maybe a novella. Eight years later in 1961, after considerable editing and a last-minute name change, it was a four hundred page-plus novel titled CATCH-22. Reviews were originally mixed, but the book thrived on word-of-mouth, and pretty soon everybody was reading it and talking about it.CATCH-22 is extremely difficult to describe because it does not operate on a linear time line: the story is not told in sequence, but in what seems at first to be a random order of events. Characters who were dead in one chapter are living in the next chapter; events that past in one chapter have not yet happened in the next chapter. These characters and events swirl like a confusion of confetti--but as the novel progresses one perceives a pattern, and at the center of the pattern is a U.S. Army Air Forces B-52 bombardier named Yossarian, who is repeatedly stymied by an absurdity of military bureaucracy created and supported by a military regulation known as \\"Catch-22.\\"Catch-22 is essentially an unspecified double-bind rule that can be applied to virtually any situation at will because no one has actually seen the rule in written form. The plot of the novel arises because Yossarian and his buddies have been required to fly an absurdly high number of missions and Yossarian's nerves are at the breaking point. He should be grounded, but in order to be grounded he must ask to be grounded. Since concern for personal safety is the process of a rational mind, asking to be grounded is evidence of sanity, and if he is sane he must fly however many missions his superiors require. This bizarre, circular logic--which is reflected in the bizarre, circular nature of the narrative--is applied over and over throughout the book.The result is laugh-out-loud funny, particularly when the characters are factored into the story: characters such as Major Major Major Major, ex-PFC Wintergreen, Hungry Joe, Chief White Halfoat, Chaplin A.T. Tapman, General Dreedle, Milo Minderbinder, and numerous others are hilarious creations that stay in your mind years, even decades after the book is read. But as the novel progresses it becomes increasingly hard to laugh at their predicaments, which become increasingly dark. By the novel's conclusion, we are praying for Yossarian and his friends to escape, but damn few of them do.People who have been in the military seem to regard the novel as a satire on the military; it is, however, much broader than that, and it would be more accurate to describe CATCH-22 as a satire on bureaucracy in general. The notion could just as easily be applied to business, to religion, to the government, and there is probably not a person living who hasn't experienced a Catch-22 moment within the past week or two. Just recall the last time you tried to have your telephone bill corrected or asked about a questionable transaction on your bank statement and you'll probably know exactly what I mean.CATCH-22 is one of the handful of novels to which I seem to return every few years, and with each reading I find funnier, darker, and more memorable than before. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amason Reviewer"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When Joseph Heller's wonderfully hilarious novel \\"Catch-22\\" was published in 1961, World War II was celebrated as the \\"good fight.\\" Popular memory held it as a noble stand against the Axis onslaught and a glorious victory for democracy, as opposed to the more recent Korean War, a somewhat muddled thing with no rousing cause beyond vague theories of \\"containment.\\" Needless to say, many found the irreverence and dark humor of \\"Catch-22\\" somewhat disturbing. Its hero, Yossarian, spends the story trying frantically to be sent home and not fly any more missions, while the United States military is depicted as an inanely irrational bureaucracy. The multifaceted \\"Catch-22\\" tells many tales, including a contemporarily relevant account of rhetoric gone wrong and the wiles of words used justify a variety of dubious causes in ways that make nonsensical sense. The result is a highly entertaining dark comedy that takes absurdity to new heights.\\"Catch-22\\" has often been described as the insanity of modern life as seen from the perspective of someone who is perhaps too sane. Yossarian is perturbed by the very logical fact that thousands of people whom he does not know nor has ever even met are trying desperately to kill him. Common sense would indicate that it is best to remove oneself from such a situation, especially given the basic biological instinct for survival found in all animals. However, such is the incongruous nature of war, here only heightened by the fantastically illogical organizations running it. In order for Yossarian to be properly discharged from service, he must be proven mentally unfit for combat. Unfortunately, the very act of self-preservation is indicative of a sound man. That, as Doc Daneeka explains, is the principle of Catch-22. Although he admits it has a \\"spinning reasonableness\\" and an \\"elliptical precision about its perfect pairs and parts that was graceful and shocking,\\" Yossarian remains steadfastly bound to the primordial value of life. It is later revealed that he came into his dangerously good sense after the gory death of his comrade Snowden in an air battle, thereby launching his quest to not fly any more missions. Alas, Colonel Cathcart, constantly trying to please his superiors so he can be promoted to general, persists in raising the number required. In essence, \\"Catch-22 . . . says you've always got to do what your commanding officer tells you to.\\"I think Yossarian's plight is perhaps that the individual must always work to oppose the domineering \\"vested interests\\" of business, government, and the military. Though vital to modern world, these establishments are often forced to rely on unscrupulous means to safeguard themselves against a populace rightfully dissatisfied with them. The core definition of Catch-22, according an old woman, is that \\"they have the right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.\\" Of course, so that they cannot be stopped, Yossarian's goal must be to prevent those in the military command from continuing to utilize him like a tool for their own ends. Yet the individual can never entirely escape the officious, overbearing, yet coldly and impersonally distant bureaucracies of contemporary society. To do so would be to violate the shifting facades of principle upon which they rest. There is too little to be certain of. Still, there remains the old declaration of skeptical philosophy: \\"I think, therefore I am,\\" as Descartes once phrased it. When the world takes on an air of unreality, when there is doubt of the very ground upon which one stands, there persists that one eternal verity: conscious life. Who wants a life, one character asks, if it is nothing but \\"a series of unfortunate events\\"? The response is another question: \\"What else is there?\\"When it was fist published in 1961, \\"Catch-22\\" received mixed reviews and moderate success. As the sixties continued on, however, Joseph Heller's novel took on a new significance. An entire generation was coming to question the authority under which they lived, as well as its rhetoric of black and white, good versus evil. Granted, there is little to have loved about the Communist dictatorship of the Soviet Union, although some American leftists came to believe that there was, but nor could the actions of the United States be seen as wholly in the right. President Lyndon B. Johnson subsequently found that he could not talk the public into supporting the Vietnam War with fuzzy affirmations of \\"Courage, Might, Justice, Truth, Liberty, Love, Honor, and Patriotism\\" backed by geopolitical jargon about the importance of the Third World in the liberty-or-death struggle against global Communism. In \\"Catch-22,\\" Yossarian finally decides to flee to Sweden: since the war is almost over, he would be risking his life for nothing but Colonel Cathcart's clamoring to be general. Meanwhile, in the real world, \\"Yossarian Lives!\\" would become a popular anti-Vietnam slogan. Escape was not an option for millions of young Americans in the late sixties who began to take \\"Catch-22\\" seriously and help make it into the classic it is today."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"War is a summary of all possible tragic events. Here the main character, Yossarian, is someone who recognizes that absurdity has become a way of life for a world were logic reasoning has been twisted to support a group of persons who could not care less about their fellow beings.The problem for someone, as him, who suddenly becomes &quot;enlightened&quot; is that he can no longer be understood. Besides he can no longer be in communion with life as it was before. From that perspective everything that occurs becomes absurd, and what is absurd is usually funny.

However, he badgers his reader to the point where any knowledge or truth that has been gleaned from the novel is lost. A book about nonsense and insanity is fine, but when the reader is forced to see it through the same kaleidoscope as the characters, some of the impact is lost. One has a hard time relating to, or feeling sympathy for, the characters since we never know what they'll do next. Does Heller really mean to say that people were making money at the expense of their friend's llives? If so, the ridiculous personage of Milo is the wrong way to achieve this end. This character's actions are so ludicrous, that the reader is forced to write off the incidents completely. This is just a symptom of Heller's disease, which causes him to alienate his reader through an overdose of sarcasm and ridiculousness."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"i loved it. i am only 16 and read it for a book report in english. the major major chapter was the best. read it!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I'm probably one of the few who doesn't think this book is outstanding.

Rather than a flowing narrative, it is simply jumbled military anecdotes that follow no timeline. An event or person that may be mentioned early in the book isn't described until later in the book. But what it comes down to is that I could have stopped at the end of each chapter with no impulse to read further to see what happens next.

There were times when I was left shaking my head with a smile, or an outright laugh. But for the most part I kept shaking my head wondering if all this book is about is dry humor satirizing the politics and ideology of WWII, or any war for that matter. And yes, that is what the book was meant to do, but it doesn't make for a good novel, as everyone is saying. A satirical conversation yes, a novel no.Reading the reviews the book is made out to have a flowing plotline that reveals the satire through an underlying conversation, one that uses a plotline of capitalist ventures, scheming officers and men who want out of the war. But this just isn't the case. The book itself is a loose collection of satirical comments that never form into anything other than a comedy, one meant to seem witty and fun. But after 463 pages you are left with nothing more than an elaborate definition of Catch-22, one that has no storyline worthy of making this a novel.If you are familiar with M*A*S*H and love it, then read this book. If you love satirical comedies with no storyline, read this. But if you are expecting to find a satirical \\"novel\\", as many reviewers have called this book, then you won't find it in this loose collection of witty phrases and hinted at revelations.

Virtually any praise that I can heap upon Catch-22 has been done - and more eloquently than I can ever put it. From a humanistic standpoint it is a far-reaching work touching on subjects which can be deemed universal, even given the extreme circumstances placed upon the characters; though most of us have never even smelled the smokey aroma of a bullet fired at our heads, let alone experienced the horror of war (as far-removed, history-channel watching observers like my self so inadequately put it), Heller smashes, with remarkable insight, care and an almost scary gift for paradoxical logic, into subjects which touch any person with the right-minded patience to plough through this massive novel.As a work of philosophy (yes, philosophy), Catch-22 visits realms of logic that will twist the reader's mind while making him realize the idiosyncracies in war, indeed in everyday life. There is a reason why the term 'Catch-22' is now a commonly used expression; the book puts a name on a set of logical impasses that had been hinted at before but never officially named. (perhaps by philosophers, yes, but never in such a popular way)As a work of literature, this book is simply amazing. A testament to the nearly 10 years Heller plunked down into its writing, Catch-22 is easily the most complex and convoluted novel I have ever read which still manages to keep some semblance of sense and cohesiveness. I cannot even begin to imagine the intense plotting and forethought that has gone into its execution; moments hinted at briefly which seem absolutely meaningless resurface 300 pages later and shed new light on everything up to that point. It of course follows suit that this novel needs more than one reading, indeed, needs more than two.Catch-22 is an extremely important work of art, not only for the generation it was written for, but for humanity as a whole, for its complexity, unabashed humanity, trenchant humor (even all these years later), mad genius and the sheer pleasure it provides in revisiting (the second lecture is much better than the first.)It is difficult to expound on Heller's genius for having writen this gem within the confines of 1000 words or less, and I usually take with healthy suspicion such raving reviews as I myself have given, but it is duly deserving. If I had to compress Catch-22 into a word, it would be 'timeless'. This novel, I am sure, will be read, appreciated and admired in 50, 100 years from now, far after the echoes of the war it was set in have faded from the failing memory of our species."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I never really got into this book, and I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about.

Basically, after 80 pages, the story was still stagnating. There were plenty of quirky, rebellious characters but all the absurdity just didn't come together for me. Yeah, there was Yossarian who was paranoid about getting killed, Hungry Joe who yelled in his sleep, Aadvark the navigator who couldn't navigate... So?I kept asking myself, what the hell were all of them doing? Where was the story going? Nowhere. The characters were simply busy being eccentric amidst the madness of war. Which perhaps was what Heller was trying to portray. Afterall, it was only 10 years after WWII when the book was first published and I guess it connected with a lot of readers then. The message behind the book is still relevant, no doubt - but apart from the anti-war and anti-establishment theme, I felt Heller didn't have much else to offer. Mildly humorous at times, but sadly, the storyline just didn't progress with enough purpose for my taste."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Having read the paper version of Catch-22 several times, it's one of my favorite books... I was surprised how few scanning errors there were when compared with some of the other masterpiece books I've ordered for my Kindle. Especially the older, out of copyright classics, where I found many errors. I am very happy with my e-book version of Catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"If I step back into my college nerd-geek mindset, I can appreciate this book for the attempts at humor. To be sure, it's a simple humor, dressed up in pseudo-intellectualism; but it reminds me of some of my friends when they would make an odd comment simply for the sake of absurdity and then try to explain to me how what they said actually made total sense. They were funny and quirky and fun. However, they also had other moods and other traits, and my interactions with them were deeper than simple banter.What this book suffers from is using a device too much. To me, great artists - of any type - have a large toolbox. They may not be masters at using every one, but they are knowledgeable and proficient with each. But most importantly, they know when to use each one - or perhaps more to the point, when NOT to use each one. In Catch-22, Heller picks up one brush (absurdity) and uses it endlessly, repeatedly, for 500 some pages. This isn't masterful, and it almost comes across as an exercise, almost like a musical etude.For me, the trick is not to find something great and use it endlessly. That is sloppy and sophomoric. The real mastery in any art is using a tool only where it has greatest effect, to moderate yourself and allow yourself to use other tools. Otherwise, the effect you are aiming for loses its meaning and poignancy. By being relentlessly absurd - granted some argue he was doing this purposefully to make us feel the absurdity - he's created an absurd book. Kudos to doing what you set out to do, but that doesn't make the book itself \\"great\\".Just my $0.02."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"What a read, hilarity and substance that goes beyond the humor to delve into the reality of being stuck in a no win situation."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is a wonderful book, engaging the reader, enabling them to watch these people live, as if right by their side. At first, I was a bit taken aback, wondering why in the world someone would recommend this book, but the reason soon became clear, diminishing any previous doubts. Heller is able to bring these characters to life, using his words to create realistic imagery. The characters become real, living, breathing people in your mind as you join them in their missions. It even leaves a sort of mystery until the last page or so. As much praise as Catch-22 deserves, however, there will be some that will argue, saying the language is too harsh, or the context too mature, but it is well written, and a true depiction of the lives of the people at war, or during the time. With all of the seriousness, though, Heller provides comic relief through Yossarian's sarcastic antics, making the novel somewhat hilarious. A person expecting a fairy tale, or an easy read, probably should not read this book, but I would still recommend it for readers of various sorts, whether you like action, war books, or not. It really is difficult to go wrong when choosing to read Catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"My title should say it all, this is an amazing book.

It can be a life-changer and an experience worth going through. Do yourself a favour and read it. You'll never forget it. It will change your perception of sanity forever."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller's Catch-22 has been seen as a controversial but classic twentieth century novel because of its rebellious nature and questioning of authority that easily places it into the social context of the American 1960s. Through the main character, Yossarian, and his various situations the author seems to comment on the individual use of morality as a counter to the governmental use of authority and power in a military bureaucracy. Yossarian, a soldier in World War II, and his squadron's fate are placed in the hands of a group of leaders who are willing to sacrifice their men's lives for personal gain in the form of recognition. Heller seems to use this situation to comment on the authoritative use of bureaucracy in that the men are led into futile situations by a bureaucracy that not only discards logic, but also has no regard for its defenders. Yossarian and his fellow soldiers must use the illogical laws of their war bureaucracy to their advantages in order to survive. They are all subject to the law of Catch-22.Heller's Catch-22 ultimately defines situations in which all of the solutions of any given situation have negative results. The author uses Catch-22 throughout his novel to show how logic can be circumvented in order to force Yossarian and his squadron to suffer through numerous personal situations and remain at war in a sort of bureaucratic military entrapment. Catch-22 is used when Yossarian, as an instinct of preservation, tries to be discharged from the military-or at least tries to avoid combat-by claiming that he is insane. But by claiming that he is insane, he is therefore seen as sane because no reasonable person would want to fly bombing missions. Again, Catch-22 is used against Yossarian when he is offered the choice to be court-martialed or be released upon his approval of the policies of Colonels Cathcart and Korn. The Catch-22 is that the policies require the men to fly eighty missions before being sent home and thereby jeopardizes their lives.Perhaps the most important point that Heller makes in Catch-22 is that there is an alternative to Catch-22. At the end of the novel, Yossarian discounts Catch-22 by opting for a different way out of war. He deserts his unit and goes to Sweden, a neutral country, and rejects the military bureaucracy. By this, Heller seems to say that while Catch-22-a contradictory condition of circular reasoning that holds its sufferer in its irrational environment and benefits only those who have made up the law-may seem inescapable; there is ultimately a way out. Heller depicted World War II with a sense of disenchantment with the military. This may be what made Catch-22 so controversial during the Vietnam War (and in the wake of what was considered The Good War). Yossarian not only questions authority, but he finds an ultimate solution through desertion. This is definitely not something that the government would have wanted young American draftsmen reading, however, it is valuable in its depiction of morality in the face of illogical or immoral situations such as war."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 is a novel set in final months of World War II. Yossarian, the protagonist, was a World War II Bombardier. In the novel, for thousands of people that didn't even know kept trying to kill him. This book I believe helps people to understand the meanings and feelings of war. For Yossarian lost several of his friends in war, bizzare accidnets, or even by fate, but he had to learn to handle it. This novel is not like every other novel, for it has no chronological order to it which gives it its uniqueness not only to the novel but also to the characters. For example, Yossarian goes crazy because he has gone through a lot but he gets through it. Major Major is a character to which he tells everyone they may visit him in his office, when he's not there. Some characters like Colonal Korn's just wants his picture in the paper and doesn't even care about his soldier or if they get bombed or anything. Heller makes the novel very interesting, but it is self-contradicting and has twisted reasoning for everything. He wants the reader to have to go back in the novel and remember certain events in order for it all to make sense. I also believe that because of all the little stories told about the other characters and the realationship Yossarian has with them, it ends up showing the reader a lot about Yossarian himself. For this novel is fun to read because it is field with numerous amounts of emotions from humor, to scary, to sadness and depressing moments allowing the reader to really get into the book. I enjoyed this book a lot, because I was able to keep reading it because I didn't want to put it down. I wanted to find out what kind of event was going to happen next. Catch 22 was none like any book I have read, and I recomend you read it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is one of America's greatest works of literiture. It is a funny, powerful, sad, and ironic portrayal of war. I'v never read anything quite like it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is a very interesting story about a bombardier named Yossarian stationed in Italy during WWII...The whole world seems crazy in this novel and there are plenty of crazy characters that inhabit it. It might sound weird to say, but there really isn't a plot in this story. It's just a bunch of funny and sometimes sad events told in a nonchronological order. This would make the story confusing, but since there isn't really a plot it doesn't really matter. Reading this novel one can tell there are many layers and meanings, but it's not neccessary to delve too deeply into these meanings as the book can be read just for it's hilarity. I found some parts to be laugh-out-loud funny. This book is somewhat hard to describe and one can really only appreciate it if they read it. It's worth reading and I personally got through it very quickly..."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I got to read this book only a few years ago, and suddenly everyone around me looked as if Im an alien. Catch-22 is really wonderful satire about war. The hilarity is wonderfully woven around the unavoidable tragedy during the war era and Heller beautifully alternates between the two.In a sense it is like Voltaire's Candide where the central character oscillates between optimism and pessimism, only here Yossarian (and others) oscillates between the comic and tragic. While Voltaire's is really a serious satire about the evils that humans perpetuate on one another, that was completed in 3 days, Heller's is more funny yet focused on war, probably starting a new genre - war comics (beetle bailey, mash etc). Its ironic that the movie Catch 22 could not bring out the nuances of the war time that Heller has depicted in the book. He probably also created a style of repeating same thing in different words to make it look funny.Anyway this is great novel not only to be read but also realise the evils of war. Yossarian will surely be an unforgettable character whoever read this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Despite a bit of sluggishness in the fourth fifth of this book, Heller managed to create a truly great book in a manner nobody had ever successfully pulled off before.Like the equally great SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE--really the only significant novel thematically similar to CATCH-22 written in anything like Heller's style--CATCH-22 is usually labeled an anti-war novel. I disagree. I think both are pro-humanity books. Heller and Vonnegut, like Voltaire centuries earlier, both seem to have reached a place when writing these classics where they could no longer stomach the absurdities of their day. It wasn't just war that nauseated them; it was the ease--the eagerness--in which they saw men become animals.They are, unfortunately, depressing books. Great books, but depressing nonetheless."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Although it lacks the credibility of Faulkner and Hemingway's works, Catch 22 is one of the better modern novels. It is extremely ironic and funny, and stands out as both a piece of social commentary and art. Books like this are great for people who like to read, because they easier to read than some more serious literature, but are thought provoking and artistic. I read this at the beach a couple years ago in a few days, and annoyed everyone by giggling all day."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Heller's style is very similar to Kurt Vonnegut's, and being a huge Vonnegut fan, I really enjoyed Catch-22. The structure of the story was very interesting too - each chapter was about a different character, such that instead of getting a whole story, you get glimpses of the story from many different perspectives, which I think helped develop the characters very well.The Everyman's Library edition is a very good looking book. And not as bulky as usual hard covers."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Heller's masterpiece; Catch-22 (Set in WW2 the story of a bombardier named Yossarian who thinks everyone wants to get him killed) is so because of a multitude of reasons. The more literary aspects are known but what I found most endearing was the sheer class of humour he uses. From seemingly absurd sentences rises the glory of a dark dry humour. I was in splits throughout the book!Read the book if you are dying to read something really great and really different. Also, read the book if your are feeling depressive. Its that good!If you are in two minds I can suggest a sure fire way to resolve your doubt. Get your hands on and read any 2-3 page excerpt. If you don't fall in love don't buy it. But I must warn you that you would probably end up wishing to get your hands onto the book real fast!The title itself is a mirror to whats inside. Catch-22 is now a standard idiom of the english language and refers to a situation in which whatever you do to get out of the fix gets you back into it.Happy catching up..."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I'm the 357th person to review this book. The average rating so far is 4 1/2. Why are you bothering to read my review, isn't that recomendation enough?You want more? Fine.I give this book 5 stars because it is the most ingenious, funny and entertaining book I have read in a long time. It is not so much a novel, but a collection of stories about a squadron group in WW2 which somehow all tie in together. Each character has their own foibles, and each is described in amusing detail. At time it does repeat itself (how many times is Snowden's death referred to?), but this doesn't detract from the great wartime yarns that are being told. All in all, a very funny read that 9 out of 10 people will love.There, now what are you waiting for? Put it in your shopping cart, NOW!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When I first opened Catch-22 I was throughly confused. Their are a whole lot of plot threads that arise that you don't find out about until a great deal of the way through the book. But after I got through the first 75 pages the novel began to come into picture.Heller's book is ...funny in places and also pretty sad in others. For people who don't find this book funny they need to lighten up. Though the humor is far from sophisticated it's still pretty hilarious. I loved the whole backwards name thing, Washington Irving and Irving Washington. And how can you not laugh at Major Major Major. General Dreedle scaring ... people by threatening to have them shot is also great.The book can be pretty sobering too. Yossarian is dreadfully affraid dying and when he has a nervous breakdown in the air you are watching someone unravel.Overall this is one of my favorite books. So if your a wise [alek]pacifist or someone who enjoys a good book, then pick this up. If you take yourself to seriously, feel your beyond hype and all \\"classics\\" suck, then don't bother."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I first read Catch-22 in high school, and it has left a lasting impression on me. My take on the book was that the circle of insanity was the very thing that was holding the characters together to make it through their lives, keeping them sane. Life is often a contradiction. Like the good ol' military term: Hurry up, and wait.When I watched the movie of this same title I was literally ill by the way the characters were portrayed. Read the book, it's a whole other story. You never once get a sense of the pain that the characters are suffering through in the movie, as you do in the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is the only book during which I have laughed so hard that I cried. The quick back and forth dialogue sections come across like perfectly natural conversation and Joseph Heller's wit cuts out razor-blade sharp."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I won't bore you with a retelling of the story, as others have already done so. (Take that statement however you want.) Let me just say a few things that you might find helpful.I first read CATCH 22 when I was 13. What an eye-opening book for a 13 year old! Now, three full decades later, it's still a captivating book, one of the few I enjoy as much or more than when I first read it.Yossarian is the man who wants to \\"live forever or die in the attempt.\\" Well, he's going to live forever, as are the other characters in the book, and that's the brilliance of the story. While Heller's literary style is looking a bit ragged around the edges by today's standards, it's his ability to discern, distill, and capture in print the true, unchanging characteristics of humans and the human experience that makes for true immortality.Is it anti-war? Yes, in part. But it's much more than that. Heller makes good use of the war as a magnifying class for examining his true subject: human nature in conflict with its own human flaws.CATCH 22 is ... a handbook on humanity, warts and all. A ribald, swerving, twisted, irreverent handbook, but a handbook nonetheless. Or if you prefer, think of it as the biggest feather in Heller's cap. ;) Oh, and don't watch the movie version, which is more an undergrad's synopsis of a Cliff's Notes version of the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I love humor and satire books, and Catch-22 remains one of my all-time favorites. Logic and sense are completely discarded, but then at times throttled and twisted by every available character to the point where you find yourself agreeing with ridiculous arguments. Generals vie for power through a constantly deserting private who sells lighters, officers are assigned due to how appropriate their last name is, and medals are won by sheer cowardice. Heller's cast of characters, including the sex-crazed ex-photographer Hungry Joe, ever-lethargic Nately's whore, and hermit Major (named Major Major Major) stand out among fictional figures. The \\"protagonist,\\" Yossarian, is one of the few main characters in all of the war hero genre that not only begins but remains a selfish coward you cannot help but love. Over time I have bought several copies of this book just to lend out every one of them."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is a funny movie but I do believe it helps to have been in the Air Corps and experienced some of this first hand---also to have read the book in advance of seeing the movie. This will give you a better perspective as to what is happening and why.I thought it to be an excellent movie and well worth the money and time spent viewing it--in fact, I watched it twice--so far."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"\\"It's a Catch 22.\\" It seems I've heard the phrase all of my life and never been able to put my finger on what it actually meant. Reading the book mostly clarified it. A Catch 22 is illogical thinking, explained in a logical manner contrived to suit the people who make the rules. For example: If you are crazy, you should not be in the army. How does one go about getting classified as crazy? You'd have to tell the doctor you are. Having the insight to tell the doctor though, means you are sane.It's difficult. I liked it - don't get me wrong, but the man has an extensive vocabulary and really seems to enjoy using it. Also, he's a bit crazy and reading crazy sometimes makes me feel it.It's an Anti-War story written about the Second WW. I guess when Vietnam was going on these books were really important - they showed the pain of war, rather than the glory. I've read a couple of them in the past year or so and I feel almost the same about each. I get why they were written but I don't identify. I feel like I've missed something almost by not having a comparative analysis of my own.It's also a black comedy, but by the end I couldn't shake the \\"black\\" enough to enjoy the \\"comedy.\\"I really did like it, I just don't think for the same reasons it became a best seller.The main character of this book is Yossarian, though he is not in all of the chapters. He is a philosophical character whose anecdotes constantly put him in center stage. His demise is heartbreaking, his brilliance is beautiful and his thoughts are totally soulful."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is a collage of bittersweet revelations. Joseph Heller shows you fault after fault in mankind, but does so with such enjoyable dry wit that you hardly realize he's pulling apart your perception of reality at the seams. It's a good thing, too, since otherwise it would be 430 pages of despair and hopelessness. By the end, perhaps, you might even be glad he flipped your view of life upside-down.The majority of the plot focuses on Captain Yossarian, a lusty bombardier who's convinced that everyone's out to kill him and wants nothing more than to be sent home. He's stopped at every turn, however, by the titular rule catch-22. Heller doesn't focus on the actual rule itself--it's mentioned by name only a few times in the entire novel--but rather on what it embodies and stands for. It states that for an officer to be grounded, he must be crazy, but he has to ask for it, though if he asks to be grounded on the grounds that he is crazy, he must not be crazy. Throughout the novel, catch-22 mutates into a way that the military can justify whatever it does. To quote Yossarian and his friend Doc Daneeka, \\"That's some catch, that catch-22.\\" \\"It's the best there is.\\" (Heller, 55)Between Yossarian's storyline are dozens of smaller stories about everyone around him, from his commanding officer Colonel Catchcart to the chaplain. These, along with the rest of the chapters, occur only in partial chronological order. For every set of chapters that appear in order, Heller throws in a story completely out of order. Sometimes they help explain the events of the surrounding chapters, but other times they seem to be shuffled around capriciously. The side stories also have a tendency to grow somewhat tedious, mostly because of a lack of dialogue and movement. It isn't unusual for Heller to continue a single paragraph for several pages; he has a liking for run-on sentences as well. Still, none of them are unbearably long or boring and they do give the reader a chance to see events from the multiple characters' points of view.Most of the book takes place in the Air Force base where Yossarian lives, but there are a smattering of scenes set in Rome and smaller locations throughout Italy. Heller obviously did his research on WWII, as there's very accurate descriptions of technology from that era. Unless the reader was there themselves, they might come out wondering if Heller was actually a bombardier himself.Catch-22 is the epitome of military satire, but Heller doesn't let his choice of setting limit himself. Nothing is safe against ridicule: society, bureaucracy, and humans themselves all fall prey to his dark wit. Still, for all his jabbings in the ribs of life, his humor usually stays well away from being tasteless. If you do throw Catch-22 down in disgust, it's probably because you just realized how incompetent man really is. In that way, his style is somewhat similar to Douglas Adams, though more subtle and less quirky. Heller's sense of humor may be so subtle, in fact, that readers more used to conventional and obvious humor may completely miss some of the implied jokes. Mixed in with the biting comedy are ideas that really make the reader think: \\"You're inches away from death every time you go on a mission. How much older can you be at your age?\\" (Heller, 48) At times it seems like Heller is softening the reader up with humor just so he can blindside them with a ponderous thought.Despite it's age, Catch-22 is a surprising accessible read. It's hardly a book for young adults; Heller obviously wrote his most famous work for a very adult audience. There is some rough language and adult themes. Some readers may be intimidated by it's length, but aside from a few sluggish parts, the book can get rather exciting.Readers with a bit of patience and an open mind will probably enjoy this novel. Heller will make you laugh, cry, and possibly rethink your outlook on life. Even before you turn the last page, you will understand why Catch-22 has earned its influential place in literature history."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 is among the funniest books I've ever read. This story of a sane man in an insane world follows an airman's exploits in Europe during World War II. Yossarian, the main character, has only one goal: to stay alive when so many people are trying to kill him.The characters of the book, comprised mainly of members of his unit and various higher-ups, are well-developed and lead to a lot of laughs. Because of the depth and quantity of characters like Milo Minderbender and Major Major, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of who's who but well worth the read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Every character is free to think what they want of themselves, and of anyone else they come in contact with. Everyone is paranoid of everyone else being crazy, no one can truly diagnose someone else as being crazy, for if a pilot says he should be grounded because he's crazy, he's showing concern for his well being, therefore he can't be crazy. By saying you're crazy, you're not crazy. I live in a major metropolitan city, and strangely enough, although not to me, every character is free to think what they want of themselves, and of anyone else they come in contact with. Everyone is paranoid of everyone else being crazy, no one can truly daignose someone else as being crazy. It's strange how art imitates life, or perhaps I'm crazy and I'm just seeing life imitate art. But if I say i'm crazy.....Best part of the book was when Yo-Yo starts moaning outloud at the sight of General Dreedles nurse, and then everyone else starts moaning outloud right along side of him, right in front of their General. I was in stiches.

This cleverly written work of fiction is filled with masterfully utilized irony, paradox, humor, and suspense. It is a shocking novel that makes you chuckle, but with regret. Yossarian is one of the most unforgettable protagonists, the ultimate anti-hero. In addition, the novel is lush with characters crafted to make you laugh, cry, gasp, or pound your fist in rage. I once read another review of this novel in which the reviewer said the novel was &quot;frustrating.&quot; I agree, to an extent. It is frustrating because Yossarian is constantly trying to get himself out of a horrible situation, but he keeps getting sucked back in and trapped (hence Catch-22). If you are looking for an easy read, this is not it. But if you are searching for a fun, hilarious ride of a book, you've made a wise decision."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is the kind of book that makes you sit back and think.

If that seems like a paradox, it is, but it is only one of many in this hilaroius novel. This book is considered to be a stylistic masterpiece becuase Heller creates huge, laugh-out-loud funny moments by describing everyday situations in a way, and with a certain tone, that makes them seem ridiculous. Everything from standing at attention to picking up prostitutes while on leave is funny in this book, and the truly amazing thing is that Heller does all of this while at the same time bitterly satirizing the military, big business, and the lunacy of combat itself."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 has to be one of the funniest books that I have ever read.

It was fun to see how stupid the military can be and how shallow people are.

Heller has provided his main protagonist, Yossarian, with a representative voice of the disaffected, disillusioned and downright dishonest. The humour of the book is grounded in realism, whilst the realism itself is possibly grounded in both sadness and humility.

The story utilizes absurdist circumstances and disfunctional characters to portray war, and the American military machine as a \\"damned if you do, and damned if you don't\\" hell where a sane person just doesn't fit in.Some of the passages were laugh-out-loud funny, but overall it was a bit dark and absurd for my tastes."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is a great novel that is a lovely satirical work. It involves many characters with extraordinary personalities but the one that it centers around is Yossarian. He is a witty man that is constantly trying not to be killed while serving his duty inWW II. He meets many people and goes trough many trials in this book. One such trial occurs very early on in the book and uses the phrase that yields the books title. Yossarian finds a catch in the system that says that one will be sent home if they are crazy enough not to fly an airplane into combat. The doc tells Yossarian that he must first tell him that he is crazy, and then most have someone vouch for him. Yossarian then assumes that one would be able to be let go if they go through that but the Doc adds one more stipulation. He says that if someone asks not to fly because they are crazy they can't be crazy because anyone that doesn't want to die must be sane. This, Doc Daneeka notes, is a catch-22. The phrase catch-22 actually was put in the dictionary because of this book. If that does not show how important or impressionistic this book was on its time I don't know what will.This book is funny from beginning to end. It shows another side of war. Most books don't refer to the human struggle inside a war but to the battles that the war consists of. Catch-22 uses humor to show how the struggle between one's self and his own people affect him in war. This book shows many people how war can affect someone in more ways than one.I really enjoyed this book and think that it is a must read. One reason that makes this book just a little better than others is the fact that it has been banned. The fact that people actually cared enough about this book to ban it means there has to be something good in it. This book was banned because it refers to women as whores. This book does not dwell on that though. If one really was offended by that they could just as easily substitute another terms such as \\"elegant young lady\\" in for whore.

While is is a great study into the insanity of war and has many truly hillarious moments, this book just doesn't flow. You'll be reading about Yossarian's present problems and suddenly you will be reading about some incident that happened in the past, and there won't be so much as a transition, then you will be right back to the present. This is why I gave it 4 stars.On the other hand, this is an excellent satire on war and its insanity, and is laugh-out-loud funny. The book follows a crazy bombardier named Yossarian who is uncanny for pointing out paradoxes and contradictions in the modern psyche. Yossarian wants to get out of the war, and he pursues several avenues, but is thwarted on one end by a neurotic, brown-nosing Colonel Cathcart, and on the other by the melancholy, and also neurotic, Doc Daneeka, who will not allow him to get of by reason of mental defect. I wish I could post a funny line that had me laughing, but there were really few individual lines like that. Mostly there were exchanges between Yossarian and the people he meets. This book is not beach reading: you have to really concentrate to see what's going on. But it was a fine read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Laugh out loud funny at times, Heller's catch 22 will bring you quickly through an otherwise unfunny topic.

Pompous officers who care nothing for their men, but are willing to &quot;sacrifice&quot; to win the war, when the only true sacrifice comes from men like Yossarian, who they so readily send into harm's way for their glory - oops! I mean to win the war.There is the war profiteer who sees no wrong in scr**ing his buddies as long as he makes out OK.

I write this however because all that can be said about this book deserves to be said and is worth saying again and again and again. &quot;Catch-22&quot; is a monumental creation, the product of a brilliant inspiration that does not recognize itself and such and thus plays things out on its own terms, without pandering or pretention. I believe that this book came about simply because Joseph Heller had a unique vision and chose to record it. It just so happens that what was unique about Heller's vision was his ability to view the true madness of the world and then distill that madness into images and words, recording his viewpoint with shocking clarity.I will not deny that the presentation is ludicrously over the top. What I will argue is that this book could have been written in no other way. Heller saw the world in general, and war in particular, as irredeemably absurd. To be honest then Heller had to paint an absurd picture, and make sure that it could not be mistaken for anything but absurdity. It follows that the presentation should be equally absurd. This is only one way in which which Heller give the finger to conventional literary wisdom. &quot;Catch-22&quot; was written to defy socio-political conventions and it would be hypocritical to adhere with any closeness to conventions of the arena in which he chose to make his stand.Two common criticisms of &quot;Catch-22&quot; are that it lacks a strong plotline and that it is too long. The first criticism is perfectly legitimate. &quot;Catch-22&quot; not only lacks a &quot;strong&quot; plotline, it comes very close to lacking anything that could be considered a plot line at all. Why, I ask, should Heller have sacrificed his ideas and vision for the luxury of a fabricated plotline? One of the major themes of &quot;Catch-22&quot; is the pointlessness and circularity of war, indeed, of life in general. It is only one more example of the integrity with which &quot;Catch-22&quot; was written that Heller chose to structure the novel in a way that would reinforce the that theme. Who needs a plot, anyway, when the theme is so strongly evident and so soundly delivered. As for the length, I don't think heller could have encapsulated the enormous scope of this book in any smaller framework. Once one gets into &quot;Catch-22&quot; it becomes an intoxicating, encompassing, and overwhelmingly enjoyable reading experience. Dealing with the length of the book is not a problem when it is enjoyed as thoroughly as I enjoyed it. It also allows for repeated readings, as one can crack it open at almost any point and read on indefinately, find fresh enjoyment and enlightenment in each page. &quot;Catch-22&quot; was brilliantly concieved and delivered and will be just as convincing hundreds of years from now as it is now."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I have read this book many times over and I never tire of it. This is one of the greatest novels in the history of the United States, at least in the last 100 years. It is a roller coaster and the sarcastic and wild characters come to life more than some of our own lives. This book should be read by everyone because although it is first seen as a comedic story, it is serious in its ability to show the problems with the world. Colonel Cathcart just wants to get ahead in the army and only wants a raise. Milo wants to become rich beyond his wildest dreams and Yossarian just wants to live. This novel has inspired me, myself to write a novel, which I am currently in the progress of. Hopefully, Catch-22 will do the same for you."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is probably one of the best books I've ever read. It's a hilarious satire on the insanity of war and bureaucracy. However, the book can be rather hard to follow at times because of the way that Heller moves back and forth. The book is not organized chronologically either. It is organized more through important events regardless of their place in time. The flashbacks kept me on the edge of my seat, however, because of the fact that only a small amount was revealed every time a situation was referred to, until finally the whole scene is revealed. The book evolves from a comedy to tragedy throughout the story, such as Yossarian's trips to the hospital. Which eventually grow from silly made up illnesses, to serious life threatening ones."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"As anti-war propaganda, this book is pretty good. All Quiet on the Western Front was better, but not nearly as funny. That's where Catch 22 excels. The book did not convince me that there is nothing worth fighting or dying for (remember the Holocaust?) but it does make you question why you are fighting and whom or what you are fighting for. Heller has incredible wit and humor, and if you can get past the overwritten prose (seems like every other word is an adjective) you'll find some real gold here."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Awesome book - the funniest book about the saddest topic that I have or ever will read - Everyone should read this - especially if you are, have been or will be in a bureaucracy (read - everyone)"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Basically, I'd like to rate this book at 5 stars to keep the average up statistically, in essence, recommending the book in that way.

It is definately the best war novel ever written, maybe the the best novel ever. Heller should be praised for clearly (and not so clearly) stating something that everyone felt but never expressed. So what if he took a chance? War is brutal and ugly, and equally crazy as well. For you who wonder about the plot, stand in a puddle and stick a fork in a wall socket.

IT'S THE BEST"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Although literate, accessible, and sometimes brilliantly written, the characters' lack of humanity blunt the force of Heller's satire. Ironic that a novel so beloved by the Sixties' generation contains no real individuals, just a batch of comically drawn stick figures cascading down an endless mudslide of absurdity.Yossarian is a bore. A hero in his own right for having flown so many dangerous missions, he runs away from heroism to become an epic-slacker and whiner. It could be said that this slacking and whining is how Yossarian's dread of flying missions manifests itself. But could an airman, a bombadier who has seen and inflicted and endured so much suffering really act as he does, even given the book's absurd context? While Catch-22's fans may see him as an anti-hero, I see him simply as an anti-human.The real disappointment for me, however, was that the book was not even sporadically funny. I've laughed out loud at the best of them--Twain, Wodehouse, Evelyn Waugh--and nothing, not one single scene comes within puking distance of these masters. The mediocre Marx Brothers patter, the Keatonesque knockabout, and the ante-Stranglove absurdity are all recognizable and should amount to something--but they don't. It is like sitting through a four hour stand-up comedy routine where a skilled and ingenious performer does everything including painting his genitalia green and none of it adds up to funny. In this sense, Heller is a skillful and often ingenious storyteller, but he is not a particularly funny one.Okay, now that I've dumped on Heller and laid my curmudgeonly, sourpuss opinions out there for you all to see, is there somewhere else where you can read a funny book about WWII? Yes, most definitely: Evelyn Waugh's Sword of Honor trilogy. This book has everything working against its being funny: a dull central character (calling Guy Crouchback a hero would be a gross overstatement), a dreary, failed marriage, and lots of tedious training far from the heat of battle. But out of these unpromising situations, Waugh creates a story that is both uproarious and profoundly moving. Put his Apthorpe up against any of the martinet officers in Catch-22 and tell me who it is that makes you laugh the hardest. Yet, when Apthorpe dies unheroically in the second volume, I felt a sense of loss--something I never felt in Catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 started off incredibly witty and profound and well, good. But after the first few chapters the humor gets old and repetitive, and towards the end of the book the humor was either no longer there or I no longer found it even mildly amusing. I had to force myself to finish the book and it took me weeks. The book also wasn't very action-packed. Don't get me wrong, I liked the book, and I thought it was somewhat insightful into war and human nature, but after awhile I found it to be tiresome and worn out. I'd recommend it for the first few chapters alone, and some of the characters are hilarious, but expect redundancy."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It took me a while to get into this. And the humor was the only thing keeping me going throughout, that and how it's juxtaposed with these scenes of war-induced brutality and human venality. Heller moves, often disorientingly, between the two. We get a a really funny exchange between army officers, then an incredibly tense, well wrought depiction of a bombing run over an Italian city. It definitely stretches between the psychological extremes of (what I infer from what military people tell me) what it feels like to actually be in a war. You have these long moments of dull, bureaucratic stasis and personal malaise, punctuated with brief moments of \\"oh god oh god oh god oh god they're shooting at me oh god oh god oh god I'm going to die here\\".I guess this seemed like a powerful indictment of authority circa 1961, and in a lot of ways it does antedate a lot of what the sixties was about. I guess if you're a baby boomer, it probably does seem like an unqualified masterpiece from your youth. For a young adult in 2010, not so much."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"with little time to read the book, the cd's let me listen in the car in between class and not keep me locked in once place reading."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is difficult to review because it swings between funny anecdotes and horrific descriptions of war.

The first time I read it, I was about 17 years old living in Russia. Anything American was good. The book was translated into Russian but somehow was not very popular. No one could really understand what it was all about. If it was about the WWII, it was at least strange. If it was an American humor, there was nothing to laugh about. It was not funny to bomb your own planes. And how could a captain walk around naked? Tomatoes, prostitutes, the CID men, crazy officers and nurses... People did not like it.Than I came to America and a few years later, I saw this book used, somewhere, and just for 10 cents. I could not resist. I read it again. I could speak some English back than but I guess it was not enough to understand the full depth of Catch-22. I liked it better than before, in Russia, but still not enough. It was just OK.A month ago, I was making more room for books in my house. Books, I did not care much about were destined to end their lives in the local library, as my donation. Catch-22 by Joseph Heller... I opened it again. What a mistake. What a surprise. I was stunned. It was one of the best books ever written. One has to know not only the language but the life in America and the Americans as well to understand this book completely. This book is not about the war. This book is about us and our lives and our regular affairs. This book is perfect and has to be an American classic. No, Catch-22 did not go to the local library.

For example, the fear of death is throughout the book and Yossarian has a tough time dealing with it. On a positive note, Hellner's characterization was intresting. He made simple &quot;average-joe&quot; characters stand out and have a role."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"'Catch-22' is a pretty famous book, so you might think you need to read it to be &quot;well read&quot;. Don't. If you read more than 20 pages you will just be wasting your time. You get the idea by the time you finish the first couple chapters, and after that it's just the same stupidity over and over again. Save yourself some time and trouble and just skip the entire thing."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is excellent. It is hilarious and filled with humorous characters. It made me laugh out loud several times. The people that find the plot hard to follow, as Heller jumps between time periods, are just stupid. I find the unchronological order one of the best parts of the book. It allows the reader to see the world as Yossarian does."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Although critically acclaimed as \\" An Apocalyptic Masterpiece\\" by the Chicago Tribune the absence of an on going plot prevents the reader from being consistently interested.

The last about 70 pages or so are probably the best part the book, but the rest is hardly worth reading. I didn't like the humor or his writing style. I will say that I have never read a book like it. But if you are into reading this type of thing, then it would probably be a good for choice for a read. Otherwise I'd say, with this book, just don't bother."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I got my order very quickly, and it was in perfect condition! I would definitely recommend this seller."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I can't quite place my finger on exactly what makes this book so superb, but it has to be one of the greatest books I've ever read. The choatic chronological order emphasizes that war itself is choatic. The insanity and insensitivity blantantly show the authors feelings on war, and opitimizes how we should all feel. Yossarian may seem like a coward or trouble maker to some, but to me he is a personal hero. He knows that sometimes it takes a bigger man to refuse to fight. Yossarian could teach us all something. The book itself also teaches you the ever apparent lesson that life just isn't fair. Too often, paper is wasted publishing books of little value. Books written about pointless and superficial things. Catch 22 avoids this catch, and becomes a classic."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is one of the funnest books to read.

If for nothing else, read it so you can learn of one of the greatest characters in literature, Major Major Major Major. He personifies the book as a whole: Insanely funny!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"What a disappointing book! I had been told by so many people how funny and amazing this book was, only to find it just okay. Many passages were chores to get through, and even Yossarian was annoying throughout the book. I'll give it this much--it is very clever, perhaps it was revolutionary in its day, and the last sixty pages almost make up for all the weaknesses throughout the book. I guess most people SHOULD read it, but it's a lot like doing homework."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book has no organization, no real plot, just a plethora of strange and demented people. I just loved it. This one is a keeper. It gets funnier every time you read it. I've read it at least four times, and can't get tired of it. Definately deserves to be above Brave New World in the top 100 list. Keep in mind, in Chapter 39, the definition of Catch 22 is &quot;They have the right to do whatever we can't stop them from doing.&quot; That stands out better than Doc Daneeka's, but that seems to stand out."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"There is no author that can write a book as compelling both comically and dramatically as Joseph Heller does with Catch-22. The pop-culture, counterculture classic reflects the down and out 1960's through WWII. The look of the world through Yossarian's eyes is hillarious at first, but at second thought-sad. The fact that he believes everyone is plotting to kill him reflects the horror of war. If you do decide to read it, beware. It starts of with a rocket, and the first 100 pages are the funniest of the book. After that, it slows down in the middle, and is a lot more meaninful. But around the 220s the book gets going again and countinues to be funny and horrific. The passage of with Snowden, especially. Bravo Mr. Heller."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I read this book for a Grade 13 high school essay and it is extremely captivating. Heller builds each of the many characters so well it is like you know them personally. His detailed filled pages make you feel as if you are really there. Feel Major Major Major Major's pain!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is absolutely a brilliant book. Everyone should read it, whether they like historical literature or not (I don't in particular). Give it a chance! I loved it. You'll meet some hilarious characters, and it's unlikely that you couldn't relate to one of them. I, personally, saw a bit of myself in the chaplain."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"catch-22 has the cleverest and funniest dialogue of any book I've ever read.

But then I could put it down. Now, I find myself having similar conversations with my friends every day. I must read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 for me, before reading it, held a mythic position amongst books. This mainly stems from the fact that my mom gave up reading it at about page 50. From that point on I was determined to read it, to get through it, and to my astonishment, that was not too hard a task. Catch-22 is an hilarious book, one of the most funny books I have ever read, but it goes far beyond that. While reading the novel, the most wide range of emotions will be felt by the reader. You'll laugh at the escapades of Yossarian and his squadron with prostitutes in Rome. You'll fell heartfelt sadness for the dead man in Yossarian's tent, who never even got the chance to unpack his bags, as well as for the memory of Snowden, just a boy who died too young. At times you may be surpirised and confused, but that's the plan. A novel that many consider to be some of the best writing ever done by an American, it does not disappoint. Set at the tail end of World War II, but going beyond pure criticism of the war, Catch-22 will make you laugh, and then cause you to think seriously at what you're laughing about. If your asking yourself whether or not to read Catch-22, condsider what the author himself said about it. When told by a reporter that he had not written anything better than Catch-22, Heller replied simply &quot;Who has?&quot;"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"As a senior in Mercy High School, I have been forced to read many a novel. When I first chose to read this novel I dreaded that I would be preached to on the glory or horror of war throughout my reading. After completing this novel, I can honestly say that Catch-22 is the best novel that I have read throughout my high school career. Joseph Heller lets the reader decide whether war is good or bad and never forces his opinion on the reader. The characters act with human emotions and their reactions are as any real person's would be. Although the stories tend to bounce from one to another, in the end they come together and form a complete story. I was unable to put this book down and wholeheartedly recommend it. This is one book that you will not regret reading."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Just wanted to vote for this as best novel of the second half of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"this is a really difficult book to truly follow- however with much effort, and time, the characters, especially Yossarian, are brought to life and compassionate! I attempted to read this about 10 years ago, and put it down early. Now, after finally completing Atlas Shrugged (another tough read that took me two tries), picked it up again, read it through and enjoyed the predicament that poor Yossarian finds himself in (how to get out of flying that next bombing run). One recommendation- see the movie of the same name after reading the book, so that you can appreciate the effort that went into making a movie of it... Also, anyone who says &quot;&quot;catch 22&quot; saw the movie it was great&quot; who didn't read the book can have no clue about the true meaning of Heller's classic!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"From my title, one can assume.

The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn't quite jaundice...&quot; It didn't stop and as each character was introduced, and a whole new story was introduced, it got funnier and funnier depicting how ironically stupid the comanding officers are as well as the ridiculous rules that govern the soldiers. Through catch 22 clauses, men are unable to fulfill the orders given, defeating the whole purpose of giving orders. Through these clauses, men are unable to satisfy their goals which just turns the situations round and round in the most comedic way.I was intrigued by the amount each character was developed. Almost all had a chapter dedicated to them and almost all i grew to adore.

But being an avid reader of non-fiction myself, I wanted to turn things around and give fiction another try. I chose as my debut work Heller's Catch-22. I couldn't be more pleased with my choice.The book is just brilliant and very funny. I found myself laughing out loud so many times. Heller has an amazing talent in describing people. By describing someone's appearance and habits it makes you think you have actually met the person, as with the Colonel who was described as someone who uses words such as apogee and panacea.Reading the first one hundred pages or so I felt a little overwhelmed with so many characters. At that point I thought the book was going to be just that, an endless list of characters, but the best was still to come. All the insanity of war is revealed in an outrageously funny and tragic way. I have a feeling folks in Washington DC should be reading Catch-22 right now.It became sort of a tradition among reviewers of Catch-22 to pick their favorite character. For me it's a hard toss between Milo, Orr, and Yossarian, of course; but I pick Orr.Leonardo Alves - Houghton, Michigan - February 2003"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is very funny and entertaining. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys off-the-wall humor with a heavy dose of cynicism. The book revolves around a war but that is hardly the point of the story. The war serves as more of the background that the author uses playfully to get his messages across.The book is filled with very entertaining stories of our hero off to battle, trying to fight his way out. He tries everything only to find that war, and life, are full of catch-22s.Overall, this is a great story that relishes the dark side of humour. I would recommend it to anyone who has a liking to war stories and/or strange stories such as those by Kurt Vonnegut.Side Note: if you are looking for more serious war novels then you should consider the Naked and the Dead by Norman Mailer or the Gathering Storm by Winston Churchill. Both are great books that deal more with the real character of war."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It really is a smattering of all the concepts that makes a great literary work. Bursting at the seams with different themes, I found Catch-22 to be uproariously funny yet awfully saddening at the same time. You can be laughing your head off and pitying the poor soldiers simutaneously.The range of emotions this book displays and yanks right out of the reader is quite impressive. I'm not a fan of war-related books because it's just not my forte - but Catch-22 is definately an exception."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The novel Catch 22, by Joseph Heller is dismissed by many as being a book simply about World War 2, which on the surface, it is. However, after analyzing the novel more thoroughly, one finds that not only does it describe WW2, but it also serves as a social commentary on life at the time. Written in the early sixties, Catch 22 accuratly describes life in the 1950's using Yossarian as the voice of a generation. The novel also does an excellent job juxtaposing the of fear of death with the uncertainty and often times irony in life.This novel is a must read for anyone interested in fifties society, culture, the atomic bomb or the second world war."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Great classic book and I think that all jr to high school kids need to read this book. It is a little 'rough' for younger kids, but if they ar a bit more on the mature side for their age - READ IT...."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is a sometimes hilarious and sometimes sad book about the absurdity of war itself, and especially the running of a war machine. The protagonist suffers through one disaster after another barely keeping his life while those around him lose theirs. While it sounds like there is no room for laughter in this book what with the deaths of all his friends, the author just hints at the death scenes which are presented in full towards the end of the book. Thus the end of the book is more serious than the beginning. The description of life in war torn Italy is especially difficult to read because it is so evocative of the way life was during World War II. I highly recommend this book for both it's serious aspects and funny moments."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I've read this book four times, and I want to read it again. It remains fresh, funny and intriguing with every read--a true masterpiece of American fiction."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I read this a few years ago as a freshman in High School. It was just as good as I remembered, and it remains as my favorite novel."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I'll be brief since there are so many reviews already out there: I have never read a book that can match this one in terms of characters, dialog and writing style; it is both immensely entertaining and profound."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Before writing a book review, I always attempt to determine what the intent of the author was and how successfully the desired effect was achieved. So what, exactly, is the purpose of Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22?\\"Is it to provide a biting satire of the reputed leaders of the Armed Forces? Is it to illustrate the dehumanization of war by a blind bureaucracy? Is it to entertain us with a dark comedy and clownish, cartoonish figures like Colonel Cathcart? Is it, perhaps, to parody the excesses and extremes of capitalism and communism through Milo's syndicate? Is it to illustrate the horrors of war in graphic detail? Is it to convey the inevitability of death and futility of escaping your ultimate fate? Or is it simply an exercise in paradoxical reasoning and illogical logic?The answer, of course, to all of these questions is yes. Heller has delivered a masterpiece of a novel, one that works on many levels. His unorthodox methods prove triumphant in the end. Through light comedy, absurd logic, and haunting flashbacks, Heller presents a war, which may be fought for idealistic purposes, but is executed in an arbitrary and self-defeating manner, whose only glory lies in the odious commanders. Although this is not an anti-war novel, it certainly criticizes how the war is fought.Catch-22 could be divided into two parts. The first 2/3 of the book provides a circular timeline, as the non-sequitur chapters help to paint a vivid picture of the lives of Yossarian and his comrades. At first, only minor details are revealed. As the chapters progress, though, the details are filled in, like an intricate jigsaw puzzle, and the reader is left to ascertain the meanings of earlier, cryptic inferences and allusions. In these chapters, a light comic mood prevails, interrupted periodically by such accounts as the siege of Bologna. Indeed, some of the chapters are high-comedy. If M*A*S*H wasn't inspired by this novel, it sure borrows some of the same comic elements. However, Heller reminds the reader that there is still a war going on, as death and destruction come into the forefront periodically. The last 1/3 of the book provides a linear timeline and marches incessantly toward the final climax. In these chapters, the mood turns much darker and sinister, as the deaths pile up and the humor dissipates.Heller provides a portrait of each of Yossarian's comrades in the squadron. Some, are comical and absurd, such as the enigmatic Major Major, who only allows people inside his office when he is out of the office. Some are idealistic and sympathetic, such as Clevinger and Nately. While others are boorish and brutish, such as Colonel (take your pick). However, the narrative is told from Yossarian's point of view, so, although we are never told specific details about him, the reader can delve into his mind and discover the kind of person he is.Overall, Heller delivers a masterpiece. Catch-22 provides an entrancing, enthralling and interweaving narrative of details and ideals that paints a glorious picture of a war-time bureaucracy gone amok. If you haven't read it yet, please do. And if you've already read it in high school or college, read it again."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"There was only one catch, and that was Catch-22....Catch-22 is a book detailing the life and times of John Yossarian, and how war changes his life and his way of appreciating life.Yossarian, a bombardier in WWII, is constantly faced with the threat of death , when all he wants is to be immortal, or die trying. He is a quirky, witty man, and Catch-22 is full of humor, but one of the great things about this book is the range of emotion expressed by the soldiers. Although they are proud men serving our country, they are also trapped in a powerful bureaucracy focused on nothing but celebrity. Although they should have been commended for their bravery, they were thrust into the most dangerous missions for the most pointless of reasons: aesthetically pleasing bomb patterns.One of the main reasons you should read this book, however, is for the flashbacks of Snowden. It's a powerful scene that stays with the reader, with vivid description and detail. You feel like your're there with Yossarian and clueless as to what to do about a dying gunner on your plane.But more than anything, this part, along with the entire book, leaves the reader with a new perspective on death and war. War can be a corrupt system, with people supposedly hating people from foreign countries they have never met, and supposedly being friendly with those on their side, when it can be entirely the opposite. War can send young and old to die, and war can drive men crazy. But most of all, war changes a man, as Catch-22 shows.So if you're considering reading Catch-22, don't think twice...but do it. It's a book you'll never forget, and won't regret reading."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It is of the essence of every great piece of literature that at least some portions of the story do not make any particular amount of sense.This entire book is like that.Catch-22, in a nutshell, is one of the most bizarre, nonsensical, BRILLIANT books you are ever likely to read. The book is described as being the epitome of insanity because it is about life, an insane state of being. Catch-22 is a documentary of society and the pointlessness of war, but makes it points in such an odd fashion that the book may be lost on those without the cranial capacity to live as humans and who are instead content to live in sewers of humanity with only its dregs for companionship.But don't take my word for it. Read it yourself."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Is there anything new to say about this American classic? All of the cliches and superlatives apply. This is one of the most brilliant and darkly entertaining novels I could imagine, a true masterpiece. It has been my favorite novel since I was in high school, and it stands up to re-reading very well. I read it recently and was amazed at how different the experience was from the first time almost 20 years ago. As a teenager, I was struck most by the comedy. But now, as a 30-something military veteran and attorney, I focused more on the cynicism. It wasn't as much fun this time around, but every bit as provocative and interesting.

Since then I have read it four times over.Yossarian, the main charecter of this book, lives in a perpetual state of sanity which can make any normal, insane person almost dangerously sane.

The author seems to want to exagerate the characters so they represent the full basis of humanity .The story for Catch-22 seems to be forcing an anti-war theme along with the books story line for the reader can grasp that war is hell even for the people on reserves. But all good books have there problems and so does this book one of the biggest flaws is the sequential order of the chapters there is written in a way that does not follow ordinary time . It's story telling method closely resemble a quintin tarentino film rather than a book. Another diffuculty is the authors use of medaphores you may read sgt.lock heart loves to parade but in saying parade they really mean how he conducts his bussiness.

Does no one realize that Catch-22 decries not simply the military, but all bureaucracy and the brutality which abounds when people can hide within such complex structures? Does no one see that Yossarian was a patriot -- only not by the definition of his countrymen? Do any of those who denounce this book as &quot;anti-war&quot; comprehend that the only alternative to being &quot;anti-war&quot; is to be &quot;pro-war,&quot; and to be &quot;pro-war&quot; is barbaric?Is there no one righteous?"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller's, Catch 22, is without fail one of the best books ever written.

For one, glory and honor are not depicted as characteristics of soldiers who are in combat. Yossarian isn't exactly on the front line, like Paul in All Quiet on the Western Front, and his ability to go to Rome allows the reader to see that although combat missions are forced onto him, he is still a human being. He is not like a character that is so engrossed in the war whose condition is difficult for the average person to comprehend. Yossarian shows you his life, his inability to ensure himself survival, and the utter irony of war. The novel is captivating and evokes many different emotions: laughter, tension, shock, and sadness. There were many instances when I laughed and at the same time realized the horror of Yossarian's life. Heller's unique ability to illustrate war had a striking effect on me and remained with me for a long time."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is not a work of fiction but the pure essence of reality. If you've ever been a part of a private sector organization (business), the military bureaucracy, or any federal, state of local governmental agency, then you have some, most, or all of the characteristics of some of the lunatics in this book. Which one(s) depends on who you, in your true self, really are. War is the setting, but this book is based on human organizational psychology.

And yet you'll laugh, I promise, money-back garantee.The book has its own timeline, yossarian's (the main character). I haven't &quot;studied&quot; the structure or printed graphs about it :) but this aspect of the book is just unique, and brings magic to it.Nothing more can be said, you'll just have to read it now, and maybe that's another definition of the now famous Catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Fantastic. A quirky and off-the-wall read. Admittedly, the style took a little while to get used to, and I put it down a few times in the past until I had the patience to become accustomed to the stream of consciousness nature. Once I actually hunkered down and got into the book, though, I was completely rewarded. I have read no other book quite like this, which I mean in the best possible way.Don't expect to necessarily retain much by way of a plot, or to remember all of the myriad of characters that appear. Do prepare to be thoroughly entertained, however. The book is completely unique and hilarious, and is prophetic in the sense that its humor still applies to readers today, some 40+ years later."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"While reading this book, i got a big kick out of Heller's sense of humour. However, i found that it was something i enjoyed as i read, but the storyline was so choppy that it didn't stay on my mind when i wasn't reading it. As things went on, i got the feeling that, for all it's erratic wisdom, the story didn't hold together well, and would soon burst out of its binding, and lie scattered and no longer useful or respectable. Happily, I was very wrong, and the latter part of the book was an ingenius bringing together of the whole crazy plot, and the resolving of the recurring passage throughout the book made for some of the most intense reading i've experienced. Brilliantly pulled off."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 did everything that Joseph Heller wanted. Moreover, it did exactly what a classic should do: it makes you think. Why do we go to war? Why do we kill? Why did we follow the insanity of war that pervaded the twentieth century? I admire Mr. Heller for this. However, what if Hitler and the Nazi's overran the world because the allies did not find the rational to destroy or stop them. It is doubtful that any such book would have ever been written, let alone even discussed. There would be no free speech, no freedom of assembly or of religion - among other liberties. Yossarian would not be able to enjoy sleeping with Sheisskopf's wife because he would most likely be sent to a prison camp to die. And because the world still has a Saddam in control, killing will remain. I enjoyed the book because I am thinking about enlisting, and the book challenges me to consider that which is usually ignored. The author's reasoning forces me to deal with the issue of killing another human and why I would follow orders to do so. In the US and other countries soldiers willingly vow to defend their constitution to death. Can anyone say that all those who had ever enlisted were insane? Thomas Aquinas grappled with the hypocrisies of war, and derived reasoning on Just War in his treatise. Yossarian reflects what is very much prevalent in the twentieth century: the 'let-me-get-mine,' self-preserving disposition. Heller underestimates human character - intentionally or not. His crack on leadership is humorous, but not convincing. In reality, leaders - whether in the military of democracies or in democratic governments - for the most part are sane and intelligent enough to make wise and justifiable decisions. The book is excellent for its provocation. However, one should also take the other extreme. James Webb's Fields of Fire is an excellent novel depicting an USNA graduate as a Marine in Vietnam. The character in the end rebukes all the draft dodgers and protesters at an Ivy League school, calling them cowards and hypocrites for not protecting the same freedoms they were exercising and that other people were willing to die for. In all, Catch-22 either provokes praise or rebuke. The style is its own, as is the content. Whatever the opinion, enjoy the book for where it can take you. (Five stars for content and aim; one star taken away for the laboring style and uneasy transitions.)"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"left wing expression, but not bound by such sensibilities .. marvellous, funny, fantastic .. anecdotes which crescendo in a tour de force"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"God I get tried if writing reviews, I just want to buy a product and go on with my lifeSorryDavid"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is a story about one man's mission to survive a war and with all the satire to go along with it.This book was entertaining all the way through.

Heller adopts a completly original style for this work. He takes scenes of outrageous comedy and mixes them together with brutal descriptions of violent conflict. The contrast keeps the reader off balance; you never know what to expect next. Heller's amazing talent as a writer comes through in almost every paragraph. His dialogue is believable, sharp, and witty; his word choice is very precise; and his descriptions are incredibly powerful. Perhaps the most amazing thing about the novel is the way that Heller juggles his gigantic cast of characters.So, should you buy &quot;Catch-22&quot;? Here are a couple sample paragraphs. If you find these to be funny, you will enjoy the entire novel.&quot;Major Major had been born too late and too mediocre. Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. With Major Major it had been all three. Even among men lacking all distinction he inevitably stood out as one lacking more distinction than all the rest, and people who met him were all impressed by how unimpressive he was.Major Major's father was a sober God-fearing man whose idea of a good joke was to lie about his age. He was a long-limbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism. He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down. His specialty was alfalfa and he made a good thing out of not growing any of it. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa that he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn't earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major's father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done. He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county. Neighbors sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money a was therefore wise. &quot;As ye sow, so shall ye reap,&quot; he counseled one and all, and everyone said, &quot;Amen.&quot;"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I fondly recall reading Joseph Heller's CATCH-22 during high school. Yossarian, the wise yet trapped bombardier, spoke eloquently about the insanity of war to a generation who grew up watching news reports from the jungles of Vietnam. I was recently shocked to discover youths still read this novel as a rite of passage. My son, a college freshman, has spent the summer reading and discussing CATCH-22 with his girlfriend. As I've listened to their takes on this book, I realized that Heller's masterpiece was not merely a period piece. It remains a solid work that still speaks to the youth of today as it did too many decades ago."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller's Catch-22, is an unequivocal satire on postmodern American life, with messages of dissident revolt that are well suited to the decade in which they appear. Heller is almost systematic in the issues he touches: the frustration of the individual up against powerful and faceless bureaucracies; the anticommunist purges of the Cold War and its smug hypocrisies; and strong antiwar issues that dominate postmodern America. In Heller's works, escaping these traps and inconsistencies of government is essential in the pursuit of moral and self-preservation. After all, \\"The enemy,\\" as Yossarian puts it, \\"is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.\\""},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I started off reading Catch-22 slowly, not really getting into it, but that quickly changed. By the time I hit about page 110, I was hooked. From then on I spent all my free time reading it. This book is not only the best overall of books I've read, but it is by far the funniest. The hilarious schemes concocted by Milo to the hilariously sane logic of self-preservation provided by Yosarian make this book the best. That's all I have to say, read it, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller, in Catch-22, uses mainly humor, horror, and irony to convey his theme that war is irrational. Most of the chapters in this book are very funny. They centre on things that are ludicrous and silly. A great number of things happen in this book that could not and would not ever happen in real life. The characters in Catch-22 though, never notice the absurdities around them, and this contributes to the humor of the book. Heller shows the characters behaving as if everything is fine to show how soldiers in the war are made to do whatever their superiors want them to. Indeed, a major theme of the book is that the individual is powerless to stand against large institutions such as the military or big business. Different characters in the book symbolize the larger forces against Yossarian, the protagonist. Yossarian is constantly being \\"defeated\\" by these institutions, despite his brave efforts to oppose them. Heller also achieves his purpose though the juxtaposition of humor and horror. He will present a ridiculous situation and invite us to laugh at it, and then immediately present a feeling of horror, such as showing us that we are no different than the characters that are behaving so oddly. This juxtaposition is consistent throughout the novel. One of Heller's chief methods of conveying his hilarity and dismay is irony. His dry, cynical, irony fills the book with funny situations and afterwards makes one think more deeply about them. Heller amplifies the absurdities of war to make them impossible to miss. Heller's constant switching back and forth shows the reader that war is definitely irrational."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller successfully utilizes detailed character developement, an extremely sarcastic tone, and a confusing placement of events, in which he jumps from scene to scene in no particular order, in order to create a humorous yet realistic image of war and the politics that surround war. Heller titles many of his chapters after a character in the novel. This proves how important the characters are; rather than center the novel around events, Heller centers his novel around the characters. Which makes perfect sense. War may involve events, but more importantly, it involves people. Most of Heller's chapters also begin with a description of the character they are titled after. The first sentence of the chapter titled &quot;Colonel Cathart&quot;, Heller begins with &quot;Colonel Cathart was a slick, successful, slipshod, unhappy man of thirty-six who lumbered when he walked...&quot; Although how he walks has absolutely nothing to do with any of the major events of the novel, Heller tells us this in order to give a more personal image of Colonel Cathart. Colonel Cathart is a character in the war; he creates the events, the events do not create him. Heller not only developes his characters without leaving out any personal details, but also portrays the war and its charaters with much humor and sarcasm. It is impossible to read through this novel and not atleast smile. I even laughed out loud a few times. The tone may seem incredibly funny; however, the message is very grim. Heller is telling a story of war. The people in this war, as hilarious as they seem, are really very depressing. Every character has their own set of &quot;issues&quot;. Yossarian, for example, loves every woman he sees. If he lives through the war (another &quot;issue&quot;-obsession with death), he will probably have a very hard time finding a mate. These psycological and emotional damages are the ones Heller is attempting to portray. Usually the funnier it seems, the more devastating, realistically speaking, its effects are. Heller also has a tendency to put all of his events out of order. Perhaps this is to show how the veterans of the war see things, or to show that the events really aren't as important as the people. Either way, it makes the novel somewhat hard to follow, but does make us look more to the characters and their feelings rather than the events taken place. As human beings, we like to take the easier route, and following the character developement is much easier than following the confusing plotline, or lack there of. Overall, the novel was incredibly insightful. Most &quot;war books&quot; are very serious, but Heller's light tone makes Catch-22 stand out. However, we must not forget the underlying message. War damages people mentally, emotionally, and physically forever, even after it's over."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The way the logic of the book is twisted into the narrative is awesome- such as Heller's description about one lieutennant being attractive, intelligent, friendly, polite etc. , and therefore everyone hated him.My favorite instance of this logic is the best come-back to the &quot;What if everybody did that?&quot; attack: &quot;Then I'd be a damned fool to do otherwise!&quot;I also liked the &quot;It's better to live on one's feet than die on one's knees&quot; exchange.Read the book, get it: there's enough density, puns, and jokes here that you'll find things you didn't 4 re-readings later!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Book Description: Catch-22 is a tremendous blend of irony and satire. The book pokes fun at the paradoxes of everyday life in the military as it follows the tour of a young pilot, John Yossarian. Yossarian spends his tour of duty going from his station in Pianosa and the city of Rome, where the men meet with Italian prostitutes. While stationed Yossarian has to deal with the loss of many friends and the paradox of the mysterious catch-22, until he finally decides to leave using any means necessary.Review: The satire that Heller uses in Catch-22 is enough by itself to satisfy the reader. However, he also includes an interesting and action-packed storyline that is enough to make any reader enjoy the book. Heller's outlook on life, as expressed by the protagonist, offers a unique perspective on its irony. The use of a mysterious military directive, catch-22, is how Heller describes the irony best. For instance, Yossarian cannot be grounded from flight unless he asks to be due to insanity. However, according to catch-22, asking to be grounded demonstrates an appreciation for life, which constitutes sanity.The only downfall to Catch-22 is Heller's extreme use of stream-of-consciousness, the use of jumping through time as the protagonist remembers events. It is very confusing in the beginning of the book and makes the book difficult to start. However, as the book continues and more events are included, it becomes easier to establish a true timeline, and the book can fully be appreciated for the marvelous literary work that it is."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I have just finished this book for the first time. The message of the book should not be oversimplified. It isn't really anti-war: Yossarian, the author's mouthpiece, does want to win the war and beat the Germans, and as I read it, believes he has a true duty in this regard. It's just that he thinks he has already fulfilled his duty and is (at the time of the action) being played for a sucker. The war is in a declining phase. The outcome is all but certain. The career military people are positioning themselves for the end of conflict, and those anticipating a return to civilian life are positioning themselves to make money. Gen. Dreedle, who is a warrior general (not a buffoon, in spite of the satiric elements), is losing his power to the bureaucratic types as the end of the war approaches. The book is not propaganda on anyone's side; instead, it is a tragic meditation on decay, which accompanies even the most important victories. And it is comic in the best sense, in giving hope that individuals can hold out against that decay. Probably not the best book I've read -- partly because of the dated humor -- but still a must-read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I read this book when it first came out. I was a Senior in High School,the Vietnam war was raging and it was what EVERYONE was reading. Its hilarity and cynicism hit everyone where we were most concerned: war, the craziness of authority, and staying sane in a crazy world."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"&quot;Catch-22&quot; is really a great precursor to M*A*S*H, &quot;Hogan's Heroes&quot; and the like. Heller keeps up an impressive and exhaustive comedy through the whole book. Rarely does he get serious, and when he does, he doesn't get out of line. If you don't want to read about crudeness, sex, violence, and---well, reality, then for God's sake don't read this book. &quot;Catch-22&quot; is by no means a careless war comedy about a bunch of aviators who like sex and alcohol and screwing the general's wife (although all three examples are in the book). The plotline and timeline are complex and a recurring, ever-progressing dream of the main character gets more violent and grisly in each episode. &quot;Catch-22&quot; is very clever and complicated. Heller showed mastery of the English language in the way that he was able to maddeningly play off the book and its characters' verbal and oral device's. If nothing else, &quot;Catch-22&quot; is an excellent study in writing technique and conversation."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I love this book.....and I'm not even finished it yet.

Definitely one of thebest I've read EVER. Recommended VERY VERY much!!!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I was never an avid reader; that is, of course, until I read Catch-22. Singularly the best book I have ever read, I might even go so far as to say that it changed my life. It has always seemed a somewhat ambivalent book to me however. It never entirely takes one side of a subject over another, which accents the absurdity of the war and of the little island of Pianosa.The story itself is mainly about Yossarian, although he isn't completely the main character. He is not a coward, but he is not willing to let himself die (one of the more sensible things I've ever heard in my life!) He is a man of conviction, even if they are the &quot;wrong&quot; ones.Almost everyone around him is crazy, or seems crazy to him. Everyone around him thinks HE is crazy. Yossarian must suffer through one of the worst wars this century has ever seen. He wants to find his way out, but the absurdity of catch-22 won't let him.Catch-22 means that you can never win. A good example of catch-22 (which has now officially entered the English language to mean essentially the same thing) is when Yossarian says he should be grounded because he's crazy. If Yossarian wants to fly, he HAS to be crazy. However, if he wants to be grounded, he has to ask. As soon as he asks, he isn't crazy anymore, because he doesn't want to fly anymore. That sentence I just wrote might be a little hard to swallow and I recommend you read it again.Anyway, catch-22 is always showing up and Yossarian doesn't mind until it wreaks havoc on a little whore-house in Rome.Meanwhile the shocking surprise ending comes around with Yossarians idiot friend, Orr. Unfortunately, I JUST CAN'T give away the ending!!Catch-22 has always been a thoroughly enjoyable book and I've read it five times. It never gets boring and it always exciting and funny. If you don't read this book, you are suffering a GREAT loss. I might point out a quote I once read in a library copy of Catch-22 which said pretty much the following, &quot;You will either LOVE it or HATE it.&quot; Instead of just judging it immediately, read it once and if you hate, then you hate. But you should never forgive yourself if you refuse to read this book!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The phrase &quot;Catch-22&quot; is mostly used by supposedly literate people to convey the notion of circular reasoning. e.g., Yossarian couldn't get out of the war unless he was crazy, but - if he wanted out - he couldn't be crazy. That's one interpretation.As I see it, that wasn't really Heller's point. The real meaning of the phrase, as quoted from the book&quot; was &quot;Catch-22... Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.&quot;Great book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"If you want to know the horror of war, read &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; or &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; or &quot;From Here to Eternity.&quot; Bravery in the service of death. Blood and carnage. The inexpressable sadness of young men dying to validate the decisions of old men who draw lines on maps.But the thing we must remember is that wars have never solved anything -- we keep having them, and the lines just get redrawn -- and young men just keep dying.And that is absurd.&quot;Catch 22&quot; says that: If you want to get out of the next death-defying mission, you must prove that you are crazy, because a crazy person can't be allowed to go on such a mission. But if you try to prove you're crazy (and therefore don't want to go on the mission), you're sane and you have to go.I've read &quot;Catch 22&quot; 10 times, and every time I read it, I find something new to laugh at. As long as I can laugh at war, I think I'm a little saner than the old men who draw lines on maps. I'll keep reading it until I find nothing new to laugh at.After &quot;Catch 22,&quot; Joseph Heller wrote other books that were less than acclaimed. &quot;Something Happened&quot; was greeted with &quot;What Happened?&quot; I don't care -- &quot;Catch 22&quot; guarantees his place in the history of the human race's struggle away from war.I was in Vietnam, so I am almost an old man. I hope I never draw lines on maps. I want to always know what Heller was trying to tell us: War is not horrible. It is absurd."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Heller's masterpiece is one of those few books that can be appreciated even by people who haven't experienced war at all. As a 23 yr old reader, I obviously haven't been involved with WWII. However, this irreverent look at the absurd nature of all bureaucracies still affected me powerfully.Written like stand-up comedy, this continuous punchline takes the reader on a trip through the hell's of war as seen by Yossarian, a bombadier who thinks, rightly, that everyone is out to kill him. Yossarian's paranoia is truly bizarre yet seems to make perfect sense in a world changed by the presence of war.This masterpiece of modern literature holds as its core theme that war alters everything and everyone, and that people in such a situation become themselves paradoxes. The doctor who is obsessed with his own health, the chaplain who loses his faith (in an &quot;English-speaking, Anglo-Saxon, pro-American God...&quot; - one of the funniest passages I've read in any book), the tortured pilot who can't sleep unless he knows for sure that he won't be sent home and must fly more missions; all make this war satire one of the best two or three books I've ever read.

This mockery of war and all things associated with it never ceases to amaze me. Always dead-pan hilarious and exciting, Catch-22 is a rollercoaster -- no, a backwards rollercoaster! You never know when the next exciting turn will come, or where it will lead. It's laugh-out-loud funny, no exagerration, something rare, though much sought after. I can tell you that I've personally cracked up out loud many times in the middle of reading, something which scared my friends a little, who were sitting with me while we read &lt;grin&gt; The humor is sometimes blatantly reckless, sometimes hidden and subtle, but always well-thought out -- or perhaps not thought out at all! The wild onslought of characters and events is mind-boggling, yet fun. The events are occasionally a tad risque, but anyone who is mature enough to handle it shouldn't be swayed by it.

What a refreshing change! Although it took a few chapters to really get a feel for the rhythm of the book, I was instantly hooked. The atmosphere, the dialogue, the humor...head and shoulders above anything else I've read.It all revolves around Yossarian, a character that wasn't very likeable for a good chunk of the novel. As the story unfolded, he evolved from a coward, to a pitiable product of a dysfunctional environment, to a beacon of strength and sanity in an insane world.Heller's dry, satirical style was perfect for delivering this great story full of quirky, all-too-real characters."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I wrote to Mr. Heller a few months ago, telling him he was a major influence in getting me interested in reading and not juvenile crime. He wrote a small note thanking me. This book blooms with compassion, humanity and infectious wit. He will be missed."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The premise of \\"Catch 22\\" is about characters, particularly soldiers, getting stuck in situations where no matter their decision, they're screwed. Some reviewers have said that the point is made within the first 100 pages and so why another 400 pages. However, for me it didn't get old. Yossarian's zaniness and Heller's swift style make it like one punchline after the next, and who ever wants a funny book to end? Although there's strong socio-political undertones, one shouldn't read this book as anti-war, or expect any preachiness, because again, the hilarity sticks out first and foremost. Is it comparable with Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\"? Only insofar as it's a dark comedy about wartime, and both authors served in war (so they have credibility). Either way, Heller provides brilliant situational comedy."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"\\"Catch-22,\\" by Joseph Heller, follows the activities of a World War II aviation squadron in the European theater. Much of the novel revolves around Captain Yossarian, a bombardier in the squadron. Heller has crafted an outrageous satire of the military. He mercilessly mocks many aspects of the military: rank structure, chain of command, protocol, the military justice system, the chaplaincy, the military medical establishment, and more. Heller's squadron and its higher headquarters form a world of cowardice, opportunism, and scheming; particularly biting is his portrait of jealousy, vanity, and self-serving ambition among the senior officers.The book is filled with many absurd images and zany situations, as well as with characters who have such names as Major Major, Colonel Korn, and Lieutenant Scheisskopf. Heller's prose is a delight; the pages crackle and pop with clever wordplay and witty lines. The book made me laugh out loud. But the wacky comedy and merry prose style are wedded to a dark vision; the book is full of graphic violence and Kafkaesque nightmarishness. There are also some vividly rendered scenes of aerial combat. It's quite a remarkable blend.The story follows Yossarian and his comrades in combat, while being treated in the hospital, during down time on their base, and on their recreational excursions into war-torn Italy. We see the relationships among the squadron members, as well as their dalliances with the women they meet during their tour. And we also learn the meaning of Catch-22, a bureacratic clause that controls the destinies of these military men. Yossarian is a compelling antihero, and \\"Catch-22\\" is a richly ironic work of satire. The book has endured for decades, and is, in my judgment, more relevant than ever in the \\"global war on terror\\" era.."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It is hard to know what to think after you read a book like Heller's Catch 22. This is Heller's comical \\"masterpiece\\" in the eyes of many. It is definitely comical, but a masterpiece? That was a tough sell for me.The story shifts time, plot, and characters in manner that is confusing. It works well in this novel because the entire book is an ode absurdity. The total and complete absurdity of war. One can probe deeper into the real depth of the story underlining the humor, but ever Heller himself commented that it was little more than a dark, comic act on the stupidity of war. He did not even intend it to be a thundering social statement, but rather a refreshing look at the irony that exists in all wars.The main character of the novel is Yossarian. He is kind of the books anti-hero, if you will. Certainly he is the most famous. The book is filled with ridiculous and memorable characters and they are all interconnected by Heller in a rather ingenious fashion. No concrete plot exists, it is rather a map a random events that occur in the lives of these madmen during World War II. There ranges everything from a quiet, gentle priest, to a psychotic whore, to rich, indignant soldiers, to ordinary a Major; to ruthless a General's and so on. It would take too long to go into depth about every character. Rest assured, they are drawn out with style and individuality by Heller in some of the wackiest scenes you will ever read in a novel.Catch 22 is told in third person, but the majority of the focus is on Yossarian. Yossarian has his fair share of flaws and mishaps, but he tends to be the one we sympathize and root for more than any other person. Yet it is hard to root for, or care about anyone too deeply because it seems like you are always laughing. You laugh even when you should be horrified, because some of the scenes are indeed horrifying, but they are downplayed so much by Heller that our reaction becomes tampered with. Instead of a feeling of power, we are left with a feeling of confusion.The only novel I can compare it to is Vonnegut's darker, wiser Slaughterhouse 5. In that novel, the author was able to maintain a delicate balance between sarcasm, humor, and pain. It was easy to see the author was hiding the pain of his experiences in the war through the dark, sarcastic humor. That made it powerful and breathtaking, along with the humor. In Catch 22, the sarcasm and humor exist; in fact, it is actually a funnier book. However, the power and the pain do not shine through and the book seems like an attempt to downplay the seriousness of war. It left me confused at times with its dark, disturbing passages that should be powerful, but are not, because the book, for the most part, is usually told in a style of a comedic satire.Catch 22 is a funny and original tale of World War II. At times, the passages reach a level of total genius with witty and cutting remarks. At times, it even makes you laugh and think deeply on how ridiculous war really is. I admired the numerous weirdo characters Heller described. I just didn't feel any real power or awe to it all. It was like watching a dark comedy unfolding in front of your eyes. You laugh, but when it is all over it is quickly forgotten.Perhaps that was the flaw for me in Catch 22. I wish I could have taken it a little more seriously. I think Heller goes a bit too extreme with his silliness and comedy, because when the \\"powerful\\" scenes of horror and anguish did finally come, I found myself not really caring too much, but I felt that I should have been moved in some way. It was an awkward mix for me. Not to say that I don't recommend Catch 22. Many passages are genius and I love the originality. It is definitely, for the majority of the time, a hilarious read. There is just that one catch, and who knows, maybe the confusion I felt was just another intended Catch 22, among many others in the novel.Grade: B+"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"As my friends and I entered our AP English class one morning, our teacher handed out a blank page to each of us and asked us each to define \\"war.\\" Little did I know how much that definition, along with my entire view of life , would be changed as soon as I cracked the binding of the novel that we were to start: Catch-22.Heller's timeless novel, though written in the aftermath of World War II (the author, like the novel's protagonist Yossarian, was a bombardier who witnessed the destruction and chaos that war always brings), is so much more than a standard war novel; it has come to define society's outlook on all things modern, including patriotism, humor, individuality, pain and the truly heroic. It tells the beautifully unstructured-structured tale of a young man, Yossarian, grappling with the illogic of morality and self-preservation. The novel is anti-etsblishment in that it asks readers to always consider their actions before giving their blind allegiance (Milo's syndicate, the glorious loyalty oath crusade) to that which is spoon-fed to them. Stark, shocking and profound in its portrayal of its society of men (and, in perhaps its only, exceedingly minor, flaw, only men), Catch-22 draws readers in, keeps them hanging on every word, and never forgets to evoke emotion, moving from humor to pity and fear, realizing the tragedy of life and death.While many have criticized the novel for its non-linear approach, Heller's structure, syntax (including some of the most amazing sentences I think I've ever read) and language prove the man to be a master. The novel loops back upon itself, returning to heartrending scenes, subtly revealing more each time in its use of diction. Snowden's death is the clearest example of such treatment in the work, only fully complete as the book reaches its truly thrilling conclusion (I'm definitely not going to spoil any of the ending by telling you more--just read it!). Catch-22 is a novel that you can't put down, no matter how you try; characters and storylines all fall into place as you move from the novel's confusion to its own type of enlightenment (particularly in these troubling times)--stick with it, enjoy, learn and take a break from the novel (for I don't think one ever truly \\"leaves\\" it) a better person...you'll thank yourself for it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is one of my top 5 or 6 novels of the twentieth century. It has everything that makes it eternally relevant - the jokes, the characters, the situation - it could be anywhere, any time, any war. This book cannot date, and it will be read in a hundred years time and still be funny. But it isn't just a humorous book. The war scenes are very real and very powerful, and there is a lingering sense of death and horror in many passages. This is what makes it so good - it is a 3D portrait of the modern world. Our hopes and our flaws are captured forever."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I read this book twice this year, upon purchase from my college book store. It has become my favorite book since, and my &quot;guide&quot; and companion. I have read critical essays on this book, and have had time to contemplate it. Yes, I agree that the book is &quot;anti-war&quot; and at times, &quot;incoherent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;However, it wasn't so much &quot;anti-war&quot; as it was anti-establishment.(Many of the readers will recall the unforgettable villains such as--many of them, caricatures representing the inherent flaws of the war establishment-- Milo Minderbinder, Generals Peckem and Scheisskopf, Lt. Col Korn, Col. Cathcart, Capt. Black , ex-PFC Wintergreen, Cpl Whitcomb.) And if it had been &quot;incoherent&quot; and &quot;disorganized,&quot; it was because the author had deliberately planned the story to capture the absurdity and irrational logic of the establishment. In the midst of the corrupt and at times, inept corporate/military machine is our hero, Yossarian, and his squadronmates who are pitted in a struggle against the horror of war, and their own self-serving superiors and bureaucrats and an entrepreneur whose only collective interest is to enlarge their fold at the expense of human lives.&lt;/p&gt;Unlike many other books that have clumsily tried to emulate its inimitable style since its publication,--Winston Groom's FORREST GUMP comes to my mind--CATCH-22 balances exceptional hillarity with a biting warning against the absurd totalian logic of the system we often take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;Moreover, it gives us hope through Yossarian's--and perhaps, Orr's--final triumph against the Milo-Cathcart-Korn-Wintergreen Axis when they tried to subvert him in his weakest moment. Where George Orwell depressed his readers with the capitulation of Winston Smith to Big Brother/O'Brien in his 1984, Heller's main message in the book --that one can triumph against the establishment if he has the courage--offered me hopes.&lt;/p&gt;That is why it will always remain my favorite book. I cannot praise this companion/guide enough. (Novelist and former Secretary of the Navy, James Webb called this book his &quot;soulmate&quot; on the battlefields of Vietnam.) But I will say this. That if there been a rating scale of 10 stars, then I will give it 10 stars+.&lt;/p&gt;"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I disagree with the reviewer who said that readers should try not to be offended given the current global situation; this book is more relevant now than ever, for the war of today is even more disjointed and Catch-22ish than World War II ever was. This novel is simply brilliant, and despite its bleakness it does end on a hopeful note and is hilarious throughout with its cruel and unrelented exposures of the insanity of the military, such as the colonel who arbitrarily raises the missions to get his picture in the Saturday Evening Post and the chaplain's interrogation (in which he is found guilty of all the crimes he would ever commit; of course he is guilty, they are HIS infractions!). Through it all, Yossarian, the only sane character in the madness, tries to get himself grounded but finds himself repeatedly blocked by Catch-22, and tries in vain to convince others around him that he is crazy while at the same time they are all crazy around him. The novel reads like a dream, completely out of sequence and often making no sense, but in the world of Catch-22 everything you know is wrong, and afterwards you begin to question everything you know. The final paragraph, even though it's only three sentences, is a gleeful twist on itself and is the perfect ending to a perfect novel."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is awesome. Heller took the generally depressing and played out theme of war and came up with a hilarious piece of literature that shows both the humor and the horror of war. Characters like Yossarian, Milo, and Colonel Cathcart make you laugh out loud while characters such as Snowden amd once again Yossarian make you feel the pain and pressure of living life day to day not knowing if you'll see the next. The stress of being constantly in danger has driven the whole squadron of bombers insane but their antics make for a humorous storyline. Heller manipulates the device of absurdity to mold the story into a hilarious chain of events as Yossarian does everything in his power and some things that aren't within his power to avoid flying even one more mission. The characters are well developed (a new one in each chapter) and each one seems to have his own absurd, definitive quality that makes him decidedly Helleresque. If you want a well written novel that will make you laugh out loud, Catch-22 is your best bet."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I would first like to inform other reviewers that I am a high school junior, read this as part of a choice novel project, and had no trouble grasping the ideas that Joseph Heller presented within his Catch-22.The sarcastic attitude of this novel is conspicuous, and all bonds with reality are dropped with the first character introductions. The humor that has previously been criticized I found to be easy to understand, not monotonous, and a unique aspect to illustrate WW2. This is not to say the humor is for all, because Heller uses many paradoxes (look up definition of \\"catch-22\\"), simple one line contradictions, and subtle word choices to draw a laugh-all which represent the personality of the novel.Yes, there are many characters, probably over fifty, yet grasping the names is not important at all times. Of course you quickly get associated with Yossarian and the other main characters, and chapters do reintroduce people from the early parts of the book. This may be annoying, yet each character is distinct, and there is little chance of confusing Milo, and entrepeneur, with Havermeyer, the elite pilot. In truth, the novel lacks a linear time, but chooses, rather, to define the novel through numerous character sketches, focusing them loosely around Yossarian. By the later chapters of the novel, Heller subtly introduces the gruesome truths of the war, balancing the early humor with more realistic look. It is through this transition that the weight of the situation is elucidated, and by contrasting the final chapters with the first, Heller is able to attract our attention and force us to analyze the war.What is the novel about? There is no simple answer, yet if I attempt to state it in a single sentence Catch-22's theme, it would be \\"The only true fault of America's once the war began, was that we as a nation began to glorify war, without truly understanding the implications of our actions.\\"What is the idea behind catch-22 as a statement? Read the book. Enjoy. Open your eyes with laughter and tears. Perhaps you won't like the satirical tone, but I would suggest to all that you try."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It's difficult to write anything meaningfully different about Catch-22 that hasn't already been written. Rather than attempt that, I'll offer my personal experience with this book. I first read it as a teenager, in the mid-1970s. I'd read MASH (Hooker) before reading Catch-22 and was much more impressed with that book (and television series) than I was with Heller's work. Catch-22, I thought, was a part of the same genre: smart-ass anti-war books. It was funny, but bogged down in places and at times simply bored me - the whole bit with Milo Minderbinder, for example. And Major Major was a one-note gag that I quickly dismissed. To be honest, the part of the book that stuck with me throughout the years was Yossarian's having written, \\"I yearn for you tragically. A.T. Tappman, Chaplain, U.S. Army,\\" and the first two lines of the book.Fast forward to now - 2002: I'm in my early forties and, it is to be hoped, somewhat wiser and more experienced. For no good reason I've decided to re-read the book (I happened upon it in the back of a closet while looking for another book). A few pages in, I couldn't believe how differently I saw the book, the characters and how differently I interpreted Heller's message. After completing the book, I'd discovered that Heller hadn't written an anti-war book, or an anti-Army or anti-government book -- he's written an anti-institution book! The experiences he recorded occur daily in numerous corporations, government bureaucracies, school systems, society -- any setting in which an individual is faced with his anonymity and utter replace-ability in an institution. Major Major, far from being a one-gag joke, is the perfect archetype for the well-meaning mid-level functionary who finds himself powerless to affect change and simply chooses to operate \\"below the radar,\\" as they say, biding his time and trying to avoid being noticed until he's retired. Milo Minderbinders really do get ahead, and Lieutenant Scheisskopfs really get promoted to the top through no effort of their own!Yossarian was the main character of the book, but the true hero was Orr, who'd figured everything out and used the system to break free. He left tracks for Yossarian to follow, and, we can hope, Yossarian made it past Nately's whore to freedom as well. And, after all these years, I can understand the first two lines of the book.A few random musings: One - Having just seen the series finale to The X-Files, I'm struck by the correctness of fit between the two universes. Two - I bought a paperback edition of this book (Dell) in 1979. It is the same book I just finished re-reading, yellowed and somewhat aged, but otherwise in good condition. Quite a contrast to the novel (Time-Warner) I picked up last month that literally falls apart page by page as I read it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I'm almost at a loss to describe just how great this book is, but I'll give it a go anyway. Suffice it to say Mr. Heller's tale of war, courage, and madness is as relevant today as it was on its first printing. It's a book that will make you laugh, make you think, and make your heart ache all at the same time.This is the story of Yossarian, an American bombardier stationed on Pianosa under the command of the vain Colonel Cathcart. No matter how many missions Yossarian and his comrades fly, the colonel demands more of them, gradually raising the number from twenty-five all the way up to eighty. Yossarian becomes increasingly desperate to escape the certain death he knows is waiting for him, especially as his friends are seemingly knocked off one-by-one not just by German gunners but sometimes by friendly fire or outright bizarre circumstances--like being smothered by a cat. Surrounded by pompous, preening, madmen like Cathcart, Yossarian turns out to be the only sane person on the base because he still has at least a shred of conscience.The satiric wit employed to paint the Army Air Force as bumbling stooges might have seemed ridiculous until a few years ago. Now with Gulf War II and soldiers being sent on four, five, or more tours of duty it doesn't seem quite so far-fetched that a Colonel Cathcart or General Peckem could really exist.As good as this book is it can be a challenge keeping all the characters straight and all the events in proper order. And like a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" skit this goes on a little longer than it should until the bit starts to lose some of its impact. The end is tremendous as Yossarian does the only thing he can do in the face of overwhelming stupidity and madness.If you're a fan of M*A*S*H the movie or TV show then this book is right up your alley with its wisecracking antiheroes and bumbling commanders. Really to me \\"Catch-22\\" seems like the precursor to that movie/series only on a grander scale.And hey this is one of the only books to add a new word to the dictionary, so that's neat too. Go ahead and give this a read; you won't be disappointed.That is all."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is a brilliant story of logic and sense. Chronicling bombardier pilot John Yossarian's years in World War Two Italy, on the fictional island of Pianosa, the story brutally satirizes war, politics, and a myriad of human flaws. Heller blends a deep and complex narrative with sharp, intelligent humor to create a classic as thoroughly enjoyable as it is intellectually rewarding. Catch-22 is a must-read, one of the very finest pieces of twentieth century American literature.The story begins with Yossarian lying in a hospital bed, feigning liver disease in order to avoid flying on potentially deadly bombing raids. He is charged there with censoring the letters sent between soldiers and their loved ones at home and amuses himself by altering the letters in creative ways, often completely changing their meanings. Already the army bureaucracy is criticized, both for its questionable intentions in having the letters censored at all, and for allowing Yossarian to ruin them. Soon a new patient check into Yossarian's ward, a Texan. He \\"turned out to be good-natured, generous, and likeable. In three days nobody could stand him.\\" The patients' reaction to their amiable fellow sets the stage for a story full of such paradoxes and ironies. At the heart of the confusion in this instance is the Texan's extreme patriotism. The veteran soldiers in the room have become disillusioned with concepts like patriotism and honor and are repulsed by the Texan's reflection of their former naivet&eacute;. As each soldier miraculously recovers and returns to duty, we laugh at the absurdity of their overreaction, but we also wonder at the idea of being so repulsed by an ostensibly good quality like patriotism.The entire episode in the hospital, during which many important characters are introduced and recurring plot elements are brought into the narrative, is over in a few pages. Heller's writing is dense, but reads quickly and smoothly, so much so that readers who revisit a chapter, particularly after finishing the book, will find much more there than the first reading uncovered. In fact, Catch-22 practically mandates re-reading, as the story is often told out-of-order, from frequently changing viewpoints, and with crucial information revealed only after it is needed. Though Yossarian is the book's central character, each chapter brings a new soldier, officer, or civilian into the spotlight, exploring events from his or her perspective as contrasted with Yossarian's relatively sane view.The first character to receive this treatment is Clevinger. Unlike most of the book's military characters, Clevinger is intelligent, well educated, and highly principled. His unfailing optimism is frequently contrasted with Yossarian's outright pessimism. Almost immediately after his introduction, Clevinger has tries to change Yossarian's dark outlook.\\"They're trying to kill me,\\" Yossarian told him calmly.\\"No one's trying to kill you,\\" Clevinger cried.\\"Then why are they shooting at me?\\" Yossarian asked.\\"They're shooting at everyone,\\" Clevinger answered. \\"They're trying to kill everyone.\\"\\"And what difference does that make?\\"Both men make perfectly rational arguments, and both truly believe their words, and yet they couldn't agree more. Unfortunately for Clevinger, fate seems to prove Yossarian right. Not long after their exchange, Clevinger is put on trial in military court, apparently for no other crime than being \\"smart,\\" (and therefore a threat). The trial is perfectly absurd, and hilarious. A bellicose colonel demands to know the exact time at which Clevinger didn't deny his guilt, but refuses to tell him with what crime he is being charged. After much confused suttering, Clevinger exasperatedly admits \\"I always didn't say you couldn't find me guilty!\\" The colonel, finally appeased, says \\"That's much better, Mr Clevinger.\\"The trial is side-splitting, but its implied accusations are frightening. The blatant injustice in the military court goes entirely unquestioned by all but the accused. Not a soul questions the court's completely invalid logic or its motivations in attacking one of the most sincerely good men in the camp without cause. Yossarian's belief that the world conspires against the sane seems entirely justified as Clevinger searches desperately for some truth to hold onto, still unwilling to believe that Yossarian's worst fears might have been realized.Yossarian begins to devote himself entirely to escaping the war when his squadron's commander, Colonel Cathcart, develops a habit of lengthening his men's tours of duty whenever one nears completion. By raising the number of missions required of each man, he hopes to develop the best squad in the army and get promoted to general, but his absurd rule effectively pronounces a death sentence upon his men. Yossarian in particular is horrified, but struggles to find any way around Cathcart in the military's virtual dictatorship of insane and incompetent men.As the story progresses, Catch-22 darkens as Heller focuses on the facts of war and death. Everything Yossarian sees in Pianosa convinces him further that his own countrymen are out to kill him. The war becomes less and less of a reality as the men of the base gain a sense of the war's futility and the inevitability of their deaths. While Heller's sharp wit remains about him, it focuses more on true insanity than the quirks and character flaws that originally defined his characters. Each man on the island has his own battle with death and must decide what he believes, yet none of them can change the realities of their situation.As death looms over the island, each man reacts differently, but always in extreme and exaggerated ways. Many go into denial about their fates; others go mad trying to escape their combat duties. Yossarian grows distrustful of everybody and tries one desperate escape after another, obsessed with saving himself. Each character's fate has far reaching implications and serves to advance Heller's anti-war and anti bureaucracy crusade, but it is the result of Yossarian's quest for sanity that writes the final words on war, death, and sanity itself."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It's a really scary thing to be sane in a world that is insane. That's pretty much Yossarian's problem. He knows that the war going on around him and the people controlling things are crazy. Life, for Yossarian, is one enormous Catch-22; it often seems to be run by forces either hostile or totally indifferent to the human condition. All humanity can come up with is a sort of economic/power hierarchy through which they try to remain blind to the state of life. Capitalism has run amok, as have bureaucracies. Yossarian is alientated and trapped in near-despair and trying to figure out how a sane man is to live in a world that is against him?Catch-22 is one of the truly great novels of the twentieth century because it is so honest and so penetrating. It's not just a war novel; Catch-22 is a novel that really encompasses the current human dilemma. Yossarian is really an Everyman character trying to live in the postmodern age. His choice is seemingly whether he should choose to die as a victim of the crazy world or choose a living death by buying into the insanity. That's why this novel is so affecting and why Yossarian resonates with so many people. He's in the same situation. He faces the same choices in this life. Ultimately, Catch-22 is a towering novel for its hope as Yossarian finally finds the courage to live.I can't really say enough good about Catch-22. It's is funny and touching and so human. It's really a novel that shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I was made to read this book as a class assignment way back when and for once I was grateful!Very humorous and deep with an odd kind of spiraling writing style. The &quot;anti-war or not&quot; discussion is always hot on this satire classic and it's my bet the author would be proud of it.To me the war itself was the central Catch-22;the war that no one wishes to fight MUST be fought.Men who do not wish to kill MUST or be killed by other men with no wish to kill them...etc.I don't think it's anti-war necessarily;just against the pure acceptance of the idea without regret.The Armed Forces,war movies,Tom Clancy books,etc. never seem to acknowledge that in every heroic soldier there is probably a little Yossarian wondering how this all happened and why he must be a part of it(I thought Yosarrian found the other characters insane because he was the only one who questioned why they was there).I think it is the genius(and bravery)of writers like Joseph Heller and Kurt Vonnegut to HIGHLIGHT this and keep wars (and war movies...) from becoming like Lieutenant Scieisskopf's parades: all looks and no truth.One of my favorites.Now tell me why I'm wrong!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"What can one say about Catch-22? It's extremely well written and thought out. Full of dark comedy.

Powerful book, nothing but pleasure."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Amanda Daddona, Mercy High School, Middletown, CTJoseph Heller's novel, Catch-22, is an amazing piece of literature. Through his realistic characters and witty and humorous use of dialogue, Heller allows the reader to infer their own opinion about war and governemnt, and the effet that war has on individuals. Through the use of humor and understatement, he paints a picture of what war does to men; their ambitions, thir fear, and the inevitahle death of whoever happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, which he describes as \\"a matter of circumstance.\\" This novel portrays a host of characters, all believeable and true to life. Yossarian has a rational an understandable fear of death, and he questions an institution whose word is absolute law. Yossarian sees that good men die for antoher man's cause, and in turn question his own positon in the war and what he is doing there, fighting in a war he deson't believe in.The concept of Catch-22 showed the absolute power that the military had over the men, and also demonstrated how when soemthing is accepted and not questioned, it can have power over people. Catch-22 did not exist, but because people believed it did, it had power and influence over them.In the novel, humor is used in such a way that what is written seems light and fivolous, but really holds a deeper and more horrifying meaning. There were several instances of this: the interrogatioin of Clevinger and the chaplain, Cathcart's obsession with missions and getting into the Saturday Evening Post, the very definition of Catch-22, Doc Daneeka's \\"death\\", and Milo's extreme capitalism.The effects of war are plainly seen as well: Yossarion's progression from acceptance of his missions to falt denial to go up in a plane ever agian, his questioning of the war itself, the deaths of the men, Nately's girlfriend's insanity after she hears the devestating news, the ambitioin of the men of higher rank in the military, the chaplain's doubts and fears, and Milo's increasing empire, M&M; Enterprises.Despite all of the horrors, Heller presents us with a light of hope in the character Orr, Yossarian's comapanion who is more than he seems. He manages to escape and this gives Yossarian the extra push to make his own decisioin about escaping the trap that Catch-22 has him in.Each character, as I said earlier, is realistic and believble, which makes the novel more meaningful and appealing to me. There is a rainbow of personalitioes, from the quiet chaplain to outspoken Yossarian, the hypchondriac Doc Daneeka, the excessive capitalist Milo, the ambitious Cathcart, the fearful and awe-insiring Major____de Coverly, young and naive Nately, the prostitues, as well as many others. All of these characters are real people facing real issues that are connected to and rooted in war. There is a struggle for survival that these people must face, and they all face it in their own way. Some are succesful, and some aren't.Heller presents, then, a novel of paradoxes, a novel about war and survival, hoplessness and hope, ambition and humility. He describes the horor of war without actually stating it. And though this book deals with serious issues, it is also very entertaining to read. I laughed aloud numerous times and enjoyed reading every page. And so, this gifted author leaves us with a novel I consider to be one of the greatest I have ever read. I highly recommend this novel to anyone and eveyrone."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It is hard to define exactly what \\"Catch-22\\" is. At its most basic, it is a book about a squadron of American WWII bomber pilots who fly over Axis territory out of their base in Italy late in the war. More specifically, it is about one captain who has become all crossed up with the absurdity of the war.In the end, it struck me as being a book about being able to see the world from fresh perspectives, even when you think you already are. The ending of the book leaves you feeling strangely excited about the unseen possibilities in life.A must-read for anyone who enjoys fiction that delves into the philosophical."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It seems silly to be reviewing classics on their literary merit. Obviously, if a book's a classic, its merits have been trumpeted by much more qualified readers than myself. But I can always comment, perhaps especially when it comes to classics, on whether or not a book is enjoyable. Catch-22 is a very enjoyable classic. Some of the cleverest writing I've read. And clever in a good way, not just to be clever. Sarcastic before it was cool, outlandish, funny enough to make the serious stuff sting and serious enough (gut-wrenching at times) to make the funny stuff refreshing. Wonderful characters. And a portrayal of the idiosyncrasies of the Army that anyone who's ever been part of a large organization can relate to."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"There's one thing about this book first published in 1955 which, at the time of this writing, was darn close to a half-century ago: it is revered as one of the greatest American novels of the 20th century. In fact, there's some pretty compelling arguments why it could be considered the best novel of the 20th century. This from the critics.It's also an enormous international bestseller. That is to say, it's not some kind of weird, experimental thing with some enormous political axe to grind that normally wins Pulitzers and garners accolades from the effete in their ivory towers. This is a book that all kinds of people from all walks of life have read and enjoyed.Business Leader take note: when a book touches both the masses and the critics then something has been written that touches a chord in all humanity. This is something that you can learn from and use in your business setting. These books reveal the secrets about how everybody feels. It helps you violate the law against fooling all of the people all of the time, so to speak.We believe that Catch-22 has something even more special to offer. It reveals the truth about bureaucracy.It's a lot of fun today--and really has been since the time of the trustbusters in the age of Theodore Roosevelt--to hate big giant corporations. You can't sit in a coffee shop without hearing someone rant about Big Business and the evils it perpetrated upon the environment and people of struggling nations. You can't turn to fiction without constantly seeing Big Business presented as an all-consuming evil that manipulates nations and lives to its whims. The press has long delighted in portraying Big Business as preying upon the decent, the common, and the innocent.And in some cases they may be right.But there is a different truth. It is the truth that Big Business can't possibly organize itself and come to the kind of consensus necessary to prosecute the vast majority of the injustices for which they're blamed. The simple truth of the matter is that bureaucracy--that maelstrom of decayed policies, outdated procedures, the futile and whimsical direction of middle-managers who have given up home, the ambitious subterfuge of self-serving middle-managers who are--or perceive that they are--on their way up, all crashing together like the planetessimiles in a proto-solar system bound together by the gravity of a thousand conflicting agenda, beliefs, and ideals... that bureaucracy prevents.Big Business blunders. It blunders its way through the world achieving much more by accident than it ever does by intent. It is why Big Businesses, which has always founded its strength upon originality, daring, and speed retreat to defense in lawyers and regulations when they age and suddenly find themselves stagnant, timid, and slow. The inevitable gravitational pull of bureaucracy on any Big Business pulls all to an entropic heat death.Catch-22 is a case study in exactly that kind of bureaucracy. It is the bureaucracy of the military--but really the same infectious bureaucracy found everywhere--as it attempts to win a war. An endless display of very real people are introduced to this blender of military bureaucracy and it is reduced to the terrible comedic.People love to read this book because it is so funny. But it's funny because the bureaucracy is so familiar. The people's behavior remind us of how the world really works outside of the board rooms, court rooms, and throne rooms.Every business leader should read this book if only to become so intimately familiar with the face of bureaucracy, which will always be the final and most terrible enemy that any business can face.READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Captain Yossarian has a problem. He wants to live, but thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him! Every mission he flies as bombadier for the Army Air Forces could get him killed, and he wants to get out of the war. Unfortunately, the only way he can get out is if he's crazy, and wanting to get out is proof that he's sane.This is a biting, cynical indictment of beauracracy and the narrow-minded paper-pushers who make it so disfunctional. From the squadron commander, Major Major, who was promoted based solely on his name, to Colonel Cathcart, who keeps raising the number of missions needed before the crews can go home and volunteering his crews for the most dangerous missions, to General Peckem, who wants to add the bomb groups to his special services command, this book is full of over-the-top characters that are just barely within the realm of believability. This book is funny and infuriating, at the same time, and reflects the worst traits of any beauracracy."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is definately the funniest book published. And there aren't even any jokes-- just pure scathing irony and paradox, sarcasm and wit (the greatest forms of comedy). The style of telling is to be celebrated. The transitions are great (my favorite part); from one year to the next in one terse comedy of a sentence. It is all so compact in its delivery and connected through the text. Its told out of order, so certain anecdotes make much more sense and are much funnier later on. Yossarian, Yo-Yo, is the best straight man in literature. His cast of pals are uproarious in rediculous seriousnous over something that, in this new wonderful light, can only be laughed at (Appleby: &quot;Do I have flies in my eyes?&quot;). It is both sad and comic, by the sheer weirdness of it, as well as pathetic and selfservingly hilarious. The small repitions of mundanity are going to catch up to you; the intermittently gradual reintroduction of small details will seem peculiarly silly. And the serious parts --Snowden's &quot;I'm cold,&quot;-- are beautiful, gritty, real, shocking fiction. Heller was a wonderful writer, truly tops to spin both certain laughter and the touching pall of warfare into his greatest book. Must Read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Critique Christopher GrantYossarian of the story, \\"Catch-22,\\" is finally free from the hell that is war. He runs away from his hellish experiences during World War II. In the minds of narrow minded readers Yossarian is a coward, escapist, and selfish for his desertion. These readers do not take into consideration how selfless his desertion really was.Yossarian is presented with a catch by Colonel Cathcart when he offers Yossarian a chance to go home in return for a favor, a favor that will take many innocent lives. Yossarian is set. He can finally leave the god forsaken war that has taken the lives of so many of his friends. Colonel Cathcart tells him he will include a promotion and, \\"have parades in his honor.\\" Colonel Cathcart says Yossarian would have to be a fool to turn down the agreement. But Yossarian doesn't go through with it and decides to run away instead, saving the lives of many innocent people. Yossarian now presents himself with a bad situation. He puts himself in danger of getting a court martial, sent to prison, and as Major Danby put it to, \\"live in danger of betrayal forever.\\" Yossarian's brave and selfless actions are continuously shown to us when he considers the lives of those who will be affected if he is sent home by Cathcart.Yossarian would be a true escapist if he allowed Cathcart to send him home a hero. If Yossarian chose to go home, the other men in the squadron would unknowingly have to complete more missions than they really need to. But if he stayed, and didn't fly any more missions, the other men in the squadron would have refused to fly missions as well breaking up the unit and putting the country at risk. In this, Yossarian is now sacrificing his safety for the lives of the men in the squadron and the good of the country. Yossarian's selfless actions have still yet to cease.Yossarian continues to think of the well being of others. He says to Major Danby, \\"there's a young kid in Rome whose life I'd like to save if I can find her.\\" Nately's whore and her younger sister have been kicked out of their apartment in Rome. Yossarian's selfless actions continue when he decides to save (putting himself in danger) the little girl from the dangers of the Eternal City. Yossarian's actions here prove to be anything but selfish.How could such a brave man like Yossarian be branded a coward, escapist, and selfish? His reasoning for desertion was based on how it would affect the lives of everyone else in the war. Yossarian would have been a coward to get sent home with a promotion and parade, an escapist if he ignored the lives of the men who fly the missions, and selfish to consider his life over the one of a helpless little girl. Before a narrow minded reader brands the selfless actions of a hero like Yossarian to be cowardly, an escapist, or selfish, they should look at the facts."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is savagely funny and deadly serious all in one breath. There's the Texan that kills the soldier in white through unrelenting conviviality, the cat that sleeps on Hungry Joe's face and maybe eventually killing him, the soldier who see everything twice, Major Major Major Major, the atheist chaplain's assistants who run God's service so much better than the believing Chaplain ever could, and then there is the war and the desperate unfunny catch-22 to stay alive in a business that's bound to kill you.I read this book in High School and have finished it off since then about 4 times. It solidified my love for literature. It taught me that to keep our sometimes feeble hold on sanity we have to find the ludicrous and humor in the dead seriousness of reality. It is pacifist's plea to find some sanity to end the state of things where we legally go out to kill each other, trading blows with the enemy underneath the bombardier's sites and the enemies among us. I wonder if Joseph Heller could find Peace quite as tragically funny.\\"The only thing going on was a war, and no one seemed to notice...Yossarian had proof, because strangers he didn't know shot at him with cannons every time he flew up into the air to drop bombs on them, and it wasn't funny at all. And if that wasn't funny, there were lots of things that weren't even funnier.\\" It's the humor amid the tragedy that in war people die and when people die, there is little laughter and to hold on to your sanity you must laugh. That's a catch isn't it? I'll close this in the words of Jimmy Buffet and thank you Joseph Heller for teaching us well, \\"If we didn't laugh we'd all go insane.\\""},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Many people complain that this book has no plot, at least not in any intelligible order, except that Yossarian wishes to keep from being killed at any moment by anyone and anything around him. He's neurotic, and at the same time the saniest one living, because he'd rather die than be killed. This book is absurd, I think, not for reasons of humor, but because of the subject matter it portrays. In fact, it may be more reasonable to show war as absurd than to show war as rational. I found this to be one of the most endearingly fiendish books I've ever read, and more life-like than I originally viewed it as. It is not about a plot, for life has no central plan (but rather a disorganized bunch of disparate events), but about the characters and people that fill it. This book is about the idiosyncracy, absurdity, contradiction, and illogic of personalities, or lack thereof.In this paradoxical way, Catch-22 seems to me to be bizarrely one of the more honest depictions of life as we know it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Many years ago, I was given a paperback copy of this book by a WWII Army Air Corps veteran.

It makes the reader think, it makes the reader laugh, and when it is all said and done Catch-22 gives the reader a great World War II novel that is told through some of the most unlikely soldiers.One of the main attractions to the novel is its comical tone. Comedy is found all throughout the book ranging from Yossarian's unorthodox ways of getting himself out combat duty to Nately's struggles to make a prostitute love him. Also the story is told in a unique circular way which constantly parallels the overall theme of explaining the purpose of what \\"Catch-22\\" means.If there is a fault in the book it is the slow development of the story. The chapters only give the reader a small taste of what the overall story is about and the storyline doesn't start forming until about halfway through the book. While this might deter some readers it can also create an incentive for the others to continue on and finish the story. Heller in a way makes his novel a puzzle that doesn't become completed until the very last chapter. The chapters in his novel could probably be read in any order (with the exception of the last chapter) and still make as much sense as if it was read the way it is printed.Catch-22 is a truly unique novel that will appeal to any reader as well as those interested in World War II literature. While the slow and confusing development of the story is its only glaring let down is also has an appeal that almost forces the reader to continue on with the novel so that all the confusion and loose ends can be cleared away by the time the last chapter is finished. The comical scenes as well as the ingenious elaboration behind the meaning of \\"Catch-22\\" and how it applies throughout the novel will entertain readers for years and years. Joseph Heller's Catch-22 will remain on book shelves for years to come and is a literary work of art that shall never be overlooked."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is a very funny book because anyone who served during war can identify with the insanity that Yossarian endured. I read it in high school, but I identify with it much more now that I've gone through two wars. A must read!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 is a truly great novel, and a wickedly funny, bite, pull or satirical take on the impact war has on the human condition. It is a strike at the idiocy of bureaucracy gone mad;it is a telling commentary on the frailty of man trying to live by the standards of decency and humanity he was brought up with, under the madness of war.Catch 22 is also an outstanding piece of entertainment. The first hundred pages or so have been described by minds greater than mine as '... Hysterical farce...' and more than once I had to put the book aside in order to wipe the tears (of laughter) from the corners of my eyes. Chapter three - subtitled &#34;HAVERMEYER&#34; is the first highlight of the book and I was in stitches several times as I read, and tried to read, and make sense of the glorious text found within. The writing style is unique. The book itself is easy to read. It has a straightforward plot (was there a plot?) which kept the pages turning but it did not take long for Heller to remind you are reading a book about war, and that war is dangerous, and people whom we love, people whom we are destined to love but never will, are bound to die fighting for the causes that we all hold dear. And some chapters you can hold up high for the joy and merriment they bring, the next chapter is just as likely to bring you back down to earth with a jolt, as one of Yo-Yo's friends go missing, and are presumed dead, or meets a particularly gruesome death in a way that no one could have predicted. But as each one dies, there is no way that it can be said that they died without every single shred of their character still intact.Catch 22 is hysterically funny, and at times, incredibly sad. It is a tribute to the strength and power of the human spirit, and as such is worthy of the five stars that I hereby give it. It is a classic novel, a book for the ages. Catch 22 is timeless. I think I need to read it again. Now.Greggles (LR)"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I thought it would be fun to reread this book after many years. I was not disappointed.

Last week I finally picked it up, and what I thought would be the standard war story was anything but.Centering around Yossarian, the bombardier afraid of dying, the novel circles through events, showing them from different characters' perspectives at different times. Joseph Heller masterfully takes the reader in and out of the minds of the large cast of characters, back and forth in time seamlessly.The book is raw, horrifying, infuriating, sarcastic, and surprisingly funny, depicting the insanity of war (or really of any enterprise) conducted by a mindless bureaucracy. Not a light read, not the kind of book I would ordinarily read but one I highly recommend because of the brilliance and depth of the writing."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Creating comedy during the murderous insanity of World War 2 is nothing short of pure genius. Joseph Heller, author of the fictional masterpiece Catch-22 showed the world a different view of the perils encountered during war, twisting them into a witty page turner. The story's main character, United States Air Force Captain John Yossarian, is a B-25 bombardier stationed on the island of Pianosa, west of Italy in the Mediterranean Sea in the year 1943. Understandably, Yossarian continuously tries to scheme his way out of flying bombing missions, since thousands of people he has not met are trying to kill him. Despite his best efforts, Colonel Cathcart continues to increase the amount of missions the men must fly to satisfy their service requirements and return home. As the title suggests, there is a catch:There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause in Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. \\"That's some catch, that Catch-22\\" he observed. (p.46)The above quote is one basic yet confusing catch can be put into simpler terms: a person is considered insane if he willingly flies combat missions, but if he requests to be removed from flying, he is deemed sane and therefore fit to fly. This basic element continually puts Yossarian in danger by the very system he is supposed to be protecting. He is more concerned with his own survival instead of winning the war, calling into question his integrity and patriotism.Heller follows no traditional structure in his novel, rather relies on free association to tie the book together. While the storyline seems at times to follow no discernible path, it perfectly echoes war is itself. Both are vain, chaotic and irrational. But it is that very structure (or lack thereof) that sets the book apart from anything else ever written. Having this book follow any sort of chronological order normally found in other novels would do Catch-22 (1961) a disservice and detract from its overall greatness. Heller implants key flashbacks and side stories at critical points during Yossarian's journey to save his own hide. The complicated storyline structure requires the reader's careful attention to accurately understand all descriptions and anecdotes. Heller introduces complex characters and themes early on, but waits until further in the text requiring the reader to rely on both recollection and foreshadowing.The book also uses third person omniscient narration to further develop and complicate the storyline. The reader learns more from each character than they would if the book was only through Yossarian's eyes. These different points of view allow the reader to fully grasp inside jokes and see characters in a complete three dimensional light. Few characters, due to the in depth detail in which they are described, are considered minor character.Catch-22 (1961) is a classic masterpiece that has withstood the test of time by being in a category all on its own. Pulling out all the stops, it grasps the reader and leaves you yearning for more. The book's influence on American culture culminated on the phrase \\"catch 22\\" becoming popular in the English language for a situation with idiotic circular logic further testifying to Heller's brilliance."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Nobody needs me to say that \\"Catch 22\\" is one of the great novels of the 20th century. It's incredibly powerful today, and it's hard to imagine the impact it must have had when it was published more than 50 years ago.The book strips away any pretense about the glory, intelligence, or fairness of war. It shows the cynical, base motives of the most human of actions: violence. It highlights the absurdities --- the utter contradictions --- that each of us face every day in our lives.The thing that struck me most about \\"Catch 22\\" on what's probably my fourth reading is that it's so densely packed. There are entire paragraphs that you need to read again and again because they have a remarkable perspective about the human condition. But then you struggle to remember them 10 pages later because of the new ideas that Heller has raised. One technique that Heller has mastered to create this density (for all I know, he invented it) is absurdist statements: \\"The Texas turned out to be good natured, generous and likeable. In three days, no one could stand him.\\" There are hundreds of these passages in the book.Heller also uses rare adjectives and adverbs throughout the text, often paired with a more familiar word. Again this adds to the density of the reading, even as you turn to an online dictionary for a definition.The book is also memorably grueseome and sexual, sometimes together. The bomber pilots lead a warped life, and so even their leisure is warped. They're whoring and cheating as much as possible, usually out in the open because they simply don't live in a just society any more. As an old, starving Italian woman explains to Yossarian near the end of the book, when he asks her why Military Police destroyed her whorehouse: \\"Catch 22 says they have a right to do anything that we can't stop them from doing.\\"Just when you think you're going to like someone or that the book is going to be fun, Heller slams you with a wounded or dead pilot or a child prostitute. It never stops.Basically, you become like Yossarian, the protagonist, in that you want to just scream at the top of your lungs that everyone and everything is crazy, and that we need a new crop of adults to come in and change the situation. Yet, because it's war and human nature, it will never happen."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Without hesitation one of the finest books on war ever written. Painfully funny, fantastically intricate, deviously corrupting, Catch-22 is the standard by which all other books are measured.

The confusion of being in a war time setting is layed on realy thick, and is the only novel that I think has really captured the fear, insanity and hilarity of the men in action.This novel is a humourous look at a horrendous subject.

Heller was a navigator on a bomber in World War II and draws inspiration from his experiences I am a self-proclaimed history buff, and I especially love war in American society. But sometimes reading the same heroic war stories or glorifications of a great battle can become redundant. Heller's satire is the proverbial breath of fresh air in comparison to the endless volumes of war related material.The story follows Yossarian, an aviator/bombadeer in World War II. It becomes clear very quickly that Yossarian is about a nickel short of a dollar. He imagines that everyone he knows or comes in contact with, save a few of his good friends, wants him dead. The problem is with the system of flying bombing missions in the military. When he began flying, an aviator was sent home after his 25th mission. But as he continues to fly, his commander Colonel Cathcart increases the minimum number of missions an aviator must fly. To escape his dangerous assignments, Yossarian fakes a liver disease and is sent to the base hospital. It is here that he is first introduced to \\"Catch-22.\\"Yossarian and Doc Daneeka, the medical officer, are good friends. So Yossarian asks Doc to lie on his medical exam and report that he is not mentally fit to fly. Doc explains to Yossarian that because Yossarian asks him to do this, he is in essence proving his sanity. He goes on to explain that anyone that would fly a plane into enemy territory is surely not mentally stable enough to fly a plane into enemy territory. (Read that sentence again if you don't get it the first time.) But anyone who asks to be examined proves that he is sane enough to perform the same task. Catch-22 is basically a lose-lose situation.The part of the novel I found most interesting is only discussed a few times. The character of the soldier in white appears in the hospital at the beginning of the novel. None of the men in the hospital know his name, and no one knows why he is there or where he is from. The soldier in white symbolizes the anonymity of the men that fight for America. Men gave their lives every day during that war, yet they are not famous. Society does not seem to care about who is fighting, but only that they are fighting for their country.Catch-22 is a must-read for anyone finding interest in war. It does well to hold the reader's attention. The mixture of off-the-wall humor and obvious irony make it an enjoyable read. It may or may not be historically accurate, but Heller probably did not intend for it to be. Pick it up; if you don't like the first two pages, then don't bother reading it, but if you do, you'll enjoy the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is exactly the sort of absurdist and strange humor I love.

Go ahead and read it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 starts off as a frivolous comedy with a bunch of insane, eccentric characters, and only later on you realize that there is a method to this madness, and the pieces start falling in place.Yossarian - the main protagonist who is a bombardier in WW II - refuses to fly any more missions after having flown seventy, a number which Colonel Cathcart (who lives in his own world of imaginary triumphs and catastrophic imaginary defeats) keeps on raising. He is then presented with a very tempting offer which he decides to decline after having seen from close quarters that \\"there are people cashing in on every decent impulse and every human tragedy.\\"Though the entire novel is very well written and fun to read, the climax is absolutely unbelievable. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller's elaborate satire of war reveals its absurdity and tragicness through contradiction and quagmire that is unequal in any other piece of literature. Heller creates an extrodinary cast that are at the same time sinful and pious, and this is what makes them so human. From the first sentence the reader is drawn into a universe filled with irreverance that makes complete sense, and through it Heller unveils a grand story chapter by chapter that begins with humour, falls into stoicness, and ends in gaiety. A must read for anyone thats looking for a new world to explore."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"'Catch-22' is an excellent novel, a true masterpiece of the 20th century. Written with cynical insight and sharp black humour, the book is a cutting critical analysis of Western society and its various forms & devices - in particular the concepts of War, Capitalism and governmental bureaucracy.Set during WWII, the story focuses around a US Army regiment, in particular a bombardier called Yossarian. Cynical, paranoid and rebellious, Yossarian is desperate to be returned home from war. Surrounded by a surreal cast of bizarre characters, from eccentric friends to Machiavellian leaders, he is angry and suspicious of the war effort, cynical towards the point of it all.Faking insanity and hiding out in the field hospital leads Yossarian to discover the cruel & immobilising concept at the center of his highers' mentality - Catch-22. The catch is, that insanity is the only valid ticket home, but any request to be grounded is surely a sign of sanity - and therefore voiding the initial excuse. In short, they're dammned if they do & they're dammned if they don't. To add to his increasing depression and frustration, Yossarian must watch as the minimum number of missions required is increased by the tyrannical Colonel Catchcart, and watch his various friends die along the way.For me the key element of the book's excellence lies in the masterful comedy of the writing. I laughed aloud often. Used to highlight the insanity and illogical mentality of those in power within the army, the humour displays the moronic ironies for all to see. Superbly witty, the comedy is extremely dry - a fact which might explain why some people don't 'get' this book. The situations and humour are certainly surreal and strange, a factor for me that makes me love the book even more, but I understand that some readers are alienated by this. 'Catch-22' is not your typical novel.One of the great satirical works, 'Catch-22' is a very important book, as it draws attention to vital flaws and corruptions within our Western world. One character who stands out for me is Milo, the Mess Hall Officer, who represents capitalism perfectly by using his position to profit from trading with various countries, including enemy sides. In this instance, capitalism is shown to have no morals or patriotic loyalty, stepping over whoever it must in order to grasp the next dollar.It is a writing that is more relevant today than ever. Not only does it highlight the sheer futility of war, but it also shows how the illogical desires of an elite can hold power over the silent majority. Yossarian stands alone in his fight against his highers, and he represents a long tradition of the solo non-conformist, rebelling against oppression. Ultimately a optimistic book, it shows the possibility of the small man's triumph over corruption.Timeless & flawless - you must read this book"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is a great great book.Note, none of his other books come close to this one."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"A mark of real brilliance is an author who manages to add words to our common language, like Heller with \\"catch-22\\" or Orwell with \\"doublespeak\\".Simply put, this book is absolutely brilliant.

Not only is it hysterical but it is a perfect example of a modern market economy based on absolutely nothing.chaplain trappman's interrogation at the hands of the CID is another example of english writing at its best.

What a masterpiece!Answer to second thing: What do you mean? There are crabapples in his hands, not his cheeks."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book to me is the perfect novel. Forget even the fact that it deals with war, it raises a lot of excellent points about life in general, through the satiric, repetitive, and absurd format and dialogue. In life we notice that a lot of stupid and terrible things just happen, and they do all the time.Life is repetitive, irritating, absurd, and bad things happen for no rhyme or reason, which is part of Snowden's secrect. Of course, this is magnified 1000 times during war time. Seemingly normal people do horrible things, like when Yossarian realizes that the true crazy person is actually Aarfy, who is so even keeled that he is incapable of grasping his own evil or true danger ahead.This book illustrates some of the frustrating realities of living in a satirical and roundabout way, which is what makes it so brilliant. If you can find the absurd, ridiculous, and awful in world war II, which was actually fought for excellent reaasons, you can find it in a hospital, a school system, a church, or an office. Someone could probably write an amazing catch 22 style book about hurricane katrina and its aftermath.The wild and colorful characters are really exaggerations of people you know and see every day. I do know people who procrastinate and bore themselves to death in order to avoid inevitable bad events, like Dunbar (me), or people who are so silly that they hid their true intelligence for a reason, like Orr, or opportunistic people who sell out humanity in their own way like Milo. I even know what it's like to be more nervous and scared when something bad isn't happening than when something bad is, like Hungry Joe having nightmares only when he isn't flying missions.I also am in awe of Joseph Heller's command of the English language and literature. There are so many literary references that I miss and find out about later on. You have to appreciate the skill in tying all of this together. If he never wrote another book ever again it wouldn't even matter because honestly, this one is perfect in every way."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is almost unquestionably one of the funniest books ever written, but there is a depth to it that forces it to resist categorization as simply a humor piece. It satirizes war in a way that's more condemnatory than most \\"serious\\" novels could ever dream of. The absurdity of it all makes it almost nightmarish; nothing is what it seems, which I guess is a pretty accurate general description of war.I've read Catch-22 from start to finish a couple of times, but my favorite aspect of it is that it really doesn't even have to be read in order. There's no telling how many times I've seen something that reminded me of Appleby or Major Major Major, and I'll just pick up my copy and read their particular chapters, always amazed at how well they function as self-contained stories. In short, this is one of my all-time favorite novels, and I feel that its scope is broad enough to appeal to just about everyone."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is a witty, funny and often mind boggling look into the insanity surrounding WWII. This particular edition was in fair shape retaining excellent readability."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When I first started to read Catch 22 I had some trouble comprehending what it was saying. In the beginning there is a lot of very random detail and the story tends to jump around a lot. But after a while the story gets quite interesting and starts of with a lot of sarcasm and humor and towards the end moves to a more sad but much more realistic outcome. The story focuses on Yossarian and how he tries to get past Catch 22 to be able to go home and out of the military. But one of the things that the book does very well is that it thoroughly examines many other characters of dramatically different character types to contrast the different kinds of soldiers in WW2. The book tells of Yossarian's struggle and how ironically he ends up fighting the American military system instead of fighting the Germans, he doesn't care about the Germans as long as he stays alive. Over all this book is a very good interesting book that shows how Catch 22 actually applies to many situations in everyday life. Even though the information is a little hard to comprehend at first it is a very good book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The best book about (the logic of) war ever written. Hilarious, sad, and - several decades after WWII - still will make you wanna drag a rowboat to Sweden. Genius."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The book's title and premise, Catch-22, is a term defined a number of ways by many men in the course of Joseph Heller's seminal book from 1955. Each time, Catch-22 is referred to as an irrational policy for legalized craziness - a way to make sure that no combat pilot can be grounded for being crazy - especially when they are crazy.A fellow airman, suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress, is described as \\"babbling incoherently when they fished him out of the dank bottom of the slit trench, babbling of snakes, rats and spiders. The others flashed their searchlights down just to make sure. There was nothing inside but a few inches of stagnant rain water.\\" Following the hallucinations and panic attack, the airman, absurdly named Hungry Joe, is almost immediately re-assigned air combat duty by his superiors.Heller's own experiences as a B-52 bombadier relate with a painfull, crisp clarity the effects of war on the male psyche.Heller presents War as institutionalized insanity - a world at war being enough to drive anyone who lives in it completely crazy. Bombadier Yossarian, although high-strung and violent, is the lone sane man in a world gone completely crazy with war. The only place Yossarian feels safe at is a military hospital in western Italy. At this hospital, Yossarian is surrounded by war-jangled men who've come down with sudden cases of sanity in the face of a fiery death. They each argue the meaning of Catch-22 while trying to find a way to survive the war."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is a classic. Catch-22 is on all of those Top 100 books of the century lists. Just start reading the damn thing already! Jesus!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is one of the greatest American novels of the 20th century. The language is literate, but the style is modern - it's chaotic, which reflects the circumstances of war and the emotional trauma inflicted on Yossarian, the main character. From the first page where Yossarian is in the infirmary avoiding duty with a vague liver complaint, the absurdity of his circumstances is apparent. Yossarian is a bombardier in a B-25 fighter stationed on an island off Italy in World War II. His brown-nosing commander, demonstrating the dedication of his squadron, keeps increasing the number of bombing missions required before (noun), despite the availability of fresh crewmembers. With the high fatality rate for these missions, it's not a surprise that by the end of the book, everyone Yossarian has served with has been killed except the administrators and commanders, who find they serve their country best in a non-combat role. Yossarian's view of war is confirmed paranoia - he believes people are trying to kill him, and they are.Now that I've read Catch-22, I see that it was hugely influential. MASH could not have existed without it, though MASH is upbeat compared with Catch -22. Published in 1955, before On the Road, it is avant-garde in some of the same ways, but has a different value system. Because of the non-linear timeline and the barrage of characters, Catch-22 was a slow, but not boring, read for me. I can't remember another book that I liked so much that took so long to read.Catch-22 is a landmark book that everyone should read at some time in his or her life. The sex and violence is understated (perhaps that's how it ended up in the Young Adult section?). The language is rich and complex, and the ideas are fresh 50+ years later."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"A clever mix of \\"alice in wonderland\\" kind of dialogues in a \\"apocalypse now\\" scenery.

But then my sister said it was the best book she ever read, so I reread it with a new perspective.The \\"running gags\\" are my favorite parts, but just the way it is narrated is refreshing, even thought the book is 50 years old.

I've always been meaning to read it but kept putting off the effort. Why? I guess the book intimidated me. I saw it as complex and obtuse. I thought I might not understand it. But what foolishness was all this? The book is a masterpiece of modern English. How could I have been so mis-informed? So nave?Where to begin? Well, in the first place, the book has no real plot. Rather, it is a series of events regarding \\"Yo-Yo\\" Yossarian and his attempts to be sent home to the US from Italy in the Second World War. In the process, we are introduced to a host of bizarre characters. Some are his peers, some are more senior officers. But despite all his efforts, he seems destined to remain on the Italian island of Pianosa from where he is sent on missions to bomb various targets in France and Italy. Every time he gets within striking distance of the requisite number of missions that would grant him a ticket home, his nemesis, Colonel Cathcart raises the bar. Yossarian's hopes are always being dashed.In essence, \\"Catch-22\\" is a book about the futility of war. In spite of its chaos, one side will win. Along the way, maddeningly insane decisions will be made. Welcome to the world of Yossarian. He is simply struggling against the system. The reader is also introduced to a mad cap cast. Each character is crazy in his or her own way. Joseph Heller clearly had a wonderful and often hilarious imagination.When, I first began \\"Cath-22\\", I was thinking of awarding it four stars.

And??? The characters are relentlessly stupid and I never felt, for a second, like I would ever want to have to do with them.Yossarian dumps his bombs willy nilly (of course, nobody ever questions that he might be dropping them on civilians or that the bombers might have to go back to do the job he failed to, and thus present more risk to his fellow Americans) and sticks around sick bay.

The reality of this second myth was brought home to me when I attempted to read this book. I gave up in disgust after 80 pages. I felt as though I was reading a children's fairy tale rather than a serious piece of literature. This is a horrible and insulting book. The &quot;plot&quot; (if one can call it a plot) is pointless and the writing is sarcastic and juvenile. We are told by fans of the book that the author intended it to be read this way, as a clever statement about &quot;the insanity of war.&quot;What a load of rubbish. War is ugly and brutal, but it is not &quot;insane.&quot; Many American wars were fought because people believed passionately in a noble cause and were willing to fight to defend that cause against those who would vanquish it.

Got me. I have no idea. Another reviewer said that you could skip chapters and not miss anything. I agree. I first attempted this novel a few years ago. I quit in less than 50 pages, so bored was I. I picked it up again recently, and I'm now less than 50 pages from finishing. What an unfulfilling reading experience this is. There is no central unifying theme or plot - other than that war is hell and the military rarely makes sense. But we knew that, right? As for the whole catch-22 business, sure, that is amusing the first twenty times, but it gets old quickly. This story could have been told in 50 pages and even that would have been too much.Why then, if it is so bad, am I about to finish it? You know how it is. You start reading, and you become determined to complete it, just to say you did. There is no enjoyment in it though. I am looking forward to getting done so that I can read something else.

I see this every day in life, so writing a book about this aspect of the world does nothing except breed more cynicism. I have enough, thank you. The characters are flat, the story is... ...weird..., and the apparent point and purpose of the story was waaaay over done. Like I said, I just didn't get it.

Heller brilliantly portrays the hellish experiences of war with hilarity and horror. Catch-22 is full of ironic contradictions and farcical ancedotes. However, Heller in no way evades or desensitizes the atrocities of war. Fortunately, just when Heller begins to use excessive military jargon, he digresses to a comedic story about one of the men.

Heller brilliantly manipulates his vast array of characters in hilarious situations, poignantly weaving the doomed bombadier Yossarian's tale into the catastrophic ironies of the war so often overlooked by the populace. In Yossarian, Heller created one of the great characters of modern literature, and with Catch-22 he set the standard for literature surrounding the second world war. The literary world will miss the words of Joseph Heller, which always seemed to be precise and discerning."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller successfully utilizes detailed character developement, an extremely sarcastic tone, and a confusing placement of events, in which he jumps from scene to scene in no particular order, in order to create a humorous yet realistic image of war and the politics that surround war. Heller titles many of his chapters after a character in the novel. This proves how important the characters are; rather than center the novel around events, Heller centers his novel around the characters. Which makes perfect sense. War may involve events, but more importantly, it involves people. Most of Heller's chapters also begin with a description of the character they are titled after. The first sentence of the chapter titled &quot;Colonel Cathart&quot;, Heller begins with &quot;Colonel Cathart was a slick, successful, slipshod, unhappy man of thirty-six who lumbered when he walked...&quot; Although how he walks has absolutely nothing to do with any of the major events of the novel, Heller tells us this in order to give a more personal image of Colonel Cathart. Colonel Cathart is a character in the war; he creates the events, the events do not create him. Heller not only developes his characters without leaving out any personal details, but also portrays the war and its charaters with much humor and sarcasm. It is impossible to read through this novel and not atleast smile. I even laughed out loud a few times. The tone may seem incredibly funny; however, the message is very grim. Heller is telling a story of war. The people in this war, as hilarious as they seem, are really very depressing. Every character has their own set of &quot;issues&quot;. Yossarian, for example, loves every woman he sees. If he lives through the war (another &quot;issue&quot;-obsession with death), he will probably have a very hard time finding a mate. These psycological and emotional damages are the ones Heller is attempting to portray. Usually the funnier it seems, the more devastating, realistically speaking, its effects are. Heller also has a tendency to put all of his events out of order. Perhaps this is to show how the veterans of the war see things, or to show that the events really aren't as important as the people. Either way, it makes the novel somewhat hard to follow, but does make us look more to the characters and their feelings rather than the events taken place. As human beings, we like to take the easier route, and following the character developement is much easier than following the confusing plotline, or lack there of. Overall, the novel was incredibly insightful. Most &quot;war books&quot; are very serious, but Heller's light tone makes Catch-22 stand out. However, we must not forget the underlying message. War damages people mentally, emotionally, and physically forever, even after it's over."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 was a very confusing book to read at times. I thought it was really fun to read about the insanity of war and what a person thinks of war. In my opinion war is crazy I would not want to be in a war for anything in the whole world. I could not imagine myself flying in an aircraft over a battle zone bombing things, and risking my life for my country many times. That is what the main character of the book did he was Yossarian. Yossarian was my favorite character in the book, because he understood how crazy the war was and he really didn't want to be in it. Many times he tried to get away from where he was stationed but the commanding officers would not let him leave. Yossarian made a lot of decisions throughout the book whether or not to leave the army or to stay, and he was always looking out for the most important person in his life and that was him. That related most to me, because I think of myself as the most important person in my life, and I would do whatever it took to make me happy. Not to say I wouldn't help other people, but I would look out for myself first and for most. I thought the book was very funny. The author Joseph Heller used very funny language throughout the book. His diction is what made the book so great. He made the readers see how insane war really is, which I think is really good for young people to figure out, before they get involved with the army or navy. Think how crazy you have to be to fly a jet over a place that is being bombed and try to dodge missles being fired at you. To me that would be insane and to Joseph Heller that would be insane also. I couldn't imagine myself ever wanting to go to war. People might say well your dying for your country and you have to do this to protect us, well there are other ways of solving disagreements with other countries. Every character in the book was very realistic. I thought that the soldiers were all very scared to die, and they wanted out. I wouldn't' blame them. Overall this book was really good, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a book that has the insanity of war in it, without the violence and the graphic descriptions. Some parts were confusing to me but for the most part I understood the whole book. I would read a Joseph Heller book again."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"A Book so full of invention, you are left breathless.

It is more than that, however. This novel depicts a life of impartiality, pain and boredom. The war is out side, and inside, but the men have their own ways of putting the horrific details and coping with the loss aside to live. Through the eyes of many different people the war and those involved are explored from many different points of view. This technique that Heller uses gives the reader a look at look at their lives and the way they are lived from every possible perspective. In a personal opinion the narration resembles a Faulkner story. Through the incessant ranting and frivelous ravings a mind and a story emerge. The \\"average Joe\\" is given his 15 minutes to shine with every turn of the page. This novel is recommended to those who not only enjoy war stories, but a good laugh as well.
