The first 80 percent of the movie and the book are mostly similar. The endings are quite different. I slightly prefer the movie's improbable ending, although the endings of both have serious flaws.Reading the first 80 percent of the book is a joy after having seen the movie. If you are like me, you will see and hear the movie in your mind as you read the book.In the first 80 percent of the book, you will find more in the book than in the movie. C.S. Forester is able to tackle interesting themes in the book that were too delicate for Hollywood. Also, he employs an amazing mastery of the technical details in describing the African Queen's voyage down the Ulanga and Bora rivers into Lake Victoria. You will almost feel like you are reading science fiction from the time of H.G. Wells, as Allnut and Rose keep making something out of nothing.To me, the best part of the book is that the contrasts between the &quot;civilized&quot; conventions and the &quot;natural&quot; instincts are drawn in extreme and fine detail. It will make you re-examine how you think about what is the right thing to do in your own life, which is what good literature should do.To me, the weakness of the book is that the attitudes that The African Queen challenges are very far removed from our experience today. What was very scathing then now seems quaint. Somehow, the outrage behind the story is diffused into a dreamy period piece. Are there many women now of 33 who are so completely dominated by their brothers that they do not lead their own lives? Would many people today be inflamed by love of country to want to strike a personally fatal blow against the oppressor against all odds? Does the arrogance of colonialism seem believable, or just a silly notion to caricature?Ultimately, Rose's instant rise from docile creature to Wonder Woman does seem to strain credibility. It's inspiring fun, though, like any book about brave heroines who are undaunted by the odds and convention.After you read this book, think about where your assumptions about what you should be doing have not been re-examined by you in a while. What are you doing because someone else tells you it is a good idea? What should you be doing because you think it is a good idea?Take the initiative to do the right thing with full speed ahead!"},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"&quot;The African Queen&quot; is a very decent classic which I enjoyed very much. Rose Sayer and Charlie Allnut are very developed, hilarious characters who give you an understanding of classes, religion, technology and love. The boat-handling information is very thorough. This classic is for almost any reader; I was very satasfied."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I stumbled into \\"African Queen\\" from \\"Shantaram\\", the self indulgent mess of a book that purports to be an adventure based on the real life exploits of its author. I felt like Charlie and Rose, having escaped the lilies or the mangroves... Here is an author who knows when description is called for and when action must take the lead; when relationships must be built, and when the setting needs a nod. And Forrester does it so well. What a delight.\\"The African Queen\\" is a road trip, where a cockney steam engineer and a British missionary's sister take a boat down a fictitious river, over countless literary waterfalls and onto a make believe lake with a gunboat that never existed; along the way, necessity insists that they discover themselves, and each other, and, being that it was written in 1935, there's not a lot of hullabaloo about it, they just look up, rather Monty Python-like and go \\"Oh, okay\\" and get on with it. And there you are, reading it all, and lapping it up. Unlike the movie, there is nudity, and sex. Unlike \\"Shantaram\\" both are very nearly erotic. Although I couldn't get Bogart and Hepburn out of my mind so I was somewhat impaired...Sadly, by the last two chapters, the author has developed cold feet. It seems he feels wicked for leading us on this ridiculous tale and he attempts to make up for it by creating new characters and events that will make everything right, at least very realistic, albeit off the mark of the original plot. Forrester is so convinced that his story won't hold up, he wrote a new forward to the 1940 edition (which I read) saying how the editors removed the last two chapters, for the first printing, and celebrating how he put them back.Forrester was SO wrong.Fortunately, there is the movie. Where Forrester got cold feet, John Huston knew a story when he heard one, and the movie fixes the ending, although the book's version is still very nice.\\"African Queen\\" is a very good story, very well written. For an English author of the period, it's also very concise and efficient, yet still melodic in its use of the English language. I enjoyed reading the book as the written word as much as I enjoyed the story."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Being a fan of Forester I thought I had read the African Queen a long time ago, turns out I had not. I did see the movie a couple of times so I could compare the book and film. Unlike many of todays movies it followed the book very closely until you get to the end. I like Forestor's version much better than the movie. I really enjoyed the book as I have everything else I have read of Forester."},{"Title":"Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation","review":"If I could give this book six stars I would. It's simply one of the best statistics books I've ever read.This book is very well-written by one of the experts in the field. It covers logit models and the various generalizations (GEV, mixed logit, probit, etc.) in detail, along with a thorough discussion of modern estimation of these models. What I find most useful about it is that the words-to-equations density is highly favorable. The equations you need are there, but the words you need are there too, making sure you understand the model assumptions inside and out. Each equation is explained thoroughly and the surrounding discussion probes the model to bring the reader to a critical understanding of what exactly is implied by the model. Too often complex statistical models are treated in a \\"black box\\" fashion. The dirty little secret is that it's easier for the author to do this. Train doesn't take the easy way out. The fact that his web site has truly excellent support--including a large number of webinars in addition to the more usual papers, software, etc.--makes this book a doubly valuable item. See http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~train/distant.html for even more."},{"Title":"Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation","review":"-Enjoyable read-Does not assume PhD level of econometrics-Explanations are clear and conciseActually, an advanced undergrad may find this book usefull as well.Is this the best discrete choice methods book ever published?Let y = 1 or 0 where 1 = yes, this is the best and 0 = No, the book is not the best. Also let P = Prob (y=1). My results show P = 0.98 (see forthcoming Econometrica article).While finishing a Master's Thesis in applied econ which focuses on a multinomial logit model, I have sought good info on this topic. Not having gone through the rigors of a PhD program, I have gone through many of the important books and articles which address discrete choice modeling methods some of which address a post-doc audience only. Dr. Train's is by far the best I have encountered. His explanations are concise yet not too dense (see Amemiya). I first encountered many of the concepts in other publications but did understand them until reading Train's book. In my opinion Train has that rare quality of being, not only an exceptional economist, but quite enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation","review":"This book is one of the best for introduction to Discrete choice models. I had been using Ben-Akiva & Lerman, but feel this book should be read along with that one for a better understanding of choice models. Also, Train covers recent advances in the field and provides a good introduction to Halton draws. He really makes sure you get the concepts and the online lecture series are really excellent."},{"Title":"Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation","review":"As a previous reviewer has already stated, this may quite possibly be the best statistics/econometrics book. It's not a textbook with end-of-chapter problems covering hundreds of topics. It's more of an in-depth narrative on the single important subject of discrete choice models (e.g., logit, probit, and many advanced extensions). The reader should have a background in statistics at the level of Casella & Berger's text. So this book is great for researchers and graduate students in math, stats, engineering, and economics, but is probably too advanced for those in psych, polysci, and sociology. If you're even thinking about doing some sort of discrete choice analysis, this book is a must read. It's extremely insightful, and Train's ability to explain everything in both mathematical and non-technical terms is astonishing. Everytime I think to myself \\"I wonder what situation would fit here,\\" Train never fails to give a concise, informative example. If his teaching style is anything like what is in this book, it may be worth taking a leave from UCSD to visit Berkeley for a semester just to take his class."},{"Title":"Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation","review":"The book is excellent for guys on discrete choice models and analysis.

The author has explained in detail so the reader is able to follow through on a extesive practice. If you are a tantric practioner that needs some guidance from a qualified teacher this is the book for you. In the back of the book there is a few sadhana that coordinate with the teachings. The book is quite advanced. If you are a beginner in Buddhism this is probably not a good first book to read. Try Universal Compassion by the same author."},{"Title":"Essence of Vajrayana: The Highest Yoga Tantra Practice of Heruka Body Mandala","review":"This book is essentially a commentary on the sadhana (liturgy) for doing the Tantric practices of the Heruka Body Mandala, practices originally laid out by the Indian master Ghantapa in ancient times. Heruka is the Tantric manifestation of the enlightened compassion of all the Buddhas. Tantric practices are designed to quickly lead one to enlightenment in one lifetime by transforming ordinary appearances and ordinary conceptions into pure ones. Tantric practices have two stages, generation stage and completion stage, which are beyond the scope of this review to explain. This book seems to focus primarily on the generation stage practices, but further study will reveal a wealth of completion stage teachings as well. At the back of the book it also contains the sadhana, as well as other surrounding practices, such that one can understand and practice these amazing teachings merely with the purchase of this book. Tharpa publications also publishes the sadhana separately, as well as a CD of the sadhana so you can learn the melodies, pronunciation, etc.. But, you really must have the empowerment and oral transmission of the teachings for them to have any effect, so the readership for whom this book may prove useful (rather than merely interesting) may be fairly limited. I don't know of any teacher except the author who gives this particular empowerment and transmission to Westerners. And even if some do, this author is in such ill-favor in the lama community (over the silly Dorje Shugdan controversy) that I doubt any other teacher will be recommending this author's books to students for any practice, even though Geshe Kelsang's books are consistently the best in class.After years of practicing various Heruka practices, I can attest to their power and speed. I have heard that this is the practice responsible for the incredible power of many of the spiritual heavy hitters in recent Tibetan history, such as Je Phabongkhapa, as well as such Indian masters as Nagarjuna. Unfortunately for us Westerners, few of our parents gave us to monasteries at age six as was expected for all second sons in Tibet, so we did not spend our whole life in monasteries and retreat caves with enough time to really do these practices justice. The Heruka Body Mandala practices are long and complicated, and to do a long retreat, or to do them three times a day, or even once a day, or even to do the short form once a day is much more than many working stiffs like me can do. But there are very short forms of Ghantapa's other Heruka practices, the Heruka Five Deities practices, that you can do daily, and, personally, I found that Heruka was more than willing to work with me amidst my hectic and full life, and over time he taught me even shorter but very powerful ways to fold his practices into the other practices I do have time to do. Fortunately, Heruka's practices, unlike those of other Tantric deities, become ever more powerful as times become more degenerate, and, certainly, to paraphrase Madonna, we are living in a degenerate time, and I am a degenerate guy!Since I seldom do the full, formal practices as they are laid out in the book these days, I have not really read this book for a long time. Indeed, although I knew and studied with Geshe-la while he was writing this book and for a few years after it came out, I have not been a student of his for a few years now. But, on a recent retreat I had wanted to see how to integrate some esoteric teachings from another tradition with my Heruka underpinnings, (easy and powerful to do, BTW!), so I brought this book along and gave it another reading. I had recalled only the book's emphasis on generation stage, since that is ostensibly what the book and practices are about, and I was no longer emphasizing generation stage, so I just thought I'd read it as background to Geshe-la's books on completion stage practices (Tantric Grounds and Paths, and Clear Light of Bliss). During the re-reading I was amazed how good it was, especially the way Geshe-la weaves penetrating completion stage teachings and practices in at every opportunity. And, as with one other of Geshe-la's books, the words seemed somehow not to be written on mere paper, but appeared to float in a clear sky! I left the retreat with great renewed affection for this book and its author, and I thought I'd write a review to reflect that.As for the book itself, it is flawlessly written and published, as are all Geshe-la's books. The language and presentation are clear and precise, and specifically suited to Westerners. As they state, \\"Tharpa Publications is a publisher of Buddhist books that provide the most complete and integrated presentation of the Buddhist path to enlightenment available in any western language, from basic introductions to Buddhism and meditation to detailed and lucid expositions of the highest Buddhist philosophy and Tantric practice\\". Most true. And to underscore the timeless quality of the whole enterprise we find, \\"Set in Palatino by Tharpa Publications. Printed on acid-free 250-year longlife paper and bound by Butler and Tanner, Frome, Somerset, England\\". Indeed.Once again, this is probably not a book for very many people. Only someone drawn to Heruka and his practices is really likely to get much out of this book, and only then if they have received the empowerment and oral transmission of the teachings from Geshe-la. And most Tantric practitioners who have received Heruka empowerments from Geshe-la or anyone else seem to practice the related and much easier Vajrayogini practices these days, so we Heruka practitioners are probably a fairly rare breed. But if you are drawn to Heruka (it is probably true that \\"you don't choose Heruka, Heruka chooses you!\\") get the book, the empowerment and the oral transmission of the practices, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Essence of Vajrayana: The Highest Yoga Tantra Practice of Heruka Body Mandala","review":"For those drawn to the Chakrasambara (Heruka) Tantra, Geshe Kelsang finally revealed all the essential practices after many years of offering only Vajrayogini training. However, you will also need his definitive Vajrayogini book, \\"Guide to Dakini Land\\", because apart from the sadhanas and the completion stage meditations the two practices are substantially the same 11-Yoga system, so he hasn't duplicated the yogas held in common between the two.For the Heruka practitioner this book is the fundamental guide to Dharma practice from the day you open it until the end of your life, by which time you will hopefully have become a Buddha."},{"Title":"Fluffy Goes to School (Scholastic Reader Level 3)","review":"I have a 5 year old and a 7 year old, and they were on the floor laughing with this book.

Although Fluffy cannot talk, the reader can see his thoughts, which are often quite funny. In this story, Fluffy gets named (he thinks of himself as a Butch more than a Fluffy).Fluffy gets into all kinds of situations, sometimes because of his own actions like chasing food, and they always end well. They are funny yet teach lessons without being obvious about it. My students love these books--they are fairly easy to read, have larger print than most books, are funny, have 3-4 chapters and 40-50 pages. Kids do not want to stop reading them, they want to know what happens next!I recommend Kate McMullan's series about Fluffy very strongly.

John Wiltshire makes some very interesting points about Louisa Musgrove's fall at Lyme in Persuasion. He understands it to be a crucial moment for Captain Wentworth's future as a husband: will it be Louisa bold and brash or will it be Anne sensible and faithful? He has much to say on Marianne Dashwood's illness in Sense and Sensibilit, in regard to her relationship with Willoughby, which is most helpful in understanding why her character alters so significantly at the end of the novel. Being a previous student of John Wiltshire's, I was pleased to come upon this book and relate it back to his class. I gained some very helpful hints in understanding Jane Austen's incredible insight into human nature from this book and I hope that many more will find it as worthwhile."},{"Title":"How to guess your age","review":"This is one of the funniest and cleverest stories I have read in a long time.

It should be subtitled &quot;The TRUTH about the French Revolution&quot;. Full of facts and dates, and heavily footnoted so that sources can be referenced, the author paints an indisputable picture of what the French Revolution really was: a chaotic bloodbath in which the Catholic Church and anyone associated with it was brutally persecuted. Carroll totally discounts the modern myth of the French Revolution as an event that simply brought France from monarchy to democracy, by inundating the reader with facts to the contrary; did you know that one of the first people to die in the guillotine was a newspaper reporter? So much for freedom of the press. My only complaint about this book is that it is so full of facts and dates it made it slow to read because I found myself wanting to take notes! This book is truly a powerful weapon for combatting the myths about the French Revolution. The description of the &quot;field of screams&quot; was chilling. Also disturbing was the scene where the animals pulling the death cart refused to enter the square where the guillotine was, because their senses were so repulsed by the blood-soaked ground."},{"Title":"The Guillotine & The Cross","review":"A wit once remarked that any fool can make history, but only a great man can write one. I'm happy to say that this book proves Warren Carroll such a man. He covers in detail the start of the revolution proper, with the arrest of King Louis XVI, proceeding through the Terror and its aftermath. His style is gripping, telling history as it is meant to be--a living story of a once-alive past. I was especially glad to see a whole chapter devoted to the uprising in the Vendee; these royalists are rarely heard of in today's textbooks, and I myself had not heard of it until early this year. Carroll covers in detail the suppression of Catholicism, along with the slaughter of priests and the martyrdom of the Carmelite sisters upon the Guillotine.I would only add that Carroll is an obvious sympathizer with the ancien regime, which may make uncomfortable those accustomed to republican sentiment. His work provokes one to wonder just how the American republic contrasted to the French version. This history proves that Republics are not immune from despots and mass murder."},{"Title":"The Guillotine & The Cross","review":"This book is well researched, organized, and written, but most of all it is INTERESTING to the highest degree! Read the compelling story of the wonderful Carmelite nuns of Compiegne! Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"The Guillotine & The Cross","review":"Carroll tends to find the most glaring historical episodes of the tangible struggle of evil against good, and carefully presents the evidence for the reader. This book is not a comprehensive history of the French Revolution, but a brief overview of the early years leading to a more detailed description of the depths of satanic inspired absurdity during the Reign of Terror.Carroll does not put too much credence in conspiracy theories put forth by numerous people, including M. Tozer below. Tozer seems to subscribe to the theory that Adam Weishaupt was the prime mover behind the revolution. Historical evidence is light but speculation is rampant. Carroll in an historian who must rely on written evidence and logical conclusions (in the light of Divine Revelation). In a sense it was Satan who was the prime mover in this drama."},{"Title":"The Guillotine & The Cross","review":"If you want an excellent portrayal of European history from a very Catholic perspective, Dr. Carroll's books are perfect. He writes in vivid language and with great enthusiasm about things that are, at least for me, very important and extremely interesting. Reading this particular book was well worth the little time it took, not only because of what I learned from it, but also for the pure enjoyment I got from reading such wonderful writing.I'd also like to say something in response to the review written by Mr. Tozer. Next fall I will return to my studies at the college Dr. Carroll was a founder and the first president of. I have listened to him speak on more than one occasion and can say without hesitation that this college is the most profoundly and devoutly Catholic place I have ever been to. Whatever evidence you think you have that indicates Dr. Carroll is anything but absolutely loyal to the Catholic Church is, in short, ridiculous."},{"Title":"The Guillotine & The Cross","review":"I have almost finished this book and it is an easy read and very informative. I was never taught a fraction of what is in this book concerning the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. The young should be taught true history. The author portrays the evil of this time and it compares with the Nazis actions and the evils of the Russian Revolution. I know we have been allies of France in many wars but to bury the atrocities of history because of this is wrong. It was a time and an evil that gripped a people and has been repeated through out history. Evil is not characteristic to one group or nation. God bless the Catholic martyrs of the French Revolution. We could learn much from the way they lived and died for their Catholic beliefs."},{"Title":"The Guillotine & The Cross","review":"Dr. Carroll exposes the truth of the French Revolution as the evil monster it was. The Revolution was truly satanic. The book is very well researched and cited.

A must read for any student of European history."},{"Title":"The Guillotine & The Cross","review":"I purchased this book which was rated as \\"like new\\".It is old to the point of almost being brittle, the binding is starting to deteriorate and there is marking/notes in every chapter.This product does not have the value for which I paid and is not the book I want to have in my library."},{"Title":"The Guillotine & The Cross","review":"There is plenty to write about the French Revolution, but too many get stuck in the picturesque days of the Terror, and miss the main story. There is a sentimental view that the French Revolution was a good thing, until a few demented ideologues caught hold of it, and turned it into the Terror, the first experiment in totalitarianism.This demonization of Robespierre (and there is plenty to demonize) is a hindrance to the understanding of history. Yes, the Terror was horrible, but it was the logical consequence of the early \\"good\\" Revolution. There is no break but continuity between Robespierre and the early revolutionaries. The Revolution was disastrous from the beginning. Let's look at the record. When the Revolution starts France was a country at peace and prosperous (the financial difficulties had to do with the finances of the State - as they said France had a poor State in a rich society). After four years of Revolution France had: 1) a foreign invasion, 2) civil war in the Vendee, 3) inminent economic collapse, and 4) a serious possibility of massive famines - something which had not happen since the early eighteenth centuries. This is the mess that Robespierre inherited, and, not being more competent than those who came before, resorted to massive killings (I suspect that the definitive history of the French Revolution should have been written by Laurence J. Peter).Warren H. Carroll offers another \\"demonization of Robespierre\\" book. In its terms it succeeds. But from the standpoint of helping to understand the Revolution, it does not enlighten."},{"Title":"The Guillotine & The Cross","review":"Warren Carroll is a gifted author and propagandist. But we can no longer, in good faith, style him an historian. \\"Guillotine and the Cross\\" marks the fifth of his works that we have read. And as in each proceeding volume, more of Carroll's intent to mislead has become clear.Here, the author manages to complete a book solely devoted to the epic of the French Revolution without even mentioning its designer, Adam Weishaupt. Somehow, Carroll includes a bit of a nod to the role of Voltaire, the philosopher, if you will, of the revolution. This is sort of like writing about World War II and discussing Goebells but leaving out any mention of Hitler.This startling omission leads us to wonder anew as to Carroll's strange selectivity of presentation. Perhaps the hint to unravel this mystery is within the corpus of many of his works on European history wherein he heaps lavish encomiums upon the Knights Templar and other adherents of masonic skullduggery. It may even have something to do with the author's supposed, but we suspect rather insincere, \\"conversion\\" to Catholicism from paganism. We are not, as yet, entirely certain. But whatever the source of the deception, and while we applaud Carroll's evident literary skills, we must, in good conscience warn other readers that, in order to understand clearly the history Carroll covers, other sources are absolutely necessary.Addendum: 25-Mar-06A later reviewer, Mr. Kerekes, seems to think we are too harsh in our estimation of Professor Carroll's rather strange blindness with regard to masonic involvement in the French Revolution, or in any other historical epic he has thus far sought to describe. The fact is that the Popes from Pope Leo XIII to Pius XII consistently inveighed against the evil of freemasonry. It has only been in the post Vatican II era of the Johns and the Paul, and, of course, the John Pauls, that the Holy Fathers have refrained from commentary on freemasonry as the implacable enemy of the Mystical Body of Christ. Is it a coincidence that Mr. Carroll's alleged conversion to Catholicism came under this new liberal era? We think not. Dr. Carroll is a \\"neoconservative\\", whose allegiance is not to the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, but to something else rather, shall we say, sinister. Or, so it would seem.Of late, we have come upon a realization that confirms the supposition we had stated earlier. While rereading Juri Lina's excellent \\"Architects of Deception\\", we came across a description of the cross of the Knights Templar. It sounded very familiar. On searching for a replica on the Internet, we were shocked to see the very same sigil that Carroll sports on the cover of each of the volumes of his history of Christendom. From this we conclude, as we had earlier suspected, that Carroll is certainly in sympathy with, if not an active member of, the various masonic cults that have emanated from these ancient knights errant. Dr. Carroll's strange selectivity of presenation makes sense only in this refined light."},{"Title":"When the Walls Came Down","review":"If you are ready to know some hard truths and to stop being amongst the herd of \\"group thought,\\" then this is the book for you. But if you'd rather go on blindly and remain in denial, I strongly caution you not to read this book. Ken Greene gives an honest, brutal account of not only what happened during those horrifying moments when the walls came down, but he goes further to discuss \\"politically incorrect\\" topics such as racism in America, election fraud, and the ills within our society that have created walls (globally) that should never have existed. Poignant, compelling, disturbing--and oh so enlightening!"},{"Title":"When the Walls Came Down","review":"The phrase \\"September 11\\" makes most of us pause and reflect upon the haunting images surrounding that day's terrible events hauntingly embedded in our minds. Sometimes we force ourselves not to mentally go back there, but when we allow the memories, we are prone to shudder recalling the attack on The World Trade Center. Survivor and debut author Ken Greene was courageous enough to pen WHEN THE WALLS CAME DOWN. I thank him for sharing the horrific details he experienced.Greene's book shares personal accounts such as: whenever he hears any one of seven songs he listened to during his commute to work that fateful morning, the music \\"puts me right back on the 6:08 a.m. train headed to Grand Central Terminal\\". The book is full of these honest, insightful truths which puts the reader in his body and mind. Reading vivid scenes of being trapped in the stairwell of the tower in which he worked, thinking of his wife, and being covered in soot brought tears to my eyes because his descriptions took me there.If you enjoy reading about history, current events, political views, and analytical brainstorming, you will become engrossed as Greene depicts the correlation between obvious routine displays of racism he encounters during his daily commutes, to the 2001 Presidential voting controversy, to Bush's explanation of going to war, and much more. He has included plenty of research to back up his views. His writing is easy to follow, emotional, very witty, and at times humorous despite the intense subject matter.The fact that the book is more than a memoir of September 11 is what pushes it into the extraordinary class of literature. Greene was employed by the Port Authority of New York as an Assistant Director of Aviation when he found himself thrust into the infamous deadly situation which demanded him to step up and save his life and help rescue others. I recommend this book is placed on your list of must-reads. You are sure to learn while becoming emotionally caught up, as you find yourself not being able to put this book down.Reviewed by Janet \\"Jaize\\" BrownThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"When the Walls Came Down","review":"The casual book-buyer might pick up Ken Greene's When The Walls Came Down and see \\"another 9/11 book,\\" emblazoned with an image of the World Trade Center buildings billowing smoke after being slammed by jetliners. While the surreal horror of that day can't be avoided whenever an author chooses to tackle this generation's Pearl Harbor, the title belies a sharp critical analysis of what that day really meant to the past, present, and future of America's readiness, or rather, willingness, to truly live up to its ideals of equality, freedom and democracy.Today, these words are taken for granted, like they need not prove their actuality in Americans' daily lives. However, as Greene begins the first part of the book recalling what started out as a typical day, he explains that he was often reminded of how equality still proved to be an elusive concept when it comes to the perceptions of African-Americans, poignantly explained in what he calls \\"the seat of last resort,\\" a daily reminder of how, on a crowded suburban commuter train where he was sometimes the only black passenger, the seat next to him was often the last to be occupied, if at all, despite his professional aura.But it was that professionalism that compelled him to stay behind and help others out of the North Tower of the WTC, amidst a backdrop of horror and mayhem that Greene paints in the mind's eye with a graphic clarity that television images could never penetrate. At that moment, when the walls were literally about to come down, so too did the constructs that separate Americans into categories. It's impossible to imagine anyone in that horrific situation caring whether or not the hand stretched out to help them was conservative, gay, or foreign, and Greene illustrates this as he takes the reader through his fortuitous escape from hell and through the rest of his day.The million-dollar question left hanging over his audience: Does it take shared tragedy to get Americans to truly come together as one, in the way that's always idealized yet neglected?The unfortunate answer, as Greene takes his work beyond 9/11, looks like yes, as he convincingly explores America's \\"business as usual\\" attitude through a diorama of topics in part two, Politics, which includes the build-up towards war with Iraq, and part three, Race and Hypocrisy.Even those who don't like looking into that mirror would be hard pressed to trap Greene's work in the category of disgruntled ranting as he has done his homework, providing timelines and context behind so-called controversial issues to bring his point home.Greene challenges readers to acknowledge inherent hypocrisy simmering under the surface of unflinching patriotism, and he isn't afraid to upset anyone's incredulous sense of \\"civilized\\" American superiority. Greene's book is a warning: if Americans lose the true meaning of professed ideals, while also acquiescing the need for governmental accountability in actions that effect the world, history will repeat itself until we get it right...if at all."},{"Title":"When the Walls Came Down","review":"The author's first-hand account of surviving and helping others survive the attack on the North Tower on 9/11 offer insights I have not read elsewhere. This in-and-of itself makes the book a fascinating read, but the author goes further.He brings to focus the fact that there was a brief moment in this country when the tragedy of 9/11 brought all of America together. Our race, religion, politics, or other elements that tend to divide us simply did not matter. Unfortunately, that unity was short lived. In fact, our nation is even more divided, and our civil liberties are more at risk than ever before.The author details his personal views of life in America and its history from the perspective of a black, Native American. Being white and from European descent, I was at first challenged by them, then intrigued, and in some cases disturbed. Case in point: I did not know that in the same battle Jessica Lynch fought, Lori Ann Piestewa, a single Mom and Native American died. Also taken captive and brutally beaten was Shoshawna Johnson, a black single Mom. These women are just as much heroes as Ms. Lynch, yet neither was given the same credit that was due to them. Ms. Lynch tried in vain to set the record straight. She openly shared on national TV her concern for the inaccuracies and omissions of her ordeal. I share these concerns as well. In fact, I was outraged.Needless to say, the book is filled with other insights: some amusing, some very sad. One might think the author would be bitter, but that is not at all the case. He simply wants to point out that there are different views of life in America, and after reading the book, I gained a better appreciation of them.An excellent read! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"When the Walls Came Down","review":"Ken Greene knows firsthand about 9/11, the day the walls came down. He was there!

FBI did and probably still doing monstrous things to our country. We do need a revolution of ideas and a rising up of our citizens to get back the freedoms given by the founding fathers. This book shows just how insidious Hoover and others acted to take away our freedoms in the name of that freedom. All He was really interested in was his own grandisment and power at the expense of ordinary Americans. Worst of all, so many in Congress went along with him."},{"Title":"FBI Secrets: An Agents Expose","review":"The author is a former agent and as such has written the most recent and most authoritative insider account which describes the day-to-day office level details of COINTELPRO (when it functioned illegally). The keeping of secret lists of people to be arrested and sent to detention camps is morally repulsive enough,but the bureau did far more than this. It broke into buildings to gather evidence, planted bugs and incriminating evidence. It used this illegally obtained material to blackmail others, including public figures. It directly interfered in the administration of justice by intimidating witnesses, in some cases having its informants perjure themselves by coming forth with false testimony. It even had people murdered.Knowledge of such activites is of particular importance now because of the legalization and reestablishment of COINTELPRO which occurred with the enactment of the Patriot Act. This event totally changes the security landscape both for activists and for corporate America. Its implications are guaranteed to be a force chilling to democratic ideals, a new dark period in American history. This book should be a starting point for any corporate strategist charged with maintaining an even foothold as acts of repression unfold. As checks and balances disappear, abuses of power emerge. It is now legal for any federal investigator to demand any business document without court supervision whether it be the reading habits of library patrons, the member rosters of organizations,or the minutes of closed meetings. Any person which reveals the material has been compromised is guilty of a federal felony.The author describes how he was taught to pick locks and sneak into look for evidence. He had to do it at risk of expulsion from the FBI if he was caught. Now it has been legalized and no legal record of the breakin is required. With these new powers agents may easily subvert third party security firms and alarm companies that are paid to protect their custormers. A careful read of the atrocities the bureau committed in the past vs what they can do now legally is very sobering."},{"Title":"FBI Secrets: An Agents Expose","review":"After a lifetime of devoted service conducting illegal wiretaps, break-ins and burglaries, known as \\"black bag jobs\\" former FBI agent Wesley Swearingen decided to tell all about an FBI that few people really know.To be fair, government employees, no matter what agency employs them, are awash in an ocean of fraud, waste, corruption and general mismanagement perpetuated by their so called \\"supervisors.\\" These individuals are generally unemployable, mediocre and incompetent. Thank God for government service, the largest, most pernicious public employment and welfare system in existence next to the Pentagon and its arms suppliers, or they'd be on the streets.\\"FBI Secrets\\" does more than expose specific secrets documenting COINTELPRo-type programs designed to deny and destroy the rights of American citizens to actively engage in political dissent, it exposes the moral dilemma faced by those who perpetuate them. Admittedly, this agent waited until after retirement to expose what he knows; but he reveals to the reader the torment of an agent who became disillusioned with the agency yet had a career to protect.Swearingen could have simply walked away. it would not have stopped these invasive violations of American's civil liberties but, at least, he would nt have been involved. With hindsight, and through the work of many investigative journalists and authors, information concerning how the FBI violates the civil rights of American citizens is abundantly avaialble.The history of the founding of the FBI, beginning in 1908 with the corrupt Bureau of Investigation, the Palmer raids, orchestrated by Attorney General Mitchell Palmer and executed by an unknown federal bureaucrat named J. Edgar Hoover, stands in stark contrast to the James Stewart inspired cinematic travesty, \\"The FBI Story.\\" Certainly, the author's slim, yet powerful volume, stands as a beacon of truth next to this cinematic garbargio.The peculiarities of the Director, his life-long homosexual relationship with Clyde Tolson, his liasons with other rich and pwerful gay men, such as Lewis Rosenthiel of Schenley, the red baiting Roy Cohn and New York's Cardinal Spellman made, in large measure, what the Bureau what it is today, the nation's political police."},{"Title":"FBI Secrets: An Agents Expose","review":"&quot;FBI Secrets: An Agent's Exposure&quot; is a chronological narration written by whistleblower M. Wesley Swearingen about his career as Special Agent for the FBI during the period 1951-1977. The marketing forward by Ward Churchill (we are not privy to who he is) notes Wesley had the necessary courage, fortitude and character to reveal the intrinsic wrongness and illegal doings of the FBI over a span of several decades.Wesley explains how he was able to muster the requisite conscience and personal integrity to expose, albeit belatedly, the bigotry, cheating, lying, burgularizing, wire taps, bugs and unauthorized surveillances he had participated in or witnessed during 25 years as Special Agent. Also emphasized is how the Black Panther Party, the Weatherman (militant college students of the SDS founded by Thomas Haden) and individual top political activists were subjected to harassment, censure and surveillance without due cause.Swearingen is to be commended for writing about alleged eye-witnessed corruption in the FBI. He effectively indicts himself as a co-conspirator, something which ordinarily adds credence to a confession. As a writer, Wesley's naivete exposes himself as a haughty Special Agent who is troubled with financial and personal security, an over zealous need to make faultfinding remarks of his associates and a total inability to get along with others. Although it fails the rule of &quot;It Takes a King to Unseat a King,&quot; the book's content is revealing, easy to digest, reasonably well arranged and does give one pause to ponder."},{"Title":"FBI Secrets: An Agents Expose","review":"I was taught at an early age to respect authority.

South End Press asked Churchill to read the book for his comments. Churchill is not one of the authors as claimed by C. Cumming.This book is a must read for everyone who wants to know what the FBI is capable of doing to their civil rights. The author knows what he is writing about because he lived through most of what is reported."},{"Title":"FBI Secrets: An Agents Expose","review":"Certainly there have been incidents and events in the FBI's history that given the opportunity it would have done things differently and better. However, this does not negate the hundreds of thousands of successful prosecutions of federal cases handled both efficiently and professionally by tens of thousands of current and former FBI agents who have devoted their lives and careers to ensuring that America's citizens are protected and criminals prosecuted. Whether Swearingen's \\"FBI Secrets\\" is a valid measure for that review remains to be seen.The real test of credibility about anything Swearingen has to offer the reader must be based on his own words and personal firsthand accounts. What follows is but one example of many where he reduces the nexus of his reliability to a mere two very important paragraphs. If the reader is to accept the premise of just this one event, then all of Swearingen's \\"FBI Secrets\\" must stand on its own; otherwise, like a house of cards, or in this instance a stream of fabrications, it all must fall of its own weight.Chapter 12 \\"Perjury Before Congress,\\" Swearingen relates the 1975 testimony of W. Raymond Wannall, then Assistant Director (A.D.) of the FBI's Intelligence Division before the Church Committee investigating governmental operations regarding intelligence activities.Swearingen is not taken out of context or misquoted because he is clearly accusing Wannall of lying under oath before Congress:\\"SOON after Raymond Wannall testified before Congress, he traveled to Los Angeles, where he held a BRIEFING for AGENTS in the Security Division of the Los Angeles FBI field office, WHICH I ATTENDED. Wannall EXPLAINED how he and other TOP FBI OFFICIALS had CONSPIRED to ALTER TESTIMONY before the Church Committee.\\"\\"Mr. Wannall SAID \\"When it came to [testifying about] black bag jobs, WE SELECTED agents who had NO FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE of the ILLEGAL BREAK-INS to conduct a search of the [FBI] files.\\" HE SAID that those agents who had had no experience in bag jobs WOULD NOT KNOW WHERE TO LOOK for information on bag jobs. WANNALL SAID that the only documentation they could find was what existed in the indices for surreptitious entries, WHICH WAS NOT MUCH. WANNALL SAID that no effort was made to interview agents who, based on information in their PERSONEL FILES, might have had any knowledge of bag jobs. WANNALL SAID, \\"We did a GOOD JOB of CONCEALING THE EXTENT of black bag jobs.\\"\\" (p. 101; Emphasis Added)It is curious that Swearingen quotes Wannall (even providing parenthetical details) but then goes on to editorialize or paraphrase what he said at this briefing. Why not provide the entire text of the Wannall's speech, or better yet, since Swearingen was nearing the twilight of his career and had already demonstrated his loathing for the FBI in his book, that he wouldn't have secretly recorded such a devastatingly indicting presentation. After all, Swearingen was an FBI agent and allegedly familiar with secret monitoring and the like and certainly could have memorialized this meeting in some more definitive way, or at a minimum, fully quoted Wannall.Swearingen doesn't state how many agents were at this briefing, however, the agent population of the Bureau in 1975 was about 8500 and the Los Angeles Division was then, and remains, one of the FBI's largest field offices. It is reasonable to estimate that the Intelligence Division must have comprised at least a significant percentage of agents assigned to the L.A. office. But for illustration purposes lets put that number on the low side, fifty, or maybe even less, twenty-five agents who attended the briefing by A.D. Wannall along with Swearingen.The reader has to accept, as prima facie evidence, that A.D. Wannall deliberately lied under oath before the Church Committee under penalty of contempt at a minimum and certainly of a potential perjury charge, and then held a briefing of ordinary street agents in Los Angeles to tell them exactly HOW and WHY he lied.This then, if the reader is to accept Swearingen's recitation of the incident, was not a briefing by Wannall at all, but was, in every sense of the word, a confession to a felony.For this to be true, A.D. Wannall must have felt compelled to unload this terrible burden of lying to congress about the suspected illegal deeds of the FBI to a roomful of agents he did not personally know, any one of whom (including Swearingen himself) could have picked up the phone at the end of the briefing and called someone, anyone in the press, or from the Church Committee, and in the parlance of the street \\"dropped a dime\\" on the Assistant Director. Certainly there would have been another agent in the room who would not want to hear something so distasteful coming from the mouth of a senior FBI official. Or in the alternate, maybe carry a grudge against Wannall or any senior FBI official and want to even the score a bit. Why would have Wannall felt comfortable enough to confide in a group of agents he did not know, or worse, know whether they would keep his confidence to themselves? Wannall must have been an incredibly stupid, nave, or trusting individual. But perhaps the agents present would never have spoken about Wannall's confession because they were afraid of the repercussions as Swearingen repeatedly claims for himself. But, J. Edgar was already gone and the Bureau had been changing monthly since his death in 1972. However, since A.D. Wannall's career, pension and retirement were in jeopardy, along with a potential indictment, staggering and ruinous legal fees, and quite possibly a prison sentence, confessing would have been a major leap of faith for the Assistant Director. No, Wannall was no fool, but we have only Swearingen to contest that at this point. Because, he tells the reader, he was there at the time and heard the confession himself.Swearingen tells us that Wannall's confession contained the details needed to have him charged with obstruction of justice, and with the witnesses in the room at the time, certainly all of whom if called upon to testify under oath, would have told the truth about hearing that Wannall had not only lied to the Church Committee but how he had pulled it off. Wannall, according to Swearingen's account, even implicated other \\"top FBI officials\\" in the same breath, creating the groundwork for a conspiracy and telling those present why the committee was looking in the wrong place. Unwittingly, Wannall, if he said these things, was broadening the potential witness list against himself or making the agents present at the briefing potential defendants' after-the-fact for remaining silent, or at a minimum, subject to an internal FBI disciplinary investigation.Swearingen reports this exceedingly significant and specific event as if it actually happened; but the reader has only his word that it even occurred. If Swearingen were able to produce the tiniest thread of corroboration it could add even an ounce of credibility to this tale. Further, there are no footnotes (other than Swearingen's own editorial comments), no proper sourcing of any factual claims or even a bibliography with which any intelligent reader could further test Swearingen's factual accuracy on other claims made in the book. This becomes then no more than a first-person running narrative, a diary of hatred and fabrication where everyone connected with the FBI is a complete fool or incompetent; it suggests only of retribution for a less than illustrious career.Swearingen's hatred for the FBI is obvious from cover to cover, for example: When only in the Bureau a matter of weeks he states, \\"But no matter how ridiculous New Agents class seemed, I could not bring myself to get up and leave.\\" (p. 9) \\"In just a few short months of being in the FBI I had observed a dark side of cheating and bigotry that made me uncomfortable. Still, I did not want to quit a well-paying job that commanded worldwide respect. \\" (p.17) \\"This and other intimidation tactics of Hoover's FBI, such as the weight requirement, were pushing me more and more toward leaving the FBI.\\" (p.48) (After resigning from the FBI and being reinstated) \\"I thought of resigning again but decided to stay because I could not afford to be bouncing around from one job to another. My employment r&eacute;sum&eacute; would look terrible.\\" (p.51) \\"I was afraid to say or do what Turner had the guts to do. I wanted job security. I was ashamed of what I had become.\\" (p.55) \\"After witnessing twenty years of FBI wrongdoing, I had accepted it as a means to survive in the Bureau.\\" (p.1) And, there are many more examples.This event allegedly took place in 1975, \\"FBI Secrets\\" came out in 1995. The reader must then also believe that in those intervening twenty years (or even up to now, 2008, thirty-three years later) that Swearingen couldn't convince just one of those in attendance at A.D. Wannall's confession to step forward and offer even a hint of corroboration. Swearingen though, has been consistent in his lack of timely reporting of significant events (see Swearingen's 2008 book, To Kill a President; Finally---An Ex-FBI Agent Rips aside the Veil of Secrecy that Killed JFK, at amazon.com), written over four decades after the fact.The reader need only apply a modicum of judgment and a very simple test to decide whether Swearingen's reporting is plausible at all. Where is the logic? Where is there a gram of common sense in Swearingen's claim to such a fanciful event as A.D. Wannall making these dreadfully self-incriminating statements to a roomful of agents? There isn't any. It makes no sense because it never happened and Swearingen cannot prove otherwise, and the reader need not be compelled to accept only his word for it. A briefing by Wannall may have indeed occurred, but devoid of Swearingen's fanciful rhetoric and concocted dialogue. If just this one instance of a specific event cannot be proven in any manner, then the entire book and its author lack credibility. If the reader is inclined to accept this seminal event as factual, then so be it; everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If not, then nothing Swearingen offers can be taken at face value and \\"FBI Secrets\\" collapses under the weight of the author's fabrications."},{"Title":"FBI Secrets: An Agents Expose","review":"I was interesed in reading about the FBI, and found this book through Amazon.com.

Including his lamenting of the huge cost the American government was spending to fight the Indian wars! Sound familiar about the war on terror today???Unbeknownst to Mr. Cremony at that time also, the character of the Apaches as he described them are in many ways very similiar to the tactics and character of terrorist today. (This is not to say the Apache were terrorist, I just find the similiarities remarkable). One would think some of the things learned in his book could certainly be applied today.There is also much praise of the physical prowess, preserverance, and cunning of the Apache. If what he writes is true, I have come to respect the prowess of the Apache as nearly unmatched! There is even one amazing story of an Apache who took on a rampaging buffalo armed only with his large knife.My only regret with this book is he did not dwelve into the Apache diet enough. It was the perfect time to take a scientific look at their diet from this fading, but very active tribe. One gets the sense that he really didn't care, or didn't bother to write much more about it. He was after all, a tactical soldier, not a dietician. And what he writes about their diet certainly reflects that. I believe much precious knowledge was lost.One may not always have to read Spartan-Greek wars book to learn about fighting wars. (As if reading classics alludes one to some kind of sophistication.) A good simple cowboy-indian book may be all you need.I might add his story is also a good Western read when most of America's West was a no-man's land.

It is a lamentable practice of modern, often \\"progressive\\" types, to apply today's standards and values to people of the past, who obviously did not share the preconceptions of 21st century liberalism. It is patently unfair (as well as ignorant) to apply one's values to people of the past. Fortunately, the majority of the reviewers evaluated this book for what it is- an amazing insight into the culture of a remarkable people, the Apache. That Cremony (the author) was a 19th century American makes this book all the more remarkable. The sensibilities of that era might have caused the average man to dismiss as mere savagery many of the practices and customs detailed in this work. One cannot separate Cremony from his century, and I would not want to. Odd that Cremony's critics slam HIM for his 1860s world view, but don't equally apply 21st century values and beliefs to the Apaches, who really did torture, murder, enslave, steal, terrorize and make bloody war on the defenseless Mexican inhabitants of the 19th century Southwest.

The author, John C. Cremony, a military officer, stays focused on the Apache tribe admirably recording his observations without divergence. What I found fascinating is his description about their culture and the difference of it from other Indian tribes, his personal bias notwithstanding. Example, the Apache's \\"whole system of life and training is to plunder, murder and deceive, they cannot comprehend opposite attributes in others. He whom we would denounce as the greatest scoundrel they regard with special esteem and honor. With no people are they on amicable terms, and never hesitate to rob from each other when it can be done with impunity. There is no sympathy among them; the quality is unknown.\\"This and Cremony's other comments regarding dealing with the Apache, like: \\"...other devices were resorted to for the purpose of quietly infiltrating the Apache mind with a sense of our superiority, but always most carefully guarding against any appearance of seeking to contrast American attainment with savage ignorance.\\" caused this reviewer to wonder about the current American exposure to cultures worldwide and how we relate with \\"those\\" people. Do we understand them or do we presuppose that our values are superior and so operate according to our personal biases? Hmmm, a labeling of \\"ugly American\\" comes to mind.I continued to wonder, when dealing with another culture do we Americans comport ourselves with an impartiality and an open-mindedness; do we allow for a bilateral exchange of ideas and perhaps a better understanding of our differing stations? Would not that be beneficial to both cultures?Captain Cremony explains how he learned to deal with the Apache and their \\"savage\\" ways by learning their language, then listening and observing. This book is such a lesson."},{"Title":"Life among the Apaches (A Rio Grande classic)","review":"Cremony's \\"Life among the Apaches\\" provides interestingly brutal insights into the Apaches, giving instances of their cruelty, such as burning the skulls of captives until their brains heat to the point of exploding them; he also reveals their use of slaves, and their general slothfulness. But one gets the impression that if he were writing today, he would leave out many of the unflattering details regarding his subject. He is at pains to point out the cleverness of the Apaches, even to the point of insisting that their Athabaskan language was richer and more complex than may be the case. He insists on the bravery of the Apaches, as well as their kindred tribe, the Navajoes, but seems to prove the opposite.One of the more annoying things about the work is the scarcity of dates so it is difficult to see any progress in the history. Cremony also employs the passive voice in a way that obscures his point, perhaps out of some false modesty. But this false modesty comes undone with a number of self-references that border on braggadocio.Still, the work provides insights that would not be available today for reasons of political correctness, and is a curious attempt to gain insights into a people Cremony was not too shy to describe as primitive and savage, with a frankness that would be condemned today."},{"Title":"Life among the Apaches (A Rio Grande classic)","review":"Anyone with the slightest interest in anthropology or history should read this most-excellent book.A fascinating account from the early days of contact with native American tribes.I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Life among the Apaches (A Rio Grande classic)","review":"Cremony's book inspired many a Hollywood screenwriter, and for years his words have been taken as gospel. As a writer who lives in the Southwest, I have visited some of the important locations and began to doubt his veracity. Scholars have since shown that Cremony was habitually inflating his own importance and his knowledge of Apache ways and history. Of particular note are his highly fictionalized accounts of the life of Mangas Coloradas -- a man far more important to history than Cremony. But this work remains an extremely telling document of a time and place -- and all the strange attitudes that made up &quot;white&quot; perceptions."},{"Title":"Life among the Apaches (A Rio Grande classic)","review":"Cremony was known to gloat and fictionalize his stories. And as noted in the book description, Cremony's main intent was to further suppress those who were here in America before himself, in particular the Apaches. If you read this book, also read Cochise by Ed Sweeney and Mangas Coloradas to get a view from both sides of the fence."},{"Title":"Yume No Hon: The Book of Dreams","review":"Catherynne M. Valente, Yume No Hon: The Book of Dreams (Prime, 2005)Sometimes I feel as if I should have a \\"five-and-a-half star\\" ranking. I've given a lot of books five stars in the past couple of years-- more five-star reviews than I'd given out in the decade before, almost. (Blame my getting a library card again, and thus not being limited to my own books.) But there are some books that transcend even the five-star rating, that are not only outstanding works of art, but that are so beautifully written that they deserve a place on the short shelf of sacred literature. The benchmark, for me, of this trait has long been Wendy Walker's The Secret Service, the book I consider the most beautifully written and constructed book I've ever read. Yume No Hon: The Book of Dreams is the first book I've come across since reading The Secret Service that rises to the same level.Throw away your conceptions of what a novel is before cracking the cover on this one. All the stuff you got taught in English class, chuck it out the window. Yume No Hon is character study in its purest form. The problem is, you've got an autobiography from the most unreliable of narrators (cf. Lauren Slater's Excellent Lying, to which this bears a passing resemblance more than once, were our main character epileptic and living in America); every time you think you've got an answer as to Ayako's real nature, you're likely to turn around and find yourself with many more questions. It's the mimetics of creative nonfiction, but turned around and attached to fiction; is Ayako dying and delirious, or possessed by powerful spirits? Is she ghost, hermit, memory, God? Ultimately, the answers to the questions don't matter (though the very end of the book does offer the reader a chance to resolve them); the journey, rather than the destination, is the point here.And what a journey it is. Valente's language is lush, rich, precise, every word slotted into place with painstaking care. While reading this, I found myself with a constant sense of overwhelming rightness in word choice (\\"rightness\\" here as opposed to \\"suitability;\\" a Dennis Lehane or George R. R. Martin novel contains suitable language, but the sentences could be phrased in many ways and still get the point across; the right language is that place where you think that there really is no better way to phrase something). The book is rich with striking, original metaphors and turns of phrase that will have the lover of beautiful language scrambling for a notebook to copy it all down. Buy two, actually; you may end up filling one completely before you're done.While the one negative effect of all this is to highlight the book's few typos (and, comparatively, there are very few; if memory serves, I found five, and two of them were arguable), this is one of those exceptionally rare pieces of work where stumbling upon a typo became something forgivable.Yume No Hon belongs with Walker's The Secret Service, McCarthy's Blood Meridian, Koja's Strange Angels, and a handful of other novels on the short shelf of sacred literature-- the first stuff you save when your apartment catches fire. It is a small jewel, to be read, pondered, re-read, and (for novelists) aspired to. Find a copy. Read it. *****"},{"Title":"Yume No Hon: The Book of Dreams","review":"I found this book at the library after hearing about the author. I was curious and read it on a rather hectic trip.My initial reaction was mixed...but as the story mellowed in my brain and invaded my dreams, I knew I had stumbled upon something more than a cunningly written piece of poetic fiction.Catherynne M. Valente cleverly weaves several elements of myth from around the world into the five tiered pagoda in the book of dreams. I could not begin to give the twisting turning plot justice by trying to describe it here. It would be like trying to capture the chattering and singing of a brook as it winds through the woods.Suffice to say, you would be well served to dive into this world of spirits and myths where the silk moths weave slick, black, gloss...."},{"Title":"Yume No Hon: The Book of Dreams","review":"I've been aching to write a review for this book since I finished it a couple of weeks ago. But where does one find the words for such an inspiring and intoxicating work?Read this book for a love of language. Read this book to be immersed in the voice of solitude. Read this book to lose yourself for much too short a time.To be honest, I read this wonderful book in a few days and promptly reread it immediately after, which is not something I often do. Valente paints with such vibrant language that I could taste the weak tea, the river and the dust. I plan on reading this treasure again, very soon, and will continue to do so whenever I need such a friend."},{"Title":"Yume No Hon: The Book of Dreams","review":"This book can be rated on many levels.As a pure literary piece, as prose and imagery, and as simply what it is.As pure literature, some may be disappointed. Some might believe that there is no \\"point\\" to this story. There is no \\"reason\\" for it, no technical introduction, climax or any of the myriad of literary structures treasured by conventional wisdom.As prose and imagery, this is a stunningly and sometimes overwrought piece of literature. Situations and parable leap from this page and overwhelm your senses. As a pure love of writing that gallops on a page rather than runs, or twist and turns your mind, I have never met its match at this point.Which leads to the 3rd way, to take this book as it is. It will not fit any of the defined categories you may think of offhand, but it is certainly something that will capture you for a time in its pure love of what it writes of."},{"Title":"Yume No Hon: The Book of Dreams","review":"In exile on a mountain in medieval Japan, Akayo is an old woman whose psyche has fractured into a number of dreams with range from her mountain land to Egyptian myth and Greek mythology. In the passage of a year, Ayako explores these dreams--and, ultimately, unites them. Lyrical, mythic, and loosely bounded by plot, Yume no Hon is beautiful but a bit overwrought. However, as the plot develops the book gains focus and ends strongly. It's not for all readers, but I recommend it to those who love lyricism and are willing to put time and effort into reading it.For the first half of Yume no Hon I was somewhat underwhelmed: the book is beautiful prose poetry, but its weak plot leaves it unfocused. I love Valente for the beauty of her books: vivid images, lyrical language, mythic content--her writing reads like music. But Akayo's dreams range a broad spectrum from the Greek sphinx to creation myths to the mountains of Japan, and for the first half of the book the plot is weak, stranding the reader among the shifting dreams with little direction to guide him. The beautiful images and language grow repetitive and it's too easy to lose focus, and pages skim by read but not understood or fully experienced.As the book goes on, however, the plot comes together and grows stronger. It's still easy to get lost in the lyricism, but the disparate influences seem less random and the dreams gain direction as the book gains purpose. And as it comes together, the book redeems its slow beginning. With less anxiety about the book's direction, it's easier to enjoy the lyricism and mythology. Akayo's journey has a satisfying conclusion which has a pleasing sense of closure but remains expansive and pregnant with potential. The book's end also begs an immediate reread, to better experience the story with the entire plot in mind. All in all, Yume no Hon is not Valente's best--it can be difficult to read, it lacks some of the magic and joy of her other books, and the plot forms too late. I would recommend readers pick up her more recent novels (The Orphan's Tales or Palimpsest), but if you've read those or find Yume no Hon more intriguing, then by all means pick it up. For readers who love lyrical language and mythic content, and who are willing to put some effort into the work of reading, this is a beautiful and meaningful text."},{"Title":"Yume No Hon: The Book of Dreams","review":"I have read a number of Valente's works and really enjoyed them all. This book was no exception; it is beautifully written and reminds more of poetry than a traditional story at times.This book tells the story of a women who has fled a village when it was invaded and chosen to live the life of a hermit on a mountain. She lives in a pagoda, an old temple, on the mountain and learns lessons from the river and the gate. She is very old and at times had trouble separating dream and reality; the villagers of the village below think she is a ghost and bring offerings to her.The beautiful descriptions and lyrical phrases in this book are outstanding. As always I am blown away by the poetic quality of Valente's writing. She is able to create wonderful imagery of both beautiful and violent things.This book won't be for everyone; as with her book Labyrinth, the story is vague and at times it is hard to tell what is reality and what is dream...but then that is kind of the point. If you like easy to read stories, with clear-cut plots this isn't the book for you. If you don't mind vagueness and enjoy poetry you will love the lyrical quality and beauty of this book.The book ties together a number of themes. There is a Japanese overtone to it, Babylonian creation myths are included, and theories of quantum physics are touched on. I know it sounds odd, but for this book it really works. There are also illustrations throughout, which is something new for Valente and I enjoyed those as well.Overall another outstanding book from Valente. I love the poetry of her written and the way she makes lush descriptions of everything with analogies. The story is vague and dreamy, so it is not for everyone. If you like poetry and if you don't mind vagueness I recommend you pick this up. If you have enjoyed Valente's previous works I also recommend you pick this up."},{"Title":"Miracle in the Making: The Adam Taliaferro Story","review":"All too often in today's world of youth sports; parents, coaches and players miss the meaning of sportsmanship.

It helps you to understand what Asperger's is, why your child does what s/he does, and most importantly how to work with your child, teachers, and others to make life enjoyable and more functional again.

I would not hesitate to recommend it to a parent or proffesional working with AS/HFA kids. I especially found the advice to parents about working with teachers/therapists to be very common sense, but not condescending. ie (pp107) &quot;One of your biggest challenges as parents of a child with AS/HFA is bringing all the therapy options together into a cohesive treatment program that adresses your childs needs and promotes a normal development in an integrated fashion.&quot;The goal of his book, as quoted on page 21 &quot;is to help you decide whether the dx of AS /HFA are relevant to the person in your life you are worried about and whether this book will help you in your search for answers.&quot;The process of using the DSM IV and how doctors use it to pinpoint your childs dx was made quite clear and was helpful. I was greatly helped by the explanation of the dx process in chapter two. The chapter on treatment options was laid out as clearly as posssible also. This book can give hope to parents of kids with AS that your kids will be ok, we just need to pivot expectations of ourselves and the way we can work with our kids.I strongly agrree with the statement on pages 7 &amp; 8...&quot;As a parent, you will want to make sure that your child receives the most accurate diagnosis possible, but, in the case of these disorders, you need to be aware that precision may elude us for some time to come. What's important is that...regardless of the label, that the treatments suggested fit with your child's weaknesses and strengths.&quot;Quite a few chapters were devoted to suggestions for working with AS/HFA kids at home and at school. there was alo a chapter on Teenage and Adult AS persons.Highly recommended!Mrs. F"},{"Title":"A Parent's Guide to Asperger Syndrome and High-Functioning Autism: How to Meet the Challenges and Help Your Child Thrive","review":"There is a research thrust to this book (unsurprising given Ozonoff's research contributuons) that puts it a few notches above others in the market. Unquestionably this, plus a very fluent writing style, puts the book in a different class.Unlike specific intervention texts, it does not lay out particular lesson plans but reviews methodological principles and best practices. As one would expect from the authors, the book is superb on descriptions of Autistic Disorders and prognosis. It has less advice on specific intervention strategies than one might like, but it does offer reviews of approaches. For interventions, I would recommend looking at Succeeding with Interventions for Asperger Syndrome Adolescents.So what does this book offer over the many others on the same bookshelf? Well it's horses for courses. It's avery balanaced book and certainly it doesn't understate the difficulties. I think that professionals and researchers will get a more out of it than others. However, there just isn't a whole pile written on AS and adolescence. Hence parents with a research interest will also gain a lot. Ultimately it is a slightly more 'high brow' book than notional equivalents.

This book also covers factually and with sympathy and sensitivity topics such as adolescense, adult-hood, and dating, as well as the usual preschool and elementary age recommendations.The positive suggestions offered in this book will be inspirational and educational for parents, and should be shared with those in the schools, colleges, and even the employment fields--in other words to anyone dealing with an \\"aspie\\".

The book is very well-written and has a positive outlook.

She too found it an excellent book and the authors' suggestions very helpful in order to guide her son forward with his socialization. This current school year he is being home schooled due to the school system being unfamiliar with Asperger's. Our grandson has a very high IQ but this grandma could not understand \\"why\\" his social skills were lacking if he was so intelligent.

The books goes into great detail of all of the evidence surrounding Austism from vaccinations, to the genetic link. Most importantly it offers a very impartial view. It presents all of the facts but doesn't try and sway you in any particular direction. There are some great examples of people living with these disorders and how they have turned their weaknesses into strengths and lead fulfilling lives. At this stage of my involvement with this disorder, this was exactly what I wanted to learn about on the next step of my journey. Reassurance that life will more than likely be ok for my child, the book helps you to think about things a little differently and look for the positives in what might seem like debilitating issues at the time.

They are all written in running sentences; no points or bullets are used.Here is a simple drill:\\"Player 1 passes to 2, after which 1 overtakes 2, who waits for 1 and turns to dribble past 1 (See figure 2.3). Once 2 gets a short distance past 1, player 2 turns and passes back to 1.

It explores the paradox of using the army to build national identity with forced enlistment from marginal social groups---including convicts, vagrants and homosexuals. The army became a feared fighting force, but mostly by crushing internal rebels and smaller neighbors like Paraguay, not first-rate opponents. Brazilians came to dread military service, avoiding it whenever possible, and eventually a less arbitrary recruitment system emerged. Beattie paints a convincing picture of the evolution of a major institution in modern Brazil. His broad approach to evidence, deploying an impressive array of conventional and innovative sources, further displays the potential of this new military history. T. Whigham's \\"I Die With My Country\\" and \\"The Paraguayan War\\" have important new material on the War of the Triple Alliance. The army's bloody role in suppressing dissent is covered, often brilliantly, in R. Levine, \\"Vale of Tears,\\" T. Diacon, \\"Millenarian Vision, Capitalist Reality,\\" and especially E. da Cunha, \\"Rebellion in the Backlands.\\" S.

Even without the audio, I must say how impressed I am with this book! I have read a fair number of beginner/intermediate language courses and grammars, spread across numerous language families, and have found few that have introduced their language so well. Readers are introduced to culture and language, rather than language alone. It proceeds at an excellent pace and is very well edited. Lastly, it ends with a list of resources for additional study, and a clear indication that there is more to learn.This is not a grammar. If you are looking for a litany of declension and conjugation charts, you will be disappointed. Instead, concepts are introduced as necessary. The alphabet is covered in concise fashion, before introducing some pleasantries and the personal pronoun - a foundation for pointing out the use of the complement. Nouns in singular nominative are covered first, before moving to plurals. Then it moves to demonstrative pronouns, and a single verb paradigm (in only present aspect).Only then is case introduced. Rather than focus on the cases that nicely match up with English concepts (nominative, accusative and dative and their relationship to subject, object and indirect object), the first case introduced in depth is the locative. Low numbers are added, then a second verb paradigm. From there adjectives and noun agreement are explained. Once noun modifiers have been covered, as seems appropriate, the genitive is covered.A third present verb paradigm is offered, then a common verbal pattern called the \\"dative verb\\" allows for the dative case to be presented. And onward. In stepwise fashion, new topics are offered to the reader. Each step is combined with dialogues to help the reader grasp the concept. And though part of me craved a single chart that would call out the noun forms, or the adjective forms, or all the verbal paradigms possible, this sectioned approach allowed for syntax to be combined with word formation in a manner that fostered greater understanding.That being said, sentence structure is never really covered as such, but since the book is largely dialogues and extended readings, one picks up this structure naturally. Key vocabulary is provided throughout, though it is not always in \\"dictionary\\" form, which frequently made it harder for me to systematize as I made notes (my standard approach to learning is to write what I read, reinforcing and causing me to slow down long enough to actually grasp the topic). At times, I felt that the the author was not descriptive or precise enough for my liking. But I could tell that the intent was to not over-burden the learner with too much, too quickly. Having already been introduced to case, heavily dative based verbal constructs, adjective agreement, and tense and voice possibilities through study of other languages, I could tell that I was wanting to go faster, and relate what I already knew in other languages to Latvian. The author steadily insisted, through information throttling, on an incremental approach for all.Images are used sparingly, but there is still an effective amount of white space to make reading easy. Latvian words and phrases are in bold. This makes them easily differentiable from the surrounding English descriptions and instructions.There is an answer key in the back, making the \\"teach yourself\\" aspect verifiable (greatly appreciated). A small lexicon is available in the back, but only one way, Latvian to English - one of the things I didn't favor. Verb, noun and preposition charts are found in the back, though by the time I reached them I felt little need for them. Most helpful in the back is the listing of additional resources, which I intend to take full advantage of.Participles and gerunds are covered briefly, mostly only as they relate to specific formulations that assisted with the dialogues. As for usage to create passive and perfect tenses - the book unashamedly declares them beyond the scope of the book. Understandable, but unfortunate. I was not impressed by the way the imperative was introduced. I almost found it deceptive, only pointing out the actual pattern once one had a firmly-seated wrong impression of its operation. As a final note, I think more time could have been spent clarifying when a plural noun phrase listed was plural-only rather than listed as plural simply for the sake of the current dialogue. Once again, my efforts at systematizing sometimes ran against the grain of the book.While it won't make for a great reference work in my opinion, it is an excellent tool for introducing the language and culture. It will get the reader moving in Latvian, quickly and easily - and enjoyably."},{"Title":"plato the man and his work","review":"In order to read Plato with some facility it is almost imperative to read a commentary a long with the Dialogues. A.E. Taylor is a true guide to what Plato actually says and provides useful classical context that will keep out the most egregious error. This is an essential volume in any philosopher's library.One of the greatest thinkers of the ancient world, Plato instigated groundbreaking inquiries into morality, ethics, and the quest for happiness that continue to inform and influence philosophical discussion today. In this outstanding work of scholarship, a renowned expert on Plato presents a scrupulously accurate historical view of the great philosopher's life and works. Distinguished by its dispassionate scholarly analysis, Professor Taylor's discourse is refreshingly free of the biases that have frequently tainted other studies.A brief introductory chapter acquaints readers with the known events of Plato's life. The author then proceeds to an illuminating examination of the philosopher's voluminous writings, including the minor Socratic dialogues, as well as such major works as Phaedo, Symposium, Protagoras, Republic, Phaedrus, Timaeus, Laws, and other influential dialogues. The final chapter, \\"Plato in the Academy,\\" attempts to pin down?with the help of some of Plato's former students, such as Aristotle the philosopher's beliefs about numbers. In a substantial appendix, \\"The Platonic Apocrypha,\\" Professor Taylor examines writings that have sometimes been attributed to Plato, including several letters, and offers cogent reasons for accepting or rejecting them as Plato's work.Praised by Dean William R. Inge of Theology as \\"a great book, an honour to . . . British scholarship,\\" this volume is an invaluable guide for students, teachers, and other readers interested in philosophy."},{"Title":"plato the man and his work","review":"This review departs to some degree from the traditional amazon review. For those who are simply trying to decide whether to purchase this book or not I suggest ignoring my review and looking to the other reviews. I will list some of the pros and cons of this book as I see them but my review is aimed more towards those with a serious interest in Plato as opposed to those who are simply looking for a basic introduction to some of Plato's ideas.I think Taylor's book is worth reading whatever camp you fall in (despite some flaws). If you are new to Plato and are just looking for an introduction this book is probably as good as any and if you are a serious Plato enthusiast Taylor is still worth reading despite being a bit dated.I should also point out that I am not a Plato scholar so my review should be read as what it is: a review by a graduate student in philosophy with an interest in Plato but no real credentials.The first pro of this book is that it is one of the only books that deals with every single Platonic dialogue (I know Catherine Zuckert's bookPlato's Philosophers: The Coherence of the Dialoguesdoes as well but I have not read it yet). It is, therefore, good for anyone who is looking for analyses of some of the dialogues that are not treated as often in the secondary literature. This also allows A.E. Taylor to provide a unified portrait of the Platonic philosophy and to highlight themes which appear in all, or most, of the dialogues.One con of Taylor's method, in my opinion, is that he attempts to follow a chronological reading of Plato based on stylometric dating. Personally I think that the attempts to date Plato's writings stylometrically are seriously flawed (there is some evidence that Plato continually reworked his dialogues throughout his life which would make any stylistic chronology impossible).Unfortunately there is probably no other doctrine neutral way to date the Platonic dialogues (and any chronology based on doctrinal changes would wind up being circular). For the reader who is interested in this problem I suggest taking a look at the article \\"Re-reading Plato: the Problem of Platonic Chronology\\" by Jacob Howland. Not only does Howland argue that all attempts to provide a chronology of the Platonic corpus are seriously flawed but he also argues that this is not in anyway a hindrance since the interpretative method of reading the dialogues in conjunction with each other, so that they are each able to shed light on each other, tends to produce deeper and more interesting interpretations than the interpretations which attempt to determine the \\"development\\" of Plato's ideas based on a chronological reading. It might be helpful to give an example of what I mean. One of Plato's most famous doctrines is that knowledge is recollection. In the Phaedo Cebes describes this doctrine in this way, \\"According to this, [the doctrine that learning is recollection] we must at some previous time have learned what we now recollect. This is possible only if our soul existed somewhere before it took on this human shape. So according to this theory too, the soul is likely to be something immortal\\" (72e). Cebes takes the theory about learning being recollection to be a proof of the immortality of the soul. I have been told by those who read Greek that in this passage and the lines following Plato is contrasting and playing with the distinction between recollection (anamnesis) and memory (mneme) and that Cebes misunderstands recollection in terms of memory (something we have known at a previous time in a temporal sense rather than the a priori in the more modern sense). We can see this misunderstanding if we compare what Plato says about recollection in other dialogues. In the Phaedrus Socrates says, \\"a human being must understand speech in terms of general forms, proceeding to bring many perceptions together into a reasoned unity. That process is the recollection of the things our soul saw when it was traveling with god\\" (249c). Here we see that recollection is not the memory of things we saw in the past but rather the gathering of many perceptions under one common form. Plato, of course, still speaks of this mythically as 'when we were traveling with god' but it would be a mistake to take Plato's myths literally (it would take me too far afield to explain why I believe that). The point of all of this is that in order to pinpoint the mistake Cebes makes in regard to recollection as an error we have to read the dialogues together. We could say that the Phaedo is an earlier dialogue and that Plato changed his mind. But we have very little, if any, evidence for doing so (why could the Phaedo not be later than the Phaedrus in which case everything would be reversed) and we would have a much more impoverished understanding of a fundamental Platonic doctrine (the notion that learning is recollection); whereas if we read the dialogues together they are able to shed light on each other and give us a much fuller understanding of Platonic philosophy.There is also some evidence that Plato himself composed the dialogues in terms of tetralogies and there is clearly a dramatic narrative tying many of the dialogues together. It seems more logical to me to read the dialogues in terms of the succession Plato himself devised rather than relying on a dubious chronology (I believe Zuckert follows this method in her book and Joseph Cropsey follows the same method in his bookPlato's World: Man's Place in the Cosmos).A.E. Taylor wrote this book at a time when it was still widely believed that we could make some fairly solid pronouncements about the chronology of the Platonic dialogues and this becomes a central part of Taylor's interpretations since he believes, \\"To understand a great thinker is, of course, impossible unless we know something of the relative order of his works\\" (pg16). While this is, I believe, a flaw of Taylor's method it is not a terribly serious one and I believe most of what he says about Plato does not depend for its validity on the validity of his chronology. This should not be a reason to entirely avoid Taylor, therefore, but should be kept in mind while reading.Another con of Taylor's book, which is also a pro to some degree, is his tendency to read Plato anachronistically. There are two main ways in which he does this. The first is that he tends to read Plato in terms of Christianity, as for example, when he writes, \\"the ideal of Socrates and the Christian ideal are fundamentally identical\\" (pg192) or \\"The conception set before us in these pages is manifestly the Hellenic counterpart of the 'mystical way' of Christianity\\" (pg181). The good part about all this is that Taylor definitely recognizes a religious dimension to Plato's thought which is not always recognized by analytic interpretations of his philosophy but which is essential to a genuine understanding of Plato. When Plato claims that the objects of thought are the truly real in contrast to the objects of sense perception he is not simply devising a theory about predication, or the status of universals, and when he argues for the superiority of thought over sense-perception he is not simply making an epistemological argument about the sources of our knowledge. These doctrines are tied to what we might call a doctrine of salvation, or a doctrine about the ultimate human good. This becomes clear in the Phaedo where Plato argues, \\"the soul of every man, when it feels violent pleasure or pain in connection with some object, inevitably believes at the same time that what causes such feelings must be very clear and very true, which it is not...every pleasure and every pain provides, as it were, another nail to rivet the soul to the body and to weld them together\\" (83c-e). Taylor recognizes this religious dimension in Plato which puts him above many analytic commentators on Plato (an analytic philosopher might abstract the arguments about the immortality of the soul from the Phaedo and attempt to determine their validity without recognizing the Phaedo as a dialogue about how the philosopher should live in order to achieve the ultimate human good). But ultimately I think Plato's ideas have more in common with his own religious context (Orphism, Pythagoreanism, and even, perhaps Indian religions) than they do with Christianity. Taylor's reading of Christian ideas back into Plato leads to at least some distortion (this statement has to be qualified to some degree since Christian writers incorporated a great many of Plato's insights into Christianity which is almost certainly the reason for the similarities that do exist between them but the problem arises when the similarities are reflected backwards rather than forwards, i.e. when Christianity is read back into Plato rather than Plato being read forward into Christianity).The other way in which Taylor reads Plato anachronistically is the way he tends to see modern debates reflected in the debates taking place within Plato's dialogues (like the debate over the epiphenomenality of consciousness). In some ways it is good that Taylor reads current debates (at least current at the time Taylor was writing) back into Plato. It allows us to see the almost miraculous way Plato was able to anticipate nearly every important philosophical question in the entire history of Western philosophy.And there is certainly nothing wrong with reading Plato in the light of our current concerns. I think one of the reasons Plato speaks to us today is because he was, in a way, living in a time analogous to our own. We often tend to think of Plato as living at the beginning of Greek civilization because our historical record becomes scanty as we move backwards from Plato (particularly in the dark ages after the Mycenaean collapse but before the classical age). But in reality Plato was closer to the end of Greek civilization. The Greek religions were losing their hold on young minds who were filled with new scientific ideas (one sees this in a number of the dialogues: one sees it in the Pythagoreans Simmias and Cebes in the Phaedo who are already ignorant of the religious aspects of the Pythagorean school to which they belong, one sees it in the new scientific explanations that are being offered for the old myths as in the story of Boreas in the Phaedrus, one sees it in the demands made for rational defenses of the superiority of justice in the Republic since the religious injunctions are losing some of their force.). We too live in an age where a religion which has existed for two thousand years is beginning to lose its hold to some degree in the face of new scientific ideas. Plato was such a giant, I think, because he held onto both ends of the chain at once. He did not entirely abandon the religious teachings of the past but he rescued them from their mythical form and presented them in a form that was acceptable to the more scientifically minded (perhaps we are waiting for something similar). For an example of what I mean we can again turn to the Phaedo where Plato has Socrates say, \\"It is likely that those who established the mystic rites for us were not inferior persons but were speaking in riddles long ago...There are indeed, as those concerned with the mysteries say, many who carry the thyrsus but the Bacchants are few. These latter are, in my opinion, no other than those who have practiced philosophy in the right way\\" (69c-d). Plato does not reject the old mystery religions outright - he merely rejects their literal interpretation (if the reader is interested in my personal opinion I think the modern atheists make the same mistake when rejecting Christianity that Plato seems to be arguing against in this passage- that is, they view Christianity as if it was just uttering nonsense rather than speaking in riddles which have to be deciphered - they think that when they have rejected the literal truth of the stories of the Bible, for example, that they have thereby refuted Christianity). I think that Taylor sees all of this fairly clearly as well and he is to be applauded for that.But Taylor's method of reading Plato in terms of the subsequent history of philosophy, or of translating Plato's arguments and ideas into the terms of more modern philosophers is no longer the preferred method of reading Plato (for example, when he says that \\"for Socrates and Plato, no less than for Kant, immortality is a postulate of the 'practical' use of 'reason' (pg207), or, when he uses the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction in scholastic philosophy to explain arguments from the Phaedo (pg204)). These interpretations are not necessarily incorrect and certainly help the reader familiar with Kant and scholastic terminology to understand Plato's point but we can no longer assume that something as simple as the translation of Plato into Latin was in anyway 'innocent' or left the substance of Plato's theories intact. We can no longer simply read backward and assume that the tradition as it has been handed down to us, and which has been derived in large part from Plato, accurately represents Plato's own thought. I think Heidegger is largely responsible for awakening us in this regard because despite Heidegger's many flaws (both personal and philosophical) he really made an attempt to go back and read the Greeks on their own terms (before all the Greek terms had been translated into their Latin versions, and before the problems Plato was dealing with had been solidified in the tradition). Heidegger really is responsible for a revolution in the way we read Plato, at least in the Continental tradition, and Taylor's book seems a bit dated in comparison in my opinion. For the reader who is interested in some readings of Plato that I think are superior to Taylor's in this respect I would recommendPlato's Sophist (Studies in Continental Thought)by Martin Heidegger,Being and Logos: Reading the Platonic Dialoguesby John Sallis,Self-Knowledge in Plato's Phaedrusby Charles Griswold jr.,Plato's Parmenides: The Conversion of the Soulby Mitchell Miller jr.,Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture Volume I: Archaic Greece: The Mind of Athensby Werner Jaeger (the second volume is the volume on Plato but it will not let me link to it directly; just click on the little plus sign by the paperback version and it will expand and show all three volumes), andOrder and History (Volume 3): Plato and Aristotle (Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, Volume 16)by Eric Voegelin.Two more books I have read on Plato since I first wrote this review that I thought were excellent and definitely worth mentioning are:Plato and the Good: Illuminating the Darkling Vision (Philosophy of History and Culture)by Rosemary Desjardins. Desjardins offers a really interesting and exciting interpretation of Plato's metaphysics, which is, in many ways, quite different from the standard interpretations of Plato's metaphysics that you get in standard introductions, but which I think has a great deal of textual support in its favor. The other book isToward a New Interpretation of Platoby Giovanni Reale. Reale was part of the Tubingen school so he attempts to read Plato in light of the unwritten tradition but his interpretation of Plato's metaphysics is quite similar to Desjardins' in a number of ways.As a final word I will simply repeat what I said at the beginning: despite the flaws of Taylor's book which I have attempted to spell out in this review I think his book is still worth reading. Taylor is a good writer, he gets a lot right, and many of his interpretations are very thought-provoking. I simply suggest that the reader keep some of the limitations of Taylor's book in mind while reading."},{"Title":"plato the man and his work","review":"If you want to understand Plato, I can heartily recommend a two-step process.First, read up on him in Copleston'sA History of Philosophy, Vol. 1: Greece and Rome From the Pre-Socratics to Plotinus.

I don't think you can go far wrong, and you will have a firm understanding of one of the greatest philosophers who ever lived --- well, two, if you count Socrates!"},{"Title":"plato the man and his work","review":"This book is 550 pages plus many footnotes which adds the equivalent of 20 or 30 more pages. It is not light reading lets put it that way. But if you can persevere and get through it you will learn a lot about Plato.The emphasis is on 'the work' rather than 'the man'. Taylor recommended biographies by Grote, E. Meyer, and his hero Professor Burnet if you want those biographical details.I read this book over an extended period of time while finishing quite a few other books in between. Having to read this book quickly like for a college class would in my opinion be a form of mental torture. There's too much information.I had already read some of Plato's dialogues plus the Timaeus and Critias, The Republic, and The Laws. Taylor's book is a good review and overview of those plus many others although The Republic is only talked about at a high level.Taylor saw three main phases of Plato's life:1) early writings which include the Socratic dialogues and some other books2) Academy period where writing slowed down a lot3) later writings which include The LawsThe Socratic dialogues were apparently written to preserve information about Socrates and may have been based on actual conversations with Soc.I still do not understand what the motivations were for executing Socrates. It sounds like he was feared by the authorities for some reason. This strange man chose to accept his execution rather than deny his principles even though he could have probably avoided it.Taylor says that Plato viewed the doctrine of the forms as his unique contribution to philosophy. I did not gain an understanding of the forms from this book but it sounds like Aristotle's Metaphysics may provide this.I'm most interested in the more mysterious and esoteric aspects of Plato's life and writings. However those are the very things that were never well known about Plato even during his lifetime.According to the legends Plato traveled to Egypt and experienced the Egyptian initiation process at some level as had Pythagoras. During those experiences the initiates came into direct contact with the mythological gods.I have read also that Plato was criticized by the other initiates for allowing some of what he heard in Egypt to make it into his writings. The initiates were sworn to secrecy and this type of information could become dangerous in the wrong hands. Perhaps The Parmenides contains some of those metaphysical secrets.Taylor provides one of the stupider interpretations of Plato's misunderstood and often contradicted Atlantis story. Taylor says Plato used the story to talk about events that happened during his own lifetime and Plato was telling history in reverse. This is an example of how someone like Taylor will try to answer mysterious questions by referring to main stream, orthodox academic sources.Even so it's hard to imagine how many books someone like Taylor must have read in his life.Taylor held Plato in very high esteem and considered Plato to be a literary genius but I'm not sure exactly why.Jeff MarzanoThe Secret Teachings of All Ages (Reader's Edition)Edgar Cayce's Story of the Old Testament From the Birth of Souls to the Death of MosesFingerprints of the GodsAtlantisInitiationInitiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)The Giza Death Star Destroyed: The Ancient War For Future Science (Giza Death Star Trilogy)Mythic Troy: The Complete Story Legend Archeology and IntuitionOccult Ether Physics: Tesla's Hidden Space Propulsion System and the Conspiracy to Conceal It (2nd Revised Edition)"},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"The first of the Lensmen series.

These were fun to read when I was a boy. Then I grew up."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"It is impossible for me to approach this series with anything but mixed feelings. I first read it decades ago, and it was written even earlier, between the two world wars when Captain America seemed something more than cardboard. This series hooked me on a lifelong addiction to science fiction, so I cannot view it impassively. It will always be associated with pleasant discoveries.This series arouses so much nostalgia in readers that any criticism of it risks sending my review ratings into the toilet. However, maturity compels me to critique it honestly, and the light of objectivity reveals some harsh and ugly flaws.First, the good stuff. This is an unpretentious series entirely devoted to plot. The superficiality of the characters doesn't detract. Nor do the simplistic, cartoon-like settings. The story barrels along like a runaway train, and performs admirably as escapist adventure fare. Think Buck Rogers meets Conan the Barbarian. And because it doesn't pretend to depth and doesn't employ any artifice, the simple-minded nature of the story is actually quite engaging. Moreover, the cheesy dialogue and the hammy characterizations are a lot of fun, adding to the Buck Rogers like feel.But the series is also deeply disturbing. As a product of its era, it is burdened with the baggage of its insular xenophobia. Its rah-rah jingoism is not only grating, but troubling, especially in light of the fruits that such jingoism has since borne. Mindless chauvinism may be tolerable in dime novels, but not in science fiction, a genre that has always worked to expand horizons and promote a higher awareness. Here, the setting aside, we might as well be reading a comic book.These books do not invite us to think. The good guys are obvious in the crudest sense of the word. The bad guys, even more so. And the death, genocide and mass exterminations that course through the series are all excused on the implicit understanding that bad guys deserve to die and good guys deserve to do the killing. I have heard this series referred to as a \\"classic of the genre\\" When I compare it to true classics of the genre like, 2001, Dune, Foundation, or Fahrenheit 451, where every loss is real and where death leads to anguished soul-searching, I cannot help but shudder at how utterly callow this series is.If you think of science fiction as nothing more than pulp fiction in an unconventional setting, and you are prepared to discard your moral compass, then this series is a great action flick with its requisite allotment of pyrotechnics and mega-death. The good guys [prevail] while the bad guys get squashed like bugs. But if you consider science fiction to be something more than mindless fluff, if you expect it to engage you with a higher set of ethical values and touch upon the larger themes in life, then this series is a failure. One thing is certain: despite its pioneering pedigree and its many firsts, a \\"classic\\" it most assuredly is not."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"The series was good not great (a solid B). I enjoyed the Super Hero concept of the Lensman, but I did not find the story very interesting and it went on and on. I kept waiting for something (anything) to get resolved. For most of the story I was very conscious that I was reading. I had to push myself just to get through it. It was better after I was finished. It is the kind of series that a die-hard SF fan has to read once. But I could not in good conscience recommend the series to a friend."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"and everybody else will become a tool in this war. Within this first book of the Lensman seires we learn about how two galaxies slam into each other and the races, the Eddore and the Arisia, meet. E.E. Smith shows us how, over time, the two super-races use others while slowly developing their own powers.Within this book is the seed for so many later stories. Star Wars, Star Trek and Babylon Five seem to have been lifed from the pages yet 'Triplanetary' itself seems to be a mixture of bad science AND a bad story.I am sure many fans of this author will get mad at me, pointing out that I am comparing his work to later authors and stories, but I am not. I am comparing it to works from the same period and EARLIER. H.G. Wells, Olaf Stapledon, H.P.Lovecraft and Karel Capek are just a few authors I can name who seem to be able to make believable stories. They may have some flaws but they know how to write over them. Bad science is cancelled out by a good story or a weak story is held up by great science or interesting characters.'Triplanetary' has only gotten worse with age. It seems like a story based on an old sci-fi serial. Only buy it if you like techno-babble, fantasy sci-fi or just plain fantasy with some science tossed in.One chapter is about Atlantis! If this was a film MST3K would of REFUSED to use it.It was turned into anime. Maybe that version is better as I have heard it has little or nothing to do with the books, besides the title."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"It is odd that the Amazon review form has a check-off box to attest that the reviewer is over the age of 13. It is difficult to imagine anyone over the age of 13 having much positive to say about the Lensman Series.E.E. Smith, who according to John Clute was a food chemist specializing in donuts, wrote this series for the pulps in the 1930's. Its primary audience was clearly adolescent boys. I read it when I was about 17 or 18 and read it to conclusion, even though the writing was dreadful, because it had a propulsive, energetic plot that hooks anyone vulnerable to space opera. The basic device is good aliens versus evil aliens in a galaxy and eons spanning struggle in which humans are anointed to administer the coup de grace to forces of cosmic evil. We are, of course, the center of the universe. Every book in the series ratchets up the stage another order of magnitude. Had the notion of a multiverse been current in the 1930's, Smith would no doubt have written further volumes to involve the other universes as well.The problem with the series is that aside from the addicting quality of space opera, every other aspect of Smith's writing is just god-awful. He simply has no skills at all in the craft of writing. The dialogue, characterizations, and style are so bad you have to read the books to believe it. Psychology, motivation, wit, nuance, ambiguity. What do those words mean ? I couldn't fairly compare the series to comic books because quite a few comic books these days have literary merit. Perhaps they would be comparable to comic books in the 1950's between the demise of E.C. and the rise of Marvel, but even these probably had better editing.I am not inveighing against the pleasures of space opera. There's abundance of it out there for your enjoyment by competent authors like Iain Banks or Vernor Vinge, who won't make you wince while you read. Some, like Jack Vance, are master stylists.I have many times encountered readers with strong prejudices against science fiction and fantasy and have tried to encourage them to read some of the finer writers in the field. It's my hope that readers who aren't sci-fi fans would never open the covers of the Lensman books. They would be permanently poisoned."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"All of the heroes are white. Not only white but Aryan and that seems to make them better than all other races everywhere in the Galaxy!Fighting past that and the grade school dialogue, the stories are fast paced and quite enjoyable. It is pure pulp fiction and at times you almost have to stop reading to catch your breath. Its ok that the science isnt perfect, you have to excuse these things reading a book that's over 50 years old, and my only problems are the blatant racism and sexism that pervade throughout the series. Without those problems I would have given it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"For a pulp sci-fi novel, it's very well-written. What became tedious to me, though, was scene after scene of vast, hideous destruction, described in pretty much the same terms every time, and in such a way that it somehow failed to be horrible.What I mean is that hundreds, thousands or millions of humans or aliens were being killed, and because they had no names and no faces and the named characters were all stiff-upper-lip about it, the horror of war was minimised and it became mere fireworks. I imagine that being written just after World War II had something to do with it."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"This review is for the actual Book 1. Triplanetary is book 1 of the Lensman series.This is a classic space opera as in it has all its elements. Super ships, vessels, shields and ray guns and many more high tek(back then)gadgets and spyware.The story starts aboard the starship Hyperion. We meet three main characters here;Conway Costigan, Captain Bradley and Clio Marsden. Grey Roger, is an elite captain of pirates who becomes a central character in the story. The T.S.S, the Triplanetary Secret Service, consists of an alliance with Earth, Mars and Venus.The main story deals with another race entirely;light years away,the Amphibians from the planet Nevia. The Nevians think themselves as the supreme all knowing beings of the Universe. Needing Iron ore, they set off toward a farther sun where they meet the humans. After a massive battle ensues, as well as an attack on the city of Pittsburgh by the Nevians, they take Costigan, Bradley and Clio aboard as specimens to be put on display on Nevia. Hence, they try to escape.I decided reading this from the great reviews it was given here and I'm glad I got it, I will certainly continue the Lensmen Saga.The writer impressed me at how he explained everything in great detail, things that at the time(and still)weren't even brought to the forefront that much.

History of Civilization, V. 1.)This entire series, volumes 1 through 6, is the most exciting story of both the power of the mind and the power of technology that I have ever read. Doc. Smith's understanding that, the possession of technology is transitory and that there is a constant struggle to have the state of the art in science and technology, is way beyond his time. He understood that control of technology can swing quickly in favor of either good or evil. That only with the strength of mind and strength of technology, can good be triumphant. Even though it is somewhat dated in it's use of it's terminology, it's still very understandable and to the point. Doc. Smith was a visionary. I highly recommend these books and would like to see them made into a movie series."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"(This review refers to the volume copyright 2009 by Cosmos Books/Wildside Press; ISBN 978-0-8439-5949-9.)I was born in the late 1970s, but I've always loved SF from earlier eras, such as early work by Heinlein, Asimov, Clarke, etc. I've encountered many mention of the 'Lensmen' series, and had it on my list of 'classics' to check out. I'm quite capable of reading a classic piece in historical context -- I enjoyed \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\", despite its somewhat dated style and science -- so I bought this book to get started with Lensmen.I was quite confused when all the elements I'd read of -- Arisians, Eddorians, Boskone, even the Lensmen themselves -- were quite simply absent from this book. Was my memory wrong? Had I confused this story with something else?No, it turns out, I was simply grossly misled by the publisher. This book doesn't contain any Lensman content, despite the claims on the cover. The first published Lensman story was \\"Galatic Patrol\\". \\"Triplanatary\\" was published prior to that, and originally had nothing to do with Lensman. After the success of the Lensman series, \\"Triplantary\\" was modifed to be connected to the Lensman world, apparently by prefixing and suffixing additional chapters. Those chapters ARE NOT PRESENT IN THIS BOOK.The other story in this book, \\"Masters of Space\\", has apparently never had anything to do with 'Lensman', even retroactively. I can only assume it was just thrown in as padding.The publisher flat-out lied. This is such a blatant misrepresentation I'm seriously intending to seek a return/refund on this book. I have purchased and own hundreds of books; this will be the first I've ever tried to return. Bad stories I've bought and kept; that's a risk associated with any book. This isn't a book I disliked; this is simply not the book the cover claims it is."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"The \\"Cosmos Books; Reprint edition\\" is not the same as any previous release I've owned. It opens with the Rodger the Space Private story and does not include any of the Arisia/Eddore series setup material. No Atlantis, no Rome, no WWI, II, or III.Oddly the back cover suggests that all that material is included. Half the page count is some obscure Smith yarn called \\"Masters of Space\\".Since I particularly like the early saga pieces, I am really ticked off."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"This is a review of the $3.69 Kindle Edition of Triplanetary. Be warned that all of the kindle versions of this book that Amazon currently offers are the original magazine version of the story and lack all reference to the Lensman series. Those elements were later added by Doc Smith in the 1940s for republication and seem to only be included in some of the physical book editions. The Kindle version does not have the first section containing the backstory of the Arisians and the Eddorians; does not include the fall of Atlantis nor of Rome, and does not include the world war(s). It begins with the space pirates in what would later be the third section of the book. I bought this for the Kindle expecting the final version of the book and feel I got burned because 1/3rd of the book was missing. A good yarn, but not yet part of the Lensman series."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"If you're intending to read Doc Smith's classic \\"Lensman\\" series, then so you should; but you should definitely start, not with \\"Triplanetary\\", but withGalactic Patrol. Here's why.Chronologically, the first Lensman story wasGalactic Patrol, from Astounding magazine in 1937-38. This was followed by the next three stories:Gray Lensman,Second Stage LensmenandChildren of the Lens. When publication in book form was mooted, Smith revised his earlierTriplanetaryto fit into the lensman universe, and wroteFirst Lensmanto form a bridge between that and \\"Galactic Patrol\\".Masters of the Vortex, another unrelated story, was likewise modified.I, and many others it seems, feel that the four books representing Smith's original conception are the essential ones, and the others are disposable (\\"Vortex\\", in particular, being a pot-boiler with virtually no relation to the others). Although \\"First Lensman\\" certainly has entertaining moments (as when Virgil Samms is almost deafened at a Rigellian construction site, because the Rigellians have no sense of hearing and can't understand what the problem is).There's another problem with the books, although fortunately not an insuperable one. Smith's universe, although already huge at the outset of \\"Galactic Patrol\\", expands as the series progresses. Originally, the reader didn't discover the total significance of the struggles going on within it until the end of \\"Children\\". But the books (except, for some inscrutable reason, \\"Patrol\\") feature tacked-on and needless Forewords that give away the whole plot. I *strongly* recommend first-time readers to skip these.\\"Triplanetary\\" is not as good as \\"Patrol\\"; and if you start here you may be disappointed - possibly enough to stop reading! Neither is it \\"really\\" the first book. But most importantly, you'll run headfirst into plot-spoilers that wreck the tension of the story.When you've finished \\"Children\\", by all means go back and read this."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"I wanted to read this book as I recently read a review on the Star Wars movies that stated this series was a basis for the Jedi Knights. In the end I enjoyed this book, but I found it slow in the begining although this is somewhat necessary as it provides the backdrop for the later books in the Lensman series.E. E. Smith does a good job of using actual history (Rome, World War I,World War II), legend (Atlantis) a fictional basis for the universe and time as a whole. While written 60 years ago, the terminology/technology is not terribly out of date by today's standard of writing and science fiction in general. Looking at the other reviews Phyed-rautha says it very well.I am not an avid reader (maybe a book every other month) and the fact I had difficulty putting it down leads to my high rating. I lower the rating (from 5 stars) due to the slow start."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"I first read the lensman series as a young girl. My father was an avid science fiction reader and had the entire 6-book series, which I started to read in the early fifties. Back then, you didn't do book reports on science fiction books. They weren't considered &quot;literature.&quot; Oh, the wasted time I spent on some of the books considered &quot;appropriate&quot; for a 10-year-old girl! I spent as much time as I could reading these wonderful lensmen books (as well as other great sci-fi writers). While the dialogue might seem old-fashioned today, the stories themselves are timeless. What a wonderful experience awaits the new reader!"},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"The Lensmen series comprises the following books:1 - Triplanetary2 - First Lensman3 - Galactic Patrol4 - Gray Lensman5 - Second-Stage Lensman6 - Children of the LensWithout exaggeration, the \\"Galactic Patrol\\" series is one of the greatest classic space epics ever written, it's one of the greatest archetypes of the genre as a whole, and virtually all of the modern masters of the genre have paid open homage to it.Originally appearing as a series of pulps in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" magazine back in the 1930's & 1940's, and later re-published in 1948 with several new introductory chapters added to the front of Triplanetary (book 1), this series, along with the other great classics of the day (Flash Gordon, and John Carter of Mars) influenced an entire generation of readers, some of whom later went on to become Masters of the genre in their own right.* The hit series Babylon 5, for instance, is a direct homage to the Galactic Patrol, and is very loosely based on it (re: Vorlons vs Shadows = Arisians vs Eddorians, Rangers = Galactic Patrol, etc.)* Star Wars too, is an indirect homage to early Sci Fi pulp action tales like GP.* Gene Roddenberry, in all probability drew deeply from this series for inspiration, when he created the United Federation of Planets in Star Trek.Although few people seem to make mention of it today, the Galactic Patrol tales USED to be omnipresent back in the 50's - radio shows, product tie-ins, kids playing 'patrol' in their back yards, you name it. It was essentially the Star Wars of our parent's and grandparent's generation.Galactic Patrol successfully combined the best aspects of several genres:* ACTION/THRILLER: the heroes and villains alike are all 2-fisted hard charging lead-from-the-font types, and the pace of action is relentless.* MELODRAMA: Classic period dialog, straight out of the 20's 30's & 40's. Perfect fodder from the golden age of radio ... chock full of exclamation marks and purple prose.* EPIC/ADVENTURE: Wide eyed wonder on a grand scale, replete with hard science and bug-eyed monsters.What more can you ask for ?Sure, a lot of the science doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, and the male/female gender roles are a bit dated by today's standards, but who cares ? That's all part of it's charm. Besides, this is all about high drama, action adventure, and pure concentrated escapism. These are the sort of books you read when life has you down, and you need to get away from it all, to a world where the action is fast, the rewards are immediate, and where the good guys win in the end, against impossible odds.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"This starts the Lensman series. Rather, it sets the stage, since the Lens hasn't actually appeared yet - but wait.It has all the swashbuckling silliness you've come to know and love. It's filled with lines like:\\"[she was] thrilled this time to the depths of her being by the sheer manhood of him ...\\"Yes, that was meant seriously. Not to worry, though, this 1940s adventure story thrills her in a G-rated kind of way. Heck, I think that manly man in charge has spent his whole life swashing so many buckles that I'm not sure he's ever been on a date.But, no matter, we have super-spaceships outdoing each other by the day, it seems, in a madly inflationary cycle. We have grey-skinned bad guys with mysterious connections to the Evil 77th-level Adepts of North Polar Jupiter. We have the mysterious, ugly, and funny-smelling beings from a distant sun who, in their transgalactic hunt for iron, decide that the easiest place to get it is from the structural steel of Pittsburgh, and from the red blood of its citizens. Fair's fair, so Our Hero destroys one of their cities to the last man (or whatever), woman, and child, plus part of another population center with poison gas. In the end, it was brusque apologies all around - no hard feelings, y'know, a man (or snake-necked, four-eyed fellow with tentacles) has gotta do what a man (or SNFEFwT) has gotta do.This was written closer to the era of Flash Gordon than to the current day, by about a 3:1 margin, so it can only read as quaintly archaic. Laws of physics come and go at convenience, and relations between men and women hover between the neolithic and chivalric. Reading these books is a wonderful alternative to reading anything to think about.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"Despite what the Amazon description says, the Kindle edition of _Triplanetary_ is *not* part of the Lensman series. It's the original magazine version, which may be a better place to start, but was _not_ part of the series (see the Wikipedia article on E.E. Smith, part of which I wrote). Both _Triplanetary_ and _Galactic Patrol_ were revised to make them consistent for the book versions.From the sample and description, it looks to me like the Kindle edition is similar to the free Project Gutenberg edition, which I scanned; the cover picture seems to be a retouched photo of my copy of the magazine, with the same tear in the lower-left corner. They've corrected Gutenberg's spurious inter-paragraph line-breaks, though, which is an improvement. (I did the same thing for my Palm version, though I doubt Evergreen used that.)Whether it's worth four dollars to avoid fixing the line-breaks in the free version is a decision I'll leave to the reader. It's an enjoyable early space opera; Dr. Smith was reported to have said of it that \\"scientific detail would not be bothered about, and ... his imagination would run riot.\\" I don't recommend reading it until and unless you've read and enjoyed the Lensman series; but it's worth reading then. The Amazon description, however, does need to be corrected so that you know what you're getting.Original Dead-Tree Review:Don't start here; read _Galactic Patrol_ instead.I'm very fond of the Lensman series, but (despite what publishers say), this is the wrong place to start. The Lensman series properly starts with _Galactic Patrol_, which I recommend heartily as classic space opera.

E. \\"Doc\\" Smith is one of the giants of SF, and one of it's greatest popularizers. He doesn't have the finesse that Asimov of Heinlein. He doesn't have the aura of humor of Niven. Doc's strength is his raw energy. This book is like watching Yoda's fight with Count Dooku at double-time. He overwhelms at times..Another one of Doc's strength is his mixture of science and gadgets. You are immediate placed in a world of sub-ether communicators, atomic weapons, tractor beams, spacer ships, space armor, and all the other props associated with old school SF.

The books are worth it just for the inventive slang! Dated but fascinating."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"Two civilizations, the Arisians and the Eddorians, old beyond imagining and evolved to the point where their mental skills alone command energy and forces that are unthinkable for lesser species such as humans from our beloved Earth or even the reptilian Nevians, battle for dominance of the universe. In \\"Triplanetary\\", Doc Smith has left no room for doubt concerning the identity of the \\"good guys\\" versus the \\"bad guys\\". The Eddorians, quintessentially and unabashedly evil, have set themselves a modest but extraordinarily clear mission - \\"to tear down and destroy every bulwark of what the weak and spineless adherents of Civilization consider the finest things in life - love, truth, honor, loyalty, purity, altruism, decency and so on.\\" The Arisians, of course, represent all of those virtues which the Eddorians are so bent on removing from the Universe.\\"Triplanetary\\" is the grand-daddy of all space opera adventure novels - a non-stop, red hot action-oriented, plot driven space battle that is a positively orgasmic geekfest of techno-babble on steroids. One need only read a single chapter to envision the origins of the special effects in modern movie and television versions of Star Trek, Babylon 5, Andromeda or Battlestar Galactica. If you like your battles hot, your villains ugly and nasty, and your heroes manly (how could a hunk named \\"Conway Costigan\\" be anything but a two-fisted, steely-eyed man's man?), then you'll probably enjoy \\"Triplanetary\\"!On this basis alone, \\"Triplanetary\\" is probably worth reading as the acknowledged progenitor of every space war novel that was ever written. One could even make a very strong case that Steven Spielberg, Gene Roddenberry and the entire world of special effects in visual media owe much to Smith's fertile imagination!But does \\"Triplanetary\\" deserve membership in a library of what we now call science fiction classics? I think not. There is so much wrong with \\"Triplanetary\\" on the literary side, it's really quite difficult to know where to start.Other than cartoonish heroic stereotypes, character development is negligible. Dialogue is stilted and the romantic interludes, in particular, are so trite as to be laughable. The raging purple prose is so positively brimful of superlatives and absolutes that one wonders how any progress was made at all, any goal achieved or any enemy defeated - barriers were impassable, obstacles were insurmountable, chances of success were only one in numberless millions, beams of destruction were relentless, forces were cataclysmic, objects were immovable, tractor beams were irresistible - well, it just got tiresome because this was the nature of the entire novel. Science, even as it was known at the time, was effectively ignored and technology in the novel crossed the line from imaginative into purely fantasy.Recommended as a fast, enjoyable read from the standpoint of understanding the roots and growth of science fiction as a genre. But the novel has not stood the test of time and is weak gruel indeed compared to many of its contemporaries.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"If you're intending to read Doc Smith's classic \\"Lensman\\" series, then so you should; but you should definitely start, not with \\"Triplanetary\\", but withGalactic Patrol. Here's why.Chronologically, the first Lensman story wasGalactic Patrol, from Astounding magazine in 1937-38. This was followed by the next three stories:Gray Lensman,Second Stage LensmenandChildren of the Lens. When publication in book form was mooted, Smith revised his earlierTriplanetaryto fit into the lensman universe, and wroteFirst Lensmanto form a bridge between that and \\"Galactic Patrol\\".Masters of the Vortex, another unrelated story, was likewise modified.I, and many others it seems, feel that the four books representing Smith's original conception are the essential ones, and the others are disposable (\\"Vortex\\", in particular, being a pot-boiler with virtually no relation to the others). Although \\"First Lensman\\" certainly has entertaining moments (as when Virgil Samms is almost deafened at a Rigellian construction site, because the Rigellians have no sense of hearing and can't understand what the problem is).There's another problem with the books, although fortunately not an insuperable one. Smith's universe, although already huge at the outset of \\"Galactic Patrol\\", expands as the series progresses. Originally, the reader didn't discover the total significance of the struggles going on within it until the end of \\"Children\\". But the books (except, for some inscrutable reason, \\"Patrol\\") feature tacked-on and needless Forewords that give away the whole plot. I *strongly* recommend first-time readers to skip these.\\"Triplanetary\\" is not as good as \\"Patrol\\"; and if you start here you may be disappointed - possibly enough to stop reading! Neither is it \\"really\\" the first book. But most importantly, you'll run headfirst into plot-spoilers that wreck the tension of the story.When you've finished \\"Children\\", by all means go back and read this."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"I first read this series in the 50's in grammar school, and it blew my mind. Then I read it again in the mid-60's when I was in college, and I still loved it. Then I lost my copies and went searching for replacements, and recently found the newest editions -- and I enjoyed them immensely once again. Yesterday, I solemnly handed my six volumes of this story to my 13 year old son, who is dyslexic, and I'm sure the Lensmen will soon rank with Harry Potter. As long as there is a perception of good and evil, this series will rank among the greatest ever written. You can read the other reviews for the details, but read the series as well -- you'll get hooked immediately!"},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"Doc Smith's classics are back in print, so bring your sense of wonder. I prefer the Lensman series to his more melodramatic Skylark series and this is the intro to the classic that finished 2nd to Foundation in the best series category years ago. Starting near the beginning of the universe, the story hops from distant galaxies to Atlantis, Rome, and the world wars. It shows the ages old conflict between Arrissa (Good with a capital G) and Eddore (Evil with a capital E) and sets it agains the backdrop of human history. We meet the Kinnisons, whose descendants will carry on the struggle against Eddore in the years (and sequels) to come. Although not as riproaringly fast paced as the rest of the series, Triplanetary serves as a handy intro to the series and sets the stage for adventures where solar systems and galaxies will be spanned in seconds. Pick it up and get ready for some good old time space opera--this is the 1st of the sciece fiction style that culminates in Star Wars."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"Flash Gordon move over. Way back when the world was new, this was the book to read for space opera. In its time it rates five stars, at the millenium (oh, so its a year-and-a-half away, don't quibble!) it is definitely dated. We have men being real men and women being real women. We can depend on the &quot;good guys&quot; to take care of us. Shades of the Authoritarian Years, Batman! For those of you too young to remember Batman, the series, on TV (no not the cartoon!) I think you will find fainting femmes and trustworthy side-kicks a bit dated. Triplanetary seems to have been written to &quot;set the stage&quot; for the later books in the series - I'm not sure which was written first, chronologically, but it sure seems like a prequel. Now-a-days we expect a little sophistication, a little subtlety and a little less than perfection in our heroes and in our villians. If we agree that &quot;Space Opera&quot; need only describe a world where all the kids are above average, where there is just one &quot;Good&quot; and all the rest either &quot;Evil&quot; or lazy and/or ignorant then this is good &quot;Space Opera&quot;. I recommend you read the second and third books in the series (First Lensman and Second Stage Lensman -if my memory has held up to these 3 decades) and then go back to this one. I loved this series and still do, but it is a creature of its author's time/worldview (mine too, I guess)."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"E.E.Smith's &quot;Triplanetary series was my first experience with Science-Fiction some(Ye Gods!)45 years ago.

The scope of things is extended. The cast of characters clutters up human history from Atlantis to...... Better not tell the ending. Better not mess with the red-headed men and women characters in this!!! A great read. makes you think that human beings can overcome anything! I think that this series would lend itself wonderfully to a &quot;Star Wars&quot; type series of movies. The mind is the great weopon here and the ability to solve problems. America could use the inspiration from such movies."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"Alright, so this is 1940's pulp science fiction, but after having read some of the others this is one of the best of that time period. Yeah, some of the ideas are now dated, but the author takes what concepts there are and writes LARGE. This is a classic epic battle between good and evil written not just on a intergalactic scale, not just on a universal scale, but on a multiple space-time continuum scale. Terms like \\"space-time continuum\\", commonly used in Star Trek and now steadfast in science fiction lexicon are used here and this is the earliest publication date that I can recall having read it. Sure Smith uses the term \\"ether\\" instead of just \\"space\\", but with the latest theory in science being that interstellar space is a seething soup of particles and anti-particles constantly forming and annihilating each other, who knows, maybe one day the term ether will come up again.As you may have read, there are two races of immortals, one is classically good, the other classically, well maybe not evil, maybe better said \`just doesn't care about anything but themselves'. Meaning if you're in their way walking down the street and it's easier for them to kill you, to get you out of their way, they will do that. However, if killing you is less easy, then it would be considered in poor taste by their society if they did so. So ultimately power, and only power, matters to the society of the Eddorians. The good guys, the Arisians, realize one day when first contacting the minds of the Eddorians, as their respective galaxies are colliding (I'm not making this up), that they would not be able to defeat them head on. Thus they quickly erase the memory of their contact from the Eddorians minds, and strive to remain unknown to them. However, they begin the mechanism, hopefully, of a way to defeat them; and that's to seed and train species on other planets that will one day evolve to defeat the Eddorians and eventually replace the Arisians as the most advanced species in this, and maybe any, space-time continuum. And this is where humanity comes in, yup, as just that species.Triplanetary (which by the way stands for the inner planet confederation of Earth, Venus, and Mars) starts out with the Eddorians disappointment in early Earth's progress as a sufficient slave race (due to subtle interference by the Arisians), and thus is the cause of large disasters in humanities past as a form of punishment. Atlantis was lost in the past due to a nuclear war between its neighbors. The Fall of Rome, and World Wars I and II are also due to the Eddorians. The possibly most controversial part of the book, is the projected Third World War being due to the Eddorians. To Liberals, any WW III scenario that does not lead to the absolute and complete destruction of humanity is considered pro-nuclear-war propaganda. So any introduction by big shot SF critic John Clute is not going to have nice things to say. This book is not as bad as he makes it out to be. Sure, the last four books in this six-book series are supposed to be even better, which were actually written before the first two. Smith's first story \\"Galactic Patrol\\" was published in 1937, and he then continued with related stories from there. In the late 1940's and early 50's he collected them into the Lensman series. The first two books were then written as an introduction to the series. To many purists, the series doesn't actually start until book 3. Book 1 in criticized as giving away too much of the plot too early. Well, if you've read any reviews here then you already pretty much who and what the Eddorians and Arisians are, so that criticism is mute.Wikipedia gives a nice background on the history of the Lensman series."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"You can't fault E.E. Doc Smith for lack of ambition -- imagining a sci-fi adventure spanning practically the whole universe and continuing for millions of years. But that's about the only compliment I can give this book.

It spans billions of years of time and long reaches of interstellar space.In the first part, few stars in our universe have planets and only one planet is inhabited. The Arisians develop through typical stages into a technological culture. Finally they become pure intellects.Then our galaxy intersects Lundmark's Nebula. The collision creates many planets throughout both galaxies. Life begins on most of these planets.The Eddorians developed elsewhere in the multiverse. Like many sapient species, they fight among themselves. Yet they carry this to extremes and eventually only one race survives. They find few planets in their own universe and search the continua for other worlds to conquer. They find our universe and decide to stay.Arisia discovers the Eddorians. The Arisian Elders remove all data on this contact from the Eddorian records and minds. Then the Arisians begin molding a society that can destroy Eddore and replace Arisia as Guardians of Civilizations.In the second part, humanity experiences war upon war. Eddore induces three World Wars that eventually destroys much of the surface of Terra and greatly reduces the population. Then the Eddorians leave humanity alone to rot.In the third part, mankind rebuilds a technological society and creates an interplanetary government linking Terra, Mars and Venus under the Triplanetary Council. The Triplanetary Patrol guards interplanetary space from pirates and other dangers. The Triplanetary Service performs other tasks as the Council directs.This part tells of the battle between the Triplanetary Service and an Eddorian puppet known as Gray Roger. Then aliens from Nevia arrive and start gathering iron -- a scarcity on their planet -- from both the Triplanetary and pirate ships. They also capture three humans.Costigan is a Sector Chief in the Triplanetary Service. Bradley is the captain of an Interplanetary liner. Clio is a passenger on the liner and greatly interests Costigan.Other humans back on Terra take information provided by Costigan and radically rebuild an experimental spaceship. They take it out into space following the Nevians. Spectacular destruction then ensues.This tale goes beyond theSkylarkseries in its scale and violence. Some elements of the earlier series appear in this story. But this novel adds new factors that eventually result in a grand finale.The author had a Ph.D. in organic chemistry. Thus he was often called \\"Doc Smith\\" by SF fans. Some aspects of this tale are based on his personal experiences.Part three was originally published in 1934 as a story in Amazing. Galactic Patrol was first published in 1937 as a serial in Astounding and other tales came later. When this story was published in book form, the first two parts were added to fit the rest of the storyline. Then First Lensman was written as a sequel to this tale.This story lays the foundations of the Lensman series. The next installment isFirst Lensman.

Smith, Ph. D. is the first book of the Lensman series in terms of the chronology of the stories. However, it was a combination of new material and rewriting of a story of the same name which was published in \\"Amazing Stories\\" from January-April of 1934. This story was originally a stand alone piece of fiction and not part of the Lensman series. The original Lensman material which was published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" between 1937 and 1948 and it is in books 3 - 6 of the series, although it was edited to make it consistent throughout all parts of the series.The forward to the book is by John Clute in which he gives the reader a good overview of what is to come in this book, and somewhat for the series. In it he strongly implies that this is probably the worst book in the series, and the most difficult to read. I must agree with most of the issues he discusses regarding this book in the Foreword, although I have not yet read the others of the series to see how those compare.The main part of the book is an odd combination of material which fits into three sections. The first section is titled \`Dawn' and is itself divided into three chapters. The first deals with the history of the two opposing elder races (The Arisians and The Eddorians) and their first point of contact. The second deals with the destruction of Atlantis. The last chapter of the first section covers the fall of Rome. The inclusion of Atlantis moves this book out the realm of science fiction and into that of fantasy. This is especially true in the way it is presented as a society even more advanced then ours at the point which this book was written. There simply isn't any evidence to support the existence of such a society existing on Earth at that point in time. The other two chapters are decent enough, but the pace is much slower than that which comes later.The second part is titled \`The World War' and unlike the other sections there is almost no mention of The Arisians or The Eddorians. The title of the section implies a single war, but in fact it covers three World Wars, the last of which takes place in an unspecified year. As with the first section, there are three chapters, each one covering a different war. The only mention of The Arisians and The Eddorians in this section is in a brief epilogue which helps bring the reader back into the Lensman universe. The style of writing in this section is uneven, and it has a much different feel than either of the other sections.The third section is titled \`Triplanetary', and it had the fast pace which I expected for the series. There are 13 chapters in this section and the action is nearly non-stop. It starts with a pirate attack on a space liner, but we soon learn that the pirate leader is not what he appears, nor are some of those on the space liner. The Triplanetary League fight back against the pirates only to be interrupted when a spaceship of unknown origin arrives on the scene and changes everything. If one sets aside any attempt at realism, then this can be an enjoyable section to read, but when one stops and evaluates what is going on, it doesn't really hold up. For example, the rate at which technology is turned around by the Triplanetary League as well as their foes is simply absurd. The story is shows its age in other ways as well. For example, the decision by one of the \`heroes' to poison the air supply of an entire alien city in an attempt to escape from the planet doesn't fit with today's morals where this act would be considered terrorism.Despite the fairly low rating I am giving the book, I do intend to continue with the series. There is every indication that the rest of the series has the fast and fun style of the third section, and while it may not be serious science fiction, it can be an enjoyable way to spend some time. This series clearly has influenced many others and is of interest in that respect as well, such as \\"Babylon 5\\". The Lensman series was nominated in 1966 for the Hugo for best all-time series."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"I pretty much forced myself to finish the book and it sure was tough. Everytime a battle occurred I gritted my teeth for a couple of pages of unstoppable beams and rods of pure energy being stopped by unbreakable screens (Shields) that glowed pure white and cans (Bombs) of pure destruction that cannot penetrate multisync screens with every erg of power constantly delivered to the very breaking point etc etc etc... The author could have saved that for perhaps a final battle or something.There were a few good moments in this pulp such as when conway first detects the V2 gas or the inertia-less collision. Also, when you consider the age of the book, Mr Smith's imagination and influence on science fiction is remarkable. Everything else is absolute garbage however.The dialog is unrealistic to the point of annoyance. The characters are shallow as can possibly be. The writing is tough to get through at times, even when considering the age of the book. The battles are beyond simplistic and the offensive and defensive capibilities of the combatants are so \\"ulitmate\\" that they are repetitive and boring.It's really as simple as a couple ships with unpenetrable shields shooting weapons of unrivaled power at each other. Then, one side develops a new even more unrivaled weapon of unconceivable power and the other develops an even-more-unpenetrable shield and on and on. Then they just shoot at each other as Mr smith goes on and on about how much power is going through the beam and how much the shield is straining to contain it etc. untill you can almost feel the spittle from his raving mouth. After that, you can expect the same for pretty much every confrontation. Oh, and almost every encounter is a confrontation so expect alot of that nonsense.I'm going to try the actual lenseman series and see if it is better."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"I read the Lensman series in the 1960s. It's what turned me into a science fiction fan. Star Wars pales in comparison to the epic nature of this series. Triplanetary and Gray Lensman are my favorite books in the series. Every SF fan should add this series to their collection."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"I first read this series in the early 70's with the late 60's, early 70's release. During those years homework, exams, and term papers had to wait until I got and read the next volume of this series. Much of the science today we know to be untrue, however, because they were written by a scientist with that mindset we can forgive these things. Additionally some of his speculations have subsequently been verified with current discoveries, vis a vis negative matter (anti-matter) However the best part of this series is the great StoryTelling. This is an art which today even many of the more famous authors have not mastered. Doc Smith is the greatest StoryTeller of the gendra, and the Lensmen Series is his best work.

Due to the nature of the construction of the text, it is impossible to fully flesh out any of the main characters besides an occasional gushing of emotion or venting of rage. This seriously detracts from this text, and thus I believe that the &quot;history&quot; Smith presents might have been better served by being more detailed over the course of portions in several books, or, more for the good, dealt with in several additional books all on their own.

It includes alot of hard science but also some deep philosphy. Periodically, I re-read them and every time I do I find something new. I highly recommend these books to anyone interested in SF."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"Apparently there's a few versions of this floating around the printed world, all with some differences, minor or major. Mine probably dates from the late nineties or early part of this century (I remember buying it while in college and I've been out of there for, um, six years . . . yeah, it took me a while to get around to this) and appears to contain the full novel, some of which was written after the original \\"Triplanetary\\" story. It helps to frame the conflict that would take up the Lensman stories into a larger context and sort of set the scene for what was to come in future books.Which means the book winds up having a bit of a strange tonal shift. Not bad, just strange. As it starts, the story flirts with going all Olaf Stapleton on us, taking us through creation and introducing us to the two great intelligences that inhabit the universe: the Arisians and the Eddorians. The former are good guys, the latter aren't so much evil as clinical and opportunistic. Needless to say, this won't do and the first chunk of the book winds up taking us through various parts of Earth history as the two sides use pawns in an effort to either experiment or steer history. Not all of this is totally exciting, as the early chapters start to take on a pattern of introducing the scene, giving you a chance to pick up where the nasty Eddorian is hiding and then watching something screw up their chance to stop him/it. But it barrels along nicely and takes on a nice resonance in a chapter that critic and introductory author John Clute points is clearly autobiographical and where the book starts to take on a bit of spark.With that out of the way we start to go somewhere totally different and suddenly we're launched into Golden Age outer space action for the actual \\"Triplantary\\" novel, where stalwart characters are pitched against heinous menaces and grave peril that only the magic of quick thinking and science that didn't exist until like six pages after said peril is introduced can stop. And this is all before the aliens show up. Meanwhile, lurking in the background are the puppet masters, a foe that humanity is unaware of even as they become more embroiled in the fight.Smith knows his way around an action sequence and definitely knows how to keep things moving, his spaceships zip across the page and his writing is more detailed than other pulp writers of the time, often engaging in some surprising violence (the WWII sequence earlier on is oddly graphic for the time, without being lurid). But we really shouldn't forget that this is a Golden Age SF novel and as such there are some things you're going to have to accept, such as plots that go so fast so as to avoid you thinking too hard about them, characterizations that hit a note and keep on hitting it right until the end (introspection? what's that? we've got a job to do!) without variation and solutions that often boil down to \\"let's just built a bigger version of whatever they're hitting us with!\\"Not to say that this isn't entertaining. The arrival of the aliens livens things up considerably, especially since Roger isn't the world's most exciting name for a villain nor is he all that menacing, clinical without being totally frightening. The Nevians at least are clever and tend to class up the place a little bit, giving the humans something else to struggle against, even if the aliens aren't really all that bad. It all goes on for a bit too long and some of the characters' self-assuredness is reminiscent of Heinlein (most of the time they have the solution devised before the problem even arises), but you can't argue with the scale of it, as giant machines slam into each other in space, careening around planets. The aliens suck all the iron out of things, people whirl past faster than light, planets get moved around for the sheer heck of it, if nothing else it's fun.But there are things that hopefully Smith fixes in later installments. For one, the characters all seem cut from the same stock, Real Men who are romantics at heart but also consumed with a sense of duty, and the women who are capable but swoon into the arms of these Real Men. There's a certain cavalier attitude toward slaughtering anything that isn't like you, with one character gassing almost an entire city of aliens who were merely keeping him captive and not even feeling a little bad about it. In fact, entire cities get bombed into oblivion and the combatants shake on it without remorse, getting together and going, \\"Hey, that's war. No harm no foul.\\" The conflict between the Arisians and the Eddorians should be a bit more drama to it, right now the Arisians are running rings around the Eddorians to the point where it's silly, so that the only reason they don't wipe their enemies out can be only be attributed to plot contrivance, as the Eddorians never feel like a real threat. When you can wipe yourself from the memory of your enemies for centuries, and then predict when they'll regain their memories, that's not a fight, that's marking time until you win. I know good has to prevail but can it be in doubt just a little bit? Please?However, this is only the first novel and basically exists to set up a saga that from what I've heard attains an even greater velocity as the series hurtles on. So with all the exposition out of the way, perhaps the series will get a chance to go exploring."},{"Title":"Triplanetary (Lensman Saga)","review":"If you're intending to read Doc Smith's classic \\"Lensman\\" series, then so you should; but you should definitely start, not with \\"Triplanetary\\", but withGalactic Patrol.

Either you use the standarts that were acceptable at the time, or your criterion should be reading pleasure (while disregarding with a smile a few flaws).If you're judging any kind of old writing with today's standarts then you are being unfare towards yourself, besides ofcourse the book, 'cause you'll not be able to enjoy excellent features of a work, other than scientific credebility, or being politicaly correct.the &quot;Lensmen&quot; series is a great space-opera built like an onion- every time an enemy is defeated, there is another one behind him, more secrative and stronger. The lensmen, on the other hand must strech their powers and abilities, while discovering new ones here and there, to super-human levels of stress, untill the last battle with the true source of evil in the universe.True, it's dated, not politicaly correct, it's scientific credebility is so-so, and not very complex plot-wise.On the other hand it's full of exploding action, killer telepathic monsters, ultra-powerfull weapons, super-fast space ships, perfect heroes who look good, think fast, poses steel-nerves, allways know what to do, and are unshakeble in their belief in goodnes.

The tale is set post World War II at a southeastern Australian coastal community, Split Point.Playing out within a well-established Upfield formula, Bony enters in to this hornet's nest armed with two promises extracted from his superiors: no interference in his investigative activities, and they are not to press him regarding his progress on the case. The local police have initially failed to solve the murder and (as usual) Bony is called in weeks later after all reasonable hope of resolution has been abandoned. Of course Bony's superiors prevail upon him in such instances because he has never failed to \\"finalize\\" a case.Posing as a sheep rancher on vacation, Bony initially checks in at the small local hotel and pub. He finds some folks friendly but many are stand-offish, and they appear to have more reason for this than mere clannishness. As Australia's premier detective unearths more and more clues the heat turns up until Bony finally finds himself in imminent personal danger... and that happens not long after Bony encounters a second dead body!This specific edition offers multiple enhanced features. First there is a very nice mini-biography of Upfield in an introduction written by John Ball. Included in the back of the book is a comprehensive bibliography of all Upfield books along with a brief commentary on each one. Finally, the publishers have included an enlightening map of Australia which indicates the location of each of the Upfield mysteries.The binding is of the book club variety and includes an attractive dust jacket.In summary, this tale is classic Upfield, first-rate escapism, and I highly recommend it. For an insightful introduction to the mysteries of Arthur W. Upfield (there are thirty memorable works in all), try:Mr. Jelly's Business, also re-titled and available asMurder Down Under."},{"Title":"The New Shoe","review":"I have been working my way through Upfield&#8217;s Napoleon Bonaparte series. In The New Shoe, Bonaparte (nicknamed Bony) is undercover in a small coastal town where a nude body has been found in a lighthouse. This is a strange murder indeed and Bony does some travelling around to other parts of Australia in his search to uncover all the clues. As always, Bony is charming, considerate and sensitive to the feelings of those he likes and direct about those he does not like. Every time I read one of this series I am struck by the similarities between the character of Napoleon Bonaparte and the character of Sherlock Holmes.However, Bony does not have a Watson. Some of the comments and references are so twee that I cringe but it was written in the 1950s so I excuse those things.One of the reasons I enjoyed The New Shoe, is because it is in set in an area that I am familiar with - Aireys Inlet on the Great Ocean Road in Victoria.

His writing style is fairly fluid and he sets the plot up fairly well. As other reviewers have noted, he wrote in an environmentalist point of view which is in good keeping with the overall \\"ethos\\" of Star Trek and, in my opinion, serves to help the plot along as opposed to detracting from it.The premise:Captain Picard and the Enterprise are sent to the planet Thiopa to deliver and provide emergency relief in the face of a planetary famine. Once there, they discover that there is more than meets the eye as the planetary government, thought to be a Federation ally, is a brutal dictatorship. Captain Picard finds that he's in the midst of a major dilemma, whether or not to deliver the famine relief which would only serve to help the dictatorship, knowing full well that they would not reach the people or attempting to change the attitude of the government, which would obviously be an uphill battle all the way.What follows is an interesting and somewhat intriguing early Star Trek The Next Generation story that is well worth the time to read, giving the reader insight into the authors perceptions of the crew during this early period of STNG's run on television. {ssintrepid}"},{"Title":"Power Hungry (Star Trek: The Next Generation #6)","review":"Howard Weinstein is very concerned about the environment. If you read the author's notes at the beginning of the book, you almost don't have to read the novel. Mr. Weinstein is quite correct in his concern for the environmental conditions on planet Earth, but I think there are better ways he could have expressed these concerns then in this by the numbers novel.The Enterprise D is called to the planet Thiopa to bring supplies for victims of famine. When they arrive at Thiopa the crew discovers that everything is not quite as the primary planetary government purported.Meanwhile Data decides to do a little looking into the planet's environmental concern, and discovers that their food shortages, drought conditions, etc. were caused by the people of Thiopa's own short-sighted rush to attain a technological society. The crew becomes concerned that even if they do provide assistance to the planet, they will just become extinct within 50 years if they don't change their pollutionary ways. Of course there is the sticky prime directive to deal with - how much can we tell them without interfering in the planet's natural progress.This story probably would have worked well as a short story. In Mr. Weinstein's drive to expand the story to a novel, he added a number of stories and characters to expand the story. These include a race called the Nuarans that basically are annoying, like gnats buzzing around the ear. He starts to give background stories on some of the people surrounding Lord Stross, the planet's government leader, but then doesn't proceed to do anything with the character or the information.The story is fast paced and a quick read. There are some enjoyable moments, such as Worf trying out for Riker's jazz combo. This is not a bad book, it's just not that interesting.

There were no simple &quot;good guys vs. bad guys&quot; conflicts here; the leader of the planetary government, while clearly not doing everything he could possibly have done to help his world at a crisis point, clearly believed that what he was doing was for the best, and his charisma (necessary in a leader of his type of government) was well-enough portrayed that the reader could feel it, and couldn't help but like him in spite of knowing better. Meanwhile, his opposition was also well-meaning and determined, convinced of the rightness of her cause, if somewhat less charismatic than he was. Both of them were plausible, at least somewhat likeable, wishing the best for their world...and absolutely incapable of working together or reaching compromise in order to save it, even with the Federation's best efforts at mediation. Sad, but all too plausible.On the downside, one character who DID grow during the course of the story (Ambassador Undrun) did so rather IMPLAUSIBLY.

Yet these are precisely the issues that defined the career of the first American Russia expert, George Kennan, a century ago. M ore than any other single American, this first cousin twice removed of our own era's George F. Kennan \\"discovered\\" and described Russia for America during the more than half a century between the American and Russian civil wars.Kennan was a child of the new communications revolution, first visiting Siberia as part of an ill-fated telegraphic expedition, then making Russia the subject of one of the great lecturing careers of the late nineteenth century and one of the great journalistic careers of the early twentieth. Having discovered Siberia as an adventuresome frontiersman trying to forge a European-American cable connection the long way, across the Bering Strait, Kennan returned to expose the czarist prisons of Siberia and to become perhaps the leading champion in the Western world of democratic revolutionary resistance to the czarist authorities. As such, he struggled against a well-established official American policy of friendship for that particular autocracy. He mobilized American popular opinion in behalf of Russia's suppressed political opposition, and eventually helped change U.S. government policy as well.IT IS A GREAT strength of this extensively researched new biography by Frederick Travis that we discover how little Kennan really studied Russia, how many mistakes (including deliberate ones) he introduced into his journalism, and yet how little challenged his authority remained within the United States. This was an age when America was absorbed in its own interests and inclined to read foreign countries, if at all, in terms of its own institutions and aspirations. Until the early twentieth century the study of Russia was almost totally absent from universities, and serious literature on Russia almost totally absent from libraries. Dilettantism could triumph if accompanied by the kind of arrogant tenacity and rhetorical panache that Kennan possessed. He presented a picture of Russia that was more a projection of characteristic American hopes, fears, and fantasies in an era of exuberant self-confidence than the product of had-earned knowledge.His authority was, however, based on firsthand observations, though they were largely focused on the exotic. Kennan first arrived in Russia in 1865, and only after spending two winters in hitherto largely unknown parts of Siberia (later described in his first major book, Tent Life in Siberia) did Kennan visit Moscow and St. Petersburg. On his second trip he passed rapidly through Petersburg in order to reach the Caucasus, describing himself as \\"a vagabond ... who travels without any definite utilitarian aim ... the vagabond is never a spcialist ... he is ready to become all things with all men and to make himself equally at home in all places.\\" His early travels in Russia were thus a kind of romantic Wanderjahre for a young midwestern Calvinist who was losing both his boyhood religious faith and his adolescent enthusiasm for scientific and technical expeditions. But he developed what grew into a lifelong fascination with the Russian people. There was, initially, no political or social content to his interest, although he generally shared the vague Russophilia in some circles that followed Russian support for the Union in the Civil War and the sale of Alaska to the United States in 1867. Throughout the 1870s and early 1880s Kennan defended Russian policy even when it proved expansionist, first in the Balkans and then in Central Asia, and he also tried to propagate the glories of Russian literature.His ten-month-long trip to Siberia in 1885 and 1886 turned him from a defender of official Russia into a self-appointed spokesman for the political exiles and prisoners that he discovered there. Romantic infatuation was part of it all, as Kennan himself acknowledged: \\"With many of them I simply fall dead in love as if I were a girl of eighteen.\\" But he was also moved by the moral purity of the exiles--their continued intellectual earnestness under difficult conditions and their combination of inner dignity and outward affection for this mysterious visitor from distant America. Kennan was particularly impressed by Catherine Breshkovsky, the populist \\"little grandmother of the Russian Revolution.\\" She bade him farewell in the small Transbaikal village to which she was confined by saying, \\"We may die in exile, and our grand children may die in exile, but something will come of it at last.\\" One of the Russians explained that until they had met Kennan, \\"we had been talking either to acknowledged friends or to prejudiced enemies, but never to an impartial observer, who would take on himself to bring the case before the tribunal of universal conscience.\\" Kennan devoted much of the next twenty years to pressing their cause, mainly from the lecture platform.He lectured before about a million people in the course of the 1890s, inspiring in one of them a \\"curious craving to see this gaunt land of Siberia and let my own eyes gaze on the starved wretches sent to a living death.\\" Victorians loved to feel both superior to and shocked by distant outrages like those Kennan recounted. A taunt thrown at Victorian liberals--they \\"cross equinoxial lines in search of objects of charity\\"--brings to mind the \\"radical chic\\" of more recent times: North Americans incensed by events in Southeast Asia, South America, or South Africa.Travis astutely observes that Kennan \\"saw in the political exiles the same heroic spirit that had attracted him to Caucasian mountaineers, wandering Koriaks in northeastern Siberia, and reforming drunkards on New York's Water Street.\\" It was something like the spirit that another great journalist, John Reed, later sought first in the Wobblies, then in Mexican revolutionaries, and finally in the Bolsheviks about whom he fantasized so appealingly in Ten Days That Shook the World.BUT KENNAN'S infatuation with Russia was informed by a sterner moral purpose, which Travis describes as a sense that Kennan was always on the side of civilization against barbarism. His long campaign in behalf of political prisoners was expanded to include persecuted minorities in the Russian empire--particularly the Jews--and the Japanese, who warred with the Russians in 1904-1905. He helped in a fascinating, little-known campaign to educate and politically mobilize Russian prisoners of war in Japan. And he attached great hopes to the Russian Revolution of 1905 and even greater to the democratic revolution of February, 1917.Kennan was a perceptive analyst of the practical need for democratic and constitutional reform. He was particularly distressed by the czarist repression of student activity after the upheavals of 1905. \\"A university is a barometer which shows the state of the public mind,\\" Kennan quoted a Russian surgeon as saying. \\"A wise man does not break the instrument, but learns from it what the weather is likely to be.\\" He accused the czars of breaking the barometers rather than read them. He saw that all russian involvement in modern wars concluded with a period of reform or revolution--in effect, \\"a recompense for their sacrifices and losses.\\"All the more bitter, then, was the Bolshevik betrayal of a revolution that Kennan had encouraged in its democratic phase. Unlike John Reed, Kennan vehemently rejected the October Revolution, both because of the Bolsheviks' renunciation of the Allied cause in the war and because the Soviet government lacked the \\"knowledge, experience, or education to deal successfully with the tremendous problems that have come up for solutions since the overthrow of the Tsar.\\" Kennan criticized Woodrow Wilson for being much too timid in intervening against Bolshevik power, and persisted longer than most Americans in the belief that the Siberians would hold out against the Bolsheviks, because they were a \\"bolder and more independent people than the Muzhiks of European Russia.\\" Travis tends to be rather condemnatory both of Kennan's extreme opposition to the Bolshevik takeover and of his insistence on the moral obligation to defend the provisional government. Kennan's last epitaph on the Bolshevik Revolution was written in a small-town newspaper, the Medina Tribune, in July of 1923:The Russian leopard has not changed its spots... The new Bolshevik constitution ... leaves all power just where it has been for the last five years--in the hands of a small group of self-appointed bureaucrats which the people can neither remove nor control.He died not long after Lenin did, having just finished an article on Japanese education--finding more hope for the future in Japan than in Russia.ONE IS RELIEVED that Travis's biography does not include the kind of psychological probing or moralistic preaching that has too often been directed at Victorian figures, though his tendency to make this account an exhaustive inventory of Kennan's acquaintances and views results in a certain blandness. Kennan's larger-than-life and even heroic qualities--his physical endurance on Siberian trips and on lecture tours, the majesty of his moralism--never quite come across. But Travis perceptively identifies Kennan's flaws. There was more than a little blindness in the man. He was sympathetic chiefly to political prisoners, who represented a minute fraction of those in Russia's vast penal and exile system. As far as we know, he never visited any prison outside Russia for comparative purposes. He confused political exiles in East Siberia with administrative exiles in West Siberia, and at times he misled his audiences in other ways to dramatize his cause. Kennan never probed deeply into the views of Russians working within the system, whom he could have helped and learned from. Nikolai Yadrintsev, for instance, one of the most interesting and sophisticated publicists in behalf of a semi-independent Siberia, urged a different, more open style of development there. Kennan met him early but seems never to have talked seriously with him or with a number of others who saw then--as many do today--that Siberia itself might ultimately become an example of the kind of liberal democratic development that its prisoners advocated.The fact remains, however, that Kennan created American public interest in the internal conditions of a remote country, and the story of how he did so supplies an impressive first chapter for a history, yet to be written, on the effects of American journalism on foreign policy. Kennan catalyzed a range of things that eventually helped to change policy: the first English-language opposition journal, Free Russia; the Society of American Friends of Russian Freedom (involving such luminaries as Julia Ward Howe and Mark Twain); and a public campaign against a Senate-approved treaty that would have exposed Jewish emigres to America to possible arrest if they re-entered Russia. State Department officials in the late nineteenth century were as annoyed by Kennan's attempts to affect intergovernmental relations as their successors were many years later by the outcries over immigration and human rights which led to the Jackson-Vanik amendment of 1974. It is easy to forget now, in the wake of the victory of the human-rights agenda in Eastern Europe, how doggedly most of the American foreign-policy establishment resisted the intrusion of such concerns into its realpolitik agenda of security, political, and economic questions. It was Western Europeans, rather than Americans, who took the lead in assuring that human rights were included in \\"basket three,\\" which became part of the international obligations of all signatories of the Helsinki Final Act. Leaders in the newly emerging democracies of Eastern Europe today express more admiration for moralistic journalists than for realistic diplomats. They are likely, too, to feel greater sympathy for Kennan's buccaneering spirit and his fierce denunciation of autocracy and Bolshevism than for the more cautious and moderate positions taken both by his opponents then and by his biographer now."},{"Title":"George Kennan and the American-Russian Relationship, 1865-1924","review":"Travis credits Kennan as being on the forefront of a new liberal internationalism that supported the expansion of the democratic ideal to \\"barbarous\\" nations. Kennan believed Russian Nihilists were the inheritors of the American enlightenment tradition and they had proved themselves worthy through struggle against overwhelming odds. His passions were stirred by a small group of Russians who had digested literature that reflected the new belief in the power of science. In chapter four, Travis notes how Kennan was spellbound by encounters with Nihilists whose reading material included Herbert Spencer's \\"Principles of Psychology,\\" Balfour Stewart's \\"Conservation of Energy\\" and Friedrich Albert Lange's \\"History of Materialism.\\"Travis raises the importance of literary cross fertilization and notes how Kennan penned translations and critiqued others' translations of Russian literature. But Travis drops this theme in his conclusion; he instead weighs the impact of Kennan's own writing on more official sources of power. He does not adequatley explain the Russian fascination with western scientific texts or Tolstoy's fascination with the writings of American abolitionists, in particular those who embraced Christian non-resistance. Travis deftly describes Kennan's personal struggle with faith and science, but he does not adequately describe the larger context of this struggle and how it played out in Russia and America in the late nineteen century.Travis seems to suggest that what really stirred Kennan's emotions for Russian political exiles and &eacute;migr&eacute;s was that they were intellectuals conversant with the most recent developments in scientific writings in the West. Had this not been the case, it is fair to wonder whether Kennan would have been their champion at all? This relatively small subset of Russian prisoners were men and women who were inspired by the same books Kennan was twenty years earlier, yet they were imprisoned and he was free. His interest in their plight stemmed not from a fascination with the exotic, but rather from how much he had in common with his exiled subjects."},{"Title":"Peter Bardazzi: Paintings : [exhibition] April 12th to May 13th 1978, Cordier & Ekstrom","review":"These are beautiful war paintings based on Homer's Iliad specifically the struggles of Achilles and his hatred of Hector.

It's part of a series about Arly Hanks, a divorced woman in her 30s who is the entire police force over a tiny southern town named Maggody.When Matt Montana, an up-and-coming country singer claims he was born in Maggody and plans to go home for Christmas, things start to happen. The town residents -- portrayed as one stereotyped country boob after another-- get celebrity fever as each of them greedily schemes how to make money off of Maggody being Matt Montana's birth place. Along the way, 3 people end of up dead and while I forced myself to finish the book, only 2 of the deaths were explained. Unbelievably, the third death was not cleared up.Here's why I hated the book. First, there are no sympathetic characters in this book-- not even the protagonist, Arly Hanks. A list of a few of the southern hicks that populate the town are an obese newlywed (many jokes about how many chins she has) who fears her husband is stepping out on her, a moonshiner constantly in need of a bath complete with a large pet pig, a slick, hypocritical, greedy minister, a convenience store clerk with crooked teeth, beady eyes, as well as a low IQ, and a henpecked husband. The main thrust of the humor in the book is to portray southerners in every negative, stereotypical way possible. I don't mind some politically incorrect jokes, but this got to be too much. The book would have been a lot better if at least a few of the residents of Maggody were decent, sincere people. Every town no matter how big or small (be it Manhatten or Maggody) has its share of fools, but there are also wonderful, genuine denizens no matter how thick their accents may be.To add to matters, Arly Hanks was little more than an after thought in the book. It was clear she was recovering from an unhappy divorce, but almost NOTHING happens in her life in the course of this book. No love interest, no good friends, heck, even her mother was a bumpkin who tended to lecture her.The final insult to the reader is that the third death is not explained AND the author is aware of this. At the end of the book, she has Arly saying to a police detective from another town that while the third death looks suspicious, it's not under her jurisdiction so she wouldn't pursue it. What??!! I feel cheated! Even a bad murder mystery ties up all the loose ends.The book fails on every level and I don't plan on reading another Joan Hess mystery.

It is in actuality a meta-book, in the sense of being a book about books. Ms. Burack-Weiss, a Clinical Social Worker and instructor at Columbia University School of Social Work, decided to expand and amplify an article she published in 1995 entitled \\"The Caregiver's Memoir: A New Look at Family Support.\\" She says in her prologue,\\"It was a topic close to my heart. For thirty years I'd practiced clinical social work with ill and disabled people and their families. ...caregiving was not an intrusion on family life but an intrinsic part of it, a crucible in which the crux of relationships was revealed; an occasion not only of stress and burden, but of growth, possibility, and meaning.... How do family caregivers \`keep on keeping on'? How do their views on family and on the meaning of life itself change over the course of caregiving? How can their hard-won wisdom be used to sustain others faced with the same challenges?\\"Her method for answering these questions is to utilize published memoirs as research texts. The main bulk of The Caregiver's Tale is a sweeping (though perhaps not entirely comprehensive) review of books about child-care, peer-care, and parent-care relationships. Ms. Burack-Weiss takes as her definition of caregiving \\"the sense that clinicians and researchers use the word: hands-on help with personal and instrumental tasks of daily living undertaken by one family member on behalf of another--usually for a time-limited period--of greater or lesser duration--of illness or disability.\\"The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 concerns itself with (and divides itself into) \\"Care Situations\\": caring for those with cancer, dementia, HIV/AIDS, mental illness or chemical dependence. The section begins with a look at the cultural context of the various illnesses/disabilities. Each care situation entails differing challenges, problems, obstacles, pains, and its own characteristic flavor of anguish. None is perhaps more difficult than the section on HIV/AIDS which describes the profound stigma those stricken often felt about their diagnosis (though hopefully and presumably this has diminished over the years).With HIV/AIDS there also exists the distinct possibility of surprise. Because it was often contracted through \\"culturally disapproved behaviors such as IV drug use and homosexual sex\\" there is sometimes in these memoirs a \\"...kind of secret that rocks authors to the depths of their beings: suddenly learning that the loved one they thought they knew was another person entirely.\\" In several of the memoirs, the caregiver finds out about adultery, unknown promiscuity, or unsuspected homosexuality. Elizabeth Cox finds out that her husband has not only been adulterous, but with a man. Susan Bergman sees that her father's \\"persona as a churchgoing husband and father of four is a sham....\\"In Part 2 it is \\"Care Relationships\\" that are examined: a parent or parents caring for a child, sibling care, couple care, and finally (and certainly most inevitably) children caring for their parents. \\"Memoirs of sibling and parent care show that there is no easy formula. Sisters may be estranged, fathers may have been alcoholic or neglectful, mothers may have thwarted their early attempts at independence, causing them to flee. Yet their siblings and their children return to care.\\"The caregivers are often faced with stark, and ghastly choices: a wife must decide whether to take a vacation with a husband with severe heart disease, a sister must decide whether to authorize sterilization of a mentally disabled sister, \\"an adult child deciding whether a mother with Alzheimer's disease can safely live alone....\\" Several choices may today seem odd. Many readers would (I suspect) be surprised to read how before 1970 \\"the necessity for secrecy (rationalized in the name of maintaining hope) was unquestioningly accepted. Simone de Beauvoir's mother was never given the name of her illness. John Gunther maintained the pretense that his son, Johnny, was going off to Harvard in the fall even when it was clear that he would never leave his hospital bed.\\"Part 3 \\"The Memoirs\\" is a succession of one paragraph summaries of the memoirs. The chapter is fifty pages long, and I must admit I that found it nearly pointless except for research purposes. Unlike Ms. Burack-Weiss's writing throughout the rest of the book which is often both wonderful and profound, the summaries are brief, dry, lacking in humor or warmth, and offer little or no actual insight into the works covered. They felt like filler to me:Ann Hood, Do Not Go Gentle: My Search for Miracles in a Cynical Time (Picador, 2000).Hood does not want the reader to miss the point of her memoir. In a prologue she writes that it is the story of her \\"spiritual Odyssey.\\" The inward journey described coexists with an outer journey--the search for a cure for her father, who was dying of inoperable lung cancer. Scenes of coping with the disease on the home front (where Hood and her young son lived close enough to visit her parents daily) alternate with scenes from a trip to Mexico to bring home a \\"miracle\\" and later to Europe to discover her family's roots. Hood's efforts did not prevent the inevitable. Her father's death and the memories of the family's response to the sudden death of Hood's beloved brother some years before add depth and pathos to the story.Part 3 aside, overall, The Caregiver's Tale is often a fascinating read. And yet it also felt like a published doctoral dissertation, with some of the flaws inherent in such an adaptation. The book was at times a bit over-academic-y. (As in the sweeping, but requisite-in-a-thesis, literature review.) Nevertheless, on the whole it is a fascinating gathering and analysis of works which, in many ways illuminate the core of what makes us truly human beings: that we care for one another. It is when Ms. Burack-Weiss gathers insights into patterns perhaps evident only to a reader of many many memoirs that she offers us her best, and most useful understandings.\\"...comfort and support is seldom available to those who suffer more subtle losses: \`deaths' of parts of the family member's personality long before his body is laid to rest. The mother who used to offer sage advice is now mute. The husband who is no longer the sexual partner and confidant he once was. These losses are often endured in silence--for who can complain when the one you are caring for suffers so much more? Also lost are parts of the author's identity in relation to the ill or disabled family member. No longer being a son, a mother, a wife--with all the cultural expectations and privileges attendant on the role--leaves many feeling as if a part of them has died along with their loved one.\\"Ms. Burack-Weiss's writing is at times quite marvelous, and the morsels harvested from the books she references and cites are tasty, tantalizing and alluring. Many of the memoirists are famous, or the people for whom they cared were: Philip Roth, Sue Miller, Kenzaburo O, Jamaica Kincaid, Kate Millett, Joe Heller, Isabel Allende, Martin Amis, Calvin Trillin, Elizabeth Swados, Danielle Steele. Much of the writing quoted from these books made me wish that we could get a great deal more than merely snippets. But I suppose the answer to that predicament would be to use The Caregiver's Tale as a tasting menu, and then go out and consume many of the splendid, illuminating, and affecting memoirs themselves."},{"Title":"Teaching Photography: Tools for the Imaging Educator","review":"For anyone who teaches imaging (and that includes me), this book is a must read. The book is informative and entertaining. . . filled with quotes that will make you smile while inspiring you - to become a better teacher.

All I can say is that we are fortunate that Dr. Zakia (whom I have met) chose teaching."},{"Title":"Teaching Photography: Tools for the Imaging Educator","review":"This book is a great book for those who are teaching either advance photography or at the college level. I am teaching a beginning class and this book was not much help. I was hoping for more lesson plan ideas and there were not as many as I had hoped. This book is probably a good book to read during abreak or over the summer, but not a good book for quick resources."},{"Title":"Teaching Photography: Tools for the Imaging Educator","review":"The quotes throughout the book give a sense of diversity of resources and are important to the theme of drawing on information from areas other than photographic. The book speaks sympathetically and clearly to anyone who has been involved on the frontline of education. But it also speaks to those (students) who are on the receiving end of art education. It gives insight into why many of us (self-learners) need to learn (how) to find the right teachers. One of the strongest merits of this book is that it addresses issues that are not limited to the photographic community."},{"Title":"Teaching Photography: Tools for the Imaging Educator","review":"I purchased this to help create the curriculum for a high school photo 1 class inaugurated this year at my school. This book is not what I expected. It is much more about teaching pedagogy and not as much photography. That being understood it is still a well designed book.The target audience is most definitely a student of education aiming at a fine arts credential focusing on photography. It reads like a college textbook.Note: I was about to return this book because it had little usable \\"photography\\" content. However, I took a closer look - a deeper reading - and found information that would be useful for improving my teaching of photography as a fine art. I am keeping the book."},{"Title":"Teaching Photography: Tools for the Imaging Educator","review":"The book by Rand and Zakia is a must for teachers or those who are contemplating becoming a teacher. It's primary audience are those who teach in the visual arts, but it has a wealth of information and ideas which any teacher could use. I would also recommend this book for individuals who teach photo seminars or workshops. The art of teaching is quickly dying and this is a refreshing breath that will hopfully inspire teachers and those who want to teach to do more than show up for their job, but take their role as teacher seriously and guide their students in the learning process."},{"Title":"Teaching Photography: Tools for the Imaging Educator","review":"Finally a book for the photo educator!!! This is long overdue and am thrilled to own it. As a relatively new high school photo teacher, it is a wonderful resource that discusses the technical and artistic considerations a teacher must deal with as well as writings on how to create assignments, test, assess, and work with your employing institution for betterment of the program. There is even more in it than I've listed here. For anyone interested in teaching photography I highly recommend this book. Although I have been trained in educational practices, so many of my colleagues have not, they are photographers who happen to teach... this book helps summarize so many points that I have discussed with them as they learn to teach."},{"Title":"Teaching Photography: Tools for the Imaging Educator","review":"This book is wonderful Brain fodder for teachers focusing on getting away from strictly project based assignments. If you want to engage your photography students by inspiring them to aspire as artist this book will be most helpful. The photos give not only the artists' names, but their teachers- supporting the book's unstated premise that behind every great art photographer is a great teacher. I will return to this book, but if you are an experienced art teacher teaching photography for the first time this book may not be for you. It is written for the photographer who finds him/herself in the classroom. Many inspirational quotes and passages. If you are already a teacher and find yourself writing curriculum for photography (like me) I recommend The Elements of Photography by Angela Faris Belt.The Elements of Photography: Understanding and Creating Sophisticated ImagesIf you are a photographer considering the teaching profession Teaching Photography is a must-read and should be used as a textbook in every teaching photography course for art education majors."},{"Title":"Teaching Photography: Tools for the Imaging Educator","review":"As an instructor, I have relied on the shared experiences of the many contributors contained within this gem of a book.

So this book was a very enjoyable read, and I loved the pictures chosen for the book."},{"Title":"Rural America: A Pictorial Folk Memory","review":"So many of these &quot;rural history&quot; books end up as nothing more than coffee table books with interesting pictures and words nobody reads. This book is an important exception, because not only are the images exceptional, the narrative that goes with the pictures brings the whole book to life.In the writing, there is a certain longing, a wistfulness for what seems to be a more peaceful and idyllic time in the past, in the country, on the homestead. But this book is not just sanitized visions of a mythical past. In the many photographs, there is clear-eyed truth: rural life was often hard, a little brutish and sometime just plain dangerous.For example, there is a striking images of a man riding a horse off of a 20 foot high platform into a shallow pool of water (page 89) is a reminder that what passed for &quot;entertainment&quot; back then might well get you arrested today.As a reader, though, what struck me about this book was the sense that I could have known the people in the pictures, perhaps I would have been doing what they were doing back then.That's what really makes the book work for me - it feels almost like finding an a family album in the attic, familiar but distant, and you want to just sit and slowly turn the pages and let the stories of long ago come alive.A worthwhile addition to anyone's collection."},{"Title":"Inventing the Electronic Century: The Epic Story of the Consumer Electronics and Computer Industries, with a new preface (Harvard Studies in Business History)","review":"As a new century starts, Chandler gives a summary of how consumer electronics and computing grew in the last century and indeed shaped many of the trends in the latter half. He starts by pointing out that consumer electronics is older than modern computing. It was the radio industry of the 20s and 30s. Which propelled Motorola and others to prominence.After World War 2 arose electronic computers. As opposed to earlier electromechnical gizmos. Chandler goes over the crucial inventions - the transistor, integrated circuit and microprocessor. And how decades of Moore's Law have driven these industries into everyday life.But sections of his book are jarring. These concern the growth of the Japanese electronics and computer companies. They purport to show how these companies grew to dominance in various market sectors, like memory. There is a distinct tone that they outdid their US counterparts, with deeper strategy and Japanese government assistance. While this book is printed in 2005, the tone completely neglects the 16 year stagnation in the Japanese economy. Including their technology companies.The book gives a few pages to describing Korean and Taiwanese companies, up to around 2000. There is no update to 2004-5. Which would say that the Koreans (Samsung) have grown hugely in memory. Certainly more so than the Japanese. Yes, in the 80s, Japan forced most US companies out of memory. But memory has proven to be a very fickle boom and bust market. Low profit margins over time. Chandler sees the Japanese \\"takeover\\" of memory as evidence of good planning and national industrial policy. But if anything, it is evidence of the contrary.While in consumer electronics, Samsung has also grown far stronger than Sony or Hitachi or ...In the important area of microprocessors, there is little emphasis that the US has not lost ground to Japan. If anything, it is Japan that has done so, with respect to other countries.The sections of the text that describe Japan have the feel of books written in the 80s, warning of a coming Japanese industrial supremacy. Never happened."},{"Title":"Inventing the Electronic Century: The Epic Story of the Consumer Electronics and Computer Industries, with a new preface (Harvard Studies in Business History)","review":"Alfred Chandler has organized the factual information of the key companies in the Consumer Electronics and Computer Industries during the second half of the XX century. The title of my review is a suggestion of another apropriate subtitle of this book.The subject is very complex, specially if we look at the technology involved. My major comment is: the author has a limited technical knowledge and this has limited the depth of his analyses, comments and conclusions. This does not invalidate the major conclusions that he has presented in this book.I think that it would be interesting to expand the story told in this book by studying/describing the evolution of the whole envinronment around these industries, including the engineering schools and research institutes that supply the brains to develop all the technology involved.The history of the electronics industry carry an important lesson, about concentration of skills and economic power in only one company (RCA). It was a good thing, while RCA was leading, but when it started to make major strategic mistakes it brought down the whole American Industry. The Japanese Industry used several companies to compete against American and European Companies, this created a whole envinronment, that included engineering schools, research facilities, several different companies where one could make a career and different ideas being tested and pursued at the same time. When you look at the capacity of inovation and development of new technologies of the japanese companies and their envinronment they were a lot more competitive. They created a competitive envinronment so agressive in Japan that western rivals were later decimated by them.The way American companies have managed the development of technologies should be better understood than is explored in this book. There is a pattern to be investigated, for it was in America that several technologies started, but there is a problem in the way this headstart is kept. Examples to be looked into: IBM dominance in computers, Xerox dominance in copiers, RCA in television (well discussed in this book). I think that is missing a description of who were the major brains and decision makers that lead those companies throughout this fast paced period. I would suggest that if we look at who are the persons making the decisions we would find important answers to the success of the Japanese. Example: what is the power and influence of the teams developing a new technology or products, what is the academic and technical background of the top managers in those companies, how do they handled investment decisions regarding product development, what is the philosophy pursued by them ...The lesson hidden in the history of the electronics industry is very important, when we look at the industrial policy in America in other industries, like Automobiles, where there is only two American Manufacturers, it is easy to see why Japanese companies are doing much better, they are following the same type of competitive organization in this industry... Ford and GM are going in the same direction of RCA... This will raise a very important question, in what industries does America plans to remain competitive in the future??? This will determine the long term stability of the American Democracy.One may have some points to criticize in this book, but the history told in this book should be better understood and deserves attention.One aspect related to the industries studied that should be brought to attention is the availability of information about the japanese industry due to the language barrier."},{"Title":"Perspectives on Argument","review":"The basics of academic writing are fairly straightforward. We need clear reasoning, hence a clear explanation of the basics of logic and of fallacies. We need to explain to students how to select research materials, how to distinguish trade books from academically kosher texts, and so on. And we also need an efficient writing guide that addresses these issues. This is not such a text.Firstly, the text gives thin and often confusing advice on logic. Where Wood discusses critical thinking and fallacies, the explanations are very short (just five pages of a 750 page text concern fallacies, for example) and there are no real- world examples of the fallacies discussed. As such, the relevance of basic logic to the art of critical reading is not really obvious to the novice. This is bizarre, given that many of the (non- academic) reading examples in the text(such as Rush Limbaugh on 'femi-Nazis') are basically wall to wall fallacious, and much of the right wing conservative nonsense in the text's reading section is simply not diagnosed as such. Further, Wood's explanations of basic logical concepts are inexplicably confused- she gets inductive and deductive logic quite the wrong way around (p.201)- an error that would get any critical thinking tutor fired. This paucity of clarity is evident in some truly shocking advice given the student: advice that rather rejects the whole principle of research and cogent argumentation in the name of some muddled epistemic relativism that holds that everyone has a unique perspective that deserves respect. In particular, she advises authors to not clearly articulate their arguments for a given proposition because \\"a stated warrant [premise] negates the rich and varied perceptions and responses of the audience by providing only the author's interpretation and articulation of the warrant\\" (p.139). This emphasis on such irrelevant issues as 'establishing common ground'and 'establishing the rhetorical situation' makes much of the text worse than useless in trying to teach what college writing entails and requires. In suggesting that the misreadings of the reader are more important than clearly articulating one's own argument, Wood is, quite frankly, talking rubbish.The text does include some solid examples of argumentative writing (such as Martin Luther King Jr's \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\") but there is no real explanation as to why such texts are persuasive without being fallacious. Further, many of the better essays in the text are far more sophisticated than the body text, making the overall work feel quite unbalanced.Geoffrey RocheTokyo, Japan"},{"Title":"Perspectives on Argument","review":"Think students shouldn't review textbooks?

I would consider myself a strong science student but this textbook is making physics extremely frustrating. We have only covered the first six chapters, but I am already noticing serious problems. The book is far from strait forward, with pages dedicated to superflous examples of things that seem to be common sense, while other pages are filled with silly diagrams that do little to help me understand the material. In many chapters the author dedicates more space to explaining how to draw diagrams of problems than he does explaining how to solve them. Consequently I often find that after reading a chapter I understand little more than how to draw pictures. The book is clearly oriented towards visual learners with little left over for the rest of us. In other chapters the material is organized in a way that seems irrational. Newton's Laws, for example, are not placed together as one would expect, rather they are scattered out of order over a 20 page chapter, making it more difficult to put the pieces together and get the big picture. The books one redeeming feature (and the reason it got the second star) is that it contains plenty of practice problems with more available online. Some of the problems even have detailed explanations and answers in the back, but often these answers are wrong, which only adds to my frustration. As I said I have only been through the first six chapter but if they are any indication, this is not a good text for an honors physics class."},{"Title":"Physics: Principles and Problems","review":"This is acually Jonathan Ray of Midlothian Virginia.

See also Piper's novel _Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen_ for a longer, very similar version of this story."},{"Title":"Federation","review":"These stories are from the time when computers were huge and stupid, when you took your DNA the way you found it, when we were sure there were a bunch of aliens waiting to be met, and you could engineer a culture the way you engineered a bridge. In other words, these stories are all about fifty years old, and you have to make some mental allowances for when, say, characters drag out that ancient bit of technology - the photostat.If you do that, you'll be entertained by one of the great practitioners of adventure science fiction, the man who created the popular Little Fuzzy series. The stories in this collection are set in the same universe, Piper's TerroHuman Future History, specifically during its early days. Aliens are central to most of the stories whether it's deciphering their history, attempting communication with them, or manipulating their culture.Piper was a great student of history and often makes specific allusions to the historical event inspiring a certain story. But the plots come off as credible and still readable instead of shoddy analogies with the past.\\"Omnilingual\\" is perhaps Piper's most famous short story. Its account of finding a Rosetta Stone to decipher the language of dead Martians is mixed with evocative accounts of their ruins and final struggles. \\"Naudsonce\\" is one of those alien puzzle anthropology stories. Here the puzzle is whether an alien race is telepathic or just has an astonishingly inconsistent language. The solution is credible and lies in the aliens' physiology. This is perhaps the only story in the collection not inspired by some bit of history.\\"Oomphel in the Sky\\" seems inspired by what anthropologists call \\"revitalization movements\\" similar to the American Indian's Ghost Dance of the late 1800s. The aliens of Kwannon start murdering and burning out human colonists in preparation for the Last Hot Time, an anticipation of the planet approaching perihelion with one of the system's suns. In the grand manner of an Astounding story of the time, our hero fixes their culture and fixes the problem. He also has to contend with neo-Marxists in the Native Welfare Commission who are hostile to his plan and the general efficiency of the military and private enterprise in providing for the Commission's native charges. While sympathetic to Piper's side of the debate, this story, in some ways, seemed to me the most dated in the book. If the story were written now, the bureaucrats would not be denouncing the influence of Kwannon priests (a la a 1950s Marxist denounciation of religion holding the masses back from their inevitable destiny) but celebrating their diversity - whatever its effects. It's Piper's hero that is most respectful of the aliens' innate abilities if not their specific beliefs. It's all about working with and accepting \\"social forces\\", alien or human, rather than working against them.\\"Graveyard of Dreams\\" is a melancholy story with a hopeful end that has a bit of the air of cargo cults about it. Poictesme's residents try to hold off their economic decline by scavenging the huge amount of military hardware left behind after a Federation civil war. Their ultimate quest is for a huge, sophisticated battle computer, the alleged key to Federation victory.\\"When in the Course - \\" is something of an anomaly. Never published in Piper's lifetime because Astounding's editor John W. Campbell rejected the story and its implausible element of parallel evolution, half of it was cannibalized to become part of Piper's Paratime series, specifically part of the novel Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen. The flavor of the story is similar to that novel with also something of L. Sprague de Camp's Lest Darkness Fall. A group of humans land on Freya, their last chance to get a profitable colonial charter. They introduce all sorts of innovations - like secret police and propaganda as well as gunpowder production - to the natives so they can get a treaty for their company and the natives can throw off a local religious tyranny.Piper's work is all in the public domain and freely available online. However, this collection is worth buying for Carr's attempt to piece together Piper's future history with its cycles of war, barbarism, expansion, and decline. It was a vast project Piper planned and, unfortunately, since many of his papers vanished after his suicide, the chronology of the series is not always obvious."},{"Title":"Federation","review":"It's a book of four short stories and a novella from the 1960's era of science fiction. Short stories around 50 pages, except for \\"Graveyard of Dreams\\" which is 30ish. While venerated by H.Beam Piper fans, the only story which genuinely impressed me was \\"Naudsonce\\", though I also enjoyed Oomphel in the Sky. So I liked about 100 pages, disliked the novella (84 pages), and thought the rest 'meh'. Averaging by page comes to 3.38/5, or three stars rounded down. Here is my breakdown by stories:Omnilingual (1957) - A group of archaeologists on Mars recreate the dead Martian language off of old scientific journals and magazines. Pretty boring unless you like archaeology. Three stars.Naudsonce (1962) - First contact with alien civilization, very original with a twist I didn't see coming (and I've read tons of first contacts). My favorite of the volume. Five stars.Oomphel In The Sky (1960) - Psychology of alien power structures on a primitive world occupied by humans. Mythic overtones, four stars.Graveyard of Dreams (1958, short) - According to the blurb, an alternative reality to the novel \\"Cosmic Computer.\\" I've not read that novel, so based on only the story, it's a treasure hunt for a non-existent computer with a great deal of exposition on the political and economic state of Piper's galaxy. The action could be condensed into two pages. Three stars; message of hopeWhen In The Course (novella, found unpublished after Piper's death)- A space colonization expedition lands on a planet filled with lifeforms that look like humans.

Considering that he is a Jewish writer living in the United States, he has established a highly independent and well-founded perspective on the state of Israel and its relationships with both the Arab world and the United States. After reading all of Henry Kissinger's writings on the Arab-Israel struggle, I found this book a wonderful counterpoint to the cold war outlook on Mideast politics taken by so many American administrations. I would compare it to David Shipler's perspective in his book on Arab and Jew; Wounded Spirits in a Promised Land. Perhaps with the end of the cold war, Mr. Viorst's perspective on the Arab-Israeli struggle will begin to find more resonance in the capitols of the western world. I would highly recommend this book to any serious student of Mid-East politics and history. In a time when we are fighting a battle against Osama bin Laden, Mr. Viorst illuminates the reasons why American policy in the Middle East may have, purposefully or inadvertently, helped to inflame so many Arabs while bringing no lasting peace to the region.He also does an excellent job, through the political history of Israel since its inception, sorting out the movements, Ashkenazi and Sephardi, Zionist and Revisionist, etc. that have pushed and pulled Israel in conflicting directions over the past 50 years.

There are a lot of excellent situational examples of how to understand a problem, diagnose what to do appropriately to the size of the project, and resolve it. As noted by other reviewers, though, this shouldn't be taken as a book that contains a sequence of steps needed to run a successful project.My favorite explicit lesson was on underpromising and overdelivering. The authors point out that while that's a great approach, never use it as an excuse to sandbag your schedule or add more features that the client didn't necessarily ask for. Overdelivering should only come in the form of early or cheaper than expected delivery of the agreed-upon solution. I couldn't agree more.There was also a great implicit lesson buried in each of the lessons that wasn't called out explicitly and which at least one of the other reviewers failed to pick up on - the importance of developing a good rapport with project managers and members. In each of the lessons, the authors spend valuable book space describing fictional details and conversations tangential to the lessons at hand. However, I've found that to be an important part of conversations in all aspects of project management, as it's easier to have hard discussions about work-related problems when you've made it clear that you have empathy for them as a person and that any work-releated issues are not an attack on them."},{"Title":"Lessons in Project Management","review":"This is not your typical project management book.

Go see for yourself."},{"Title":"Lessons in Project Management","review":"Lessons in Project Management, 2nd Edition, Tom Mochal & Jeff Mochal. Apress 2011.Project Management is defined in the text as referring to the \\"definition, planning and subsequent management, control and conclusion of a project\\". In the business world, it is the role of the Project Manager to co-ordinate the operations of their team and to solve any problems or issues as they arise in an organisation.The Second Edition of this title represents 30 years of experience and is made up of a series of 50 bite-sized stories and lessons, all of which have been updated, edited and revised to some extent since the original publication. The book is based around the \\"Ten-Step Project Management Process\\" and there is a companion web site, which readers can access.In the book the reader joins Project Management Advisor, Tom, in January at the fictitious Mega Manufacturing organisation in Dickens, Illinois. The snow is falling as Tom sets out to work and his first meeting with Jerry Ackerman who works in the Information Infrastructure Department. The first story is set out in the format of following stories and covers two pages in length.Lessons follow the narrative and are typically 2-4 pages long. The approach is both highly informative and interesting, but at the same time providing insight and practical advice. Each of the stories allow the reader a wonderful introduction to the lives of Mega Manufacturing's employees and there is an appropriate amount of humour throughout the 50 stories. At the beginning of each story the characters exchange a little small talk and banter with Tom, before moving on to discuss the more serious matter of any problems that they may be experiencing in relation to managing their company projects. In each lesson Tom is very willing to share his wisdom and knowledge both with the employee and the reader.The characters that Tom introduces us to include a diverse range of people, many of whom appear more than once in the book. We are also invited to witness the various seasonal celebrations at Mega Manufacturing throughout the year such as New Year, Valentines Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas.The main changes to the Second Edition are lessons 8,13 and 30. There are also some minor changes to the remainder of the title, especially chapters 6, 43, 44, 46, 47 and 49. Other changes to the new edition include the editing out of the \\"Contents by Story\\", the \\"Story & Lesson Chronology\\" and the \\"Cross Reference of Project Management Processes and Lessons\\". \\"The Appendix of Project Management Templates\\" has also been edited out.The 2nd Edition of the book features a new front cover and the lesson text is now left aligned rather than justified, as was the case in the first edition. The general design of the printed pages is also much improved.What I did notice about the second edition was that some of the Project Management Terminology had been revised and updated, especially for this 2011 release. For example the \\"Project Definition\\" is now the \\"Project Charter\\" and the \\"Project Workplan\\" is now the \\"Project Schedule\\". Many of the Chapter titles have also been modified and improved upon in order to more succinctly describe the lesson contents.Other relevant titles from Apress include: \\"No-Drama Project Management\\" (Bart Gerardi), \\"Painless Project Management with FogBugz\\", Second Edition (Mike Gunderloy), and \\"Pro-Project Management with Sharepoint 2010\\" (Mark Collins).In my opinion \\"Lesson's in Project Management\\" is a great read and it even motivated and inspired me to visit my local University library to seek further knowledge and future reading on the subject. Whilst many Project Management titles can be a little dry and lacking in humour, this title left me wanting to read it again to consolidate my knowledge and learning.No prior knowledge is assumed and the book is ideal for Clients, Functional Managers, Managers of Project Managers, Project Managers, Students and Team Members.The Author's have made an excellent job of this new second edition and I hope that one day they may release another title. Until then I look forward to putting in to practice the lessons that I have been taught via Tom, the Project Management Advisor at Mega Manufacturing."},{"Title":"Lessons in Project Management","review":"I agree with the previous review that there are many implicit lessons to be learned--such as creating a rapport with the people you work with. Most projects fail because of communication--or lack there of--not technical issues.

Melanie's thoughtless husband has died and left her without advice on how to marry off their lovely but feather-brained daughter, Sara. After receiving a plea for help, Lillian Vernon and her sharp-tongued aunt visit to lend a hand. At the same time, the local political seat is up for elections, and so begins a merry race to get the best man. When the Whig party whip shows up to take the election in hand, he finds himself hampered at every turn by the lovely but dim Sara, and intrigued more each day by the intelligence and wit of Miss Vernon. Soon, they are collaborating on campaign ideas, clever speeches, and a delightful flirtation... Will their budding romance survive the rigors of a most underhanded political race?"},{"Title":"Sweet and Twenty","review":"Synopsis:When the unexpected death of Sir Gerald Monteith placed his wife Melanie and daughter Sara in financial trouble, their only hope was to quickly find a husband for Sara. They thought it would be easy, for she was as beautiful as could be. They hoped her beauty would make up for her lack of brains. The problem was, they didn't know how to look for a man.Then Aunt Martha and cousin Lillian swept into town and took over the search. Lillian, too, was available for marriage. Soon the crafty Aunt Martha discovered that the handsome and wealthy Anthony Fellows was running for Parliament.None of them knew a Tory from a Whig. But that didn't stop Aunt Martha. Suddenly, the ladies were involved in a spirited campaign. With so many men around campaigning, they reasoned, husbands could not be far away ....My Review:a clever, biting satire of the upper class and politics. The heroine, Lillian, is a smart, though penniless lady who is taken by her matchmaking Aunt to the country, as the Aunt is also matchmaking for her niece, who is, along with her mother, two pretty airheads.When the Aunt finds that a wealthy, eligible neighbor is running for office as a Whig, she makes the ladies out to be more avid political followers than they really are. There begins a madcap farce, and the satirical machinations of the author.The hero,Matthew Hudson, is the \\"whipper-in\\" the Whig party has sent down to help the candidate, Fellowes, who is pretty much as much a moron as the niece and mother. They were all so stupid, it was in fact sometimes hard to read their dialog as it was cringeworthy in it's stupidity.The book needed more romance, hence the 3.5 stars, but would still be a unusual change of pace for most Regency fans.3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Sweet and Twenty","review":"This story started out very slowly for me. However, once I caught on with the plot and different characterizations then the whole book started to take off. It was so funny, which is writer's usual format, and this time she was poking fun at some idiots running for office (which we could still see in our present day political arena). What I liked and admired was Ms. Smith's abilities spanned from wonderful sense of humor, to fluent language skills, to understanding of art and history. But in this book, she added one more accomplishment: political strategist. Reading this story was like reading a behind the scene of some political campaigning but with a mixed feeling of laughing at the candidates and sense of sorrow for the constituents.I liked both hero and heroine a lot, they were intelligent and sensible. I also think all the sub-characters were very well portrayed--even though they were somewhat exaggerated."},{"Title":"Sweet and Twenty","review":"I very much enjoy reading Joan Smith Regencies. Occasionally, one of her many books just falls below the mark. For an author who was able to write 4 to 6 books a year, I am surprised that this doesn't happen more often. The story drags because the character development is more shallow in this novel than in most of her others. I think she was in a hurry to meet a publishing deadline or something. I might not finish this one. Just not one of her best."},{"Title":"The Apocalypse: In the Teachings of Ancient Christianity","review":"_The Apocalypse: In the Teachings of Ancient Christianity_ is Fr. Seraphim Rose's translation of Archbishop Averky's patristic commentary on the controversial New Testament book. The introduction examines the history of the interpretation of the Apocalypse. It is an allegorical book that is based on Old Testament symbolism which mystically represent events that will happen at the end of time before the Second Coming of Christ. The visions of St. John the Theologian on Patmos do not follow any chronological pattern and many speak of the same event using different symbolism. The Apocalypse shares certain similar characteristics with St. John's Gospel and his three letters, which include mention of the spirit of the Antichrist and Christ as the Lamb of God. The heresy of Chiliasm, which is the belief in a literal thousand-year reign of Christ on earth, is refuted. The world will only get worse and worse, and the Antichrist, the Beast arising out of the multitudes of the people of the world, will pretend to &quot;save&quot; the world with a multitude of false, contrived miracles. He will commit blasphemy against the Christ and mock Him by rebuilding the Temple in Jerusalem as a world center of religions. The end will come when Christ comes in Glory to judge the living and the dead. Averky draws heavily from an early Father, St. Andrew, who wrote a commentary on the Apocalypse, as well as adding his insightful comments to the text. An appendix features an essay discussing the resistance toward the ecumenical movement. The &quot;politically correct&quot; Church moves toward becoming one amalgamated body devoid of original Christian faith. Countering this are the conservative elements within all the different denominations that do not want to see any changes to traditional Christian doctrine. In their own way they are forming a true Church which will remain faithful to Christ in the last days, not following the spirit of this age."},{"Title":"The Apocalypse: In the Teachings of Ancient Christianity","review":"There is a sea of confusion about the book of Revelation, and the subject of the \\"end times\\" in general. This book does not purport to bring perfect clarity to the confusion. What it does do is offer commentary based on what the early Christians themselves, and Christians through the centuries, have said about these subjects. This can sometimes mean that you get disjointed, and even contradictory, testimony. However, it also means that you get something that is grounded in history, and you get to see what Christians from all eras believed, not just today's supposed experts expounding on theories that are hardly a couple hundred years old. This is not to say that current events are ignored in this book, but only that because of it's historical perspective, today's current events can be seen from a more detached and objective vantage point.Translations of texts has been one of Fr. Seraphim Rose's best contributions to English-speaking Orthodoxy, and we are indebted to him for this translation (as well as his find introduction concerning the author). Some (across jurisdictional lines) believe Archbp. Averky to have been a saint, though only time will tell on that matter. Whatever the case, His Grace has provided a fine help in this effort in helping us to understand how complex and profound the events described in Revelation really are.After my experience with a certain Protestant group, with it's historically anachronistic claims and absurd speculations, I was very much against reading any type of eschatological book. The subject simply turned me off, for lack of a better phrase. Still, I knew that the subject was important, so I decided to read this book. I was pleasantly suprised by how much I enjoyed it, and how much I was glad to have put my ill feelings for the subject behind me. Perhaps others are cautious about this subject; perhaps the string of popular rapture or fictional type literature has made the subject seem like one to be avoided. If so, I would still suggest giving this book a chance. This book is the exact opposite of most of the popular end times books out today. It doesn't have all the answers, but it does ask the right questions; whereas most of the books out today claim to have answers that they don't have, but proceed to ask the wrong questions (ie. they ask questions they think they have an answer to).This book goes through Genesis verse by verse as a commentary. It was written by a 20th century Orthodox Archbishop, but it takes into account nearly 20 centuries of Christian thought, quoting Christians throughout the centuries often. If Archbp. Averky doesn't know the answer to something, the author might speculate briefly, but he doesn't try to force theories onto you or ramble on for pages about them. He is more concerned with asking the right questions, and having the right information, so that we can make the best choices as Christians."},{"Title":"The Apocalypse: In the Teachings of Ancient Christianity","review":"A terrific book on the REVELATION of Saint John, It puts false teachings of today in perspective. Expecially the miss-interpreted time of the RAPTURE and the millenium rule of Christ on earth.A great soul pleaser to know what awaits us at the ends of our times, and a wonderful heart soother of the knowledge of the Eternal life here after with Christ.A MUST READ for all Christians whose eyes are closed or who are wearing rose colored glasses that are pre-trib or millenianist, expecially the ones that believe and are awaiting for the pre-trib RAPTURE! WAKE UP and smell the FAITH."},{"Title":"The Apocalypse: In the Teachings of Ancient Christianity","review":"In the avalanche of commentaries on the end times that seek novel and unique perspectives, it is a refreshing change to see one that sees the future events through the eyes of Christians of the past. Archbishop Averky Taushev of the Russian Orthodox Church Outsided Russia wrote The Apocalypse In the Teachings of Ancient Christianity as a commentary on the Bible's last and most mysterious book to give a grounding to Orthodox believers on the importance of the Second Coming while avoiding the sensationalism that has long accompanied speculative works on the topic. This book was ably translated by Fr. Seraphim Rose who passes on the wisdom of this important work to English speaking audiences.The importance of this work is its complete rootedness within the patristic tradition that forms the essence of Orthdox theology. Passages of the text of the Apocalypse of St. John (the Book of Revelation) are given with comments presenting the views of one or more opinions that have roots in the patristic synthesis. The rich symbolism of the book is brought back to the context of the early Church which understood it best and made clear with the penetrating analysis of the holy Christians of past centuries passed on faithfully by the Archbishop. Each chapter of the book corresponds to a chapter of the Biblical text and each chapter ends with a valuable look at parallels elsewhere in Holy Scripture that provide insight from God's Word to the proper context of the passages.The beauty of the commentary is how clearly the text is explained with no need for strained attempts at paralleling first century symbolism to contemporary events. It is acknowledged throughout that the Lord could return at any time and the focus is on being spiritually prepared rather than engaging in fruitless decoding sessions to set dates. The book ends with three useful and related appendices that give aspects of the eschatalogical beliefs within the tradition of Russian Orthodox thinking.Those who desire new and sensational predictions of the coming apocalypse will find little of the fireworks needed to hold their interest. However, for those interested in a serious and historically rooted look at this often misunderstood book of the Bible, Archbishop Averky Taushev's The Apocalypse In the Teachings of Ancient Christianity is a welcome change from the silliness of the prophecy pundits."},{"Title":"The Apocalypse: In the Teachings of Ancient Christianity","review":"In a nutshell - it was the best book on Revelation I have ever read.Yeah. It was that good.Why?Well, for starters the book wasn't about trying to map out the \\"end times\\", find out what everything John means and how it plays together in the 21st century. Instead, the commentary was written with the knowledge that Revelation is a book of mysteries:\\"The deep things bound up with the beginning and end of all things, the ultimate purpose of the world and man, the opening of the eternal Kingdom of Heaven; and so we must read it with fear of God, and with a humble distrust of our own wisdom.Keeping with this heart, Archbishop Taushev takes the reader through a journey of Revelation; highlighting the Glory of God and His triumph over evil. It is a book that will leave you encouraged and strengthened - instead of confused about how it all \\"works.\\"God is in control. He gave St. John the vision of Revelation not to confuse or to trouble His people. But to encourage and uplift them in their times of trouble - that is what the Orthodox view of the end times does; and what the Protestant view often lacks.Another thing I love about this commentary is Archbishop Taushev's use of the Church Fathers. For example, a lot of the material in the book is from St. Andrew of Caesarea commentary on Revelation written in the 5th Century - which is one of the best books about Revelation written by the Ancient Fathers.In addition to seeing what the Church Fathers had to say about Revelation, Archbishop Taushev quotes passages from the Old and New Testament relating to the subject at hand. He does this in a way that I have not seen before - as in he actually quotes entire passages instead of just referencing verses or taking out small portions. This allows the reader to see what is happening and make their own choices.As I type this review, I wish I could take the time and quote pages of The Apocalypse so you all could see the difference... yet that is not possible for several reasons.... Sigh.I guess I shall end with this simple statement:When it comes to the Second Coming of Christ, the Eastern Orthodox Church has the heart of God more then us Protestants."},{"Title":"The Apocalypse: In the Teachings of Ancient Christianity","review":"How could I possible like this book? Pages 64 through 97 were missing from the book. When I asked Amazon they never responded to my request for a another and complete copy. As a whole book this might be a valuable read."},{"Title":"The Apocalypse: In the Teachings of Ancient Christianity","review":"This book is an interpretation of the Apocalypse of John (Book of Revelation) made by an old Bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church. As an evangelical christian I can tell you that you may find other books about the Revelation more interesting, specially dealing with the last days events, the tribulation, the rapture of the Church. None of this you will find in this book. I will highly recommend the Prophecy Study Bible if you are interested in the matter of escathology, or the study of the last events that will happen as prophesized in the Holy Scriptures. This poor Bishop don't even think of the Rapture of the Church. You need a better reading. This is a poor exposition of the Biblical Truth.I hioghly recommend:The Feasts Of The Lord God's Prophetic Calendar From Calvary To The KingdomNew Spirit-Filled Life Bible: Kingdom Equipping Through the Power of the Word (Bible Nkjv)The Theology of the Book of Revelation (New Testament Theology)"},{"Title":"Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York","review":"Peiss begins her argument by explaining the relationship of industrial capitalism to wage labor in creating class-conscious leisure arenas, literally recalling Roy Rosenzweig's study. Peiss's distinction lies in &quot;this conception of leisure did not develop historically in the same way for both sexes.&quot; (Peiss, 4). Sexual division ultimately shaped and confined women's leisure to their homes. Thus, the typical wage-earning females in pursuit of leisure were young and single. Their youth and marriage status turned their attentions from the leisurely pursuits of Rosenzweig's working men but to dance halls, amusement parks, and movie theatres.The emerging youth-oriented forms of recreation could not be ignored by the commercial industry, which viewed female participation as lucrative. In addition, these commercialized forms of amusement fostered a heterosocial culture that eventually brought new meanings and restriction to same-sex gender friendships. Rather than stand by and chronicle these changes in leisure for working-class women, Peiss makes the bold argument that these women were actual agents in shaping the nature of their leisure, and Peiss proves again and again to be correct. Even more impressive is her claim that the majority of these women were immigrants or second-generation immigrants (Peiss, 56-88). In examining the actual amusements of working-class women--dance halls, excursions, amusement parks, and the movies, Peiss illustrates vividly how women had a place in the architecture of their own leisure.It is Peiss's conclusion that women's suffrage and the growth of women in the public sphere &quot;infectiously appealed to other middle-class women who were less politicized. Dancing sensual dances, attending cabarets and nightclubs, living as &quot;bachelor girls&quot; in apartment houses, these women expressed a new-found sense of freedom and possibility.&quot; (Peiss, 185). Interestingly, the phenomena of entertainment for working-class women eventually made its way to the middle-class, though the &quot;cheap&quot; amusements deliberately shed their vulgarity for the more formal tastes of the middle-class. Although the adventures of the single working-class woman often ceased with marriage, their new leisure pursuits would only grow with consumerism."},{"Title":"Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York","review":"In her book, GILDED CITY, M.H. Dunlop chronicled the execesses and outrages of upper class New Yorkers (especially the women of the uppermost uppers) at the turn of the 20th century. While hiding behind the facade that the lavish parties and balls they threw and the exorbitant clothes they had tailored for themselves were giving jobs to the lower classes, their effect was to shamelessly display their wealth and, ultimately, enrage a lower class that was finding the economy and job market less and less bearable. Peiss' style is scholarly yet without the distancing effect that that form of writing usually exhibits in less skilled hands. Her knowledge and passion for the subject are easily identifiable in this wonderful book.Kathy Peiss' CHEAP AMUSEMENTS, for me, is the flipside of the situation. The working women of New York, especially immigrant women, needed some way to spend what little leisure time they had with the little discretionary spending they had. Rather than simply identifying the spots like some old guidebook, Peiss explores each type of simple pleasure ground available to the girls, and how and why they became so popular. On a second level, the book examines the social and sometimes political consequences of this class of working women--bachelorettes--and their spending habits."},{"Title":"Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York","review":"Peiss's work reveals in detail the social implications of young, middle class women's free time in turn-of-the century New York. Based on diaries and reports from the time, Peiss delivers with impact a convincing and highly interesting discussion on how just a few extra hours, a few days out of the week eroded American Victorianism. She writes with authority while keeping her writing very readable."},{"Title":"Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York","review":"New York City at the turn of the twentieth century was a landscape troubled by class and ethnic tension--there were mansions on Fifth Avenue and tenement houses of Italian, Irish, and German immigrants along the Lower East Side of Manhattan. In Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York, Kathy Peiss analyzes working-class women's free time and leisure. She recounts how Victorian sexual mores and ethnic traditions that restricted women's presence in the public sphere were replaced by a commercialized culture with more modern entertainments: dance halls and clubs, early movie theaters, and summer resorts with amusement parks and shoreline hotels. Examining these social spaces as representative of gender relations, Peiss asserts that young working women viewed these free time pursuits as expressions of autonomy and excitement, but were also exploited by entrepreneurs of the entertainment industry and by men who perceived financial dependency.The book does offer insight into the gendered nature of capitalist work patterns. The residual nineteenth-century domestic ideal clashed with women's increasing participation in the workforce, rendering their desire for leisure outside the home problematic to their parents. Ultimately Peiss' work succeeds in its depiction of working class leisure culture, reconstructing working women's attitudes toward living arrangements, fashion, romantic relationships, and elaborate kinship and social networks. To escape the Victorian constraints of their mothers' generation, these young wage-earners embraced a nascent entertainment culture of dance halls, amusement parks, and movies, which enforced sexual objectification even as it offered ostensible freedom. Peiss' New York is less a depiction of a bygone era than an explication of a time whose consumer attractions and dangers mirror our own. But while Peiss addresses the issue of cultural transmission, the work raises questions regarding geographical relationships that it does not answer. At several points, I was left asking: Were these pursuits typical of other regions or distinctive features of New York's cultural scene? Did these trends originate in New York, then spread throughout the nation?"},{"Title":"Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York","review":"Better and more interesting than you would think.

McLaren's ideas in this installment of the trilogy are excellent, shying away from any kind of doctrinal statement but instead placing ideas and thoughts within the wider meta-narrative of Hebrew religion, Judaism, and Christianity. The best move this book makes is placing sexuality, perhaps THE most overlooked part of the human experience in evangelical culture and American culture as a whole, within the framework of creation. McLaren is absolutely right in pointing out that any debate on origins shouldn't start with creation vs. evolution, but should start with sexuality. McLaren's ideas have always been more conversational, and this book follows in that stance of critiquing rational minded religion.So, why three stars? To put it as nicely as I can, McLaren's prose is underwhelming, his characters are one dimensional, and the plot of this book would have been better written by a team of writers from \\"General Hospital.\\" Some might disagree with me and would say that McLaren's book is more conversational theology than novel, but I would counter that it would have been better as a strictly conversational theology book and not a novel.But, its hard to argue with McLaren's intentions and this book is a welcome addition to his end of the theological conversation."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"This book, of which this is the second in a trilogy, comes as a huge relief to many of us who thought we were the only ones asking these questions.

The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2003). 203 pages.Review by Darren CronshawDr Kerry Ellison is an Australian scientist working at the Charles Darwin Research Centre in the Galapagos Islands. A Uniting Church minister's child by birth, eager youth group member by upbringing, staunch defender of seven-day Creation through a youth pastor's urging, keen science researcher at university and cynic who turned her back on faith when told she had to choose between God's wisdom or man's - creation or evolution.Kerry's life is turned upside down and around about, however, after two concurrent events. One, she discovers a relapse of cancer. Two, she meets Neo, an ex-pastor and ex-science teacher who is tour-guiding on the Islands. Their conversations spread over treks searching for turtles to Sunday night informal \\"church\\" on board Neo's La Adventura, from hospital rooms in America to Neo's old friend Dan's house. They grapple with the nature of faith, doubt, science, environmental crisis, evolution, atonement, cancer, heaven, prayer, suffering and death. Kerry is amazed Neo can appreciate science and believe Christianity. Her imagination is captured by the story of the world and God and Jesus that Neo unravels.Neo describes the narrative of the Bible in seven stages; creation, crisis, calling, conversation, Christ, church and consummation. This story is the story we all find ourselves in. It begins with the awe-inspiring account of the universe created out of nothing, order arising out of chaos, the story of the development, emergence or evolution of the world in Genesis. The story tells us that we are not designed to be alone and that we are made not to exploit the world but to live and give life creatively, as apprentices to God. Unfortunately, people have plunged the world into crisis through our selfishness and arrogance, lust and greed. In our desire to live life independently we have lost connection to God.So God intervened and called and blessed a family to be instrumental in blessing others. God entered into conversation with them for generations. Through priests, prophets, poets and philosophers, God and humanity spoke and listened to one another. The family, which became a nation, grew to know God not just as Creator but as guide, companion and friend. They often drifted away, but would repent and return to God's agenda. Jesus Christ came through this family, and by his life, death and resurrection profoundly demonstrated the love and triumph of God. He offers to be saviour of our souls after this life but also invites us to join a revolution and let him be saviour of the world and bringer of truth and goodness in this life.Those whose hearts were won over to Jesus banded together in community, passionately devoting themselves to live differently in ways that would help the world become all God dreamed for it. Looking ahead in hope we see God welcoming and inviting us into recreation, salvaging all that is good in our lives and our world. (esp. pp. 175-176)Neo and Kerry realise that discovering our place in the story is both inspiring and a little scary. Yet Neo's words assert the importance of grappling with these larger issues:If we're going to do the courageous thing now, as the early church leaders did in their moment, as the Reformers did in their moment, then we need to engage the best thinking and the toughest questions of our culture, with no less courage, because it's no less dangerous or difficult. And it's no less necessary either, if we're going to be faithful to Jesus and his teaching and his mission. And so we need to reenter and reengage the world, this world, and we need to rediscover our story here in this evol---... this emerging universe, not in some static spiritual world of concepts behind or above this one. (p.164)The characters and setting are perfect to explore issues of science and faith. Neo explains to Kerry his deeply held faith and his wonder at Creation, and offers historical perspectives on how the church has related to science. There was no objection from the church about Ptolemy's view of the earth at the centre of the universe surrounded by a range of spheres ascending to God in heaven. But Copernicus and Galileo used telescopes to discover and explain the round earth revolved around the sun, and the church could not cope. With urging from the Inquisition, Galileo hung up his telescope. But instead he picked up mechanics and physics and showed how the world could be explained with physical laws.Monumentally adding to that hole in the medieval worldview, Darwin said mechanics and time explains not only orbits and chemical reactions but life, including human life. What was there left for God to do? Instead of seeing life and everything descending from God above, science was looking down at the atoms and molecules - meaningless, impersonal forces that apparently did not need God to explain the world. Kerry's youth pastor opposed any hint of evolution. Neo saw evolution as a brilliant theory, albeit with its share of bugs, but based on honest observations about how God may have made the universe to become itself.Brian McLaren is the main conversation partner in Emergent, the network of emerging church practitioners and thinkers who are reassessing the shape of church and theology for a postmodern, post-Christendom, post-Darwin world. The Story We Find Ourselves In is the middle of McLaren's trilogy where he uses this narrative genre that he calls creative non-fiction or philosophical dialogue. The prequel, A New Kind of Christian: A Tale of Two Friends on a Spiritual Journey (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2001), focuses on postmodernity itself and the new kind of Christian and new ways of doing church that McLaren urges. The sequel, The Last Word and the Word After That (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2005), explores death, hell, judgment and the mercy of God. The Story We Find Ourselves In imaginatively tells the story of the gospel in the context of emerging postmodern culture.The book is encouraging for Christians to be able to reimagine their story in a bigger context and beyond modern trappings and false dichotomies, especially science versus faith. It is an accessible and inviting read for \\"spiritual but not religious\\" people who may be intrigued by how life looks in the context of this adventurous story.Published in St Mark's Review, No. 211 (February 2010), pp.97-100."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"The ongoing conversation begun between Neo and Dan continues in this second installment with the additional character of a young lady battling cancer adding fuel to the mix. A great explanation of the truth of Gospel for folks in the 21st century who have been inundated with hints that the story of Christ is no longer relevant to our increasingly \\"educated\\" generation (read: cynical). A great conversation piece to explain in modern terms the timeless truths of the Bible and more particularly the story of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"I'm surprised to see so many people critique the genre of this book. In my opinion, they have missed the point! Comments about any lack of theological substance would indicate a mode of thinking still permeating Christian thought. As if true biblical theology could be discussed outside of community and conversation, these types of comments indicate that many people are still looking for a definition of God and his people apart from \\"the story we find ourselves in.\\"This book was a delightful treat, giving human qualities back to the discussion of God and his people. The genre of first person narrative reminds us that our inquiries into this subject matter are in fact reflections on our own personal experiences. Furthermore, if we can't find a forum in which to discuss God that includes the contexts of hospital rooms, airports, or watching turtles have sex :-) (just read the book)!!!! I believe that we have failed to adequately relate our theologies to our truly human condition."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"Having read and enjoyed A New Kind of Christian, I decided to turn to the second book in the series which I received as a Christmas gift (along with the third book which I have recently started reading). So, I took some time to read The Story We Find Ourselves In.On the whole, I found this book to be somewhat less satisfying than the first. In it, McLaren attempts to redefine Christianity in terms of narrative rather than theology. This is a good thing, especially since most of the Bible is closer to narrative than theology anyway. And, as far as providing a good summary of the Christian story of history, McLaren was pretty accurate in my view.On the other hand, McLaren's fiction writing leaves much to be desired. Whenever he's focusing on the conversations about ideas, it's all very good. And, conversation is a good way to present the ideas that he wants to present and also how they interact with each other. But, he interrupts the good flow of the conversation with fiction writing. But he's not a fiction writer (as he admits in the introduction). So, while one of the major character's struggle with cancer would be a touching story, I found the characters to be so unlike real people that I had a hard time taking them or their problems seriously.Also, as others have noted, this book lacks conflict. While the first book was a story about how modernism and post-modernism are in conflict in our modern age, and what they each stand for and such, this book's main idea is simply a retelling of Christian history. He does mention that not everyone agrees with the theistic evolutionist viewpoint which the \\"Socrates\\" character advocates. But, there is no conversation between these conflicting viewpoints. The closest we come to anything like that is when different theories of atonement are listed. But, they aren't allowed to interact with each other as one would expect from a conversation. Rather, it was a Theology 101 list, with very little accompanying analysis.Despite its weaknesses, I liked this book. It was easy to read and did provide some interesting information.If you're looking for a book with some random information about Christianity and a pretty good summary of the Christian story, this is the book for you.If you're looking for a book that is directly practical, deeply theological, or just good fiction, look somewhere else."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"I could not put this book down.&quot;The Story We Find Ourselves In&quot; might be best approached as a spiritual adventure where readers are invited to imagine God in new ways that restore all that is beautiful, revolutionary and compelling about the Bible story we think we know so well. Some may be put off by the finer points of theology (and science) explored here through McLaren's fictional characters, but I think that would be missing the point. This is a book to *expand* the imagination, to broaden our ideas about God and to deepen our hope that we can have a place in the mystery of who God is...for the good of our world.Do not miss this book. It is a treasure, a tiny glimpse of how beautiful the story of our life in God can be."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"What McLaren set out to do and what he did are different things.What he set out to do was to tell an outline of the scriptural story in fictional dialogues through an outline of C's: creation, crisis, calling, conversation, Christ, community, and consummation. It is essentially a long sermon or non-fiction text in the mouths of three people.What he ended up doing was forcing content into two-dimensional characters and minimal settings. The characters are cardboard cut-outs with holes where their mouths should be, and McLaren runs back and forth between the three spewing niceties from each. To make matters worse, the characters continually stroke one another with comments like \\"good point\\" and \\"great insight,\\" which becomes all the more hard to swallow when you realize it's McLaren patting himself on the back. Forced, sermonic dialogue is a painful kind of literature. In fact, there are two points at which one of the characters simply says, \\"Here's the sermon I preached that day,\\" and McLaren goes from sermonic dialogue to photocopied manuscripts he used in his church.McLaren receives moderate criticism for having \\"weak\\" or liberalized theology. I think this is probably overblown. McLaren is just a small voice trapped in his time; there's no novel heresy here. McLaren is reviving from traditional, theological, impersonal churches that are not shaped so much by an intentional philosophy or ecclesiology as by a generation of non-emotive leaders. His solution is a church that focuses on love and good feelings without getting caught up in the theological controversies of the day. But there is no alternative to the controversies here, just avoidance. He shows as much in the characters who are baptized after the confession, \\"I don't know about all of these doctrines\\" (p. 112), who replace Jesus' \\"kingdom\\" with a \\"revolution\\" (p. 116), and who prefer to refer to Jesus as \\"master\\" if it means \\"expert\\" rather than \\"ruler\\" (p. 121). There's no explanation as to why we should hold to all the Jesus talk anyway if we get to intentionally change the plain, 1st century sense of \\"kurios\\" or change Jesus' metaphors into stuff that X-gen types will think is cool.Ultimately, McLaren is coming out of one of these stodgy, old, legalistic traditions and saying little more than, \\"It can be so much more appealing than this.\\" But as far as I can tell from the younger generation, the intended audience, his most common response will not be \\"aha!\\" but \\"duh.\\""},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"In part 2 of the this series we find the characters coming to the realization of no boundaries, unexpected discoveries, and love for all of creation (not just the human creation). What the author brings forth for all who read is not a pointless liberal agenda, or leftist mentality, but rather a perspective of the truth that transcends categories. It is a story about the inclusive rescue by God for all creation, our role in that rescue, and the role of others past, present and future. This book- and series- has challenged some of my earlier notions and categories and is bringing about an emergence of a new perspective. I am gratfeul to the author for writing this book."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian by Brian McLaren is the sequel to A New Kind of Christian. I enjoyed the first book very much. It opened my eyes to the idea of a post-modern church and how to look at the world in a much bigger way. In this book, the conversation between Neo and Dan continues as Neo's friend Kerry dies from cancer. Neo explains the \\"story\\" of the Bible to Kerry in a new way, helping her find peace before the end. While McLaren makes some good points during the book, I couldn't help but be annoyed at how everyone who listened to Neo viewed his opinions as almost sacred or divine. Everyone who listens to him is shocked and awed at his wisdom. He props up evolution, gives an unusual view of Heaven, and refuses to discuss the concept of Hell. Neo talks some ideas to death, but others he dances around without giving answers that would commit him to an opinion and possibly chase his listeners away. I'm just not sure how I feel after reading this book. I don't feel that the inclusion of Kerry was necessary, and the story of her wasting away seemed a bit forced. The book did not change my mind or open it the way the first one did. I guess I'm a little disappointed that Neo dismisses anyone who doesn't believe in evolution or the way he does. His tolerance seems limited to those who think the way he does, and those who don't, aren't as intelligent."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"I truly loved the first book in this trilogy by McLaren, A New Kind of Christian, the characters were new, fresh, exploring a relationship and a kind of faith. However in this follow-up book these interesting developing characters that I had come to love in the first book and done all their character developing and left the second book fairly flat, there was no more growing with Pastor Dan or with Neo, they had already been stretched to the limit.I had a hard time picking up this book, mainly because I wasn't learing anything new or interesting about the characters, and secondly because it seemed like McLaren focused more on the storyline and less on theology. I learned less in this book, which was a big dissapointment.Also, unlike A New Kind of Christian, The Story We Find Ourselves In is NOT a stand-alone book. It is full of inside jokes and background that would require one to read the first book to fully understand what was going on.NOTE: Included at the end of this book is a study guide that would have been optimal for gathering theology and philosophy from the book, I just didn't discover it until I was finished reading. If your work on the study guide coincided with your reading of the book, I imagine you would have an even more enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"This, the second book in McLaren's \\"New Kind of Christian\\" trilogy is the most satisfying on some levels. It works better than volumes I and III as story, as fiction. But, too, it is very stirring theologically, a brave attempt at rethinking the gospel in light of current scientific knowledge. What stays with me most, now that I've lain the book down, is its vision of heaven. A provocative yet comforting book. Not for everyone, yet God bless Brian McLaren from one who needed it."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"This is a great book for those who are interested in emerging christians and post modern ideas of Christianity.If you have postmodern people that you don't understand this book might shed some light onto their ideas and thought processes. Very engaging and interesting"},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"The second book in the New Kind of Christian Series, the author continues to weave the tale of Neo, Dan, family and friends. And as in the first book he continues to make you sit back and ask yourself, \\"why do I believe what I believe\\". At the same time he gives you the answer, and if your not missing the point, you will find this book making your faith in God stronger every chapter.You don't have to embrace everything in this story as the gospel truth, I don't think that is what the author is trying to do. He is trying to make you ask questions, and at the same time, gently giving you some answers to these questions.These questions and answers will probably take most Christians out of their comfort zone, since what our modern church teaches is not questioned very much and on the most part, blindly followed. Personally I think we need get back to the core of God's word, not man's interpretations and this book has a knack for doing that.As I said about the first book, buy one, buy two, give as gifts. Change is needed, the word needs to get out, and this story is a great way to do it."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"I read this on the recommendation of a good friend a little while back, and decided to give this as a gift this Christmas. After going through the reviews, though, I thought I needed to throw my voice into the ring as well.First, understand that this book is primarily a set of fictional dialogs, not a drama or action book by any means. Through the dialogs between the main characters, we are presented with an interesting and thought provoking alternative perspective on Christianity.Through this story (and his other stories as well), McLaren tells hard truths- about a church that is out of touch with modern society, a church that is so caught up in its orthodoxy and purity of doctrine (conservative or liberal) that it has largely forgotten its original purpose. This message is bound to raise the hackles of those in the establishment, and you can see this discomfort reflected in the negative reviews above.Which is fine, and I am guessing that this is what McLaren wanted in the first place. Modern America has lost the art of dialog and debate. Sure, you can turn on the TV and watch ranting people talk past each other, but that is not a dialog. True engagement with the possibility of disagreement is considered impolite and distasteful, and something to be avoided at all costs. So what we are left with is opposing positions (Christian and otherwise) isolating themselves in their own ideological sandbox and refusing to constructively engage the other side.McLaren is making an effort to start the missing dialog, and bridge the isolated ideologies, and he does so by presenting a new perspective on the Christian story... a \\"third way\\" that is perpendicular to the liberal/conservative axis. He never claims (either himself or through his characters) that this is the right story or the only story. But it is a story that makes you think and challenges each reader to explore further. (One way to explore, of course, is to engage with those of opposing perspectives... perhaps, just perhaps, there is a kernel of truth in their position as well.)Christianity was born as a rebellious movement with a focus on ditching the ceremony/dogma of Roman era Judaism and getting back to the basics- honoring God, serving each other, etc. In some ways, McLaren is simply asking us to go back to our roots. I, for one, have been enriched by that journey, and I suggest that you give it a go. This is as good a place as any to start."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"This is an excellent book.

The Story We Find Ourselves In, is a moving tale about Christians and non-Christians alike, struggling to understand how the gospel should be interpretted in our post-modern world.I could not put the book down, I read it in a day and a half. It caused me to question some aspects of my worldview, it caused me at times to be angry with the text, and it also moved me to tears in several sections. It is a story about a journey we all find ourselves on and it is definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"I realize I'm probably a little out of my element here, but I thought I'd comment anyways. I am an agnostic who reads many books on religion, particularly christianity, not because I'm \\"looking for something\\" by any means but simply because I find religion and people who believe fascinating. A Christian friend of mine lent me this book because he knows I'm intoreading this sort of thing. And lets just say I was not all that impressed, not because I disagree with anything that was presented exactly, but because for ideas that are supposed to be so new and exciting and \\"pushing the envelope\\", I found them to be pretty darn tame.As other reviewers here have mentioned, the storytelling leaves something to be desired, and boy does it ever. I got very irritated at everyone going ooh aahh over every single thing Neo said. A truly interesting book would include some kind of debate, some opposing ideas, if only to reinforce the ideas the author is trying to present. The only non-believers or sort-of-believers in the whole book are swayed by Neo's ideas without any fight at all. I kept wanting to jump in and give Neo a few of my own ideas, then at least an interesting discussion could have been had. Instead everyone just sort of agrees and that's that. When Kerry's son is about to arrive, I had my fingers crossed hoping that he would be gay or at the very least a bonafide atheist, just to give the book some spice and a bit of excitement. But alas, I was disappointed.If anything, this book did give me what I was hoping it would; a bit of insight into the Christian mind. I found it hilarious that the narrator was ashamed to be seen in a liquor store at 11 AM, or how he expressed his irritation every time the word evolution was mentioned. I found it kind of irritating that Glenn, the only non-believer in the whole book, is presented as a rather annoying and simpleminded dope who sleeps around and lacks social skills. The fact that he even refers to himself as a Pharisee after being wowed by Neo's ideas made me want to put the book down and never open it again. As for Neo's ideas, as I mentioned before, they are not all that amazing. The whole idea of evolution being able to co-exist with Christianity, the meaning given for the crucifixion, and speculation on what happens after you die were all quite interesting and I enjoyed them, but I wasn't floored by any of these ideas in the slightest. If you find this book mind-blowing then you should probably steer clear of your local humanist or skeptic chapter, us non-believers have some pretty wild and wacky ideas that would really make your head spin. If I were to mention one point in the book that did have me floored, it was when the narrator literally gets \\"fired\\" from his church for being too liberal. Too liberal??? \\"Wow\\" is all I can say about that..."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"Again I loved this series. If you are open to new presentations of Christianity but are not ready to question parts yet then read this book first. You cannot come away from this novel not either having been opened up to new expressions of faith or having your current beliefs strengthen. Either way your far better off."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"In the most unlikely of settings with the most unlikely people, NEO (see book 1) tells his imagined story of the universe and life, ending with a a very interesting preview of what Heaven might be like. (Some characters: terminal cancer PhD biologist/atheist and her hippy son, Jamaican ex-preacher-still-Christian PhD scientist and believer in evolution (NEO), a disenchanted preacher, and his family). The book centers around a long story by NEO , who is on vacation, that starts in Ecuador trying to explain how he can be a Christian and a Science teacher to a sceptical atheist biologist who is trying to save species. It continues and concludes in Maryland where NEO finally convinces her (with God's help, of course). Shortly before she dies of cancer she becomes a true believer and is baptised. It sounds pretty far fetched and terribly melodramatic the way I put it here, but actually, for me, it was a believable, fascinating continuation of the first book, \\"A New Kind of Christian\\", well worth 5 stars. I am going on to read the last of the trilogy, with great thanks to Brian McLaren for some beautiful insights and a touching narrative."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"After reading McLaren's first book, A New Kind of Christian, I knew that I had to continue on and ordered this book as well as the third book in the series. McLaren does an incredible job of drawing the reader in to really knowing and caring for all of the characters. I found myself identifying with many of them and, at times, had to stop reading for awhile to let the new thoughts settle in. The content was stimulating yet easy to consider and ponder because of the narrative/fictional style.I would advise readers to try to read it with an open mind. I thought this was every bit as good as his first book and will probably read it again and jot down notes.

McLaren gives voice to many who long for a vibrant faith, and a bigger story."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"I was urged to read this McLaren book by someone who was really excited about it, but it was disappointing to me personally. To begin with, I found the first-person story format tedious and punctuated all too frequently with unnecessary trivia (generally in parentheses) that seemed to only serve to make the story &quot;folksy&quot; - and superficial. It reads like an eigth-grader's diary. I often bogged down in the seemingly contrived conversations between Dan and Neo, but then would forge ahead again later, waiting eagerly for the wonderful thought-provoking new truths that had been promised. I gave up on it a few times, but eventually did go back and finish the book. Finally, by about page 100, I found some substance and was glad I finished reading it. If you are looking for more than light entertaining reading (listless at that), my advice would be to begin with Chapter 12! Then, if you are one who is still briared in &quot;Fundamental&quot; theology where your Christianity is composed primarily of &quot;Being Saved&quot; and escaping Hell, then you will find McLaren's post-modern views very enlightening and expanding. This is where today's Church is headed and you might was well grasp it now and get onboard. You will be glad you did. My own faith and ideologies, on the other hand, already embrace all of McLaren's &quot;New Kind of Christianity&quot; and beyond, so this book was &quot;ho-hum&quot; to me."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"Red flags started popping up for me early on in this book, even starting with the poor grammar of the title. Then, opening up the book, it commences with an e-mail from Neo (the postmodern Christian \\"guru\\") to his friend and \\"student\\" Dan, contrived with many unnecessary and irritating typos. Next, with the visit of an Australian woman, dying of cancer, who became acquainted with Neo, we find out what Neo has been doing during his extended time away. By way of explanation, the first book in the series touched briefly on Neo's belief in Darwin's theory of evolution. This book hits you right in the face with it, as Neo's adventures in the birthplace of Darwin's theory, the Galapagos Islands, and at the Charles Darwin Institute, no less, are presented in detail, including a rather graphic scene of two giant tortoises copulating. What fun!Personally, I have always questioned the theory of evolution, not just for religious reasons, but because it has never made a lot of sense to me. A certain amount of evolution does go on (microevolution), but a lot of the details of macroevolution are unconvincing to me. Basically, I'm an old-earth creationist, along the lines of Hugh Ross. Neo doesn't just accept the theory, he loves it. He calls it \\"brilliant\\", \\"important\\", and \\"one of God's greatest creations.\\" Even being aware of the holes in the theory and the challenges to it (getting in a little dig in at \\"Darwin's Black Box\\"), he ignores the problems. Why? Because his system of theology (oops, I mean the \\"Story\\"!) would suffer without it. See, creationism relies on too many miracles, and too many miracles makes for an unreal world, and after all, we live in the real world.As he unfolds the Story before various listeners, I started picking up on something that I'm unsure the author intended. Most of the characters in the book are totally in awe of Neo's teaching. Frankly, it's wearying reading of people's jaw-dropping amazement as Neo unfolds the Story before them. The one person on the island that rejects it is a conservative religious type (a Pharisee?), and, indeed, those who are already of the faith have a harder time than those previously hostile to the gospel. Later, in a discussion of various atonement theories of Jesus, Neo shares a very personal story of betrayal that affected him physically, much like...a crucifixion? Let's see, they were amazed at his teaching, he gets resistance from the religious establishment, he shares a theory of atonement from a personal betrayal...is Neo being set up as a new Jesus? What really bothers me about the whole thing is that this Story is coming from the pen and the mind of the book's author, as is the amazement of the listeners, so even if Neo isn't the Neo-Christ, the author seems to communicating that this is pretty brilliant stuff if he does say so himself.There are all kinds of other issues, like Christianity vs. other religions (all religion, at one point, is lumped together as part of man's God-given creativity), and there are unanswered questions lingering about salvation by faith or by works, but I'm sure we'll hear more about that in the third book of the promised trilogy. That, and, I fear, we may see Neo going through some resurrection and ascension to sit on the right hand of the Post-Modern God."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"Read 2 Timothy 4:3-5.Read Mclaren's book.Read 2 Timothy 4:3-5 again.The Word of God is eternal.

Once again, a fictional setting is used to provide the stage. In the preface to The Story We Find Ourselves In McLaren writes: \\"The more I have written about postmodernity (and so on), the more I have wanted to get to the point where it no longer needed to be written about so much. I wanted to start writing about the Christian gospel itself, from a vantage point within the emerging culture, without always having to defend the vantage point.\\" In this work, McLaren begins the process of describing the \\"new\\" ideas, theological frameworks and viewpoints that paint the backdrop for the unfolding drama we are living.The Galapagos Islands provide the setting for a discussion of creation and evolution and the origins of the universe. Once again, Neo is the prime expositor of the \\"new\\" ideas. In this case, his conversations with Kerry Ellison, a biologist working on the islands to study and preserve wildlife, allow Neo to unpack ideas about a Christian's concern and care for the planet.Other areas of discussion are the authenticity of miracles and Christ's work on the cross. Neo's leadership of a weekly gathering on the yacht, La Ventura, sounds like the kind of church that I would like to join. The unfolding relationship between Neo and Kerry mirrors Kerry's unfolding relationship with God.I liked the storytelling in Story a little better than the first volume. In New Kind of Christian I sometimes felt that the essay overpowered the story. In Story I think McLaren's skills as an author have given us a book that is as interesting for its plot as it is for its information.I have a big appetite for stories that tell of the beauty and mystery that moves people toward faith. And for that reason, I recommend The Story We Find Ourselves In. Be prepared to expand your ideas about the Story that God has written for each of our lives."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"It's interesting that the tone of some reviews of McLaren's work stands in bold relief compared to humility brought by McLaren to his works, and the humility that he insists upon from people who agree with him. There is alot in this book to engage as a reader, and thoughtful readers will refrain, as McLaren does, from wholesale endorsements or rejections of complex works such as this. In fact, the only basis for wholesale rejection is the rejection of storytelling, which McLaren clearly stands behind. So allow me to defend McLaren's craft of creative nonfiction below.Many writers in the postmodern Christian &quot;tradition&quot; call for a turn from abstract theology to theology as story, from the apologetics of argument to the apologetics of storytelling. Few, chief among them McLaren in this book and John Eldredge in Sacred Romance, are actually telling stories. Stories are by there very nature disarming. Perhaps that's why Plato wrote in stories, to be able to say exactly what Socrates was saying, but without being persecuted for it. Stories also enable the storyteller to experiment with ideas without offering endless caveats and &quot;quotation marks&quot; to properly distance himself from his proposal. Finally, stories reflect our day-to-day interior worlds, our thought lives, and are thus much better able to engage us than abstract claims of the Kantian or Schleiermachian ilk.The most intriguing episodes in The Story We Find Ourselves in are, to me, the creation account given by McLaren and the break that occurs with the medieval synthesis of Christianity with Greek philosophy. It is indeed difficult to think of the creation story without the extraBiblical dualism of material vs. spiritual.Finally, I think an interesting result of this book, or of the 3rd in the series, would be for others to continue the story that McLaren has begun. I think many would love to work through their questions via the medium of Neo, Dan and the rest."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"In this continuation of Neo and pastor Dan's story, McLaren does not succeed in giving us much that is genuinely insightful or with great impact. Besides a couple of genuine moments in the story line in which characters appear to come to terms with God and their spirituality (even then, though, McLaren is extremely shy of the concept and the word \\"conversion\\"), there is not much in either the fiction or the theology to recommend.One general point of critique would be the postmodern penchant for story and dialogue in which no clear point is made and, allegedly, no side is taken. As philosophers no less than Aristotle and Davidson have pointed out, a good story or metaphor has a plot or makes a point. What is a metaphor or a story but a clever and unique way of saying something fairly specific? Dialogue simply for the sake of dialogue is basically (and maybe literally) meaningless. Christ did not speak in parables in order not to make a point.As for the theology, most of what McLaren has to say in this second part of his trilogy is wrapped in politics, an obvious adherence to evolution, and his clear aversion things traditionally evangelical. The only \\"bad guys\\" in this work are caricatures of traditional evangelicals. At times McLaren seems to toy with Monism, Pelagianism, and a general lack of definition of sin and redemption. The concept of redemption looms large in his book, but it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what needs to be redeemed except white evangelicals and conservative politics. In other words, sin does not play the role it needs to in order for McLaren's version of redemption to be meaningful.At one point near the end of the story when McLaren is laying the foundation for the third book's plot, his theology hits the surface. Dan and Neo are reflecting on the death of one character and Dan is questioning him about heaven and hell. Neo is talking around the issue and Dan presses him on the point. Neo's, and apparently McLaren's, response is, \\"Why do you always need to ask that question?\\" Neo then continues to evade giving a clear or distinct answer to the question. The answer to why the question of heaven and hell needs to be answered is obvious-because it is the one final question every single human being ever born needs to face. Seems to me that a caring and thoughtful response would not be a gloss but an answer.Unless you are interested in understanding the theology of the emergent church movement, I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"\\"I believe it to be a great mistake to present Christianity as something charming and popular with no offense in it....We cannot blink at the fact that gentle Jesus meek and mild was so stiff in his opinions and so inflammatory in his language that he was thrown out of church, stoned, hunted from place to place, and finally gibbeted as a firebrand and a public danger. Whatever his peace was, it was not the peace of an amiable indifference.\\"--Dorothy Sayers\\"You can't conceive, my child, nor can I or anyone, the appalling strangeness of the mercy of God.\\" - Graham GreeneBrian McLaren sets out to redefine Christianity as a story instead of a philosophy/theology, and I respect that. The only problem is, he tells a completely BORING story - in five chapters, all starting with C. There is no drama. No tension. No heroes, no great feats, no intricate twists or surprise turns. Basically, it's the story of a nice God and mean people, and all of the nice things this nice God does for the mean people, and all of the mean things these mean people do to this nice God. Yawn.I hate being called \\"nice.\\" It's such a sterile, safe, powerless, harmless adjective. Nice is what your parents want you to be. Nice is who your parents want you to marry. I'd rather be called just about anything else. I'd imagine God feels the same way.For example - McLaren finally, after dancing around it, deals with hell towards the end of the book. Except his hell - the hell of a nice God - is more like a cancer ward or a hospicethan anything (ironic, as much of the book takes place in a cancer ward.) God doesn't \\"condemn\\" people to hell per se - He's just unable to save them. Like a doctor to a cancer patient he says something like, \\"I'm sorry, but there's not much I can do for you. If you'd have come to me sooner...\\" So it really has to do with nice God's inability to save everyone - the limits of his power. (Don't mistake me here - I'm not a fan of the eternal damnation, implements of torture, Dante-esque and Southern Baptist version of hell. I don't know what hell is, or what it will be like. The Bible doesn't speak of it much. But I do suspect it will have more to do with justice than with God's incompetence.)Why do we always do this? WHY do we always feel like we've got to dress God up in a new suit, clean Him up, straighten his collar, wipe that smudge off his cheek? \\"I want you to meet some of my friends - so behave. Be a nice God.\\" We skip over or deliberately fuzz out the UN-nice parts of the story -- God stuffing the ungrateful Israelites with quail until they puke, or giving David three choices of decimation, or Jesus calling his best friend bad names. Come on, God. Be nice. Nice doggie.And in doing so, we lose the best parts of the story. The heroes. The battles. Incredible risk, incredible cost. The danger, the thrill, the mystery: the utter STRANGENESS of mercy and redemption, of blood sacrifice and blessed suffering. This is a wonderful, intoxicating, story, if we'll remember to tell it right.Be honest - do you really want a nice God? Does anybody?"},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"I was surprised to be so dissapointed in this book. The previous book \\"A New Kind of Christian\\" was great! The previous book asked questions that need to be asked of the church, questions that often lead to shocking answers (and revelations), but the author left them as questions. This was very wise of Mr. McLaren; it leaves the reader to pursue God to find the Truth. Especially in the 'postmodern' world that Mr. McLaren posits, there will not be simple and 'cookie cutter' answers. One-size-fits-all church is a thing of the past, and I wholeheartedly agree with him.Unfortunately, in this second book we find out that Mr. McLaren's answer to all of the dogma of the past is to create a new dogma for the future. I was especially dissapointed that he hinges his story on evolution- a theory rooted more as a faith than science. C.S. Lewis once said that to anchor any faith in the findings of science is a mistake. All science will be disproven, and your faith will go with it. When our faith and science agree- it should be no more than a curious fact to us, because our faith is based on Truth, and science (by the modern definition) is rooted in materialism.I suppose what disturbed me most was that I was halfway through \\"the story we find ourselves in\\" before there was any mention of the enemy, and then only as a 'metaphor to put a personality on evil.\\" The next mention of the enemy was similary vague, and it was in the very end of the book. I suppose if you remove the enemy from our story, what you're left with is.... evolution to explain evil and suffering.From the movie \\"The Usual Suspects: The greatest lie the devil ever perpetrated on humanity was to convince the world that he doesn't exist.\\"I agree with Mr. McLaren that the conveyance of the Gospel is changing as society changes, but I disagree the we need to change it into some form of unitarian cosmo-love to communicate the love of Christ. There is an enemy, and removing references to him doesn't do anyone any favors except, of course, the enemy.Jon"},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"I enjoyed meeting Pastor Dan Poole and his friend, Neo in the pages of A New Kind of Christian, and highly recommend it as a starting point for those interested in exploring the new cultural paradigm facing Christianity in the 21st century.Brian McLaren's second book, in what is likely to be a multi-book series, spends less time talking about the modern-postmodern shift and spends more time unpacking the new theology that flows from it. Once again, a fictional setting is used to provide the stage. In the preface to The Story We Find Ourselves In McLaren writes: \\"The more I have written about postmodernity (and so on), the more I have wanted to get to the point where it no longer needed to be written about so much. I wanted to start writing about the Christian gospel itself, from a vantage point within the emerging culture, without always having to defend the vantage point.\\" In this work, McLaren begins the process of describing the \\"new\\" ideas, theological frameworks and viewpoints that paint the backdrop for the unfolding drama we are living.The Galapagos Islands provide the setting for a discussion of creation and evolution and the origins of the universe. Once again, Neo is the prime expositor of the \\"new\\" ideas. In this case, his conversations with Kerry Ellison, a biologist working on the islands to study and preserve wildlife, allow Neo to unpack ideas about a Christian's concern and care for the planet.Other areas of discussion are the authenticity of miracles and Christ's work on the cross. Neo's leadership of a weekly gathering on the yacht, La Ventura, sounds like the kind of church that I would like to join. The unfolding relationship between Neo and Kerry mirrors Kerry's unfolding relationship with God.I liked the storytelling in Story a little better than the first volume. In New Kind of Christian I sometimes felt that the essay overpowered the story. In Story I think McLaren's skills as an author have given us a book that is as interesting for its plot as it is for its information.I have a big appetite for stories that tell of the beauty and mystery that moves people toward faith. And for that reason, I recommend The Story We Find Ourselves In. Be prepared to expand your ideas about the Story that God has written for each of our lives."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"I'm glad to see someone in the Christian writing field able to put a less &quot;fundamentalized&quot; view of belief into the popular marketplace, so I applaud McClaren's effort and courage. And I agree or at least share parallels with most of his thoughts regarding scripture, creation, eschatology, and the notion of the kingdom/revolution of God. But as I read I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching a TV movie-of-the-week. The use of one-dimensional fictional characters to relay this information just didn't work for me. And I felt that too often the various threads or stages of the story ended up with rather simplistic, overly idealistic wrapups.For thoughts/ideas along a similar line in a more poetic yet technically satisfying format, I heartily recommend the writings of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, especially &quot;The Divine Milieu&quot;. I find his &quot;vision&quot; better reflects my experience as a modernist with spiritual foundations."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"A great work that is bound to stretch your thinking and challenge the things that you have believed since childhood (in many cases). I have always had trouble with the idea that it has to be either Creation or Evolution, but that there can be no middle ground. I loved the way that evolution plays a part in 'the story' as well as the way the author introduces Jesus into the story. I thoroughly enjoyed this book - deeply."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"After reading The Story We Find Ourselves In, I walk away feeling that most, if not all, the reviews I read concerning it (whether in favor or against) were strangely beside the point. I encourage you to read it for yourself (starting with the Preface).It seems strange to me that folks would defend so vehemently their interpretations (whatever they are-in agreement with the character Neo or not) of this story that every human finds himself/herself in: as if it's our interpretations of life that gives life meaning or significance. It would seem to me that the most basic significance of our story is that it exists before, above and beyond any one of us individually, though we find ourselves inextricably a part of it. In the face of anything that is so indisputably greater than one's self-such as LIFE-it makes more sense to me to seek meaning from that thing than to think that one's undeniably limited perceptions of the thing can somehow add meaning it. The former is all I see McLaren doing in a most respectful way. And it is my humble opinion that in most instances McLaren's search is for the better.For those to whom it matters, McLaren's writing is substantive and full of latent meaning. The title itself, in its lack of grammatical convention, strikingly suggests that by exploring \\"the story we find ourselves in\\" we simultaneously find both personal context and meaning. Though narrative, the vehicle of choice for McLaren is almost exclusively dialogue which may take some getting use to for some, but there's nothing wrong with that. Of course the quality of his use of the narrative form could be critiqued-doesn't education teach us that all things can be improved-but such critique would be better reserved for a truly artistic work of fiction. McLaren's work is more along the lines of \\"creative nonfiction\\" (a more accurate categorization that a reader of the first book in this series gave him). Besides I get the impression that McLaren's purpose is more parable and less art. The content is not heretical in the least. McLaren only asks you to re-examine the assumptions upon which beliefs about creation, evolution and God's interaction with humanity are based. That which is worth believing should hold up to examination.Whether Evolutionist or Creationist or Intelligent Design Advocate or Christian or not, I hope you read The Story We Find Ourselves In. I hope you enjoy and are inspired by it. If not, I hope it at least challenges you to reconsider for your own benefit why you believe what you believe."},{"Title":"The Story We Find Ourselves In: Further Adventures of a New Kind of Christian","review":"I had to pause frequently to absorb the initial impact of the ideas McLaren presented. I've grown up as a creationist, but as an adult have thought deeply about the implications of creation and evolution because our responsibilities to a Creator or Evolver may be different. McLaren invites us to consider an alternative that the modern traditional Western church would decry as heresy, and therein lies the value of this book.At no point does Scripture give us permission to say to God, &quot;You must,&quot; or &quot;You may not.&quot; It does not specify that it is a scientific textbook, as Western readers might surmise... so &quot;The Story&quot; gives us a possibility closer to the Eastern mindset, a provoking jolt that God might see his-story differently than we do. That he might have made things in his own way and that we have not yet grasped how that came about. I'm not convinced by the theory of evolution, but I was aware of my own evolving faith as I read. Thanks, Brian!"},{"Title":"Japan: A Budget Travel Guide","review":"Ian McQueen's book is by far the best travel guide to Japan, even if you're not on a budget. He describes both the well known places and the out-of-the-way ones. He doesn't make up your mind for you, but leaves it up to the reader whether what's being described is a place the reader would like to go.What amazed me most, of all the advice, was when he said that a certain beach in Hokkaido had washed-up fishing floats (those beautiful big glass balls) on it that people could take home (free) as souvenirs. I went there, and he was right!When I first came to Japan, I tried various guidebooks. This one was the best for me.

My recollections of the great love of Cathy and Heathcliff's turned to impatience with the angst filled duo and a shocking realization that I did not like either of these individuals well.But that being said, I found I appreciated the second half of the book much more than my first read which I must have barely skimmed with the great love being physically impossible. Nor did I forgive Heathcliff as I once did, because my enthusiasm for bad boys has waned over the years.But the question remained for me, when I was forced to rebuild my thoughts regarding this classic novel, was what made it so, what did it have to offer over the centuries to us today? It is a truly atmospheric novel that presents the cold and cruel world of the Yorkshire moors, which seems to shape people in its own fashion. But the value of the book perhaps, is a look at the many faces of love, and what people will do in the name of love.Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a true classic in that each reader can take a lesson from it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The story is depressing and confusing, if you are to believe the adaptations. If you are to believe the 1978 one, also tremendously long-winded and boring. The book, however, is not long-winded and it's not confusing either. It's got decent pacing, good characters (even though there are a number of DSM-IV labels that can be distributed liberally amongst them) and passion. Lots and lots of passion. Not necessarily of the bodice-ripping kind, but passion and fury. Especially the latter.Problem is, as much as I enjoyed reading the book and Emily Bront's writing, which is a lot more succinct than her sister Charlotte's, I don't like any of the characters and I have no sympathy for any of them, save for narrator Nelly/Ellen, because they're all a bunch of b*st*rds who deserve a good slap! I know, I know, it was written a long time ago, but I get the feeling that Emily didn't particularly like the people she wrote about either. They're either violent, drunkards, narcissists or just plain emo. But yes, aside from wanting to give the majority of the cast a good shake and yell \\"wake up and smell the coffee!\\" at them, it's still a good read. Yes, even though it's a little bit depressing and everyone hates each other and people die. Some people you're quite relieved to see the end of.The edition I have (Wordsworth Classics - cheap and cheerful!) comes with a glossary to be able to interpret ye olde English. Some of the words feel a bit unnecessary, because they're either fairly common knowledge or you can grasp the meaning by the context, whereas others ... well, any time poor old Joseph opens his mouth, you need a translator. Yorkshire dialect, 18th/19th century, oww. English isn't even my first language, so it was a tad bit difficult to read. The rest of the book wasn't a problem, just the bits in dialect.The book is actually a lot better than any of the adaptations I've seen. Emily's prose is atmospheric and timeless. Some of her words keep being repeated in the adaptations because, well, they're worth it. Notably this one, which is very passionate:\\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.\\"See, that's goosebumps right there. How profound, how passionate, how... obsessive and bordering on deranged! But that's what I like about it. It tells a compelling (and rather violent) story of a couple of star-crossed lovers who live miserable ever after. What would it have been like if Cathy and Heathcliff had decided to get married? That's what I'd like to know.Anyway, it's a book that exceeded my expectations. I thought it'd just be weird and confusing like the adaptations, but no, it was actually pretty good. It was well written, and to think all of that came out of a parson's daughter living a fairly sheltered life in a small Yorkshire town. Just shows how good her imagination was, and her skill with a pen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was recorded by Ruth Golding for librivox.org and is available free, gratis and for nothing at that site - as 80,000 people have already discovered."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book because I had to teach it in a literature class about three years ago. The novel is poetical in nature, but it uses simple words to unravel the romantic twist in the novel. Catherine who is the center of the novel is in love with two men in her life one who she loves dearly and the other who she married for money. The two men in the novel Edgar Linton and Heathcliff are definitely in love with her. Edgar Linton shows his love for her by staying as a widower even after Catherine's death. By contrast, Heathcliff seeks to revenge his treatment by the Earnshaw family. At the end of the novel the two men who are in love with Catherine are buried close to her.One theme that stands out in the novel is that of love. What does it mean to love someone dearly? How does loving someone manifest itself in the lives of women and men? Is it possible to carry out nefarious act because of love? The responses to these questions are answered in the way the plot of the novel turns out. Through her prose, Emily Bronte answers these questions. Love to her means to be faithful to a partner despite the person's flawed character. Love can be seen as delicate subject which can lead to someone conducting baneful actions, as well as conducting acts of kindness.In a sensational group of compound sentences, Bronte shows her readers how love can be convoluted sentiment in women \\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees.

The book is designed perfectly for the young readers, especially girls. My students were very excited about reading the novel when they saw the cover of the book. The font of the novel is quite large and because of this the book is almost 500 pages; this put off some of the students because they were worried about reading such a large book. However, I explained that it made it easier to read and to take notes in because of the larger print and margins. There is also a pedigree chart in the book and a character reference section that certainly made it more understandable to my students. Also, as we read it, they got more and more excited when they saw how far they would get in just one reading. This book has a Lexile reading score of 880, which is a 6th grade beginning reading level, however, it is quite a difficult read for younder audiences because of the period grammar. My students read quite far above their grade level and most had difficulty with comprehension. I don't know if I will read it again next year because of the grammar, it does suit an older reader, but I do love sharing the story. After we completed the novel, they did complain about the words, but they really loved the story and were sad when we finished the novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"SummaryWuthering Heights is a dark tale of enduring passion and violent love. Set on the wild, rugged Yorkshire moors of northern England, this classic gothic novel follows the story of Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, adopted siblings and lifelong lovers. Narrated through the diary of Mr. Lockwood, a tenant of nearby Thrushcross Grange, this strange and fantastic story tells of a love that transcends all boundaries--even death.Mr. Lockwood is paying a polite visit to his landlord, Heathcliff, when he is expectedly stranded there during a snowstorm. Forced to stay the night at Wuthering Heights, despite Heathcliff's clear displeasure, Lockwood finds an unoccupied room in the grand house. Unable to sleep, however, he stumbles upon the diary entries of a young girl named Catherine Earnshaw, who writes of adventures with her young friend Heathcliff. After nodding off to sleep, Lockwood is awakened when the Catherine's ghost appears at his window, pleading to be let in.When Lockwood returns to Thrushcross Grange the next day, he asks his housekeeper, Ellen (Nelly) Dean, to tell him the story of Heathcliff and the others at Wuthering Heights. Nelly begins her story thirty years earlier, when Mr. Earnshaw brings home an orphaned Heathcliff to raise with his own children, Hindley and Catherine.Though Catherine and Heathcliff are, for many years, inseparable despite Hindley's cruel persecution, eventually the two seem to drift apart. Catherine becomes a proper young lady, and since Hindley forces Heathcliff to work in the fields after their father's death, Heathcliff becomes ignorant and angry. Catherine chooses to marry Edgar Linton, a rich neighbor whom she naively believes will take care of her and Heathcliff. However, Heathcliff interprets this move as rejection, and he runs away for several years.When he returns, he has mysteriously acquires wealth and prestige, though his brooding nature has not been appeased. He has vowed revenge against all of those who have wronged him. When Catherine is confronted by her two loves, Edgar and Heathcliff, she falls ill and dies after giving birth to Cathy. Before she dies, however, she and Heathcliff reassert their undying love to each other.Now, many years later, Heathcliff is more embittered than ever, and he lives to torment the offspring of his long-dead enemies. But he is constantly conscious of Catherine's post-mortem presence, and he is pulled toward eternal love and happiness with her beyond the grave.AnalysisDespite the many narratives-within-a-narrative (the story is a diary entry, often recording Nelly's narrative, who in turn often relates the detailed speeches of others), I found the story surprisingly easy to follow on audiobook. I enjoyed listening to the heavily accented speech of Joseph and other characters, though I also checked a paperback out from the library to understand what they were actually saying!Nelly's judgmental comments about the devilish behavior of Catherine and Heathcliff, which only seems to worsen with time, make the pair seem irresponsible and deserving of any punishment that they receive. Nelly supports this viewpoint with the opinions of Edgar Linton and Hindley, both of whom despise Heathcliff and become frustrated with Catherine, and she portrays the lovelorn couple as ungrateful and spiteful.It struck me as odd that such a seemingly selfish and cruel pair would feel so deeply for each other. In my experience, relationships between truly destructive people such as Catherine and Heathcliff never end well. But their love persists and even grows stronger with each passing year.All of the other characters in the story judge the actions of Catherine and Heathcliff quite harshly, but their persecution only serves to strengthen the depth of feeling between the two. Every time Nelly criticizes their irreverent and even cruel behavior, I felt more sympathy and understanding for them and I began identifying with the persecuted couple. No one believes in them but themselves, and that is what makes their love so powerful and endearing.I found Wuthering Heights to be an enjoyable read; even more than Jane Eyre. Such a powerful story of love and loss ages well, and the unconventional use of an unreliable narrator had an interesting effect upon my view of the characters and story.The very subtle addition of Catherine's ghost, which could be interpreted as real or could be read as merely a figment of Lockwood's and Heathcliff's imaginations, does not diminish the credibility of the story. On the contrary, the supernatural elements throughout the novel only serve to add to the dark, intense feelings between the two lovers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is like nothing I've ever read. Beautifully written yet filled with hateful characters and depressing scenes. Yet...yet, I loved it! Emily Bronte does what few authors are capable of doing successfully; compelling you to care for people and situations you otherwise would not. So unlike her sister, Charlotte, who created a likable, strong character in Jane Eyre, Emily creates Cathy, Heathcliff, and the rest of this brooding, spoiled, and somewhat selfish cast of characters driven to depression and madness by the pitfalls of love--both familial and romantic--and makes you want to never stop reading about them. A true classic and one that everyone should read and keep in their library."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Book arrived very speedily and was in excellent condition, would certainly purchase from this seller again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wow. I actually really liked this book. It wasn't flawless, but was certainly enjoyable for a classic.The Things I Didn't Like:1. The narration. It was just a mess. It would be a narration inside a narration inside a narration. I had no idea who the \\"I\\" was whenever it was mentioned. And I just find it a tad bit unbelievable that Nelly Dean was a witness to it all. I kept cracking up because I would imagine Nelly hiding under tables or behind doors, listening in on all these intense conversations. I would have preferred it in third person.2. The names. I can't count how many time I was confused because I lost track of which Catherine, Linton, or Heathcliff, Bronte was talking about. I think I ended up guessing more than once.3. Joseph's accent. Oh, Lord. His dialogue was practically in another language. I ended up kind of skimming his parts because it wasn't worth the five minutes it took to decipher one paragraph.The Things I Did Like:1. All the characters. They were just so crazy, flawed, unlikable, dramatic, and awesome. I loved them and I hated them.2. When it was written. It just blows my mind that this was written 150 years ago. Besides the language, it just seems so modern to me. Not the setting, but the plot seems like something people would enjoy today.3. Romantic but not romantic. I loved how every action and conversation was so filled with passion. It wasn't a romance in the traditional sense, and that made it seemed more realistic. Heathcliff was both the antagonist and protagoninst. He definitely wasn't swoon worthy like the other heroes of his time, but he was darker, more coplex.I'm really surprised by how much I liked this novel. I wish Emily lived to write another one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm actually 17, not 13, but I don't have a credit card so I can't submit normally...Anyways, this is my review:To be perfectly honest, I found this novel to be very overrated. I didn't enjoy this book at all, and to be honest, I don't really understand why it has been referred to as a &quot;classic&quot; when it has, at best, a flimsy plot and several of the characters are little more than one-dimensional stereotypes, not unlike characters in a modern-day soap opera.I'll admit, it does have it's strong points at times, such as the profound symbolism used throughout the book and the imaginative descriptions of moments such as Mr. Lockwoods dream about the late Catherine, but personally, I found it to be overly melodramatic, and at times, tedious.

Up until now, I could have said I've never met a book I didn't like. The best I can say - I didn't find it offensive. Just dull beyond belief.

Yet, we must read it if we are in an English Literature survey course.It is ponderous going... a classic of dreary proportions, encumbered by a depressing plot, set in dismal surroundings and peopled by dysfunctional characters.However, many other readers, many teachers and professors, many literature critics, genuinely love this book.- Perhaps it appeals to their current mood, or it speaks to having shared, in some way, the experience of one or another of the characters?- Perhaps they have loved long and deeply and found their love unfulfilled? Then Heathcliff speaks to their hearts.- Perhaps they have moved beyond a deeply felt love, for reasons that they cannot fully express or understand, all the while, still keeping deep in some hidden recess of their psyche, that love that will remain first or best or purest? We can see, then, why that reader might be drawn to identify with Cathy.A sad aspect of the book, however, is that it seems so hopeless, so dark, so fatalistic, so depressing. An over identification with these characters might have an adverse effect on a susceptible reader.The reality is, if you are more or less happy in who you are and who the other beloved people in your life may be, then you will probably find very few connecting points with these benighted main characters. If so, I will offer you this hint......Watch the DVD of Larry Olivier and Merle Oberon, dear student, before you read. They play fast and loose with the plot, so you still have to read the book to ace your test or write your essay. But at least you will have some visual hints of beauty to keep in mind as you labor with this challenging novel.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When my English teacher assigned this piece of Gothic literature instead of the prescribed novel \\"Frankenstein,\\" my curiosity was piqued. Though I had questioned her taste in literature throughout the year, I felt that this novel would be her redeeming point, the thing that would bring her class together.I couldn't have been more mistaken.Wuthering Heights is the story of a man who rents a small mansion from another man, and decides to pay his landlord a visit. Or so it seems. What the novel truly is can only be decribed as a farce on human emotion. It follows the passionate, and often violent, semi-romance between Catherine Earnshaw and her adopted brother Heathcliff. Bronte's poetic language eased the physical reading of the novel, but shrouded the actual plot in deeper mystery and chaos than it had managed to do itself.A novel filled with one amazing plot twist is intriguing; one with several shockers is unexpected. Wuthering Heights, however, conatins more curves and unexpected turns than a New Orleans back-road. This would keep the reader alert and willing to continue . . . if the characters were not blatantly predictible, and completely imhuman. The love-struck heroine/antagonist Catherine Earnshaw declares at one point that \\"Nelly, I am Heathcliff!\\" While intended to be a moving statement, modern psychology student would be more likely to call it stage one acute paranoia. Indeed, this particular educational slave had to struggle through only six chapters of poorly created characters, morose settings, and a plot that seemed more thrown-together than created, before literally guessing his/her way to passing every exam.Back to Ms. Bronte's plot devices. This novel is almost like watching a child play with dolls while talking aloud. Listen to your young daughters; \\"Suzie came home, and did this.\\" A thoughtful pause will follow, and then something else will hapen to Suzie. Then something else. Whatever comes to mind will happen, regardless of whether it makes good storytelling or not. The novel takes the same approach, with a plotline that could only be deemed a line in Lovecraftian geometry.All in all, Wuthering Heights demonstrates fluid and powerful use of the English language . . . but isn't that the purpose of poetry? With predictably unpredictable characters, stale settings, and a plotline that almost refuses to exist, Wuthering Heights could be summed up only in the words of another English teacher: \\"It's General Hospital with an English accent! She's making you read that!?\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is an incredibly hard to read book since it is written in old-English.

I have just a few seconds ago finished this book and I am completely speechless...but not with admiration.Yes,PERHAPS Emily Bronte might have written this well but EVERY other aspect of this books is extremely flawed. Good literature it may be to some but good characters, morals, story it is most certainly not. I completely 100% agree with a reviewer who wrote that she hated Heathcliff being described as some alpha male. Reader, believe me, he is the farthest thing from it. How can all these people talk about WH as being a love story? Some call it Powerful Love, Passionate Love, Strongest Love that Could Ever Exist, etc etc. Believe me when I say Heathcliff has ABSOLUTELY NO LOVE for Catherine. Nor she for him. All of it is just a matter of obsession. Their \\"attachment\\" to each other is purely selfish. This book has not ONE admirable character in it. All are either foolish or wicked. Heathcliff is nothing good and honest but obsession, jealousy, cruelty, baseness, dishonesty, and selfishness are the elements of his character as well as Catherine's I might add. Perhaps if Emily Bronte would have brought out all the folly of the characters and spoken of their error it would have had some merit. But the book starts off in bad and till the end no one grows or improves their moral characters. If the wickedness of a person can only be erased by extinguishing the the person himself what moral is there to be learned at all? I had not the slightest big of emotion except relief when I finished this. When I read a book I feel so engrossed in it, almost as if I know every character and am part of their world. HA! Emily Bronte has such a superb power of making you feel like you are only reading blank words on a page...I felt no connection with the characters at all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This Bantam Classics paperback edition of Wuthering Heights has many typographical errors in it, such as \\"Cathering\\".This novel astounds me. Although it is well-written, what could have prompted the young author to write such a demented tale? And my biggest peeve is that the main character, Nelly Dean, never once considered leaving the insanity, and she did not seem to ever think that there was anything seriously wrong with their little \\"world\\" between the Grange & the Heights. I agree completely with the review by Monika on 1/25/04. The characters are weakly written so that I did not feel attachment to or pity for any of them, and their actions did not make much sense."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What an amazing book to be written by a 20-year-old woman. She was ahead of her time.I didn't know whether to like the characters or not: Heathcliff was such a jerk in so many ways and Cathy was such a wench.I enjoyed the second half of the novel, however, with the drama of their children.Still can't compare with &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; -- which gets 5 stars in my book. :)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is, frankly, a disaster of a novel. Examining it from a technical point of view, the narration is stilted and poor, the characters are flat, the writing is childish, and it's much too bloated. The entire story could have been summed up into about forty pages or less, and I think it would have been more \\"passionate\\" and surely much more believable if Emily Bront had written the book in third person, not first person.Mr. Lockwood begins narrating the story, which is perfectly fine. I'd thought it would be a normal first-person narrative, until I discovered that the true narrator is Nelly Dean. In everyday speech, or even in telling a lengthy story (as Nelly is), no one actually speaks like they're writing a book (\\"'Yes,' she said, looking at me.\\"). People speak like, well, people. They stammer and stumble and interrupt themselves, especially when they're trying to narrate a story. Now, this sort of stilted narration is tolerable for a certain period of time--- the real issue I have with this book is that each and every character has the same style of speech. Each of these flat, poorly developed characters speak and narrate in the exact same way--- except for Joseph and the other uneducated characters, whose rare bouts of dialogue are generally incomprehensible.Heathcliff is supposedly the main character, but he is anything but a hero...although I do admit he is the most human. That doesn't say much, however. I really can't imagine any of the characters being portrayed as heroes. And the ancillary 'narrator,' Mr. Lockwood, is nothing but a stand-in for Nelly Dean. Of all the characters, he is the flattest, and he seems to have very little purpose in the story.To top all that off, the story isn't nearly as \\"amazing\\" as it's made out to be. It is advertised as revealing some of the \\"terrible truths about men and women,\\" but the characters are so unrealistic and childish that I can't even think of them as being true men and women. 95% of them fail to act their ages, by the way. The book is about thwarted love, yes, I understand. But the passion is just as believable as the characters are, and there is a disturbing lack of justice in the story. The whole book screams, \\"Who cares?!\\"Overall, I don't recommend Wuthering Heights to anyone, even though it is hailed (for whatever reason) as being a work of searing beauty and one of the most wonderful classics today. It is one of the worst books I have ever read, technically and metaphorically and creatively speaking. But who knows--- you may enjoy it.[EDIT: This review expresses my opinion about this book...my opinion only, and nothing more. I don't think it's mature for people to make illogical judgments (for instance, \\"people who thought Wuthering Heights was badly written aren't such great writers themselves\\") about others simply because they do not agree with them about a book. Everyone is entitled his/her own opinion, and therefore, no opinion is right or wrong.]"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Letters formed, words flowed, as Emily Bront moved the ink across the pages. In 1847, around the age of 28, Emily saw the culmination of her writing, Wuthering Heights, published. Emily also heard it bashed, criticized, and spoken of as worthless in her life time. As the year 1848 rolled around Emily perished from the earth. We do not Emily's personal opinion of her book when she died, but her sister, Charlotte Bront, around 1850, wrote an introduction to Wuthering Heights. It was then that the book burrowed its way into the hearts of society. Since then some have admired Emily Bront's intricacy of characters and format of plot, while others still hold to the idea that the book is morbid.Set in 1801, the story travels back in time to the beginning of Heathcliffs entrance into Wuthering Heights, it then once more progresses, ending in 1802. Emily Bront's novel, Wuthering Heights, weaves the lives of Catharine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. Mrs. Nelly Dean, for the bulk of the novel, is relating their lives to Mr. Lockwood, a new tenant at Thrushcross Grange (which is owned by Heathcliff, who lives at Wuthering Heights when Mr. Lockwood arrives). Intertwined with other impressionable characters Catharine and Heathcliff's lives are poured out. Catharine, a stubborn, saucy, selfish girl, grows up with her parents, her brother Hindly, and Heathcliff - a young starving gypsy boy brought home to Wuthering Heights by Mr. Earnshaw to live with the family. Mistreated and degraded by Hindly and scorned throughout life by all, save Mr. Earnshaw and for the most part Catharine, Heathcliff grows bitter and vengeful. As time progresses and Heathcliff's bitterness thickens his love, his life, his Catharine, dies. She dies married to another man and giving her last breath baring her husbands child. All that Heathcliff then feels is left, is to live sadistically and desperately grieved among the ashes of his life.Wuthering Heights depicts love, loss, hurt, dread, selfishness, brutality, vengeance, and in a strange way a restoration of peace. As one reads the tale, one is aghast at the behavior of the characters' and nauseated by the plot. Yet, one is intrigued by the intricately woven details and structure of the novel.The novels strength is its style; personable characters that are intermingled with larger then life characters; and its tangible setting on the moors of England laced with a supernatural essence. Emily Bront captures the Romanticism ideation of the 19th century in such a way that one gets pulled into the era, into the lives of those at Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.Regardless of the well written tale and excellent method of describing the mind set of those in the 19th century, having this idea of the supernatural intermingled with the real; the novels weakness is loud spoken. The characters of the novel are insufferable, and the plot dark and selfish. Leaving one sick to the stomach and ones mind plagued by terrible images after reading certain portions.Through the strengths and weaknesses of the novel a lesson is brought forth. If one lets selfish ambition and revenge rule their lives, they shall live a sad desperate life among ashes. Instead of a pleasant life, by forgiving and moving towards reconciliation and freedom from the chains of abuse. It teaches that each person has a choice; to do good and bring happiness to themselves and others, or to do evil and bring pain and suffering upon themselves and others. Though the novel in totality impresses this upon its readers and concludes this in the end, I feel there are other ways of learning this lesson.I can not recommend the book; for although the conclusion brings about a lesson reaching that lesson is inner torture. I was excited to read Wuthering Heights for the title intrigues. Now that I have finished the novel I am even more excited to let it alone, to let it die among the ashes.I rate this book with one star because it is well written, not for its content."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"These books should still be required reading.

These hoary old classics such as WH or JANE EYRE or Thomas Hardy's output or Dickens along with hundreds of others have withstood the test of time for a reason, and although they may not be to everyone's taste, they won't need any help from me to keep their place on bookshelves. My problem has always been one of 'familiarity with a book's cover breeds contempt'. I've seen copies of WUTHERING HEIGHTS for about as long as I've been able to read; I've seen it so often there comes a point where I convince myself that I already know what the novel is, since I know (from dust jacket material) what it's _about_.WUTHERING HEIGHTS also suffers from the image of its film adaptations (none of which I've seen). Still, it's hard to have lived anywhere but under a rock and not have seen at least snatches of Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier in the 1939 film, or any of the more recent remakes. Those glimpses have always made me consider WUTHERING HEIGHTS as a ghostly gothic romance, although it is really nothing of the sort. Instead it is a wildly fierce tale of obsession and revenge, implacably engineered by the monstrous Heathcliff, who seems more a force of nature than simply a human. And yet, the revenge motif - while guiding the bulk of the tale - is in itself only part of what constitutes the power in the novel. The mix of primal emotions and the veneer of civiliation together standing out in stark relief agains the unearthly backdrop of the moors suggests mythic archetypes in the mold of Tristan and Isolde. To think that this novel came from the mind of a twenty-nine-year-old 'reclusive spinster in a rural Yorkshire parsonage' (from Diane Johnson's introduction), is at once baffling and intimidating.For those readers who may have looked at this book over the years and passed by from a mistaken idea - as I did - that you already knew the contents, I would highly recommend taking a few days to actually crack the covers. While it isn't a perfect book, there's no question of its forcefulness, and even if it doesn't exactly strike your fancy, you'll know for sure why it is that you've avoided it. For other, younger readers, I would also recommend it as an excellent addition to your reading list.

I LIKE THE THIRD PERSON STORY TELLING FORMAT."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I found this book quite confusing at first, as you are just thrown into the situation and most of the story is disclosed through a narrative by the housemaid to a new tenant. I'm also just starting to get used to the way people were referred to back in those times. One character can wear many names: Miss Earnshaw, Miss Catherine, Missy, Cathy, Mrs. Linton; makes it appear there are five characters right there instead of just one. Although I did eventually figure out that Cathy was actually Catherine's daughter, but I still have a hard time keeping characters straight in classic books.While I probably wouldn't classify this book as a page turner, when I do set it down, I don't set it down for long. I often can't wait to pick it up and hear more of the story, hoping it will all makes sense eventually. One is told the characters at the present time of the book, the housekeeper starts her story with a completely different situation, and as the story unfolds I cannot help but wonder what could possibly transpire to get the cast of characters where they are \\"today\\".I'm torn between hatred of Heathcliff and pity. Was he heartless because he was a scoundrel or because his heart had been broken to bits?I still find it hard to understand dialogue when it is spelled phonetically based on the character's speech patterns. Mark Twain is also known for doing this. I find it easiest to read these passages aloud and pray my family doesn't think I am nuts. But still I found that I couldn't understand a word that Joseph said. The gist of what I did get from him, he probably wasn't saying anything very nice anyhow. It doesn't seem that he had ever heard the adage \\"if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all\\". I'd have sacked his sorry butt and sent him packing if I had been lord of the manor.Is it just me or were people more apt to fall ill back then? The housekeeper/narrator had been out in the rain and gotten her feet wet. As a result she was bed ridden for THREE weeks. Jane Bennet, in Pride and Prejudice, was sick for months after getting caught in the rain. One could argue that we have better doctors today, though I'm not sure I would agree, or that they didn't have Nyquil back then. Personally, I often get caught in the rain without need of either a visit to my general quacktitioner or over the counter cold medicines. There were other illnesses where the cause of which seemed strange to me, but I don't want to go into specifics for fear of giving away too much of the book.One thing I found humorous, the main female character compares a situation in her life to a passage in another book which I just finished."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I disliked this book thoroughly--it was completely different from what I thought it would be.

I am sure it is classical literature and makes a nice commentary on society, but as I was not reading this for an English class, I wouldn't know about any of that. I was not analyzing it, I wanted to read it for fun but didn't enjoy it at all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A classic, indeed. For someone not too fond of reading, this book has recaptured my interest in the activity. It is a significant and profound notch on the belt of the ever-enrapturing theme of the tragic love triangle. The 1992 film version of the novel is what first captured my attention. After seeing that film I had to pick up the book. It was the first book I've read in months and I'm glad that this was the read I chose. For some, the language may be a bit of a stretch to understand at first, but it quickly becomes 2nd nature (it's no \\" Nadsat,\\" courtesy of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE). The archaic punctuation and diction, as well as the unwarned flip-flop of narrators may lead to some turbulence in the read, but that's nothing a good dose of patience and willingness to reread the page won't cure. A plethora of the more critical reviews have pointed out that many, if not all of the characters are unlikable at least part of the time if not continuously, but I argue that it's their flaws and the causes of their flaws which make these same cruel characters interesting and worthy of our sympathy (sometimes). The novel draws upon very human emotions and very human reactions to those emotions which should satiate any readers' unconscious internal hunger for the exploration of human depth and dynamics."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book because is a must read and I heard it mentioned in many movies/shows that I thought I had to give it a try. I was not interested in the beginning but it turned out to be a page turner although I was disappointed at how it ended, not sure there was any other way to end it but while reading it I wondered if there was a movie about it (never searched to see)...some how I kept picturing Gerald Butler as Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I certainly liked it.... I guess the only thing that is so very frustrating to me and most surely the point of the novel, is the destruction of all involved in this story. The love is not love at all but total obsession and selfishness. Its a cautionary tale. I used to think it was supposed to be romantic, but after reading it and also seeing the BBC version of Wuthering Heights I am convinced that Emily Bronte thought to diadactically show the writer that what some call love is no LOVE at all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've always been a sucker for reading the classics and finally got a chance to read this one. The language takes time to get used to if you haven't read any old literature in a while, but just like most classics - definitely worth the read! And, how can you beat free?!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After the first two chapters, the book takes off. You are thrown into the hectic lives of the inhabitants of the Grange and Wuthering Heights. The language is beautiful, and the plot takes you on many twists and turns."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My interest in Wuthering Heights was spurned when I learned that the authoress was the sister of Charlotte Bronte,one of my favourite authoress of all times.And I am definitely pleased to learn that Emily Bronte parallels her sister in depicting love,passion and vengeance.The revenge that Heathcliff exacts on the Earnshaws and the Lintons were slow and tortuous,but one may have to reconsider his wretched childhood ,full of humiliation and degradation.There is also an element of mystery present:did the tenant really see Catherein's ghost?And did Heathcliff murder Hindley?(The details of his death seemed somewhat ambiguous)Overall,I'll say that anyone with an appreciation for good literature will thoroughly enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book haunts me. I have read it countless times. It is ingrained in me now as part of my own personal myth. I carry Heathcliff and Cathy inside like some people carry The Virgin Mary or Allah inside of them. I read it when I was young because I had to for class and hated it, then years later, I was about eighteen and read it again, and this time Cathy and Heathcliff blew through me and knocked me down as surely as if I were a Linton. Years later it still exerts its strange force over me. People are right, it is not a 'nice' book: its emotional terrain is pitted with violence and terror, brutality and abuse. Wuthering Heights isn't about star-crossed love or the endurance of love over death, Emily Bronte was not concerned with such trivialities. It is about what happens to a person who feels intensely, about how a person who endures such intensity of feeling survives. Heathcliff and Cathy respresent two sides of one thing that Bronte was trying to tell us about. She tells us in such a way that we come back to her only novel time and time again to seek the meaning. Not to be confused with 'Jane Eyre'. Jane Eyre is the tale of an insipid who finally gets her man (big deal) despite puritannical hardship, and though its crie de coeur touches the heart, it never sets it alight. If however, you are interested in being burned, and if some teacher isn't force-feeding you this text, Wuthering Heights might just be the book for you."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book was a little boring at first.

I remember at the time being captivated by the star-crossed lovers Heathcliff and Catherine. I decided recently to reread the story because it had been so long and I had forgotten what had drawn me to it.If this had been my first time reading the story, I would probably give it no more than 2 stars. It is definitely a mood piece. As an angst-filled teen, I can understand my former attraction to brooding characters and missed opportunities. As an adult, with much less angst, I have grown to pity the characters I once held in admiration. To say it plainly, Heathcliff is a d*ck. He was so hell bent on his own vision of revenge that he not only wastes his own life, but ruins the lives of others. The bad boy I was so attracted to 20 years ago is in actuality a loser. So is the story of the teenage girl.I have given this book 4 stars due to sentimentality. If you're looking for a happy ending fairy tale, this is not the book for you. If you're 15 years old with a chip on your shoulder, then this will probably become your favorite classic of all time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Gotta love this classics.

What a love story! A great tale of people sometimes setting in motion awful events due to their desire to do what they see as right in their own eyes. Recommended. Well-written."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Instead of focus on sad love story, I have quite differnet perspectives to approach. I have a view that their tragically unfulfilled love was something that they could have overcome sufficiently by themselves although there were a lot of psychological and social pressures. Those external factors were merely a word 'pressure'. True obstacle was existed in Catherine itself. Even after she married to Edgar, her fluctuations of mind was psychologically abnormal and very egoistic in some point of view. For fulfillment of metaphysical areas, she was always craved the Heathcliff and for materialistic basis she wanted the Edgar. It is a typical ambivalent feeling that we should avoid. In addtion, it is pretty romantic but these excessive histronic characteristics of this prose made me tired partially. Thus, we should not only focus on sad love story affairs but also about implications that truly inculcate matters between human being throughout this long fable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Brot's \\"Wutheting Heights\\" is a two sided coin. The whole narrative is contructed over doubles and juxtapositions -- with elements arranged into pairs. From the basic conflict of love against hate, the writer brings up the most and lest noble feelings and actions -- always making pairs and putting one against the other.To begin with, the narrative is divided into two distinct poles, each representing a different generation. Structurally speaking, the first part -- the one that includes Catherine, Heathcliff, Isabella, Edgard -- is stronger and more important, while the second segment works as a sort of anticlimax dealing with the love of the second generation --young Catherine, Linton, Hareton. Another double point is that there are two Catharines, being the second one the daughter of the former. They both have many resemblances, physically and psychologically. But the young Catharine is an amalgam of her mother's and father's personality.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a generational drama. Two generations have to face the same problems that they parents had. But at the same time, Bront deals with the gap of one generation to another. The same dramas do not have the same conclusion. Time has passed, minds and behavior have changed. In this fashion, the book tackles life as a process that is in constant change.Places are also battling against each other. The main stage for the action is the Wuthering Heights, while the other part of the narrative happens in the Thurshcross Grange. The first, as the name gives away, exploits the wildness, the extremity, the unstoppable love. On the other hand, the Grange represents the social status and the aristocracy. At the same time, they represent Catharine inability to choose between Heathcliff (WU) and Edgard (TG).Despite not being a success when first published in 1847, Brot's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" became a cult with time. Nowadays it is considered one of the most important novels ever written. Not a bad change for a book that received much critics when published and the writer had to use a masculine pen name in order to be considered serious.As Gothic novels go, not only structurally is \\"Wuthering Heights\\" a very brave effort, but also thematically this book defied its genre. Following the gothic tradition of the late XVIII Century, the books has elements like supernatural aspects, moonless nights, valorization of the grotesque. But, despite these strong points, what remains more popular in the book is its characters and their love story, Catherine and Heathcliff.The narrative is told by many different narrators from various sources, like letters, diaries entries etc, therefore there isn't an unbiased narrator. Nelly tells most of the story to Mr. Lockwood. She watched most of events she describes, however she remains as an unreliable narrator, once she injects her own view of the facts and characters. That is why it is so important to read between the lines in this book.Thinking of more contemporary concepts, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is like yin and yang, dealing with two basic principles of the universe: love and hate -- both inhabiting the same people. Since the novel deals with the human nature, Bront's single novel is timeless and appeals to most readers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In addition to the complete text of Wuthering Heights, this volume contains selected poems of Emily Bronte and articles of criticism by such noted authors as E. M Forster and Mark Shorer. Shorer's essay is an introduction to another edition and provides background information on Emily Bronte and her family, a valuable \\"family tree\\" of the characters in W. H., and a perceptive interpretation of the novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"bronte's story of life on the moors in england revolves around the earnshaw and litton families. the \\"adopted\\" son of the earnshaw's, heathcliff, and his passion (i'm reluctant to call it love) for catherine, the legitimate daughter, is the centerpeice of the novel.heathcliff is probably one of the most evil characters in literature. he destroys everything in his path, including catherine. his motivation appears to be revenge, but his actions go well beyond a reasoned response and continues thru subsequent generations to innocent offspring. the imagery surrounding heathcliff and the moors helps create the ominous setting. heathcliff actually appears to be possessed either by the devil or by catherine as she exclaims, \\"i am heathcliff.\\"the story ends somewhat ironically in that all that heathcliff has achieved in his revenge is overturned by the next generation.the shortcoming of the story is that heathcliff is beyond the pale. how can catherine love him when he is the devil incarnate? the story which takes on a ghostlike quality particularly at the end, would have been better as a haunting of heathcliff rather than a tale of revenge. heathcliff could have been a very sympathetic character and you would have then cared about what happened to him.but then again who am i to challenge a classic. read it on your own and decide."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is my favorite book. The characters in this book truly touched my heart. The characters, the story, the setting, are all so realistic, gripping, profoundly touching, it's hard to even describe the range of emotions one goes through when reading this book. I've read a wide variety of books: modern, classic, mystery, romance, suspense, drama; this book stuck with me more than all others. The last time I read it was several years ago, but I can still picture the scenes and hear the dialog. It is an amazing book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is truely a classic novel. Bronte's wonderful tale of Heathcliff, mainly, is an excellent though provoking novel. It contains everything, and a reader who indulges in any genre of novels will no doubt love this story.This novel takes place on the moors in the late 1700's into 1802 England. Heathcliff is taken in by Mr. Earnshaw, owner of Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff, becomes beloved by Cathrine Earnshaw, but despised by her brother Hindley. Catherine, however falls in love with Edgar Linton, heir to Thrushcross Grange. She denies Heathcliff's proposal, for she claims it to be too much of anm embarassment to marry him and marries Edgar Linton. The novel tells of tells of the characters and their intense fellings toward one another, as time goes on and their childern grow."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering heights is remarkable. No other book was able to characterize the human behavior in such a way.a love story that shows all sorts of feelings like hatred, revange, friendship...A book that has been well received for so long and in so many places, can make you feel happy, angry and many others along the reading because you can actually see yourself in the character\`s shoes. There is no doubt that Wuthering heights is a master piece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The writing is descriptive yet very structural, which, in turn has a lack of smoothness. The Yorkshire accent could have been better but all in all the story was a turn since quite a few that told me the story is sad. Sad indeed, but it didn't trigger my emotion. A story pleasantly told, it lacks little. The characters are brilliant; they're realistic and very human if not humane.It is a story to remember and a story to remember is a story worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though this may be a romance, it isn't one in the Nora Roberts sense of the word (thankfully). Rather, it is a romance in the Shakespearian sense that it is neither comedy nor tragedy. It does have romantic aspects sprinkled throughout, but that is not the most important aspect. Rather, it is a dark, brooding novel that focuses far more on loss, revenge, and the deterioration of the human soul than it does on love or anything else the average person might conceive of as \\"romantic.\\"In many ways, it parallels Milton's Paradise Lost, if in a metaphorical sense. We have Heathcliff as the devil (as he is often referred to throughout) and his fall from grace. We have both Catherines as Eve-type characters in slightly different ways, and as I explain below, it is their choices (often under the infernal influence of Heathcliff) that determine the future of the narrative, much as Eve's choice determines the future of humanity. We even have the loss of paradise toward the end, but with the hope of eventual salvation and a return thereto (i.e., as Paradise Regained is suggested in the last book of Milton's epic).The characters of Wuthering Heights are a generally unlikable bunch of flawed human beings provoking and being provoked by each other. Strikingly realistic for a \\"romantic\\" novel. It is the strong, independent women of the novel who are the foundational characters around which the book revolves. They are the focus of attention, and it is only through them that the male characters are able to accomplish whatever ends they set out to accomplish. In fact, one of the main struggles of the book can be seen as the attempts of the women to remain independent of the male characters' repeated attempts at subjugation and control. Interestingly, it is always the women who end up with the choice as to result will prevail in each battle of this war.In this sense, Wuthering Heights can be seen as a feminist novel, but not as a preaching one. Rather, Bronte seems to strive for the reader to understand the strength and resiliency of her women through their subtle control of the narrative and their resistence to the constant pressure that the male characters exert from attempting to take that power away. One final example of this is through the framing of the narrative itself. Though superficially told by Mr. Lockwood, he is initially relating Ellen Dean's story verbatim through the first half of the book. However, halfway through, he discards Ellen and \\"summarizes\\" the story she told him off-screen. In other words, he attempts to dominate the telling of the narrative as Heathcliff, Edgar, Hareton, and Hindley attempt to dominate the women of the novel at various points. Yet, like all the other dominations throughout the novel, this narrative domination fails as well. Ultimately, Ellen is able to reassert herself as the official storyteller over the last few chapters, but what was the effect of losing her immediate voice for the intermediate period, I'll leave up to you to interpret. I'm still working it out myself."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have to say it: I did not like the book. I willingly admit that Emily Bronte had heaps of talent and writes beautifully, but I couldn't bring myself to like any character in the book. They all seemed, rude, selfish, and insane to me, and there were very few or no aspects in which I could relate to or sympathize with them. In short, I have nothing against the writer, and her style, but the plot and characters in this story, are in my opinion, overdone and stretched beyond believability."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wow! I may be only twelve, but this is a wonderfull book! I enjoy reading classics, this one especialy. Despite the author growing up with an excentric father in a house far removed from the rest of humanity, she was able to create a wonderfull book of friendship, love and tragedy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't know what people see in this book. I found it irritating from the start -- all the characters are thoroughly unlikeable. After slogging my way through a quarter of the book, I found I still couldn't care less what happened to these people.The writing is also painfully verbose and florid. For a better story, I would have been willing to cope with it, but here it was just another reason to put the book down and never pick it up again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I thought I was going give this a bad rating because I hated Heathcliff and Cathy Earnshaw so much that I couldn't bear to read any more, but that's the reason why I gave it high marks! It's been awhile since a novel has brought out such feelings in me! Frankly, Cathy and Heathcliff deserved one another; I hated Cathy because she was so selfish she did not deserve to be loved by anyone with a good heart, like Edgar; I hated Heathcliff because he was such a monster with no heart towards anyone else other than Cathy. I was sick to my stomach the way he punished those around him. I don't know why Heathcliff was so fond of Cathy either. There was nothing about her to love! I loved Missus Dean though. She had the strongest spirit and I found her a refreshing character amidst the madness of all the others. This book was incredibly tragic and even hard to get through because it is such a downer. It's like when you think it couldn't get worse, it does! I didn't give the book 5 stars, however, because I found the ending weak and abrupt. Other than that, a worthwhile read!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I recommend the novel Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. The plot is clear and simple to understand but it is charged with energy throughout the whole book. When Emily Bronte writes there are no questions as to what she means about scenes that she describes. She does this through her choice of words. She always gives a clear description of places and people. Heathcliff and Catherine are her most passionate characters in this novel. She expresses their love and devotion to each other by their actions through out the whole novel. She does not come out and tell the reader things, she makes them use their imagination and interpret scenes and characters themselves.One of the negative aspects to this novel is the ability to understand the vocabulary. Bronte uses a lot of extensive vocabulary through out the whole novel and this makes some of the sentences and scenes hard to comprehend. This is because Bronte knows exactly what she wants her readers to get or see out of Wuthering Heights.One of the main themes in this novel is love and hate. Catherine is a prime example of this theme. Her feelings for her husband, Edgar, and her feelings toward Heathcliff should be in reverse. Through out the whole novel she loves Heathcliff. The hate comes into play because Heathcliff hates Edgar because he with Catherine and he is not with Catherine. He hates anyone that tries to come in between him and Catherine.The characterization of the characters by Bronte was very excellent. She lets the reader know certain characteristics of the characters by scenes and background information. She demonstrates certain connections between different sets of characters very well. For example the scene when Heathcliff and Catherine went to see the two Linton children it compares both sets to each other.Overall this book is interesting and has many different themes and interesting topics. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading and likes different characters and plots. Although the vocabulary at times is hard to understand it can be dealt with."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Of all the things committed to paper, why on Earth was it this? Having been forced to read this tripe under penalty of death in high school, and then once again in college, I must say that death is welcome. Oh poor poo-poo Heathcliff the Brooding and Catherine the ill fated strumpet. Yawn. Emily Bronte lived one of those lives like that of the other Emily, you know, Dickenson, who is another pile of rubbish altogether. Lonely days and cold nights with her father, and no hot little encounters with a horny gardener from Spain. All Emily Bronte needed was a good tango, but I fear that she was too chaste. And so the world must bear the weight of this tragedy, of its endless reprints which will mark the end of Time. Of course you can love this book and curl up with it at night as if it were your secret lover, or teddy bear, (Even if your teddy bear is your secret lover.) and listen to that song by Michael Penn, or whoever wrote that piece of yack. I don't care. I believe that this book sucks, and it is not worthy of being in the Canon. It should be banished to the realm of Cheesy Teeny-Bopperazzi Romance Goo in the back of a used book store somewhere in Northern Alberta."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was put through this 'book' when studying Higher English. It is undoubtedly the single worst piece of literature I have ever had to read. What is worse that I had to read it twice, take notes, answer questions, memorize quotes, and in 9 days am sitting an exam in which it will feature rather heavily. You cannot truly hate a book until you have studied it in detail. The problem with it is the fact that about half the words in the book are adjectives. E. Bronte spends so long lavishing useless and totally superfluous descriptions on every scene that I dozed off and missed any point that the events may have had. Then there is Heathcliff, who actually does very little, but merely has circumstances favour him about a dozen times - and he's supposed to be one of the most evil characters ever? The rest of the characters are not much better - they are flat and predictable, although I can't imagine why anyone would be interested enough to wonder about what's going to happen. By the end, I was wondering if I'd fallen asleep and missed the climax - which would have been possible - but I could account for every excruciating page and therefore I can only conclude that the trivial, unsurprising non-events that the narrative lurched between were supposed to be climactic. If this is a classic story, then so is an eight-page picture book that's only strength is very detailed - but not well-drawn - pictures. Please feel free to send me mail to argue about my review."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I began reading--&quot;though you mayn't believe it,&quot; to quote Lewis Carroll's Mock Turtle--at the age of 1 and 9 months. Since then I have read literally thousands of books. And of them all, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is my least favorite. The characters are so unpleasant and cruel to each other that reading the book is a seemingly endless nightmare. It seems that almost everyone in the story eventually dies some physically or psychologically horrible death, and the two major characters other than the two first-person narrators get engaged to each other at the end in an attempt to give the book a bizarre happy ending. About the only good thing about the book is its intriguing narrative structure, in which a man sets down in his diary a long first-person narrative told him by a woman who sometimes repeats briefer stories told her in the first person by others, such as Catharine. Even this, though, is rendered irritating by the fact that the diarist is such an boring and annoying character. I would never have continued reading this book beyond the first few chapters had it not been a school assignment, and I felt a greater sense of relief when I finished it than on any other occasion in my life. To quote what C. S. Lewis once wrote on the last page of a book he had read (I forget which one), &quot;Never again.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Don't buy this book without reading carefully the description.

I would recommend it only if you like drama, and romance.This book follows many stories, of basically 3 families. This story gets really complicated. It's really hard to explain without spoiling the book. The best way that I can explain, is that a rich girl falls in love with a servant, and is \\"not allowed\\" to be with him, because of the standards of the time, (the late 1700s). The story follows the lives of these two individuals and what happens to them in their lives.Like I said before, this was an interesting plot. I have seen the movie with Laurence Olivier, and I have to say I like the movie better, but I did see the movie first. I think that you should give this book a try and find out for yourself what you think of \\"Wuthering Heights\\"."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My friend complained bitterly to me how horrible this book was, and curious, I decided to pick up a copy. I was impressed by Bronte's work.. I like how she illustrates the passion and love evident between Cathy and Heathcliff... it is one of the most moving storylines I've read. It's a good classic, and although it's tragic, there are glimpses of happiness here and there in the novel, and the novel ends on a peaceful, concluding note.However, the Yorkshire accent nearly killed me... it was hard to read--I skipped the Yorkshire dialogues almost completely. Also I felt like strangling Cathy and Heathcliff... it was all perfect, but then she had to go do her thing... Yes, I know this was the whole point of the story--conflict--but still, it could have been happier. The novel was very touching and I was left speechless as I quietly closed the book, because Ms. Bronte knows how to describe two people in fervent (though at times.. rampant?) love and how it will endure the tests of time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When I first read this book I was a little confused at first. The beginning has random names coming at you, but once you get to Nelly laying out the story--I was hooked.I loved this passion and heartbreaking love story. Catherine and Heathcliff are extremely believeable as two star-crossed lovers, who had to hide their love. Their passion is so burning, yet so forbidden that you want to burst.Heathcliff is the best romantic hero of all literature. You just want him to succeed in his good or evil deeds.I think EVERYONE wants a love as strong as Catherine and Heathcliff's. A must read!If you love the book, the best movie version is the 1939 one.I don't get the people who didn't like this book--what were the words too big?But all in all, there is a reason why Wuthering Heights is called one of the greatest love stories and pieces of literature of our time!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a book filled with many complex characters, ranging from a self-righteous servant, to a dishonest housekeeper, to a saucy young lady, to a bitter old man. Emily Bronte did an excellent job of creating interesting characters and a riveting plotline. The book starts out in the \\"present\\" which is in the early 1800's. A couple chapters in, Mr. Lockwood, the tenant at Thrushcross Grange asks his housekeeper what the deal is with his landlord, Mr. Heathcliff, and the others that Lockwood has met at Wuthering Heights. His housekeeper, Nelly, proceeds to relate the story of all that took place, going back three generations in time to begin the story. The book is filled with characters that you both like and hate at the same time, and the story is also an interesting study in betrayal, revenge, and forgiveness. The only negative comment I have about the book comes about the character Joseph. Joseph's speech is written in the dialect of the hills area of 19th century England, and is extremely difficult to read or understand. Many times, you as the reader will be able to infer from the surrounding text the general idea of what is being said, but it is often difficult. Overall, I think Wuthering Heights is an excellent book, and definitely worth a buy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a tale of romance, bitterness, and forgiveness. It is a story that will leaving you feeling sorry for some characters and even bitter towards others. The beginning of the story introduces Heathcliff, a young boy who has had a hard childhood and been left alone. Bront leads you to feel sorry for him. Much of the book is the story of Heathcliff's life, and how it plays into the lives of the other characters. I see through Heathcliff's life a life lesson: through our difficulties in life, we have two choices. We can let these things make us stronger people, or we can let the troubles ruin us. Let's just say that Bront doesn't choose the \\"storybook\\" path for Heathcliff's life.This novel is one I would recommend reading. On this note, don't get discouraged reading the first few chapters--they were the most difficult of the book. Once you get past these, and begin to understand the story line, Wuthering Heights is an enjoyable book. If you don't like a typical romance, read this book anyway! There's nothing typical about it. Bront filled her pages with anger, passion, romance, and various emotions. She will capture your attention as you become entangled in the web of confused relationship between Edgar and Catherine, Catherine and Heathcliff, Cathy and Linton and others."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a tale filled with love, hate and the unexpected on every page. Three generations of characters are portrayed, each having a distinct personality and story. The main character, Heathcliff's situation and position as a young child causes the reader to have sympathy. It may even leave the person with a sense of grief and sorrow for the child who seems to be the victim of the plot. Don't be fooled! Heathcliff deserves not to be seen as a victim but rather a villain for the agony, grieve, and heartache that he inflicts on so many lives. The novel picks up rather slowly and takes a number of chapters before the reader is best able to understand the major characters. The plot twists and turns and is filled with enticing details to keep the reader engaged.I would highly encourage reading this only work by Emily Bronte. While this book will cause the reader to feel a mixture of emotions it is definitely a must read. Determine for yourself whether you feel sympathy for Heathcliff or you think he is the heinous villain who causes the unease and chaos found in almost every chapter. This work left me cringing at many of the terrible details but all and all it is a tremendous piece of literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a book about love and forgiveness. Emily Bronte keeps our attention through the passion of the main characters and powerful quotes such as, \\"My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and HE remained, I should still continue to be.....Nelly, I AM Heathcliff! He's always, always in mind: not as a pleasure......but as my own being.\\"Bronte's book starts out kind of slow, but as you continue reading through, the story picks up and captures your attention. The dynamic of the characters and their relationships with one another brings such enthusiasm to the story that as you read through, you find yourself becoming a part of the story- you find yourself wanting to tell Nelly Dean to speak up and stop withholding information and you want talk to Catherine and tell her to give Heathcliff a chance and you want to tell Heathcliff that he needs to forgive so many people in his life so that he can have a chance at a real and peaceful life! Bronte does an excellent job bringing her characters to life.The story also has an element of surprise woven throughout- which keeps you coming back to continue reading through each chapter. Bronte goes through three generations of this particular family in a way that is captivating and exciting. As the story unfolds you get to see how each character is related to the other while discovering why they are like they are- you realize why Heathcliff is so bitter and why Hareton is so under-educated and why young Catherine is living with her father-in-law and cousins.The ending is not as satisfying as the rest of the book, but it does end in a uniquely mysterious way.http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&nodeID;="},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The first time I heard of Wuthering Heights, was honestly when I was reading one of the Twilight series novels and the main character was reading it. So, I was glad to have the opportunity to read this and see what it was all about. After finishing it, I still would recommend reading this book. It is truly an interesting love story. Now, even though it is a love story, I bet you have not read about this kind of love. It is a tragic and dark story of a passionate and consuming devotion. Emily Bronte had the ability to intertwine the love between Catherine and Heathcliff in every scene and relationship the characters shared. Bronte uses great description of her characters as the narrator, Nelly, tells the of the lives at Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. What you should know before you read this, is that some of the language of the servants is hard to understand. However, try to push through it and you will be able to get a rough understanding of what the character was trying to say. Besides this, Wuthering Heights will keep you entertained and wondering who's love is true and how the novel concludes."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily BronteI wasn't sure exactly what to expect when I picked up Wuthering Heights to read from my one college course, but I was, over time, pleasantly surprised. The first five chapters proved, for me, to be the most challenging, simply because I was adapting to Bronte's writing style. Honestly, if you frequently read literature from this time period then you will have no problem settling in. It took no time to realize that Emily paid close to attention to the development of her characters. After finishing the book I felt extremely acquainted with each character, and felt almost a loss when I had to say goodbye. One of the things I struggled with was Joseph's dialogue throughout the book. He was hard to follow, and I can't help but say that it almost distracted from the plot in comparison to enhancing it. Bronte told one of the strangest love stories in relation to how each individual expressed their affections. It's a story that leaves the reader at times a little bit baffled at the outcome, but it also creates unprecedented twist in turns throughout the book. It's also a book that I believe has a huge amount to say about forgiveness, and can shed light on its importance through learning from others who make poor decisions. To be honest, there are very few books that transport you directly into the world of the writer like Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I would definitely classify Wuthering Heights as one of the best books I've read. Packed with drama and intrigue, this piece of art will keep you riveted throughout. Written in old English, it is absolutely fascinating how Emily Bronte pieced this intricate storyline together. Besides the slight difficulty in visualizing Joseph's speech, with a strong Yorkshire accent, I found it relatively easy to read. The chaos and insanity that pursues throughout this novel kept me coming back for more, with sadness when I reached the end because it was over. The characters are developed well through different circumstances, depicted through the eyes of the housekeeper, Nelly Dean - a conniving participant in the drama. Be prepared to have your emotions run away with you as you get caught up in the action. It's a great book to sit down and sift through on a cold, winter's day. I found the story very realistic in the portrayal of everyday choices made through these diverse, strange characters, and could even relate to them in some senses. This controversial book would be a great choice to use in a book club where you would have the opportunity to discuss the outcomes and potentials Bronte confronts."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Passion for the passionless: A battle of the hearts!Emily Bronte, though only in her 20's, manifested one of the most unforgettable dark love stories of all times. Though her book was not well received after it was first published, the volume and the positive feedback she has received hundreds of years later speaks in volumes for the masterful quality of Wuthering Heights! Standing in stark contrast with a fairy tale love story, Bronte embarked on a difficult quest of being realist lessons and qualities into the passion she was skillfully gifted with.Bronte developed and heighted this sensational love story through numerous characters in the story and throughout three generations. Such love unfolds with a girl named Catherine, raised in the moors of England, and a gypsy boy named Heathcliff, a homeless starving boy that was saved from death by Catherine's father. Through the years, their affection for one another turns into a wild passion that will stand through the tests and the trials they create. At the ages of 16 and 17 years old, a misunderstanding occurred between the two lovers and created a permanent wedge between them forever. Heathcliff had disappeared for three years and Catherine had married a passionless man, Edgar Linton. Tension picks back up when Heathcliff suddenly reappears on Catherine's doorstep, eager to rekindle the passion that he is so determined that they both shared. From this encounter, Catherine's heath declines and she later dies, but the last kiss she bears is Heathcliff's. Through her death comes life, as Catherine's last contribution to this world was a daughter named Cathy. During this time a young boy, Linton, was born to the wife of the miserable Heathcliff. After Catherine's death, Heathcliff becomes more revengeful and manipulating than ever. Though his aching from his heart adds fuel to his actions, Heathcliff soon masters in manipulating young Cathy to marry a sickly Linton when they get around the ages of 16 and 17. Though one can see the parallels in linking this relationship to the first, one also sees the difference of a selfless love that goes deeper than just emotions.As you read this novel, you will encounter many of the symbolic and realistic themes that are embedded throughout this novel. The forgiveness theme from this novel has impacted my life, for one can see that the revenge, bitterness, and hurt that Heathcliff lived under this whole life only put him in his grave faster and did not allow him to produce anything successful or hopeful. In addition, one can see a glimpse of what true love looks like. True love is not an emotion, an appearance, or even an action. It a selfless love that penetrates one's soul, like that of young Cathy and Hareton walking in the moors that looks beyond the faults and seeks to better the other person involved. As a fellow Christian, this love reminds me to that of the Biblical love in a marriage that we are too represent. Though I liked majority of the book, I disliked how Bronte used the old dialect for Joseph. I would highly encourage readers of this amazing book to get a published form that will have side notes at the bottom revealing what Joseph is talking about. I found that he didn't have a huge role in the book except for stability, but he does make some key statements that I felt the dialect lessened the importance of their intended impact. I would encourage anyone who is interested in this book to buy a copy and read it! It truly is a classic on every level. It gives a whole new light into the human depths of a romantic tragedy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is the name of the house where the love story between Heathcliff and Catherine takes place.

Great value."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"One of my personal criteria of a \\"classic\\" novel - and a reason these certain books are read and re-read throughout the years - is some kind of illumination of our human nature. 'Wuthering Heights,' in my opinion, is one of these novels. On the surface, it is a love story. But deeper than that, the characters could be any of us. How many times have we been our own worst enemy? In this story, the characters make decisions that we, as the reader, know are the wrong decisions. Yet it is easy to identify with the mistakes that the characters make. Any of us could (and have) made those same wrong decisions. Perhaps this is why this novel has resonated with so many readers and made the story so timeless.Read it for a good story, then think about it later and put yourself in the character's shoes. I think you'll find it illuminating and something that will stick with you a long, long time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is almost unique among classic literature for the point of view from which it is told. Various people who are not principal to the story are telling what they saw to a man new to the area. So the amount available for telling is much less than were the story told from the all-knowing point of view of most novels or the first person point of view. It is astonishing how well the author uses this limited point of view to relate the passions and fears of the principal characters. Anyone who has not read Wuthering Heights as an assignment in high school or college should read it for the enjoyment. It well deserves its reputation as a classic of English literature. The book has been made into movies a number of times, so many people who have never read the book are familiar with the story, or at least to the end of the first generation. Even if you know the story, you will enjoy the beauty of the book as literature. The book is also a powerful statement against the limitations in legal rights of women at the time. It is this powerlessness which produces the tragedy in the second generation. So the book can be read as a women's lib argument; I have no idea if the author intended to make such an argument; it's not being in any way a polemic makes the point in a very matter of fact way, but the reader is aware nonetheless.Read Wuthering Heights if you can; you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have to disagree with previous reviewers who called Heathcliff evil. I dont believe so at all. He is a driven man full of passion and emotion. And when his life is shattered he scrambles to find some dignity, pride and content. It is through unfortunate circumstances surrounding him that he never finds them no matter how hard he searches for them.Heathcliff grows up with Catherine. They share a special connection throughout their childhood and adolescence. Catherine is the only person who can talk him out of a mood, cheer him up and make him laugh. He shares his dreams and secrets with her. Heathcliff is deeply in love with her and for a time believes that love is returned.But Catherine is a foolish and sometimes cruel girl who is a product of her upbringing. She knows Heathcliff is a poor nobody of dubious lineage and she doubts that he will ever amount to much. She wants to marry someone who is her social equal, someone who will keep her in style and give her social standing. So she selfishly marries Linton without even once giving a thought to anyone or anything else. The fact that Linton is Heathcliff's sworn enemy doesnt bother her for a second.Heathcliff is completely devastated by the marriage. Not only does the love of his life becomes completely out of his reach, she also becomes the wife and the lover of the man that he hates. His heart and innocent youthfull illusions shattered, Heathcliff leaves and doesn't return for many years.Catherine meanwhile realizes her mistake. She is completely bored in her marriage, more she is a very strong woman and runs roughshod over her husband. Her husband's weak character disgusts her, but she is trapped. There is no way out of the loveless marriage. She has made her bed and now must lie in it.Heathcliff spends years yearning money and accumulating a fortune just so that he could prove to Catherine and to everyone else that he is in fact worthy of her. He comes back to rub the fact in her face. He wants to make her hurt as she made him hurt, to show her the kind of a mistake she made so that she could regret it for the rest of her life. Heathcliff comes back a harsh and a bitter man bent on revenge. He wants to get his back after having his heart ripped out.But revenge does not bring him any satisfaction, for Catherine is near her deathbed. She dies giving birth to her daughter. And now Heathcliff is left with nothing. His life has no more meaning without Catherine in it, for the second time in his life he has the rug yanked out from beneath his feet. He vows to bring revenge on the Lintons and that becomes his only reason for living. The hate and the anticipation of revenge sustain him through years.Many years and many deaths later, Heathcliff has achieved no satisfaction. His life is empty and he is all alone. He lives with Catherine( the daughter) and his knephew. He hates them both, Catherine because he blames her for her mother's death and Hareton because of his father. All of his attempts at revenge have brought him no solace. He is just a shell of a man, sustaining from day to day with no real purpose. All of the people he hoped to bring revenge against are all dead and he is tired of living. And so ends a life full of passion and volatile emotion, anger and hearbreak. Only in death does Heathcliff finally achieve his peace.There are no words to describe how much I loved this book. It took me on an emotional roller coaster from page one and until the bitter end. I could not help but symphasize with Heathcliff and experience emotions as he was feeling them. The book is incredibly powerful, emotional, dark and brooding with some light relief at the end. Its heartwarming to know that Catherine's daughter at least found some happiness. But the thought remains, Catherine and Heathcliff never did..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is often unfairly labeled as a &quot;Gothic romance.&quot; Well, obviously that is one way of looking at it, but I don't see what &quot;romance&quot; has to do with it. The main characters, Cathy and Heathcliff, have one of the most twisted and obsessive relationships I have ever seen. I wouldn't exactly call it a romance;more of some bitter love that the orphaned Heathcliff cannot let go of when Cathy marries another, has a child, and dies. He spends eternity taking out his revenge on the later generation, making this one of the darkest ideas of love that I have ever read. But then, that's why I like it. It shows that sometimes romance is not that pretty. In fact, it's pretty darn self-destructive. A great read, my favorite out of any I have ever read before."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a surprisingly modern novel given that its authorship predates our modern understanding of psychology. Like many modern novels, Ms. Bronte has also explored the darker side of human passions and psyches more thoroughly than the sunnier side. Heathcliff will remind you of classic characters whose lives were twisted by fate like Captain Ahab in Moby Dick, Erik in Phantom of the Opera, Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, and the mysterious prisoner in The Man in the Iron Mask.If there were ever two star-crossed lovers who have captured the world's imagination since Romeo and Juliet, they must be Catherine and Heathcliff. Yet, unlike, many such pairs, their unhappiness is heavily influenced by themselves.As you contemplate their story, you are constantly drawn to the thought, \\"what if\\" thus and such had occurred differently? That's part of the great power of the story because it has so many unexpected twistings and turnings. A reader's expectations from a love story are turned upside down, sideways and diagonal from where those expectations normally rest. As a result, you'll probably decide this isn't a love story after all . . . but a tragedy. Taken from that perspective, you'll find yourself hearing echoes of Lady Macbeth and King Lear as you contemplate what occurs when the natural order is disturbed. Few English authors since Shakespeare have captured that sense of what can happen when the universe is disarranged.What's great about this story? It's pretty simple: Emotional intensity in the writing; deeply memorable characters; doomed lovers; and a haunting glimpse at unshakeable obsession.What's not so great? The story development itself is pretty awkward. Much of the story is told in flashback which steals power and immediacy from the narration. If ever a story cried out for being told in the first person (by Heathcliff, Catherine, Edgar Linton, Hareton and young Catherine), it's Wuthering Heights. The transitions from one key moment to another are often very abrupt. Sometimes it is 150 pages later before you get the full sense of what Emily Bronte meant to convey in some of those transitions.What's less than great? The characters aren't nearly as appealing as those you'll usually find in a novel dealing with these issues. In that sense, the novel is more realistic than fictional . . . which helps create some of its immense power. It's probably a worthwhile price to pay.Whatever you think of Wuthering Heights, you owe it to yourself to read one of the most moving tales that has ever been written. Pick a time when you're feeling reasonably happy to start the book. Otherwise, you may find your mood to be more than a little darkened for a few days."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As the editor of this volume, I wanted to point out its differences from many other editions of Wuthering Heights. This one contains the short story, &quot;The Bridegroom of Barna,&quot; believed to be the most influential source for the novel. It also collects essays about Emily Bronte that are not published elsewhere with the novel. I may be biased, but I think this is a great edition of the novel and is particularly good for college classes on the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"How do you define a classic? Some might say that which stands the test of time. By that definition alone Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" merits the designation of classic. To the best of my knowledge it has been made into four films. I've not seen them all but would surely recommend the version starring Sir Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon and David Niven. It has been assigned reading in countless high school and college classroom, and printed throughout the world in numerous editions.Now, Penguin Audio gives us the opportunity to enjoy this story of love not meant to be in a superb audio edition read by Prunella Scales and Samuel West. Fans of the incredibly popular BBC series \\"Fawlty Towers\\" will remember Scales as Sybil. Here, she is Cathy incarnate and a prime narrator when assuming the voice of Nelly Dean. A popular actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company, West brings both pathos and drama to the hopes and final bitter heartbreak found in Heathcliff.As we hear in the voices of Mr. Lockwood and housekeeper Nelly Dean, Heathcliff was an orphan with no home to call his own so he came to Wuthering Heights where he is not only given shelter but also friendship by Catherine Earnshaw, daughter of the wealthy owner. But, eventually Heathcliff asks for more than friendship - he proposes marriage. When he is cruelly rebuffed his love turns to a desire for revenge.How sad that Emily Bronte lived for only 30 years. How fortunate for us that her legacy is the incomparable \\"Wuthering Heights.\\"- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, considered a defining work of Gothic Romance literature is essentially the narrated story of two individuals at the end of the 19th century, Catherine and Heathcliff, and their passionate love for each other which is never consummated. The story takes place basically in two estates in Yorkshire&iexcl;s moors, and its intricate plot involves two generations of characters living in these houses.I found Wuthering Heights to be very a very enjoyable book mainly because of the unbridled emotional intensity present in the story. Each of the characters are bounded by love or hatred, often to a very twisted and irrational extreme. The passions of these characters eventually lead to great acts of cruelty and vengeance, creating a very vibrant, tragic, and intense storyline.I also liked the fact that there very few actual characters in the book, however Bronte manages to make them very vivid, and their personalities and relationships with other characters consistently changes throughout the story as a result of events. Often I would really pity certain characters, or feel shocked and angered at many of their actions; it&iexcl;s simply very hard to not be almost pulled into the book&iexcl;s setting. Until the last few pages of the book, it really seemed as if the anguish and torment of the characters would continue endlessly. Therefore I was quite amazed Bronte managed to create a tranquil, satisfying ending, however I do feel that the ending was just a bit TOO satisfying, since it didn&iexcl;t leave me with very much to think about.Overall, it&iexcl;s a very beautifully written book vivid even in its descriptions of the beauty of the Yorkshire countryside, and one that really stirs the reader&iexcl;s emotions and feelings. This is definitely a great read for anybody in high school or above."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It was good to read the classic book, WUTHERING HEIGHTS.

It centers on the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff, or rather the lack of a real one...the basis of their passion for each other is pretty thin, which makes the depths of Heathcliff's obsession with her pretty hard to understand. That characterization didn't seem true to life to me anyway---rather than being passionate about one thing to the exclusion of everything else like that, people are usually passionate in general or mean all around, not this precarious mixture of the two.The story really picked up for me in the latter part, when Heathcliff attempts to continue taking out his grievances on the subsequent generation, whose ultimate fate redeemed the novel for me. So, definitely worth a read, just make sure to stick with it all the way through to the end. Still, I definitely didn't love it as much as I did Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up.

Cannot find these classics in the stores and this way my kids will be able to enjoy as well."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I first purchased the novel a couple of years ago while I was still a teenager, and the book was difficult at first read. Over the years I've reread the pages again and again, in particular the beginning pages, which introduces us to Lockwood, who is first person narrator. The book is still difficult because of the layers, reading into first person commented. There is also a chronology in the narrating, and a complicated connection between past and present. Also the diction is complicated because two people are telling the story at the same time, because mr Lockwood is listening to Nelly most of the time.Nelly is a clear narrator of story between Catherine, Heathcliff, and always includes the involvement of everyone else (Edgar, Hindley, Isabella, Nelly herself), and also the second generation (Hareton, Linton, the young daughter of Catherine who shares her name).Catherine passes away very soon since giving birth to daughter Catherine, and her ghost lives on, in the spirit of her daughter, and in Wuthering Heights. Her ghost touches Lockwood early in the novel, before he reads her diary material, and he possibly closest sees her in the daughter, whom he says is beautiful. Lockwood has never met the first Catherine, but he has met Heathcliff. Lockwood is intrigued by Heathcliff, and by the story Nelly tells. We find out that Nelly is only two years age difference with the first Catherine, and apart from being the objective story teller, she is also passive narrator, because she is immediately involved with the subplot at the same time. She talks to Catherine and Heathcliff, she doesn't understand their love, but she looks after young Catherine at Thrushcroft Grange since her mother passes away. Also the relationsip between Catherine and Heathcliff is platonic, as told by her, and there is never physical or sexual interaction told by Nelly. Catherine had her daughter with husband, Edgar, not Heathcliff, but she never kisses, sleeps with or has sexual or physical interaction with Heathcliff, and critics sometimes pay attention to that happening when they read the novel. Less of the elder Catherine is told because she passes away under halfway through the course of the book. Most of the connection readers continue to feel is still platonic.The novel is very beautiful, because of the nature described about Wuthering Heights and Thrushcroft Grange. We know it is a world removed, as young Catherine marries Linton first (first cousin through Isabella and Edgar being siblings), then she marries Hareton (first cousin through Catherine and Hindley were siblings), but being married to cousins is still a taboo today. This makes it less surprising the novel was so controversial when it was first released, and critics sometimes still find it difficult to get interpretations around Catherine and Heathcliff's love, but although the novel was heavily criticised when first released, it found a place in critics' hearts over a vast amount of time. Readers can eventually come to understanding the book after reading and retracing, and in the end it was always worth the effort of rereading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Everyone I know who read Wuthering Heights hated it. Said it was sad and the people were horrid. I actually enjoyed it. Yes, they were silly people who held in their feeling until it was too late and concentrated on revenge other than trying to make the best of life, but that's what makes it so great. Plenty of life lessons in this novel. I loved the ending. How one person could find a way and make everything right. Of course, I don't want to spoil it for you, just know that it is worth reading it through to the end to see how Emily brings everything full circle."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When I ordered this book, the \\"Bed Book\\" was not clarified very clearly or I missed the point of what the bed book meant.

I dreaded the prospect of reading a Victorian romance. I think I may have even seen the Hollywood interpretation with Olivier. ( A poor pale and distant echo of the novel as it turns out). I read it because I was forced to. I was determined to dislike it. Even after starting the book I continued to criticize the foppish Lockwood wandering inanely about the moors in the classroom.There is no comparable book I have ever read. Its impact stays with you forever. Other reviewers are for more eloquent, but the vivid imagery and violent emotions of the protagonists is unparalleled. I have recommended this book to family and friends over the years, badgering them into reading it. The result is often the same. It was not what they were expecting and simply a great book. Perhaps they were being polite, who knows.If you have yet to read it, I envy you. That first reading is so memorable and surprising.You too will come to wonder \\"how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Published in 1847, WUTHERING HEIGHTS was not well received by the reading public, many of whom condemned it as sordid, vulgar, and unnatural--and author Emily Bronte went to her grave in 1848 believing that her only novel was a failure. It was not until 1850, when WUTHERING HEIGHTS received a second printing with an introduction by Emily's sister Charlotte, that it attracted a wide readership. And from that point the reputation of the book has never looked back. Today it is widely recognized as one of the great novels of English literature.Even so, WUTHERING HEIGHTS continues to divide readers. It is not a pretty love story; rather, it is swirling tale of largely unlikeable people caught up in obsessive love that turns to dark madness. It is cruel, violent, dark and brooding, and many people find it extremely unpleasant. And yet--it possesses a grandeur of language and design, a sense of tremendous pity and great loss that sets it apart from virtually every other novel written.The novel is told in the form of an extended flashback. After a visit to his strange landlord, a newcomer to the area desires to know the history of the family--which he receives from Nelly Deans, a servant who introduces us to the Earnshaw family who once resided in the house known as Wuthering Heights. It was once a cheerful place, but Old Earnshaw adopted a \\"Gipsy\\" child who he named Heathcliff. And Catherine, daughter of the house, found in him the perfect companion: wild, rude, and as proud and cruel as she. But although Catherine loves him, even recognizes him as her soulmate, she cannot lower herself to marry so far below her social station. She instead marries another, and in so doing sets in motion an obsession that will destroy them all.WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a bit difficult to \\"get into;\\" the opening chapters are so dark in their portrait of the end result of this obsessive love that they are somewhat off-putting. But they feed into the flow of the work in a remarkable way, setting the stage for one of the most remarkable structures in all of literature, a story that circles upon itself in a series of repetitions as it plays out across two generations. Catherine and Heathcliff are equally remarkable, both vicious and cruel, and yet never able to shed their impossible love no matter how brutally one may wound the other.As the novel coils further into alcoholism, seduction, and one of the most elaborately imagined plans of revenge it gathers into a ghostly tone: Heathcliff, driven to madness by a woman who is not there but who seems reflected in every part of his world--dragging her corpse from the grave, hearing her calling to him from the moors, escalating his brutality not for the sake of brutality but so that her memory will never fade, so that she may never leave his mind until death itself. Yes, this is madness, insanity, and there is no peace this side of the grave or even beyond.It is a stunning novel, frightening, inexorable, unsettling, filled with unbridled passion that makes one cringe. Even if you do not like it, you should read it at least once--and those who do like it will return to it again and again.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Rather than delve on the contents of this strangest and strongest of English novels, so intensely poetic in its haunting darkness and otherness, I'll comment briefly on the best editions available for a good first contact:A) Text oriented editions (that is, editions with few materials added: normally an Introduction, annotation, and perhaps Charlotte's Peface and Biographical Notice and some bibliographical indications).1. Oxford World's Classics: authoritative text, good annotation,excellent introduction.2. Penguin's Classics: same as above, everything looks a little shorter but is excellent nonetheless.3. Wordsworth Classics edition. This would be a rather fine edition as befitting this collection, if it had a good 1847 text and not the heavily tampered-with Charlotte's 1850 edition. The text itself reflects accurately that of the 1900 Haworth Edition -a careful one-. The wording changes aren't perhaps so worrying nor is the toning-down of the dialectal tirades -although funny and useless-. What is worrying is the disappearance of more than six hundred paragrapph entries (I mean just the paragraphing, not the contents itself!), that makes for a different -and worse- reading experience. Very good and full -if brief- annotation. Mass-market, glued paperback.4. Heather Glen's for Routledge. One of the finest text-oriented editions, especially for the excellent Introduction and Epilogue together with its good annotation, out-of-print for rather obscure reasons. If you find still a very good to fine copy at amazon Canadian branch (or at abebooks.com, it would be a good buy.5. Orchises two-volume facsimile reprint of the 1847 edition. No notes nor any additional material. the books are well produced if a little expensive. Very interesting item, but only suitable for textual scholars or would-be scholars, or otherwise for fetish-oriented WH-maniacs.B) Study-oriented editions (i.e. editions that contain additional contextual information: early reviews, selection of Emily's poems, critical essays, chronologies of the novel or of the Bronte family...).6. Norton's Fourth Edition (current item): OK, the text is still a little idiosyncratic, but the notes are much improved, and so is everything else (with the anthology of poems, and the critical essays). A very fine study edition but also suitable for a first contact, although annotation is still on the scarce side. Good paperback production without flaps but signature-sewn (or so it seems) and good paper and printing quality (albeit with a rather small type).7. Broadview edition by Beth Newman: it's one of the best study editions overall. There are some minor textual foibles and the annotation is decidedly scanty (to make amends for Heywood excesses) but good and accurate, and both Prof. Newman ecellent Introduction and the selection of the additional contextual material is, arguably, the finest ever (including the very interesting document on \\"Brain fever\\"). Materially speaking, it is a good paperback without flaps with good paper and printing quality (like Norton Critical, although I can't ascertain without tearing apart my copy of Beth Newman's that it be signature-sewn instead of glue-only \\"perfect binding). In any case a very good buy.7. Alison Booth's for Longman Cultural. Other of the very best study editions available. The text is deadly acuurate -except for some 1850 unobtrusive detail- on theClarendon 1976 reference critical edition, although the punctuation -like Norton Critical, Broadview's Newman and Oneworld's one- has been silently lightened and modernized throughout. It looks like glue-only \\"perfect binding\\" paperback, but perhaps it is signature-sewn. Paper and printing quality are good enough. The only misgiving I have is the overdone fragmentation of contextual material (good and relevant material though it is): there are 40+ items, many of them very short or they wouldn't fit into 430 pages. One of the best possible buys.8. Onewold's Classics edition. A fine paperback edition with flaps, very good paper and printing quality and (I rather surmise than know for sure) signature-sewn. The text looks like 1847 in paragraphing but it takes in toomany of 1850 \\"improvements\\" and is wrong at some places: it's short of a disaster, but rather non-reliable (in spite of the well-meant efforts by the almost anonymous editing panel who perpetrated it). Annotation is good and comprehensive enough, but the contextual material is rather scanty and run-of-the-mill non-commital.9. Barnes&Noble;'s Tatiana Holway edition (hardcover). To say it promptly the only fault with this lovely edition (but, as stated above in wordsworth Classics edition, a really big fault) is its accurate and reliable 1850 Haworth Edition text. Other than this, it looks as a popularly oriented edition, but with quality marks. The Introduction by Daphne Merkin is good enough, the annotation by Holway is really excellent. Supplementary material is very scanty: the \\"Charlotte's prefatory materials\\" of 1850 (prefixed to the text, which is a pity), and some comments about film and TV adaptations as well as some chosen excerpts of reviews. Material production is outstanding: nice hardcover with dust jacket, good paper and printing quality, the only good available edition in a becoming format (Clarendon Edition is very hard to come by nowadays: say one to three years to pin it down). Don't forget the Franklin Mint editions of the sixties and seventies if you are interested in a very beautiful book with a reliable 1847 text and illustrations by Alan Reingold (and nothing else)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is a thin line between love and hate, and once Heathcliff crosses it, we see a grand, passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug. Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village.Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, \\"Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?\\"Sound depressing? It's not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one's heart, rather than one's head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off.Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That's the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place.Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher's daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights,\\" Emily Bronte's only published novel, is a saga of two Yorkshire families who live in the remote Pennine Hills of England's North Country. To me the book has always epitomized the best of gothic fiction. The narrative is filled with intensity of feeling, especially Heathcliff's passionate love for his Cathy and hers for him - a love which endures beyond the grave. More than would be lovers, however, the two are soul mates and have been since their childhood. Cathy once told Nelly, her servant and friend: \\"My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be... Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure... but as my own being.\\"Yet, the novel is more than a love story. \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is about hatred, cruelty, delusion, frustrated yearning, obsession, deep despair and vengeance. At times its very darkness is depressing and painful. Yet love and faithfulness, which endure beyond death, bring hope and much needed light to this tale; as does a second love story, born from the seeds of the first. The author also addresses the issues of social class here. Both Linton and Earnshaw families are considered gentry. However, the Linton's are a more educated, cultured group and appear to be of a higher class than those who reside at Wuthering Heights. Some of Catherine's most crucial decisions involve moving up in society.The story is told in a series of narratives, none of which are entirely reliable. During the winter of 1801, a gentleman named Mr. Lockwood rents a manor house called Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire. He has a natural curiosity, and in time visits his neighbor and wealthy landlord, Heathcliff, a grim, forbidding man who lives at Wuthering Heights, a few miles from the Grange. Lockwood also makes the acquaintance of Heathcliff's housekeeper Ellen Dean, called Nelly, and asks her to tell him about her employer and the history of those who reside at Wuthering Heights. He documents her narrative in his journal, and his written recollections make up the main portion of the novel. Much of Nellie's tale consists of memories from years before, her observations of life with the Earnshaw family, her recollections of the Lintons, and her own conclusions, which are subjective. Lockwood, gets his information second hand, from Nellie's perspective. He continually interprets, and misinterprets the relationships and actions of the characters who play such major roles here. So, it is up to the reader to make sense of it all - which is what the author intended.As a young girl Nelly worked as a servant at Wuthering Heights for Mr. Earnshaw, the owner, his wife, and their two children, Hindley, and Catherine. Earnshaw returned from a business trip to Liverpool with a gypsy-like urchin, a dark-haired, handsome orphan boy. He had taken quite a fancy to the lad, a quiet, stoic child, and names him Heathcliff, after a son who died. Earnshaw decides to raise him with his own children. Catherine befriends Heathcliff almost instantly. They share a love of nature, and an emotional intensity unknown to most people. They are able to communicate with each other easily, even as young children, and both possess tremendously creative imaginations. The two roam the moorland wilderness, where they're most at home, like wild creatures of nature, and become inseparable friends. Hindley detests Heathcliff from the first. He is jealous and goads the boy constantly. Eventually, after the death of his wife, Mr. Earnshaw begins to show preference for Heathcliff over his own son, which exacerbates the hostility. Finally, Hindley is sent away to school and Heathcliff is kept at home, at Earnshaw's side.Hindley comes into his inheritance some years later, at age twenty, when his father dies. Cathy is eleven years-old, and Heathcliff about twelve, when the heir returns to Wuthering Heights, and seeks vicious revenge for having his rights usurped by a wretched boy from the slums with no means of his own. Obviously Heathcliff cannot defend himself and is totally dependent on Hindley. He is forced to work as a laborer in the fields, and is treated harshly, as less worthy than an animal. He and Cathy maintain their closeness. They still wander the wild North country and she shares her studies with him. One night they pay a clandestine visit to Thrushcross Grange, home of the Linton family. Cultured, spoiled and very well behaved, young Edgar and Isabella live there. When a dog savagely bites Cathy, it is discovered that she and Heathcliff have been hiding in the brush spying. The girl is seriously injured and is forced to stay at the Grange for several weeks to recover. During her time with the Linton family, Mrs. Linton becomes intent on turning wild, mischievous Cathy into a young lady. She encourages her to become a young woman with manners and actions appropriate to her social standing in society, rather than the wild, headstrong creature she is while roaming the moors with Heathcliff. By the time Catherine returns home, in elegant new clothes, she has become infatuated with Edgar Linton. Needless to say, her relationship with Heathcliff deteriorates significantly, as he feels he is losing the only person he ever loved.Edgar pursues Catherine relentlessly, and eventually, the young woman's desire for social advancement, and an inexplicable fey, self destructive quality about her, prompt her to accept his proposal. However, she really does not love her fiance. She may care for him, but her feelings are much less than what her passionate nature requires. On the other hand genteel women of this period were supposed to have neither \\"passionate\\" nor intense feelings. \\"'Here and here!' replied Catherine, striking one hand on her forehead and the other on her breast: 'in which ever place the soul lives. In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!'\\" Thus Catherine acknowledges to Nelly that her marriage to Edgar cannot be one of love. Although she knows that Heathcliff is her true love, however, she cannot marry him because he has been so debased by Hindley. \\"It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightening, or frost from fire\\". Her powerful connection to Heathcliff is always present, no matter how annoyed she becomes with him. Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights a bitter man. He knows that if he had come from a better social class, or had wealth, Cathy would have married him. When he finally returns, years later, a self-possessed, successful, wealthy man, he is obsessed with revenge, and is more adept at exacting it than Hindley ever was.Nelly continues her increasingly complex tale, (which I won't spoil for you), of three generations: of births, marriages, deaths, traumas, complications, a second more hopeful love story and redemption. The most recurring theme is the great love and friendship, the everlasting connection, between Cathy and her Heathcliff, whose difficult nature is almost impossible to understand and to accept - unless, of course, one thinks about his unknown origins and early childhood as a homeless waif in Liverpool. One can only imagine the horrors he experienced wandering the streets of the rough port town, with neither protection nor kindness. What cruelty and meanness of spirit did he learn there? His terrible, inhuman treatment at Hindley's hands certainly played a part in Heathcliff's lust for revenge and lack of mercy, as did Catherine's decision to marry Linton, which must have been devastating for him. Heathcliff remains a dark, brooding, cruel man throughout his adult years and never reforms. He is an anti-hero, at least in my eyes, as he also possesses good qualities, along with a terrible sadness, an emptiness and longing which he shows to Cathy alone.Emily Bronte's extraordinary prose is filled with powerful imagery. Miss Bront spent most of her short life at home, in Thornton, Yorkshire, where she was happiest. She loved the surrounding moors - the wide, wild expanses, unsuitable for cultivation, and full of danger. There are bogs and wetlands on the moors, which can go virtually unseen, and where one can drown. It is also a place of great beauty. The author spent much time walking there with her dogs and was terribly unhappy when she was away. The similarities between the author's natural environment and that of the area around Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange are obvious. Ms Bronte drew inspiration from the regional Yorkshire architecture also, as well as her own personal experiences and her amazing imagination, a gift Charlotte, Emily, Anne and Branwell Bronte shared - with each other and with us. I have read a few Bronte biographies and always felt that the character of Catherine Earnshaw, certainly her intensity and love of nature, was based on Emily Bronte.Keep a box of tissues handy throughout your reading of \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" I wonder if this is the first tearjerker?JANA"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm 16 and fall into the vast catogory of Wutehring Heights readers who had to finish it for a highschool english assignment. If I hadn't been, er, forced to read it, I never would've encountered this amazing book. The themes that it encompasses, love, hate, revenge, isolation, are so masterfully blended in this book that I found it extremely powerful. True, it is not a romance - it is so much more. I didn't find it confusing, although Joseph's lines had to be read allowed several times before they were actaully understood. The doubling-up of names just increases the sense of isolation within the book, something which I think is rather important to the story. I hardly find this book boring at all, it's passionate and full of action, something which took me completely off guard. Please, give it a chance. And even though he was a complete jerk, my favourite character is still Heathcliff. *G*"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Is there anybody out there who hasn't heard of Heathcliff, the dark villian/hero of this high pitched and utterly committed work of madness? Oh, I love it. It was difficult for me at first. I'm a writer, but not a natural reader. But once I was into this book, once I stopped asking questions of the narrative and just entered the shadowy world of Catherine and her doomed household, I was quite literally spellbound. Bronte died believing this book was a failure. What a dreadful irony that this quiet, disciplined woman who lived out her life in a cold parsons' house with her brilliant sisters, her drunken brother and her eccentric father (The man memorized Paradise Lost: imagine. And outlived all his children!) never even had an inkling that this outpouring of her heart and soul would become a classic, overshadowing even her sister's highly successful Jane Eyre. Both Bronte sisters had the capacity to create archetypes -- to imprint upon the culture seminal patterns that endure to the present time. One last point: the father was Irish. Madness and genius in the blood, indeed. Enjoy it. I read it over every year or so, sometimes twice in a row. I study it; I watch all the film versions. I just love it, the way it works, its strange cruelty and enchantment."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The fact that this novel was written when Emily Bronte was only 28 years old, two years before her death, makes one wonder what she would have been capable of had she lived longer and continued writing. I must admit, this was one of those books that I appreciate for its literary merit more than enjoy for its pure reading pleasure. But if the true test of a novel is how visceral of a reaction the reader has to its characters, then this is certainly a fine novel. Each of Bronte's characters is exquisitely developed in his or her own way. And each evokes powerful emotional responses from the reader - mostly negative reactions of anger, frustration, disgust, etc. - but reactions, nonetheless. A well-written character, remember, does not have to be a character that you admire or love; pathetic, self-centered, cruel characters can be the product of exceptional writing, as long as they evoke genuine feelings of revulsion from the reader.And this novel is full of characters that will earn little admiration from readers. Indeed, the only character that was really \\"likeable\\" was the temporary tenant of the Wuthering Heights estate, to whom the story is recounted by Ellen, the servant. Ellen gives her account of the events that she witnessed as the domestic employee of Catherine, a self-centered, melodramatic eccentric who falls in love with Heathcliff, the gypsy who under somewhat mysterious circumstances is brought by her father to live in their home. Despite her love, Catherine marries Edgar, causing Heathcliff to devote the remainder of his years to exacting revenge for her betrayal. What follows is a dark, brutal, sometimes frightening tale of a pathological love affair and its tragic consequences.Bronte certainly did not view the world through rose-colored glasses, if Wuthering Heights is any indication of her personal world view. It can be a difficult read at times, only because the few redeemable qualities of the main characters are so powerfully overshadowed by their flaws, their cruel intentions, and the bleak outlook that Bronte portrays. It certainly deserves its place, however, among the classics of English literature, and its characters, despite their shortcomings (or perhaps because of them), will live long in the readers mind after the final page."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Jane Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights not to show what love IS. But what love can DO to those who are encompassed by desire. This novel is simply brilliant and by far the greatest novel of the Brontes and (in my opinion) the greatest novel ever written. I say this because Emily laid aside all the conventional types of victorian writing and imbued her novel with persons and events that are not ordinary, but utterly fascinating. Almost completely unrealistic at times, yet perfectly sound in their meanings. Some say to me that Wuthering Heights is impossible to enjoy. While others say they dislike the characters so much that they had to stop reading. I also hear that they cannot figure out all the plot twist and turns. But I say, is this not what REAL-LIFE is? There is no certainty of happiness in the lives of Catherine and Heathcliff. Certainly there is no certainty of happiness for ANYONE in the novel. (Which goes the same for all of us.) As wretched as this seems, Emily (in my opinion) did not write a full blown epic of true romance, despite what many say they love about this novel. She took humans and turned them into what is surprizingly MORE realistic. Emily filled them with faults and turned Cathy and Heathcliff into selfish and undeserving people who destroy each other, not out of love, but out of greed and their own unharnessable animal-like behaviour of what love was TO THEM. What they do and say isn't romantic, but a sign (or even a warning from Emily) of what self indulgence and obsession can do to people pushed beyond their limits of common sense. Cathy and Heathcliff brought themselves to believe that their love was REAL, when in fact their grasp of love was (as Charlotte said, PERVERTED.) Unrelenting in it's destructivness, thus leading to the various calamities their actions bestowed upon the (somewhat) innocent people surrounding them. As brilliant as this novel is, the greatness lies in the story telling of the many different characters we meet. The many different view points from Nellie to Edgar to Isabella and Hindley, spread across the pages and show you how they interact and react with one another as they expierence the situations which seem so very wild and incredible yet ring so very true. This (to me) is not exactly a novel about unbending love. But more of a study of the weaknesses that is stored in everyman. Emily gave us a written guide to show that following your instincts and passions is not always the best path to take. And Emily accomplished this with the most brilliant and unsurpassed written novel in history. It's pages burn with life and it's characters speak in tongues which, even now, I cannot always fully understand. Wuthering Heights can be looked upon as a fascinating study of a particular human race (at what could be any time frame) covering the ground of but a few persons, admist the many open miles... Thank you for your eyes..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As with other Wuthering Heights editions, I will not delve into the depths of this strangest and strongest of novels, with its haunting poetical intensity, its everyday realism, its display of physical and psychical violence, its metaphysical contents and its eerie beautiful otherness. As the noted critic C. A. Swinburne put it in 1883:\\"It may be true that not many will ever take it to their hearts: it is certain that those who do like it will like nothing very much better in the whole world of poetry or prose\\".By the way, whatever the edition you end up with (or none), don't forget to havea try with Emily Bront&eacute; poems, or a sensible selection from them. I realize that this review is by far too long: so, if you are in a hurry, I think that you can skip safely to the last paragraph (\\"SO WHAT?\\") for practical recommendations.The real issue that we face now is: how much does THIS PARTICULAR EDITION of Emily Bront's novel measure up to its intended goal? How does it compare with other editions currently available?Beginning with the bottom line, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST \\"STUDY\\" EDITIONS EVER, together with Beth Newman's one for Broadview Press and Dunn's one for Norton Critical (4th edition). By a \\"study\\" edition (in roughly the same sense as a \\"study\\" Bible), I mean one that is richly annotated, with an interesting Introduction and a variety of context-oriented documents, such as critical reviews or essays, biographical or chronological items, a selection of poems or other writings... Such an edition must be evaluated firstly by his handling (more or less scholarly or careful) of the TEXT(s) involved, then by the choice of supplementary materials (whether interesting or not, balanced or else), in third place by the quality and accuracy of the Introduction and notes, ending with very important issues of design (user-friendly, beautiful) and material production (durability, paper and print quality, binding).IN SUMMARY, lest I get too long and formal, this is a well cared for, accurate and reliable 1847-type text, springing out of the University of Virginia electronic texts, but tightly controlled by the 1976 Clarendon Edition one (by Hilda Marsden and Ian Jack), and silently adapted as punctuation is concerned (resulting in a friendly version, which the scholarly reconstructed punctuation of Clarendon is not).THE INTRODUCTION is short (11 pp) and well planned so that it opens ways for understanding, but can be read before the novel without spoiling anything.It sounds a bit like run-of-the-mill material, but this is a deceiving image(Alison Booth's command of the material is always there).THE ANNOTATION IS VERY GOOD and extensive enough, with full and right glosses of the dialect tirades, and accurate, to-the-point information on biblical or literary references, or contextual ways and means.In that most elusive of references, the one about Milo (of Croton) in Chapter IX, however, Alison Booth edition slips a little, like many other good ones (with Clarendon doing a little better, the ones getting the story right if not in full are Barnes&Noble;, Wordsworth Classics, Penguin/Nestor, Broadview/Newman, Oneworld Classics and the excellent but ill-fated Routledge edition by Heather Glen). According to the Geography of Strabo, Book XII, which is the only source for this story, Milo in his old age tried to tear apart in two a tree half split and with a wedge to retain it open. He then exerted all his force with his hands, opening the gap wide enough for the wedge to drop off; the tree closed (it requires an ever increasing force to continue opening the trunk -this is Hooke's Law in physics-) and trapped the hands of Milo, who was then devoured by wolves.It is regarding this story that we read in the novel:\\"Who is to separate us, pray? They'll meet the fate of Milo!\\" (who also tried unwisely and deadly to SEPARATE something). Saying in a note, as Booth does, \\"In the classical fable, Milo, an athlete, tried to pull a tree up by the roots\\" is a little misleading (not only do we lose the \\"separation factor\\", but also accuracy. Milo is neither a fable nor a myth, but a real human being with a place both in time and on earth, mentioned with consistent witness by two of the best historians of the time, other than Strabo. As to the stories connected to him, nothing is known for sure when we go into the details, and so the label \\"legend\\" is most appropriate).The CONTEXTUAL MATERIALS are well chosen and presented. The only problem, and I think THE GREATEST PROBLEM with this otherwise excellent edition, is that there are 40+ items of this material and only 130 pages to fit them in: it looks hopelessly like a motley medley of maddening fragments, with, say, ONLY FIVE OF EMILY'S POEMS, which is both a pity and a blunder. There are interesting curios as the \\"Table of the average yearly wages paid to domestics... according to their rank in a household\\".More important are the pages devoted to Yorkshire dialect (too scarce) and ballads (very good). There is also a fair amount of space (11 pages) allotted to \\"cultural dissemination\\", that is, works of art (songs, theatrical or musical adaptations as well as TV or movie ones, sequels...) deriving from or related with the novel.The data included are very good and complete except for the chapter on translations in which, just as an example, only two translations into Spanish are listed, and only one in current use although it is barely acceptable: there are by now no less than TEN Spanish translations easily available; some are very good, some are rightly annotated, none is both things together and none is based on the 1847 text (but on the 1850 one).MATERIAL PRODUCTION is... fair enough, as far as I can tell without ripping apart my copy. A not-too-bad paperback, perhaps even signature-sewn but without flaps (with cover corners and even front-edge vulnerable). Paper quality looks good (time will tell) and printing quality is excellent. Design is clear and user-friendly(I will not comment on the typeface they use for big headlines, perhaps somebody will love it).SO WHAT?If an accurate and reliable text and a rich annotation are a must,then stick to this Longman Cultural Edition (by Alison Booth).If you can make do with a generally reliable text with a few errors, some idiosyncratic readings and inconsistencies and, besides, you don't mind a scanty annotation (but with full dialectal glosses), and you will appreciate the finest choice ever of contextual materials (but with only EIGHT OF EMILY's POEMS) as well as a MOST INTERESTING and thought-provoking INTRODUCTION (29pp), then choose the Broadview Press edition by Beth Newman (be sure not to pick their earlier one by Christopher Heywood!).If, on the other side, you may accept a generally reliable text and a very scanty annotation (but with full dialectal glosses), and you would appreciate the best presentation ever of early reviews and similar materials (Charlotte's prefaces for 1850, and some letters by Charlotte) and you would enjoy a really good and wide enough selection of EIGHTEEN EMILY's POEMS, then don't miss the elegant and no-nonsense Fourth Edition of Norton Critical (by R.J. Dunn, with almost the same text, for good and worse, of the late and mourned William M. Sale 1963 1st edition).Have a haunting reading!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book aloud to my wife 23 years ago. At the time, I was working as an apprentice at a winery on the Rhine River. There was an old medeival castle across the river from our room. It was the perfect setting, as we two were the only English speaking people in the town. I think now is the right time to review the book, because I can only recall the feelings left behind by this powerful work of literature. Most of the plot and many of the characters have been long forgotten, leaving only the residue of strong emotion. I have read many works of powerful fiction by the world's great authors since then. But not one of them affected me emotionally the way this extraordinary tale did. I remember one gray German morning finishing the chapter where Heathcliff digs up the body of his beloved Catherine because he has gone mad in his desire to hold her close once more. And then off to the Altenkirch Schwanenkellerei I went. I spent the rest of the day working quietly in the cellars of the winery, deep inside the mountain with mold hanging all about, and brooding over the maniacal behavior of these highly romantic, insane characters. I've never been able to shake the feeling entirely. There is something so entirely timeless about this work, as though it were a piece of ancient literature, old far beyond the 1840s setting, something so utterly classical and piercingly primordial, it's as though you already had the genesis of this material in your DNA and it only required this story to bring it back to life within you. You recognize the spell it weaves because it speaks to the humanity in you so clearly, it is as though you have been secretly drugged. The English language has rarely been utilized as well as it has here, and I dare say you would need to go back to Shakespeare to find its parallel. Romanticism reached its high water mark with this novel. Ms. Bront has now become immortal because of her creation, and in the Pantheon of world literaure, she stands among the Titans. If you are a native speaker of the English language, you can hardly consider yourself educated if you have not read this astounding novel of romantic love and uncontrollable passion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE BOOK, NOVEL ETC, OF ALL TIMES, HANDS DOWN.

It brought tears to my eyes, which doesn't happen to me often."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If there is a list of one hit wonders in literature, at the top of that list would be Emily Jane Bront's magnificent novel Wuthering Heights.It is a dark, brooding book that never really answers the questions it leaves us with. Why did Mr. Earnshaw bring the boy Heathcliff home with him? Was Heathcliff his illegitimate son? Why does Catherine Earnshaw marry Edward Linton and not her true soul mate Heathcliff?As an English teacher, I am always reminded that sometimes the great novels of classical literature, like Wuthering Heights and to Kill a Mockingbird, would not get past the inquiry letter to the literary agent stage today. Why? Because both books have horrible beginnings. The reader must persevere in order to get to the meat and bones of the story. In the case of Wuthering Heights and to Kill a Mockingbird it is worth it.Catherine and Heathcliff are undoubtedly selfish human beings, but their love for each other is so powerful and damaging the story is a must read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't know if I can add much to what has aleeady been said about Wuthering Heights.

The two main characters, Heathcliff and Catherine, are in love with each other; not in an earthly form but rather there souls are united as one. Heathcliff loves Catherine not for her body, her apperance, her money, her status but rather for her soul. He is one with her in a way every soul desires to be understood. In this novel love is shown in forms and extents that are so much of what people in our culture are deprived of it makes for a wonderful read. One often longs for a soul mate to connect with and be loved by for being them and when Heathcliff shows this affection towards Cathy I believe it draws in a person and captures his or her heart.Wuthering Heights isn't just a fantasy though. It isn't a fairy tale everyone knows will never come true. Wuthering Heights is very much now and here. Heathcliff loves Catherine with his heart but she denies this love and tries to suppress her own feelings toward him for she thinks it will receive her scorn from society to which she is right. This is so heart wrenching because it is so much of a reality. Many times we meet our soul mate yet let them slip away because we are to worried about what others will say. Wuthering Heights shows picture and makes you think about when you might have not loved someone only because the culture didn't approve of him or her.Wuthering Heights is a wonderful book because it illustrates a love people yearn for so dearly. If you have the chance to read Wuthering Heights I would definitely say take it because it will speak to your heart."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The novel Wuthering Heights may sound like another cliche book of love and hate. The general audience would think this book would follow the same romance plot. Man falls in love with woman, woman feels the same, something terrible happens and in the end they solve the problem and live happily ever after.When in all actuality it is about a man whom driven by pure love for hatred on a path of vengece. The man known only as Heathcliff. *Don Don Don!*The novel starts out in an unusual manner of telling the end of the story in the beginning. Surprisingly all the substance plays right in tune with the style of writing. The characters of all very complex and intricate to the point of instanity. The story is all centered around a man who is rejected from society from adoption and is only loved by a one soul. Unbeknownst to his step sister Catherine, Heathcliff has fallen madly in love with her. Heathcliff ,since rejected from society, has developed deep hatred for everyone who maltreated him or loved Catherine.Heathcliff's revenge is so cold and rotten to the point were you want to rip the book apart and burn it. Later on Catherine finally confesses her love to Heathcliff whom after this was overjoyed with passion. Sadly this Catherine,Heathcliff's only true love in life, dies a most unusual death.Heathcliff plans to make Catherines daughter the puppet or weapon if you may to take revenge against Edgar the one who stole Catherine from Heathcliff's reach. To do this he tries to force Catherine's daughter to marry his own son.Although the book is very entertaining I highly suggest this for and audience of some background knowledge of the Victorian era. Another tedious thing of this book is it is not intended to those of an average vocabulary so at often found myself having to grab a dictionary. Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights novel shows how love can eventually turn into hate by just adding a few essential ingredients.[Redsponx5]"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Don't read the review from Monika \\"equestrienne_23\\" below.I have never read this book and was looking at the reviews online to see if I could get an idea of what it was about.

Everything about it is bitingly real. Though most of the novel is bent on Heathcliff's revenge, it is more about how far a person would go acting on the powerful love they feel for another. Some might say his character shouldn't exist (absurd! He is more real than the pining Edgar or the dashing men of what I call 'heaving bosom' stories).Cathy, the heroine, who never acts like the typical one, does a typically human thing: she marries a man she has mild feelings for because he's rich and Heathcliff is MIA.But her death scene: all I can say is read it! Haunting.It is a little awkward because we are removed from the story, hearing it from a maid's point of view and the parts about Cathy(Jr. her daughter) and Linton and Hareton are not as moving as Cathy and Heathcliff's destructive love, it's still absolutely amazing! I've read it three times and I still get chills at the end!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have always considered Wuthering Heights the best offering from the Bronte brood. It may be a soap opera, but WHAT a soap opera--and besides, the writing, dark and Victorian though it is, is superb and more than a little mad.The two most over-used adjectives used to describe this book are \\"dark and brooding.\\" So I won't use them, but it will be hard. Because out of the ashes, almost literally, of a dark, dreary, oppressive estate on the English moors flames the love affair of all time: the daughter of the house, Catherine, and the wild foundling brought into the family as a child--Heathcliff. Catherine and Heathcliff have a special bond, even as children, but when adulthood arrives, their bond flares into unbearable passion.Tortured Heathcliff wandering the moors calling for Cathy; married Cathy dying in her bed for love of Heathcliff; ahhhh. Nothing better. One wonders, of course, what forbidden thoughts churned beneath the genteel breast of Emily Bronte as she wrote of this unmistakeably sexual and erotic relationship. I have also wondered more than once if Heathcliff was modeled on the Bronte Sisters' wild and untameable brother Bramwell. But I am no literary historian. I am only a lover of books, and this particular one resides on my all-time top ten. If you have never read it, or if you consider it one of those dreary required assignments you fled in high school, give it another chance. There is nothing else like it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Why?

The pearl's there for you, waiting for someone to take it out and absorb it forever.It might be a hard reading, but it will move you deeply and make you pound your chest and cry out."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a novel that oozes with romance. It is a story of unbridled love that has no boundaries and no restraints. The love that exists between Catherine and Heathcliff is an all consuming almost maddening love. The way Emily Bronte attacks your senses and emotions is both exicting and devastating. Her style of describing the surroundings and landscape is gothic in style. It is rugged, isolated and atmospheric. It gives you a sense that the Earnshaws and Lockwoods are the only two families in existence. The landscape seems to be a direct reflection of the personalities of the characters. It is a clever way to describe the families in a atypical way. Because of the unusual style of this romance novel, it may be hard to dive into at first, but it will soon capitivate your attention. It is hard to determine who you should hate and who you should pity.Healthcliff is a dark and mysterious man who you absolutely want to love, but every word he speaks and every action he makes drives you to despise him. Catherine whom you want to side with, drives you mad with her selfishness and snobbery. It leaves you with a feeling of desperateness for a happily-ever-after ending, yet a sense it may never happen. Wuthering Heights is a passionate, all consuming pyscho-romance. It made me want to jump into the pages and set things straight. I really enjoyed the use of love and hate and how it is able to bind people together in a circle that never ends. Once a wrong has been committed, it is so hard to break the cycle. Once someone has been hurt it is so hard to forgive and forget. Healthcliff's emotional side had been trampled on at such an early age that his whole life was soon consumed with revenge towards anyone that was involved in the mistreatings. I despertly wanted Catherine or at least someone to break through the shield that Heathcliff had built, but if someone does want to be loved they never will. The saying goes, you must love yourself before you can love someone else and Healthcliff was not able to accomplish this.The combination of love, love lost and love denied makes Wuthering Heights a romance that I fully recommend. It is a mixture of life and death, twists and turns and vengence that would attract all genders and all ages. It leaves you confused and frustrasted in a way that books do not do anymore. It may have you puzzled in the beginning because it does not follow the norm of a modern romance, but by the end you will feel that every romance should have this quality. I feel that everyone should sample the taste of a tragic romance."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I can't recommend Wuthering Heights enough. It tells the story of the doomed love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a foundling adopted by her father. There is an implication, which not everyone may have picked up on and in never confirmed, that their relationship is inscestuous and that Heathcliff is the illegitimate son of Catherine's father. This idea is based on the fact that it seems highly unlikely that Earnshaw would have picked up a strret child to adopt without some sort of motivation. The gothic genre was also fascinated with strange relations etc and whilst authours would not have been able to look at inscest openly they would have been able to get away with subtle undertones that many people would not pick up on.There is an immense sense of landscape within Wuthering HEights and I feel that the title and setting reflects the unbridled passions of the characters within the novel. Emily Bronte's beautiful descriptions of the rolling countryside reflect her love for her home at Haworth. The plot can be a little confusing because of the way the characters all seem to have the same names (two Cathys, Edgar Linton, Linton Heathcliff, Heathcliff etc) so if you can get hold of a family tree it'll really help you to follow the plot. Like all classics, Wuthering Heights takes a bit of time to get into but keep going and you won't regret it.:)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Fresh off of reading &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, I was interested in reading &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; because I had heard it was this great romantic story. Could it surpass &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, I thought? Hmmm... I went in search to find out. Well, after reading &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, I have this to say: If you think that &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is about lovey-dovey romance, think again. If you are expecting it to be in the likes of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, think again. If you think Heathcliff will be like Mr. Rochester, think again. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a novel filled with a fitful, satisfying romance. It is a beautifully written novel, and Mr. Rochester will always be my favorite hero, and Jane, my favorite heroine. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is, on the other hand, a complete 180 from &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is a disturbing novel filled with disturbing characters. It is a gothic tragedy which is very dark and depressing. Not one single character is likeable, although you hope that Heathcliff turns around at the end and turns good. It is about obsession and it makes you wonder if you can define love. What is love? I did like how the author is completely distanced from the novel, and that a lot of the story is left up to the reader's imagination, but there were times when I was thinking, &quot;What is the point of this novel?&quot;. Yet, at the end, I realized it was a good story-- very spooky and it sucked you into their own world. I think this is a mood-novel. It will make you go into a very dark place, and leave you kind of depressed! I suggest watching the movie adaptation of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, featuring Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff. I know that I actually gained a greater appreciation for the novel after watching this film.

I immensely suspect that confederates of Heathcliff have either not read the second half of the story or are ignorant to the terrors of domestic violence. Where the plot lays asunder, I'd remark that Bront's ability to truly abhor me in the chilling degradation of Heathcliff and the ghastly haunting story that ensues, greatly pulls together an all around unsettling finish to an otherwise unremarkable tale. Over all while I can only fault the book for the story, the writing was much to my liking and I may very well come back to it in later years with a different eye. I think it's worth venturing a read, but I'd say not to get your hopes up on everything everyone sells Heathcliff to be."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I usually stay away from classics since most likely I won't like it at all, but since I like romance and heard that Wuthering Heights is a great classic story, I decided to give it try.I just don't see how can this be a great classic romance story.

The characters have a depth to them that causes the reader to become emotionally involved with them. I found that I was cursing Heathcliffe on one page, and pitying him on the next.My only regret concerns myself more than the book. The ever-decreasing attention span of Americans today made me feel at time that the book got a little long. Perhaps if I weren't so distorted by a sitcom mentality where conflicts are resolved neatly in thirty minutes (minus time for commercials), I wouldn't have felt this way. In other words, the fault here is with my reading of the book, not with the book itself.

Bront didnt get deep enough into the characters thoughts and emotions because she wrote it from a third person perspective, that of Nelly Deen. And what was Joseph saying?! I just skipped over his infrequent lines. Also, she should have made it longer, she just zoomed right through the lives and loves of Catherine, Heathcliff, Edgar, Miss Catherine, and Linton, who were all very interesting characters. Those characters were so interesting that the reader should have gotten to know them better! But, it is a classic everyone should read. Also, I found myself quite enraged with Nelly throughout most of the book because she was the main hindrance in the loving relationships between Catherine and Heathcliff and that of Miss Catherine and Linton. She was stern and not understanding of the young mind and definitely not a romantic. And, I thought she was mostly exaggerating about Heathcliff, untill the end where I saw how he treated Hareton and Miss Catherine so poorly, and then i saw that maybe Nelly was right!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Amazing book. Truly amazing.

Neither Heathcliff nor Catherine are heroes--rather they are the villians who want to love each other, but are thwarted by circumstance.

That was the ONLY reason that I finished this book. It was a huge task just to finish a page of Wuthering Heights; it was almost impossible to complete it. I enjoy characters that I can care about. I like to be able to really feel like I want something for a character. If that happens, then I want to finish the book; I want to know what happens to the character. I found with Wuthering Heights I hated Catherine and Heathcliff. I wanted them to die. I was supposed to be sad when things went wrong in their lives, but instead I was so happy. They were selfish, cruel, horrible people and I wanted them to DIE! Was I really supposed to like these selfish people? Since when is love a selfish thing? This is supposed to be a marvelous love classic, but where is the love? Love isn't just about what makes oneself feel good. Love is a kind, caring, sharing thing. Catherine and Heathcliff were selfish, cruel people. They deserved each other simply because they would make each other miserable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm not ashamed to admit that a good half of my personal library is comprised of classical novels and plays and that I read them because I genuinely LIKE them.You heard me right. I LIKE them. I read them for ENTERTAINMENT, not because they were assigned reading in classes (although I've made \\"friends\\" with a great title or two via that route as well).The Bronte sisters' novels enjoy love and hate from readers. I don't think there's a soul who just feels lukewarm about their works. I've read a couple and liked and kept most of them.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" stands out to me as one of the WORST novels I've ever read in my ENTIRE LIFE. Given the number of novels I've read in my entire life that's saying a lot.WH is very well-written. Emily Bronte CAN write. Style/technique isn't the issue. What is the issue is her abysmal failure to engage the reader because of her deplorable characters.Heathcliff and Catherine are frequently cited as one of the \\"power couples\\" of literature along with Rhett & Scarlett, Romeo & Juliet, Antony & Cleopatra, etc. They may be kindred spirits but there is none of their behaviors ever signifies they know a thing about love.Catherine Earnshaw isn't even an interesting character. She is a charming, selfish and silly young woman who fulfills the Victorian stereotype of choosing \\"a good match\\" over wild love on the moors with Heathcliff. This may have been the sanest thing she did. Maybe she recognized H's bizarre fixation on her as unwholesome and knew she'd never live up to it in reality.A lot of women get swooney over Heathcliff as a sort of alpha-male anti-hero. I'm female and I CAN'T STAND this guy! He isn't alpha, he's WEAK as skimmed milk.How psychologically disturbed is he, let me count the ways. Inferiority complex, obsessive attachment to uninterested female (Cathy turned him down whatever her \\"real feelings\\" might have been) that borders upon incest (they're not blood kin but they are raised together); inability to \\"forget the one that got away\\" and MOVE ON; child abuse/neglect with clearly murderous intentions; wife/spousal abuse; kidnapping and coerced marriage and even theft of personal assets...Give me a break this is no alpha male, this is a psychopathic CRIMINAL!If you sigh and say, \\"Oh but he did this all because he LOVED Catherine!\\" I will slap you. Truly I will.A REAL alpha male would be broken-hearted by the rejection of his \\"true love\\"...then he would have moved forward and continued with his life and discovered \\"true love\\" (as in love that was returned to him without bizarre psychological games).Heathcliff is a loser in every sense of the word.

Also the writing of the local dialect of one of the characters I could not understand a single word. I hope that his converstions were not pivital to the plot point because I had to keep skipping every part in the book because I had no idea what he was saying.

One glance at the poster and I declared we'd go watch Wuthering Heights starring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, and that was that. I was transported by the thwarted romance that played out on the bleak Yorkshire moors. Of course I had to go read the book straight after, and while my youthful self probably didn't \\"get\\" half the relationship dynamics or the full depth of the dialogue, I nonetheless knew this is a book I'd need to reread at some point.Fast forward 20 years (gee whizz, it's been *that* long) and I downloaded the book from Gutenberg.org - a far cry from the battered paperback copy I inherited from the family home, and was immediately transported - again.Wuthering Heights is primarily a story about relationships, and of people who wilfully twist and allow others to twist them. We are first introduced to our narrator, a chap by the name of Lockwood, who has rented the grand Thrushcross Grange (complete with its own park lands). I get the idea the chap is a bit of a poseur, who's quite oblivious and gauche when it comes to how he relates to people. Self-absorbed. I missed this in the first read. Kudos to Bront for having a narrator I'd cheerfully slap. I mean, the fool goes blundering in to visit the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights when it's perfectly clear to anyone else with half an ounce of common sense that they do not appreciate the intrusion of a stranger.But Lockwood is our narrator, and it's clear the mystery presented by the relationships he encounters captivates his imagination to the point where he's determined to uncover they mystery that has presented itself. (My inner cynic cheerfully comments: \\"Well, what do you expect? They didn't have reality TV in those days.)Not one to take a hint when he's not wanted, Lockwood plays voyeur, and an ill-timed visit results in him having to spend the night at Wuthering Heights and subject himself to the ghost of Catherine - one of the key scenes.But the story's layers get peeled back. Lockwood's housekeeper at Thrushcross Grange is none other than Ellen (or Nelly, as she's know by those who're familiar with her), who grew up with the main participants in this drama. Her narration of past events is then retold by Lockwood, so once again our perceptions as readers are coloured by the lens of yet another viewpoint. We are faced with not only the opinions of Lockwood, but that of Ellen. Unreliable narrators both, but in their opinions, we view our main players with a degree of separation. We vicariously live out the unfolding tragedy from a safe distance while debating on characters' true motivations.Most often, Wuthering Heights is pegged as a romance and, to a degree I agree that romance is an underlying theme but I prefer to view it as a tragedy, of characters denying their true natures and being destroyed by the prolonged act of revenge.We enter a complex interconnecting web of relationships and the intermingling of two families. Always, Heathcliff is the outsider. Bront suggests that he is dark, perhaps of gypsy stock, and Catherine and Hindley Earnshaw's father brought the foundling home. The lad was closer in age to Catherine than her brother, and the two were soon inseparable. But when Catherine's path intersects with that of the wealthy Lintons, and specifically their son, Edgar, she is soon torn.The unsophisticated Heathcliff is her dark half, an animus as such, wild and unfettered, yet Edgar represents culture and an artificial construct of what \\"love\\" is supposed to be. Catherine is at a quandary, and it is her decision to marry Edgar that sets the wheels in motion for the unfolding drama.Yes, this is a tale of thwarted love, but it's also an illustration of how individuals will consciously choose a path that can only lead to damnation. What I found fascinating was comparing my initial response as a teenager to how I felt about the novel now, twenty years later. I recall feeling so sorry for how rotten Catherine's life turned out. Now? Well, I'd dearly love to shake some sense into the girl. All the characters are unlikeable. There is nothing romantic about Heathcliff's all-consuming passion for Catherine. And Catherine is a wilful, stubborn girl who's used to bending everyone around her to her whims, unmindful of the damage she is causing to herself and those around her.This made me think, however, about the relative ages of the characters in the story. They were but teenagers themselves, who behaved as such. The only difference is that in those days, folks getting married as young as eighteen was not unheard of. Now, you sit back and think about how your life would have turned out had you married your first sweetheart (you're excused if it's two decades later and you're still happily married to your first love).I think about my first love and where we'd be now if we were still together, and probably miserable as all hell to boot. Let's not go there. I'm glad I never felt obligated to marry someone, and that when I did finally get married (yes I married young at twenty-two) I'm still very much in love with the man but glad I'd had experience with other relationships.And lastly, Heathcliff. Wuthering Heights is really his story, if you ask me, and he suffers a bit of a dog-in-the-manger syndrome. He cannot have happiness, and has focused his entire existence on ensuring that no one else will have happiness. Heathcliff is ultimately tragic, but I don't pity him, as he mastered his own fate. In the end, he cannot bring himself to carry out the final act of his schemes, and loses the taste for revenge. Instead, he turns the sickness inward. The world continues without him, in spite of his machinations, and he consumes his own heart.Wuthering Heights falls under the category of the Gothic novel, along with the likes of Frankenstein. Supernatural elements are hinted at, and I suspect it's left up to the reader to decide whether these exist. This is one of the novels that I recommend to all aspiring authors to read. As a study on character development, Wuthering Heights is essential. Yes, the language usage takes a little getting used to but if you can get into the story, you'll gain an appreciation as to why this is one of those classics that has inspired film and music. (Go check out Kate Bush's music videos on YouTube.)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book can be so depressing, but I love it! I tend to like other Bronte novels better just because this book gets dark and stays that way until the last few pages."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"One of my favorite teachers told me this was her favorite book. She must have gotten something different out of it. I mostly despised the main characters, especially Heathcliff. The best part of the book is the last 20 pages when the daughter finally finds happiness but the rest was almost unbearable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is in many ways a remarkable novel, but also a very dark one, which makes it difficult to really love. It centers on the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff, or rather the lack of a real one...the basis of their passion for each other is pretty thin, which makes the depths of Heathcliff's obsession with her pretty hard to understand. That characterization didn't seem true to life to me anyway---rather than being passionate about one thing to the exclusion of everything else like that, people are usually passionate in general or mean all around, not this precarious mixture of the two.The story really picked up for me in the latter part, when Heathcliff attempts to continue taking out his grievances on the subsequent generation, whose ultimate fate redeemed the novel for me. So, definitely worth a read, just make sure to stick with it all the way through to the end. Still, I definitely didn't love it as much as I did Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i was so glad to find this amazing edition for such an affordable price! it was in great condition, exactly as the description said. thanks so much!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book was mentioned in several of the other books that i have read so I thought I would see why it was referenced so much. I really liked this book. Emily creates these characters that have depth and strong emotions. Cathrine and Heathcliff are doomed from the get go, their chilhood spares them no humanity for them to retain in adulthood. Heathcliff is horrible and is often referred to a an evil man, true but Cathrine still loves him. Though she loves him she is so concided and horrible herself she refuses to be with him. I cannot tell you how horrible each of the characters are in Emily's novel you must read it for yourself. Please don't misunderstand me when I say horrible I mean the behavior and attributes of the characters not that they are poorly written or lacking in depth. Even thought this characters are the complete oppsite of good I found that I wished for their pain to stop. Each of the characters were in such a constant state of torture I could not really blame them for acting the way they did. They say that misery loves company and Emily's novel could not paint a better picture. It does take some adjusting to the way it is written the wording and phrasing are not of this era. But once you get started and get a feel for the writting style you will become consumed by the characters and their pain. I thought this book would be just another one of those old dull reads but it is so much more. I know its old and hard to understand at times but is so worth the read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It took me a long time to get around to reading Wuthering Heights, and I have to admit, it was a slog. It's not that I have anything against novels from that time period; I count Jane Eyre and the works of Jane Austen among my favorite books. But Wuthering Heights did not live up to its reputation. The characters were universally unlikeable and unsympathetic. The story was meandering and ultimately unfulfilling. And the \\"love story\\" - more of a story of unreasonable obsession - did not move me. So count me among the few who did not fall in love with this novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is nothing special. I personally don't see why everyone considers this to be a masterpiece. First off I can't see how Bronte can turn such a stupid story into a 300 page novel. Another thing that bothered me was the narrative. The story was almost completely told in flashback and that flashback often broke into another flashback and a couple of time broke off into a third flashback. Another thing that was bad was the referce to the characters. One sentence she wold call Isabella Mrs. Linton then she would call Catherine Mrs. Linton also. Same situation with Mr. Heathcliff and Linton Heathcliff. Not to mention the fact that there were two Catherines which just added to the unproffesionalism of this book. What the heck was Joespeph saying!!!! Overall I believe reading this book was a complete waste of time and I would defenantly not recommend this book to anyone else. If you are looking for an enjoyable book from that era I strongly suggest you read Jane Erye by Emily's more competent sister Charlotte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"No doubt about it, this book is a well written classic that generations continue to enjoy. I did in fact enjoy this book and got absorbed in the story. I was told this book was a love story; however, it is not just any love story. This book had depth and angles not only about love. In Wuthering Heights, as the years went by the Earnshaw's and Linton's became very dysfunctional. It seemed that there was no order in the family households. Most of all, I enjoyed the characters Emily Bronte created. Catherine Earnshaw was such a passionate character, her words moved me like no other book had. I was inspired greatly by Cathy's passion, &quot;It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning,or frost from fire (73).&quot; That paticular passage has always been my favorite. I felt so sorry for Heathcliff even though he became revengeful; however, I believe he was driven by passion himself. Catherine and Heathcliff were my favorite characters, but all the other characters were very important too. Altough the book is 'wordy', I throughly enjoyed the storyline and characters. So I have decided on ranking Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights an eight. Futhermore, I recommend this novel to anyone searching for a good book.

This is nothing like Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice. It does not have the spirite or the heart of those two books. For years I tried to figure out what was wrong with me that I should not love such a classic. But now that I am more mature and a more seasoned reader; ...It just is not to my taste. Sometimes I like books that others do not and sometimes others like books that I dont. This book lacks the hope and sense of awe for life that I desire in a novel. For me the hero and herroine must be worthy of my time and attention. Something good in them must prevail. That just doesn't happen here. This story is really sad because it is a love story writen by a woman who never know what it was like to love and be loved in return. IF she had she would never have writen this abusive version of love. But you know as well as i do that some women truely belive that abuse is love. So like I say to each his own.P.S.

In fact, the novel was so controversial for its time, that publishers did not want to take the risk of publishing it at first. The book is a masterpiece with unforgettable characters and a great and swift-moving plot. I bet that anyone who has read this book has not forgotten Catherine and Heathcliff.

It's a timeless book for everyone, combining elements that make it enveloping for both men and women. I must confess I have a hard time keeping myself interested in many classics I have read, but this one was different.

Under most circumstances I wouldn't care but I have to write about the storms in the novel and what they mean. According to my teacher there are 43 but I have not found that many.

It was a very in depth book but a also very rewarding one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I went into reading this book with the mindset that I was reading an 18th century english romance novel, which isn't exactly the genre that I would choose to read. I chose to read Wuthering Heights because I've heard of the acclaim that this novel receives for being one of the greatest pieces of English literature ever written so I casted aside my stereotpes and read it. It is a very tragic obsession between CAtherine and Heathcliff that lasts well after the latter dies and one can really feel the love between them. And the most riveting character in this story is the demon that Heathcliff transforms into as the story progresses. He is truely one of the most sinister characters I have ever read.

To be honest the only way I could survive the book was to read the cliff notes. But halfway through the cliff notes I was struck by the developing relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff, and my opinions altogether changed. I re-read the entire book, and could at last understand the story, the torment, the love, the fury, the power of what Emily had written, a real love story, with the real sentiments that occur when people of different upbringings clash, and somehow, in spite of such brutal hatred and jealousy, love dawns, and it survives the storm of hatred that continues for many years and a couple of generations. This story epitomizes true and unconditional love.

I don't no if characters such as Heathcliff or the younger Linton actually could exist. But this whole story is so unbelievable that it goes way beyond fiction. Not only that but one of the basic requisites of any successful novel, or movie for that matter, is to have at least one character that the audience likes or will root for. There is not one character in this book that I pulled for. Not one that I wanted to see come out on top.

I LOVED (became slightly obsessed) with Jane Eyre and figured this might fall in the same category. Unfortunately, I was very wrong.The writing is so utterly dull. I cannot understand where this great love comes from between Catherine and Heathcliff - they are just in \\"love\\" and we are supposed to believe it. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if it was not told by Nelly's accounts, whom I find extremely annoying, overly motherly and controlling for a servant. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters and just wished they would all die already, as seemed to be the prevalent theme throughout the novel.I also found it somewhat disturbing how easily people married their first-cousins back in those days. I get it - it's the 1800s, but really does Cathy have to go from marrying one first cousin to the next? Is there no one else in this town that she is not related to?!I was really hoping to enjoy this book - especially considering this is such a \\"classic\\".

The unbridled, doomed and forbidden love between Heathcliff and Catherine would seem to be the original Harlequin romance. How NOT true. Instead of a love story the real \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is conflict, anger, evil, betrayal, loss, mystery, revenge, debasement, regret with a large unhealthy dose of bonding.Having seen the 1939 movie when I was 7 or 8 years old and not knowing what I was watching for many years I was struck by the story. But the producers of that version win the award for most creative re-interpretation of a book in the 20th century. For fun I looked at 5-10 minute clips of the the 1992, 2009 and 2011 versions on YouTube (I read there are 17 screen versions to date). In those short passages it's clear that each film tries harder to reach the emotional pitch of the book by being more true to the storyline. None beyond the first have been commercial successes and I think it's because the intensity of the book is in the narrative not the dialogue. While Heathcliff is increasingly dark and willingly evil with each version the films cannot bring out what he's thinking because - well we don't know what he's thinking. All we know is he's very angry and would really like to have Catherine back. The movies create monologues that don't exist in the book. By filling in the blanks it takes away from the mystery that is forced on the reader to speculate on Heathcliff's character and motives.I found appeal in Bronte's willingness to portray Heathcliff as nearly the devil; a man wronged and willing to exact revenge for eternity even on his own family. It's painful. Heathcliff's bitterness goes on page after page and year after year. No \\"victory\\" seems to satiate him. It's incredibly intense and he only gets worse as he goes after more innocent victims. His villainy has no bottom.I started the book thinking I was in for a more elaborate version of the 1939 movie. I finished knowing I had read something far different, more challenging, provocative and modern. Much is made about Bronte's ability to write this - where did the ideas come from? what was she thinking? If she were a man would there have been as much focus on the writer instead of the book? Fortunately those debates have receded while the freshness and originality of the story have remained."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It's unfortunate that Wuthering Heights often gets lumped into the category of Victorian chick lit, because it probably has more in common with Dickens or Balzac than with Jane Austen. The various film adaptations often make much of the love between Heathcliff and Catherine, but that doesn't begin to cover the scope of this book. Wuthering Heights is no conventional romance novel. It is in fact an epic examination of human wickedness involving an ensemble cast that spans two generations over the course of almost 50 years. Filled with powerful imagery and unforgettable characters, it makes for a profoundly entertaining read.Heathcliff, a gypsy-looking street urchin from Liverpool, is adopted by the Earnshaw family, who live among the moors of northern England at the secluded estate of Wuthering Heights. Mr. Earnshaw treats Heathcliff as his favorite, much to the consternation of his eldest son Hindley. When the father dies, Hindley seizes the opportunity to retaliate against Heathcliff, revoking his favored family position and forcing him to labor in the fields. Meanwhile, Heathcliff and his adopted sister Catherine develop a love for each other, but due to his servant status, dirty boots, and surly demeanor, she spurns him for her more elegant and refined neighbor Edgar Linton. Heathcliff resolves to revenge himself upon all who have hurt him, and the following generation of Earnshaws, Lintons, and Heathcliffs must also suffer the repercussions of his passionate vengeance.The joy of Wuthering Heights is that there isn't a single character in the book who could be described as a good person. They are all at best selfish and petty, at worst deplorably evil. All are set on destroying each other, not through murder or violence, but by making each other's lives a living hell until one by one they gradually drop dead of sorrow or destitution. Emily Bronte's unrelenting audacity in depicting the cruelest, basest aspects of humanity is so refreshing it's a joy to read. Yet over and above its sensationalistic pleasures, Wuthering Heights is undeniably a meaningful piece of literature with an intricately constructed plot and keen insights into human nature. It offers important lessons on the poisoning effects of resentment and vengeance upon the soul, as well as the resilience of the human spirit to rise above adversity and degradation.The one drawback of Wuthering Heights is its narrative voice, as told through the perspective of a visitor, Mr. Lockwood, which results in some rather convoluted constructions (Lockwood says that Nelly said that Cathy read in a letter that Linton wrote that Heathcliff told Hareton . . . ). The story would have been better served by a third-person omniscient perspective. Nevertheless, Wuthering Heights deserves its renown as a classic of English literature. It's a shame this is the only novel Emily Bronte ever finished. Let the chick-lit label be damned; real men read Wuthering Heights too!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"(Spoiler)Wuthering Heights is one of the most perfect novels I have read. Here are my thoughts on what makes Wuthering Heights an outstanding read and why it's considered a classic:Characterization:There are no extraneous characters introduced into the story. Each person serves a purpose and is often complementary to another character in the book, like a mirrored reflection or a duality, sometimes the same, sometimes opposing; i.e., Catherine and Heathcliff, Edgar and Isabella Linton, Hindley and Heathcliff, the younger Catherine and Hareton, Mr. Lockwood and Nelly, Nelly and Joseph, the two families at Wuthering Heights and the Grange, the mother Catherine and the younger Catherine, and Isabella and Heathcliff. The relationships among the characters are complicated and evolving. If you were to take one of the characters out of this story, the plot development would be negatively altered. The plot is character-driven and tightly woven throughout the story.Tone:The tone of the story is brooding and dark. The sensuous feeling is foreboding, first exhibited in the setting which Emily Bronte describes in detail. There is an element of overarching suspense and aversion to the characters: the morose Heathcliff; mother Catherine who dies of a brain disorder; the drink of Hindley; the tragic life of Isabella following her marriage to Heathcliff; the delightful younger Catherine who succumbs to depression after coming under the control of Heathcliff. The depressing scene and dysfunctional characters that greet Lockwood's arrival prompt him to ask Nelly to explain the history behind Wuthering Heights.Societal:I was struck by how Emily Bronte weaves the social status of the characters into the story: Joseph and his barely intelligible English; Nelly, the servant and principal narrator, and her portrayal of others from an inferior social position; the many differences between the upper class Lintons and the middle class Earnshaws; the emphasis on social structure with less opportunity for upward mobility, which impacted the \\"heart\\" of the story -- mother Catherine sacrifices her desire for Heathcliff to achieve a higher social status by marrying Edgar. The characters' traits, flaws, and attributes within the structure of society make for believable people that the reader both loves and hates.Multi-generational:The differences between the generations were striking: Heathcliff and mother Catherine seemed unable to change with the passage of time or grow as individuals. They were locked into extremisms that became dead-end roads. Eventually, their flawed natures doomed them to early deaths, providing an opportunity for the next generation in Catherine and Hareton to overcome the past. In contrast to their parents, they were able to adapt and redeem the past, and through their transformation, the reader is filled with hope for the future. The multigenerational aspect of time adds to the completeness of the story--this is a family with a history, a past that threatens to destroy the future.Spiritual/Psychological:Emily Bronte probes deeply the psychological aspects of people's behavior and the ramifications of the dark side of human nature. The story touches on the spiritual nature of the individuals, with references to the small church, the recurring battle with death, the repeated references to ghosts, and Joseph's incessant recitation of Scripture.Themes:The many themes are timeless--love that is forbidden, prejudices that hurt people, the meaninglessness of life without hope, hate that destroys, the vindictiveness of human nature, and the darkness of the soul without God.Setting:Established in the first paragraph, a \\"perfect misanthropist's heaven. \\" Right away, I am told a lot about this story in a unique way which encourages me to keep reading.Classic Author Similarities:I am struck by the fact that many classics, like this one, have been written by individuals who have experienced tremendous suffering. I wonder if there is a relationship between a giftedness to write great stories and the degree to which one has endured hardship. Perhaps the strong emotions that are pent up in a tortured soul find solace in the pen as a healing balm.Risky:Creative, original stories take risks. For instance, there isn't one protagonist versus one antagonist in Wuthering Heights. Ninety-five percent of the story is dark and unsettling; the story reinforces negative stereotypical issues and characters. The orphan is the troublemaker and destroyer of the family, perpetuating a common \\"myth\\" with adoptees. Joseph uses the Bible in a beguiling way to demean people, contrary to the Good Book's ultimate purpose. The submissive role of women and their inability to escape from abusive husbands or families is also perpetuated in Wuthering Heights, reinforcing the long-held notion that women are inferior to men. Despite these risks, Emile Bronte creates a masterpiece.Fictional Dream:Emily Bronte immerses the reader into a world that is vivid and dream-like, with colorful characters and a complex plot. She uses literary techniques that make this is a compelling read, one worth pondering after the last page is finished. It's a shame she died so young--what other books might she have written?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is timeless literature. I read this piece when i was about fourteen, and, although difficult to follow and differentiate between the Cathies and Lintons in the beginning, Bronte unraveled this work very thoroughly and revealed a ghastly and revealing story about two selfish lovers.Heathcliff is truly the most despicable character imaginable, and for his feisty spirit he is one of my favorite characters.Catherine is selfish and a character i feel a strong connection to on some levels.Together these two complete a classic tale, which i would have fallen in love with no matter who the author. However, I am truly impressed with Emily's gal to have written this grizzly tale. For its time, this type of literature is a bold one, and for a women to write? Forget about it! That's a piece beyond the story I absolutely relish.I advise anyone interested in reading this to pick it up and enjoy (possibly making notes, or just trudging through the beginning like i did, ha) But definitely read it twice over, at the very least, for a truly enjoyable (and understandable) read.Anything below five stars for lack of clarity is no fault of the author, and is simply a problem with anyone reading the book. Yes, it is confusing sometimes, but there are pieces to that which complete the complex puzzle of revenge and human indecency."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I really liked Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff is a \\"little\\" disturbing. When I first started reading it, I was like what? But, once I got to chapter 2 or 3 things started making more sense and I couldn't hardly put it down. Once I finished the book, I went back and read the beginning and it makes sense because you know the whole story. Very good, if you like the older, classic style. I would recommend it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The first thing a lot of people who have read this are probably going to ask is \\"Why not 5 stars?\\", and indeed, one may be subjected to stoning for giving only 4 stars to such a well respected piece of classic literature. However, I have my reasons: for one, the book becomes a bit difficult to follow at times- when you have Cathy Linton Earnshaw, and Cathy Earnshaw Linton, and the one who is dead won't stay dead, that gets a bit confusing to begin with. There are a couple of other similar instances when the reader may have to turn back to see just which character is involved in a given encounter. Also, it seems to never be very well established just how Heathcliff went from having nothing upon his departure, to being wealthy upon his return. Perhaps not necessary for that to be fully explained, but at least some explanation would be welcome. Emily Bronte does one thing exceptionally well, which is painting a picture of Yorkshire and The Moors with words. Maybe people who are better readers than I will enjoy this more. I did enjoy it, by all means, thus the four stars, but I was not as enthralled with it as many others have been."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A young lady, 29 years of age, published a book under the name of Ellis Bell. It was so abhorrent to the public, critics wanted the 400 pages of \`pure repugnance' to be burned. Yet as the horror and outrage grew throughout the world, so did the number of copies. How had this young, sickly woman who lived a life of desolation and strife, caused such uproar in our hearts as she led us through hers? Wuthering Heights can be examined through the events, ideas, and personal observations within the text to decipher our own personal experiences with reading this novel.The book begins through the narrative of a man named Mr. Earnshaw. Earnshaw is a tenant for a man named Mr. Heathcliff. From the beginning page of the novel, we find Heathcliff to be rough and with a dark presence in him. The man has come to stay the night before heading down their land to his recently purchased house. Yet the owner of the land makes a very unwelcome first impression on the young Mr. Lockwood. Immediately entering the house, Lockwood get attacked by dogs, and laughed at for his fright. This dreary setting to start off a book happens in a residence named Wuthering Heights. The place Lockwood has recently bought is called Thrushcross Grange; the book will solely revolve around these two houses. Thrushcross Grange is 4 miles away from Wuthering Heights, and Lockwood, returning from his visit from the heights, tries to return to the Grange during a storm. Yet he is unable to make the journey and is force to stay at the Heights until morning.A maid leads Lockwood upstairs into a room that Heathcliff has forbidden. While he lies in the eerily dark room, he finds that names have been carved into the wall next to the bed. Deeply carved into it are 3 woman named Catherine with different last names. A quote on age 35 describes the mood in which the chilling names rang into the night, \\"In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued spelling over Catherine Earnshaw--Heathcliff--Linton, till my eyes closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres--the air swarmed with Catherines.\\" He also finds a diary written 25 years earlier, and with curiosity for the strange inhabitance of the household, he ventures to read it. Within the diary, a girl named Catherine Earnshaw writes about a day she experienced at Wuthering Heights. She talks about how her and Heathcliff must suffer through long sermons and put up with the hatred her brother has towards Heathcliff. We now are aware of 3 major characters--- Catherine, Heathcliff, and her brother named Hindley. Lockwood falls asleep soon after, and has a frightening nightmare in which a hand grabs him and cries the name \\"Catherine Linton\\" and demands to be let in through his window. She will not let go of him, until he continually rubs her wrists on the glass she broke trying to get in through the window. He wakes up screaming, and tells Heathcliff that there is a ghost named Catherin in the room. Heathcliff runs into the room and as Lockwood shuts the door, he is heard crying out for his apparent lover. Following this occurrence, Lockwood asks a maid named Nelly to tell him about these people's lives. The story begins there.Nelly begins by telling us of her own experiences at Wuthering Heights. She is the nurse of 2 young children--- Catherine and Hindley Earnshaw. Their father is expected to come home one day with presents, yet he brings home a young gypsy boy instead. He is quiet, yet with a strong-will. His name is Heathcliff and the father favors this boy above his own children. Throughout the 3 children's childhood, Hindley is jealous of Heathcliff. Yet as strongly as Hindley and Heathcliff hate each other, Catherine loves the boy. The two were inseparable, and their connection went deeper and deeper with age. When their father dies, Hindley is the head of the household and Heathcliff is turned into a slave. This strong connection turns from childhood playmates, to a deep emotional attraction towards each other. They were both alone in the world, trying to only protect themselves and each other. The connection is so strong, that no amount of physical force could drive these two apart. She was the rebellious teenager, eager for adventure, and ignorantly falling for the boy. Heathcliff was a dark character, who was hardened by the cruelty he received, yet utterly infatuated with the girl. The two young lovers plan to run away together until one night, when they sneak over to Thrushcross Grange to spy on the upper-class family. Yet they are heard, and as the two mischievous trespassers run away, a dog catches Cathy's leg and severely injures her. Cathy stays there to heal for months, and Heathcliff is banished from their property. She becomes close to a formal and respected man named Edgar Linton.As Nelly tells Lockwood of these events, she seems to have an eye for every happening, and an ear for every story. She observes that after Cathy returns home, she is changed. She is now dressed in fine clothes, and an air of superiority. A quote in chapter 8 shows the effect of her changing her affections for Heathcliff to Edgar Linton, \\"Doubtless Catherine marked the difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out. The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect.\\" The young girl is attracted to his wealth, and reputation. While their relationship grew closer, her and Heathcliff grew farther apart. Eventually it came to the point that Linton proposes to Catherine, and she talks to Nelly about it as she tries to decide her answer. Yet as they discuss, Heathcliff is listening the entire time. Catherine says that she cannot \\"degrade\\" herself to Heathcliff's level; it is then that Heathcliff leaves in a rage. However, he departs right before Catherine says one of the most important lines of the book. She says in chapter 9, \\"would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him; and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same, and [Edgar's] is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.\\" With this reference, we learn that she is literally stating, \\"she is Heathcliff;\\" their persons are so similar that they are the same.Throughout this entire time Hindley marries a woman he is deeply fond of, and she becomes pregnant. However, his wife gets sick and dies while giving birth. Hindley becomes a different man after the death of his wife. He turns into an alcoholic, and vows that if he ever sees that baby he will smash its brain. While a life went out of the world, a new one came in however, and the baby boy was named Hareton. Nelly is the sole caretaker for the baby, and treats him with loving care as he grows up.Yet after Heathcliff leaves, Catherine spends the next few days searching for him and sickening herself. She waits for her childhood companion to return for 3 years, but eventually marries Edgar. Thus Nelly and Catherine move from Wuthering Heights to Thrushcross Grange, leaving behind baby Hareton with his drunken father.While the new couple settles into Linton's beautiful, fresh, and crisp home, Nelly starts to notice some aspects of their marriage. Linton listens to everything Catherine says otherwise Catherine will get extremely upset. He gives her everything, and she constantly complains to him. The entire story changes when one day Heathcliff arrives again. He has a new \\"darkness\\" in his eyes, and is now very rich. We will find that his personality has changed from being a boy with anger towards his oppressors, to a man with a psychopathic idea of revenge and love.Immediately, the two have a passionate connection that Linton cannot even compete with. Eventually it gets so bad that Heathcliff threatens to kill Linton, and he must call in help. Linton banishes Catherine from seeing him again, and she fakes a disease to try to get his attention. Eventually however, Linton grows frightened with his wife's health and nurses her night and day. This causes her to keep up with her illnesses and starve herself.Throughout this time, Heathcliff revenges upon Catherine for marrying Linton so he eloped with Linton's brother, Isabella. Isabella is utterly in love with Heathclifff, however he despises her. When Linton hears about his sister's elopement, he disowns her and vows that he cares nothing for her. Catherine is so utterly caught up with jealously with Heathcliff's action, that she grows into a new person. She would lay in bed and stare blankly at nothing for hours. Within 7 months after Heathcliff's return, she becomes so frail and weak that she can no longer move. She is also 7 months pregnant, but Nelly never mentions that until after the baby is born. Heathcliff finally finds a day where Linton is absent to come into her house and find his Cathy. Upon meeting each other, they are overcome with this attachment and lust that completely controls their bodies. Heathcliff lifts Cathy in his arms, not fully aware of the severity of her condition. This roughness causes blue marks in the lady's skin as the maid observes from afar. They kiss repetitively, apparently not aware of anything around them. Yet as hours pass, Linton makes his way home. Nelly pleads for Heathcliff to leave; yet Cathy pleads for him to stay. He leaves Cathy just as Linton comes into the room, and he is overcome by horror at how rabidly her strength had decreased. She died in her husband's loving arms.While this story ends, a new one begins with the child born in the hour of its mother's death. The baby is name Catherine as well. Edgar mourns for his wife for weeks, yet eventually he welcomes the baby in. Nelly calls her \\"angelic,\\" and everyone loves her at the Grange. Yet during the happy days of the baby Catherine's growth, treacherous things take place at Wuthering Heights. We so far have been unaware about anything that has happened at the Heights. Yet Isabella arrives at the door on a frigid winter day, with a deep gash on her neck. She ventures to tell Nelly her entire story from the day she elopes and onward. She tells Nelly how she was attacked, and banished from sleeping in the same room as her husband. She was made fun of, and kicked around. The day that made her run 4 miles through a blizzard, while bleeding profusely from the neck, was a shocking revelation of events.Hindley Earnshaw had told her on a previous date, that she had better make sure her husband's room was locked, because Hindley would shoot him the night it was not. This chilling experience shook the young lady up, and she tried to stay out of the two men's evident hatred towards each other. Hindley plans to kill Heathcliff, but Isabella warns him of coming into the house. Heathcliff believes she is trying to kill him as well, yet is able to attack and almost kill Hindley. Afterwards, she gets into an intense argument with Heatchcliff, and she tells Nelly of her feelings towards her oppressor. She says, \\"it is better to be hated by him than loved him.\\" As she departs, he savagely throws a knife at her neck. Isabella runs away and gives birth to a baby boy named Linton.13 years later, young Catherine grows into a beautiful lady, loved and nurtured by everyone around her. Yet as she grows up, she yearns to go outside of the walls of the Grange. They hear news that Isabella is sick, and she wants to give her nearly 13-year-old son to her uncle. However, the day he arrives, Heathcliff sends for his son and the frail boy never gets to live in a house of safety and solitude.4 years later, as Nelly is out looking for Catherine, she finds that the girl has escaped and ran up to the Heights. Nelly retrieves the foolish girl, and notices that Linton has become extremely sick and frail. She is very angry with Catherine, yet Catherine continues her interests with the Heights and Linton. Catherine and Linton start sending letters to each other, and become romantically interested.. We find through the course of events that Heathcliff manipulates Catherine into marrying Linton while her father dying. He grotesquely locks Nelly up in a room for days until finally she is released and her and Catherine are able to return to see Edgar before he dies. Nelly is not allowed to follow Catherine to the Heights, and finds a few months later that Linton dies, and Catherine is left trapped into a lifestyle under her insane father-in-law.The story ends here because Nelly has no more information to portray. Lockwood, who has been patiently listening, returns to the Heights to find that Heathcliff died, and Catherine is now in love with her other cousin Hareton. Hareton grew into a strong, muscular, mysterious, and rather illiterate man of 23. Heathcliff had bribed the man burying Catherine's coffin, to attach his coffin to hers--- much to the neighbor's detest. That way, he claims, \\"Edgar will not be able to tell us a part.\\" The book ends on somewhat happy terms now that Heathcliff is out of his misery and the new lovers are now together.In my opinion, the book was harshly realistic to what we live through today. It captured not only my attention, but also my emotions. Heathcliff was such a threat to society within the novel and outside of it that it was shocking to read about how strongly his heart was displayed just through words. When reading along, your entire being went into his character. It was repulsive, and horrific to imagine the things he did, but somehow understandable. When we can truly understand how he loved, then it is somewhat clear how he hated. Our villain of the story is not the man that viciously threw a knife at his wife's neck, or tore a young lady away from her dying father. Instead the true villain lies in what love can be turned into. Young Catherine did not love Linton, she only felt sorry for him. Heathcliff did not have the kind of love that will stay by you always, with compassion and gentleness. Heathcliff only attained the emotion of the past--- clinging on to the deep attachments of the wrongs people had done to him, and the only person that ever treated him right.When Heathcliff forces Catherine to stay at his home, and abuse his son and his nephew's emotions towards their cousin, I saw a similarity in Heatchcliff's own experience. He told Hareton to take Catherine out into their garden, \\"but try not to stare when she isn't looking.\\" Yet while she is out with him, he would try to make the sickly Linton jealous. In my opinion, I saw a pain in Heathcliff that he could only suppress by making others suffer.When examining the author of the book, we find that Emily Bronte lived on the moors of Yorkshire, England. The moors are deserted, stormy, and dangerous. The moors can represent Bronte's own life, and also the characters in the novel. All main characters of the novel can be compared to the bleak yet fierce aspect of the place where they live. It says Catherine Earnshaw Linton was buried \\"in a corner of the kirkyard, where the wall is so low that heath and bilberry plants have climbed over it from the moor.\\" She was neither buried in the church with the Linton family, or in the Wuthering Heights graveyard. This can be taken as the idea that she was caught between her wild childhood lover, and her caring protective husband. In our lives today, we can live two lives and get caught in the middle. Whether it is a person in love with two people, our faith, or our character, we can all struggle with living in two different worlds. Following Catherine's death, both Edgar and Heathcliff followed her to her grave. Edgar lived a life of happiness; he moved on with his life. Heathcliff lived a life of despair and solitude, only finding comfort when the ghost of Catherine haunted him. Our lives can be defined by how we are treated, what we lost, and who took that away. Yet we also can move on, and choose to forget those things--- not living in the moors of our devastated, uncivilized emotions. This brilliant novel can truly open up to one's heart and mind as you allow yourself to experience the words of Emily Bronte's inner being."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"reviewer:alysalovesbooks:)I am 16 and I thought this was going to be pretty boring and just...blah.But it was actually pretty good!I admit I only read this book because I had to do an assignment for my English Honors Literature class.It was slow and uninteresting at first but NEVER GIVE UP ON A BOOK right?Well, as I read on,it became more interesting. I really reccommend this and all the other classics because these books set the foundation of a well written book.After all, thats why they are called classics,right?Oh,and for your information.....this was my inspiration to write a novel in the future.....By the way,The Wuthering Heights was a really tough book to write an essay about.hahahaha. Literature is an Awesome class!=)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I first read this book as a senior in high school and I absolutely adored it. I think one of the most amazing things about this novel is that the characters aren't exactly likable and yet you love them anyway. I love Heathcliff, though admittedly I wouldn't ever want to date him. I think Heathcliff is one of my favorite likable bad guys in literature along with Severus Snape. I would really recommend this book to anyone looking for a love story that transcends time and life. One of my favorite things about this book is that it's not just some simple love story where the guy falls in love with the girl and then something bad happens that threatens the relationship but it all works out in the end. I think it is even more tragic than Romeo and Juliet and definitely more complicated. Anyway, I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For the quality of the binding - it's fair at best- the pages at the end sit jagged and uneven. But this was quite inexpensive, and it didn't bother me terribly.The book itself was good. Personally I think Jane Eyre was better, but Wuthering Heights has unusual, headstrong, and not always pleasant characters even in the role of the lovers in the story which makes it very unique."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is written with such charactorization, that well after reading the novel, I am still deep in thought about the psychology of Heathcliff, and those that tell their interpretation of their interaction with him (Lockwood and Nelly Dean). This novel is great for someone who has ever loved and lost, and not had their way, as life often does not turn out the way we intend. I love the way Bronte writes, with the deep meloncolic undertones. It makes me yearn to read another of her novels, however, that is not a possibility. That's all she wrote (besides a collection of poetry). My favourite quote from the book is when Catherine Earnshaw confesses to Nelly that she really loves Heathcliff despite her agreement to marry Edgar Linton: \\"So he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lighting or frost from fire.\\"To me this distinquishes the love of soulmates, between the casual love we create in order to socially fuction; fear from remaining single, money, social status. Brilliant novel!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is a shame Emily Bronte didn't live to see her novel gain the success it deserved, but it is fortunate for the rest of us that she at least lived long enough to write it. Wuthering Heights tells a fascinating story that is extremely difficult to put down despite it straying well outside the traditional territory of novels.The story offers very few sympathetic characters, and much of what it relates is horribly distasteful. Yet the characters are so interesting and the writing so skilled the reader sticks with Bronte through all the trials and tribulations of the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.The story covers about a 25-year period of time in two families whose destinies are tied together by a horrid orphan named Heathcliff. Heathcliff is arguably one of the most despicable villains in literature, as for the sake of his twisted love for Catherine he quite thoroughly and deliberately ruins the lives of almost everyone in those two families, not even sparing his own son his vicious rage. The vengeance he wreaks for his perceived wrongs is thorough and brutal, almost impossible to imagine, yet fascinating to watch.My one complaint would be Bronte's use of phonetic spelling for one of the secondary characters. Joseph's dialogue is virtually impossible to understand in sections, although fortunately his character is not vital to the story. The rest of the writing is quick and entertaining, making the story move quickly and keeping the reader's interest.The reader may assume, as I long did, that a novel written so long ago would be likely to be of more interest in some high school English class than to be read for pleasure. Such prejudice should be set aside, as Wuthering Heights is too good a book to be so ignored."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Jane Eyre is a classic novel from Charlotte Bronte and this unabridged audio recording is highly recommended to people who read the book and loved it and are interested in hearing the book being read. By the way, I strongly suspect that Anne, the previous reviewer who made the speed reading comment about this bookcassette audio recording from Brlliance Audio lisened to this recording without using the adapter or adjusting the balance on her balance control knob on her tape player. If listening to this on a walkman style tape player you need the adapter and you need to read the instructions before using it and if you are listening on a stereo or car tape deck with balance control knob then you need to follow the instructions on how to listen to it that way.

Now many years later I have again found this truly remarkable novel. Its style ranges smoothly from horridly wicked, to loving and caring, to darkly comedic. Heathcliff is perhaps one of the most wretched characters in literature, and his love affair with Catherine is truly unique. This is almost like \\"Jerry Springer\\" for the 19th century. If you skipped this in school, do yourself a favor and pick it up again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've been on a quest this last year or so to read (or re-read) the ladies of English literature that I so sadly ignored in high school. How could I have been so silly. I started my 'tour' with Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\" and quickly went from there to \\"Pride & Prejudice\\", \\"Mansfield Park\\" and \\"Sense & Sensibility\\"...and just recently I picked Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\". I absolutely loved this. I'm not going to give you a great literary dissertation here. I just have to say I loved it. There was love, destruction, reconstruction, sorrow, mindlessness, drunkeness...all marvelously narrated to the reader. I was truly impressed. I'm forever kicking myself for not reading Austen & the Bronte sisters earlier on. The saddest thing about reading these (and other) classics is that you know going into it that the author won't be writing anymore wonderful works. Take the time to read this..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though 'Wuthering Heights' has garnered a reputation as an overly romantic sentimentality, this is not what the book is about at all - and this nonsensical assumption has pervaded popular culture and discouraged new fans. Though 'Wuthering Heights' is, above all, a love story, it is sordid, melancholic, shocking, and filled with characters that are markedly maniacal, self-centered, and cruel. This is, of course, peppered with Early Victorian verbosity, dramatism, and rambling plot, but its content, and the memorable anti-hero that it creates in Heathcliffe, are far less so. Violent, emotional, yet touching, the book creates its indelible charm in its slightly overblown examination of the darkness, but vulnerability, of the human soul."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This story is one of revenge. One day, instead of returning from town with gifts for his two children, the main patriarch instead brings back a \\"waif\\". This street kid, Heathcliff, who is the ridiculed underdog upon arrival, attempts to destroy two families and take their land.I always felt that Heathcliff was an illegitimate child that was claimed one day by his father for some unknown reason (mistress mom died?). For me, this explained the \\"lost soul mate\\" type comments made by his step (or real?) sister and her instinct not to marry him as the right thing even though she did not love the man that she did marry. You decide.Heathcliff is on of the most evil antagonists you will ever read about. He not only wants to win, but wants to destroy absolutely everything that his enemies value.The story itself has three stages which correspond to the three generations of characters. While this in and of itself is not interesting, the way Bronte manipulates the timeline is very effective. Most of the book is told not by the narrator, but by one of the family servants.Also interesting is the prevalence of mysticism versus traditional religion given the backdrop of both when it was written and the time period in which the story was set. The spirit world is front and center.This is not an uplifting book, but the talent of the author should not be missed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have to say that I never would have read this book, had I not read \\"The Well of Lost Plots\\" by Jasper Fforde. There's that once scene where Thursday and her boss appear at that \\"Anger management meeting\\" at Wuthering Heights, and the characters originally invented by Emily Bronte all explain why they hate Mr Heathcliff so much. It made me curious - who is this Mr Heathcliff, and why is \\"Wuthering Heights\\" in constant danger to explode from the emotions it contains?So I got me a copy, and I was fascinated. Not only have I never read a story that contains so much hatred, and revenge, and wild emotions - the characters all seem so real, and so fatal in their set ways - and Mr Heathcliff surely is a wonderful, interesting, enchanting character. Emily Bronte might not be as well-known or famous as her sister, but this book definitely is almost as good as Jane Eyre.If you're not sure whether you want to read this yet - read !The Well of lost Plots\\" first, and then you won't be able to live without!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In Wuthering Heights the characters and households are so easy to visualize, yet when you get further on your perspective on the novel change dramatically. The relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff and Cathy and Hareton are so similar you'd believe they were the same people. Both catherine and Cathy, although they loved Heathcliff and Hareton, turned to Edgar and Linton for status, which played a very important role in the mid-ninteenth century. Yet Catherine was never able to follow through with her love for Heathcliff, while Cathy was able to wed Hareton after Edgar and Heathcliff's passing. The households of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange are extreme opposites. Wuthering Heights is on a bleak, desolate hill, tormented by extremely rough weather. Thrushcross Grange is located in a warm, cozy valley. The inhabitants of Wuthering Heights, most likely due to the morose attitude of Heathcliff, are very gloomy and not welcoming to strangers. Thrushcross Grange is a very open, inviting household, with cheery inhabitants.In a simple page, all your views of the characters and the surroundings can change. When going through the novel, you must feel some pity for Heathcliff. But when the novel begins and ends, he can disgust you with his horrible ways and actions. Upon his death, Wuthering Heights, always a gloomy household, became cheerful and inviting.The relationship between generations is almost invisible. You'd come to believe Catherine and Cathy were the same people, and Edgar and Linton could be brothers. As with Heathcliff and Hareton. You see Cathy follow in her mother's footsteps in her love life, and Edgar and Linton were both frail growing up. You notice those characters have almost everything in common, yet there is always one difference. In Cathy and Catherine's case, Cathy was able to marry the one she loved, but Catherine died before she had the chance. Edgar was more refined than Linton, and was better able to stand up for himself. And Heathcliff, unlike Hareton, had some education, and was smart enough to stand up for himself.I thorougly enjoyed reading this book, it would've been even better without horrible deadlines*ahem*, but all in all I found the novel's characters and settings to be so creative and ever changing. I don't think I could've written this book in a lifetime. Of course I'm a VERY slow writer. Especially when there are deadlines, but... that's another story for another day. Too bad, you might have found it really good. Oh well. It might make you laugh too. But I shall not say anymore. I'm just going to make you ever so sad. Maybe you'll hear it someday. Wow, I'm really managing to drag this out. This should be worth extra extra credit. The suspense is just killing you I'm sure. Anyways, this was an excellent book, and I'm very glad I read it. Not to mention we're going to read Great Expectations next. Yay!? Goodnight, America."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have just recently finished the book Wuthering Heights and have found it is a very interesting book.In the novel, Nelly Dean is telling Mr. Lockwood the story of Mr. Heathcliff, who is the landlord of the houses Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.Mr. Heathcliff was a young, poor child when he was adopted into the rich Earnshaw household. As Heathcliff grew up he fell in love with Catherine Earnshaw, daughter of Mr. Earnshaw, and loved her throughout the rest of the novel. Once Catherine is old enough she decides to marry Edgar Linton for his social status (i.e. money, looks), and hopes to bring Heathcliff up out of the power of her brother Hindley. Heathcliff regrets her decision and runs away for three years.When Heathcliff comes back he is very wealthy and wishes to see Catherine after his time away for so long. After meeting with Catherine, Heathcliff is very upset at the fact that she married Mr. Edgar Linton. Heathcliff finds out that Isabella, Edgars sister, has fallen in love with him and he thinks it will be a perfect way to get revenge on not only on Catherine, but also Edgar Linton. Heathcliff marries Isabella and takes her to live and Wuthering Heights with him, where she is quite miserable due to the lack of hospitality. During this time period Catherine dies after she has her daughter Cathy, and Heathcliff is miserable because he never got to show his love towards her. At this point Isabella runs off to Gimmerton, the local village, and has a child named Linton which she asks her brother to come pick up so that Heathcliff could not torture him with the anger he had towards Isabella. After Edgar picks up Linton, Isabella dies and Edgar comes back to the Grange. The next day Nelly brings Linton over to the Heights because Heathcliff says its \\"his property\\". Young Cathy falls in love with her cousin Linton, even though he is always sick and moaning, and eventually marries him. Linton dies one night and Heathcliff taks control over both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. Young Cathy falls in love with Hareton, son of Hindley Earnshaw, and marries him. Heathcliff eventually dies and everyone lives happily ever after.I personally wouldn't have picked up this book myself if it was up to me, but my teacher had us read it in his class and im glad i did. Compared to Wuthering Heights, not any other novel has seemed so hard."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I recommend this wonderful book to almost everyone! I especially love reading novels that take place in the past yet can be related to now. One thing I do recommend - when you start reading this book, as you piece character personalities and profiles together - write them down! Make a family tree! That is the one confusing part of this book but by getting things down on paper you help yourself to enjoy the book more and not worry so much about who is who ;)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights can easily be compared to a soap opera. Personally, I do not have an inclination towards soap operas, but this novel, written by Emily Bronte, was done beautifully. One of the most complex characters in literature is perhaps Heathcliff. His motives are sometimes opaque but his emotions are so real. The reader can identify with his heartbreak and anguish. The despair created by the love triangles throughout this novel is breathtaking. There is symbolism on every page, making Wuthering Heights an in-depth work of literature. This novel is truly a romantic classic, and personally, my favorite."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I think this book evokes controversial responses from readers because of the ending and because of their failure to interpret this piece of literature. Wuthering Heights is not just a love story--it's a story of relationships, class struggles, the angst of the soul, passion, remorse, and regret. It is about everything that makes us human, e.g. the power to choose between good and evil. It is about obsession and how it can kill the soul. The story is masterfully written, filled with symbolic representations. The reader must read between the lines to truly appreciate and understand this great classic!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The symbolizim in this book is great, Heathcliff compared to the moors, the blooming trees at the end are Hareton and cathy, etc. This book has everything, from hate, to the most passonate love! HIghly recommended!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Oh my God! This was the most amazing book I have ever read. I cannot express how thrown i was by this classic tale of disturbed love and torturous passion. It knows no bounds!! The most amazing experience for me was to read this book, Cathy is beautiful and ghostly, Heathcliff is dark and still, yet undercurrents of black, storm his character like a great tempest! The relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff could be explained as so: Cathy is Heathcliff's light and Heathcliff is Cathy's eternal darkness, these are two characters who love what they have learned to fear! AMAZING!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I would never have read this brilliant, fascinating, and whirlwind novel had it not been for my English teacher. I can't believe what I would have missed out on! The narrative is not at all confusing - it's simply 1st person limited. The frame narration is wonderful, it adds to the mystique and ambiguity that surrounds the whole situation. Heathcliff inexorably attracts and repels as does Catherine. It's one long huge piece of poetic prose. It disturbs, it frightens, it causes one to look at a darker side in a new light. The book is amazing, Emily Bronte was a woman way beyond her times. I would reccomend this book to everyone - even those annoyed with the characters etc simply cannot argue with the mastery of the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is simply the best book I have ever read. You can't just read this book, you have to feel it, breathe it and live it. I simply love it....."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book when I was 15 or16, I think, out of curiosity, I had heard so much about it. Three years later it is still my favourite book. I lost track of the number of times I had read it. To me it is the greatest love story ever written. At first, I felt it strange that the hero of this story should be an unbelievably evil villian, but I later understtod that Heathcliff was not your conventional love-sick melodramatic hero, and how Emily Bronte could make this character appear deserving of sympathy and even a little admiration, is nothing short of literary genuis. I had come to that conclusion years ago- you had to love a man who could love like that. I felt his character was more rounded than any character I've known. Some people might find the book depressing, gloomy, even a bit morbid-no doubt it is, to a cerain extent.I found it to be the most realistic, passionate and romantic love story I've ever read or will read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am writing my senior college thesis (currently) on this brilliant novel and everytime I pick my much-loved copy up I discover something new and fascinating. My copy has notes in the margins throughout, often followed by an exclamation marks to indicate my excitement. This excellent novel is saturated with deep thoughtful symbolism, the colorful beautifully-created characters (despite their cruelty) have our sympathy throughout (if they deserve it). The emotion Emily Bront is able to convey through her words defies description itself. I love this book so incredibly much; I consider it to the best of the Bront novels and I've read nearly them all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I spent most of my life avoiding books like this. Now, nearing 50, I have been finding that many of these old English novels are great fun and can occasionally even be very moving (&quot;Silas Marner&quot; knocked me clean out!). What you will find distinctive about &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is its surprising violence. The title tells it all: Yes, &quot;wuthering&quot; is an alternative spelling of &quot;weathering&quot; -- we have entered the heights of wearing-down. You will find it incredible the depths Heathcliff sinks to in order to exercise his obsession. Bodily violence, to be sure, but also, and mainly, torture of the soul. You will shake with revulsion and frustration when reading of the wrongs Heathcliff perpetrates. Can anything good come out of this Hell on Earth? Will the violence follow its winding path ever downward? Ah, but that's for you to discover. Hunker down and go for it. This ain't no sippin' novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"While I know this is considered a great Classic Romance, I failed to see the romance or the greatness. I decided to read this because I had never done so. I regretted that decision within three chapters. I was determined to finish it to find the wonder of this work that I had heard so much about. I failed to find it in all of it's almost 400 pages. It was a tedious read and nowhere near the great romance I was led to believe. While the last few pages were a payoff, they were not worth the torture of the previous ones."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Not what I was expecting. For some reason I thought Heathcliff was going to be a typical romantic construct who had some dramatic character arc. I'm a little misanthropist myself so you would think I would like this novel, relishing along with my kindred spirit, but I was never quite captivated."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was under the impression that I had ordered an actual book. I wrote the seller who provided a link for an e-copy of the book. I appreciated the offer but my daughter needed the actual book for English class in school. Be aware of what you are ordering - if you want the actual book, verify that is what you ordered."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After listening to this unabridged version of Wuthering Heights I am a great fan of Tantor Unabridged Classics. The narrator did an excellent job bringing the characters to life. This is a wonderful story though a bit depressing. Many classics from that time are written with a an overwrought, tradgic mood. If you can handle that, it is a good story of a dysfunctional family, revenge and love."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Anyone who is a frequent reader of this blog knows of my aversion to classics. I don't typically enjoy them, I always have to force myself to finish them, and I usually just end up giving up before I finish altogether. This book started out similar - it took me a really long time to get invested in the story and characters, I read it very slowly, and I was pretty sure I was going to hate it by page 50. Fortunately for me, though, I ended up enjoying the story when I (sadly) forced myself to continue on. (Thanks, Classics Challenge, for that little push!) I am SO proud of myself for getting through this and actually feeling like I somewhat enjoyed the book. Someone described this book to me as almost like a soap opera (can't remember who...), and that individual is completely right. There is so much drama in here... it's crazy. I definitely felt attached to the characters, even with all their unpredictable drama, and I'm glad that I finished the book and got to appreciate it. I can't really say that this is one of my favorites, but it is a pretty decent book, and I can see why it is dubbed a \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After reading \\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte, I knew I had to read her sister's only novel. Quite an interesting contrast to the love story of \\"Jane Eyre,\\" but unique and worthwhile nonetheless. A great classic by a 19th century female writer...read it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is an interesting book in that people tend to take it in one of two ways. People either feel that Ms. Bronte is drawing a love story between Heathcliff and the 1st Catherine, or that Ms. Bronte is pointing out the 'terrible truth' of the failings of romantic love. I myself lean towards the latter. For one thing, the 1st Catherine dies 1/2 way through the story.The story is basically this. Mr. Earnshaw (father of Hindley and the 1st Catherine) brings home an abandoned child. (Heathcliff) At the risk of oversimplifying, Heathcliff is basically responsible for rifts in the Earnshaw household. (For one thing, Hindley, with some justification feels that he has lost his father's love to Heathcliff.) Heathcliff seems to bring out the worst in both Hindley and Catherine. While we may sympathize with Heathcliff from time to time, he basically represents vengeance and destruction.Moving on, you will probably notice that while that while certain characters display passion for each other, the happiness DOES NOT last into the marriage. We may be tempted to think that Nelly Dean is in fact Emily Bronte herself scoffing at the characters she created.Moving on, the 1st Catherine (who married Edgar Linton) dies leaving behind one daughter Catherine (2). The widowed Hindley dies leaving behind a brain damaged son (Hareton). The story then switches focus to Hareton, the widower Edgar, Edgar's daughter Cathy (2), and Heathcliff's son Linton. It is interesting that Edgar is the most likable once he is a widower trying to raise his daughter. Heathcliff remains a character of darkness and vengeance bringing pain and torment to the surviving characters. (For someone who is famous for loving the 1st Catherine, he sure doesn't mention her much. Nor does he seem to have any problem treating her daughter wickedly.) There is something called false imprisonment, as well as kidnapping!I don't want to ruin the book for those of you who haven't read it. But there is an interesting resolution that to some extent gives the romantic at heart what they want. However, at the same time, Heathcliff's expansion of character is limited. While many see this as a romantic novel, Miss Bronte is offering us an interesting reality check. (Passions are often short lived, and do not often last once marriage and reality set in)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When I first started reading this novel I thought it got off to a somewhat of a slow start, and when it switched the narrators I got a bit confused. As the novel progressed and told about the relationships present between Heathcliff and Catherine I got very interested. Throughout the novel I noticed the absence of mothers present in the novel. I found that part of it very interesting and really wonder why Emily Bronte made it so that all of the children lost their mother figure. I recommend this novel to anyone who has to read a \\"classic\\" novel for any type of educational purpose. My only advice to anyone who reads this book is wait like 50 pages before you decide to give up on the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a classic love story between dark, handsome Heathcliff and beautiful, lovable Catherine Earnshaw. The differences they had in life never came between their strong willed love. This is a book for EVERYONE. I believe that this should be read by each person sometime during their lifetime. There were things I liked about the book and things I didn't, but the good outweighed the bad.I loved how Emily Bronte, the author, switched from the point of view of one character to the other because it gave me a better idea of what the story was about. In addition it was nice to know what all the characters thought everything that went on. That made it hard for me not to put down the book, although I had to in order to live my life.My next praise of Wuthering Heights is the way that the setting and the characters are described. With all of the vivid words in this story it made me believe everything that was happening. I really began to see the surroundings and feel the way Heathcliff and Catherine did about each other, and how much hatred Hindley and the rest of the world had towards Heathcliff, with the many astounding words that she used to write this wonderful book.Now to the one thing that I disliked about Wuthering Heights, it was hard to get into. The first, oh maybe, 5-6 chapters were gloomy and not to exciting. It seemed as though it would never get better and more interesting. Surprisingly, it gets better every second you read on.To wrap it up, Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is a stunning book. I recommend it to everyone to read in their lifetime. This book proves that it doesn't matter if a book was written a long time ago because it will still capture readers for many years to come. The good outweighed the bad in this story because of the vast description and how well it is written."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte is a brilliant and flowing writer, but there were definitely times when I was completely lost and confused. However, I think it's because of the way that she writes this novel that makes it so captivating. It's terrifying and romantic, it's seemingly unbearable and it's light and easy. It's definitely the best of both worlds. A romantic and thrilling tale of love and evil. Who doesn't love that? Not to mention the writing is second to none.But, regardless of how much I love this story, I did have to take a star away just because of how many times I had to stop and go, \\"wait ... wha? erm ... but I thought ...\\" And yes, in the long run, it makes the book that much greater, but it can get frustrating (especially for one not used to that type of reading) and confusing.But, yeah, a true classic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wonderful book -- I have read and re-read it so many times and fall in love with it all over again each time!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book was in good condition and arrived on time. Wuthering Heights a classic story of passion and vengeance. One for the bookshelves to be read again!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My father thought it outstanding & gave it to me to read when I was young. I thought it gorgeous & got it for my daughter, who, is loving it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Admittedly, I saw the PBS Masterpiece Classic version of this story before ever picking up the book. My reasons are my own but I have to say - neither disappoint. Though it's no surprise that the two stories are different in many ways - the book version is so visceral and touching. It's no wonder that since it was first published in 1847, it's never been out of print."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The Bronte sisters have always seemed to come up as respectable classical female writers and as story telling goes, I will agree that they can tell a story. I have notice though, that their stories have the common denominator of detailing the ugliest side of humanity. Whether it is unconquerable cruelty or the amount of abuse it takes to break a naturally good spirit and turn it black with bitterness and spite, both Bronte stories that I have read dwell solely on the darkest aspects of life. The only silver lining in this story is that eventually perhaps, after enough suffering, fate will turn your hand. Eventually. Maybe.If that is your thing, you will appreciate and perhaps enjoy this book. As for myself, I prefer books that vary in sentiment. Sometimes happy, sometimes sad, sometimes crazy, etc."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a different type of story. It follows the developments of two generations of families and the family dynamics within from the point of an outsider being told the story. It almost reads like a family history if not for the love story thrown in. For the time period, the portrayal of certain scenes was quite graphic, and it's interesting to try to gain that perspective from our current time period, where violence and sex are pretty much societal norms.A great book! I would suggest making a family tree as you read; it does get a bit confusing!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The story is known to a number of people but reading it over allows one to experience it from a different perspective as we grow."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I didn't have the opportunity to read American Literature in HS and to be honest,I doubt I would have enjoyed this one as much back then. I feel when you reach a certain age,you understand more about life and,of course,there's nobody telling you to read it NOW! This is a well written love story and is about how tangled up love can become when you are denied to follow your heart. It's a sad tale but I enjoyed every minute of reading it. If you haven't read any of the Classics,I suggest you read this one,makes you want to read other classic books!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I disliked this book enough that I waded through half of it, and then just stopped. It is well-written, but so dark and foreboding that I simply did not enjoy reading it. I gave it a good try but decided to go for books I actually enjoyed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Last read Wuthering Heights as a teenager, now at 69 enjoyed Bronte's classic even more. The depth of the characters and their interactions heightened my senses. Bronte's words were so descriptive they inspired me to continue on my journey through rereads."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"That's how I would describe this novel. I first read it when I was 15 and hated it. I couldn't understand what the appeal was about these savage, ruthless, selfish characters. I was obsessed with Jane Eyre, but Wuthering Heights seemed a distant, incomphrehensible world. But now, nearly 20 years later, I have a better appreciation of it. It really is worth reading - just persevere through the first 50 pages or so, and you'll be sucked in.I haven't seen the Laurence Olivier film, but am curious now to see how this bleak and twisted world is portrayed on screen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is not the creepiest classic in existance, but it is delightfully morbid, what with insane make-out sessions with corpses, and still has a beautiful ending and a bit of happiness in the last chapter. However, I have heard so many people call it boring or difficult to read that I have become apalled and have lost hope for the future of the human race.The characters of Wuthering Heights are the element of the book most frequently attacked. But Heathcliff is NOT evil!! How would anyone feel, never wanted by anyone in their entire life but one woman, and then to be cast off by that same woman? How would anyone feel in his shoes? He is a git and he is a dreadful person, but he is a complex and layered character, deeply troubled and very well written. As for everybody else, not a one is really likeable, but not a one is evil. They are only what they world has made them, Cathy the younger spoiled and Hindley abused. And if you still don't like them? Well, take comfort that most of them die.My second point is that this book is NOT hard to read. The gamekeeper's dialogue is, granted, impossible. But he hardly talks anyway. Also, the family tree is equally difficult, but it helps to draw your own as you go along. However, other than that the text is simple and the plot-line straightforward. The beauty is in the descriptions.This is a love story of epic proportions. It doesn't illustrate the beauty of love until the end, but also incorporated is platonic love of family and friends. Yet nevertheless, love triumphs upon the finale, and it does truly tell of true love. True love isn't perfect, but it is, in essence, everlasting. And this book tells of nothing if not everlasting love: \\"Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.\\" - Catherine Linton (once Catherine Earnshaw), relating to Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What a Morose book this is! This is the first book that I have read by the Bronte sisters. I was really looking forward to it. It begins with the story of Mr. Lockwood entering the house of Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights) and the reader finding out that the people inhabiting the house are just nasty. This includes Heathcliff, Hareton and Catherine (the younger).Some have indicated that this is a love story. I am not so sure of that. It is clear in the story that Heathcliff was in love with Catherine (the elder) and was deeply hurt when she married Edgar. He goes off for three years and returns with money. However, where and how he got his money is never explained in the story.Now that he has returned, it is Heathcliff's intention to get revenge on those that he believed have wronged him. This includes Hindley, Catherine's brother, Edgar, Hareton, Linton (his own son) and Isabella. If he cannot get his revenge on those that wronged him, he will get it on the children of those that wronged him such as Hareton and Catherine (the younger).Shortly after he returns, Catherine (the elder) dies but not before giving birth to her and Edgar's dauther Catherine. By this time though, Heathcliff has married Isabella, Edgar's sister. Heathcliff wants to get his hands on Thrushcross Grange since this is the home of Edgar and Catherine. On the day after he is married to Isabella, he basically tells her that he married her to get possession of Thrushcross Grange.It is at this point that I realized that Heathcliff was an evil person. It is also at this point that I no longer considered the novel to be a love story. Heathcliff's love has now been turned into hatred. He has one thing on this mind and that is to make those around him miserable.When he returns to Wuthering Heights, Hindley is a drunk and an gambler. Hindley's son Hareton will inherit Wuthering Heights but Heathcliff gives money to Hindley and now becomes the mortgagor of the property so that when Hindley dies Heathcliff becomes the owner of Wuthering Heights.If Edgar dies without Catherine being married she will inherit Thrushcross Grange. When Edgar gets a letter from his sister, Isabella (remember that is Heathcliff's wife) that she is dying and wants him to take care of her son, Linton (Heathcliff's son too), he goes and gets him from near London. On the night of their return, Heathcliff sends Joseph to get him. The next day Linton leaves to live a Wuthering Heights. Given his condition, he gets Linton to correspond with Catherine but since Nelly and Edgar are standing in the way of their marriage, he forces Catherine to marry Linton. Therefore, when Edgar dies Thrushcross Grange becomes the property of Linton. Linton, being sickly through the whole bood, soon dies and wills the Thrushcross Grange to Heathcliff. At this time, Catherine, Hareton, and Heathcliff are all living at Wuthering Heights and he rents Thrushcross Grange to Mr. Lockwood.At the time Catherine (the elder) dies, Heathcliff asks that her ghost haunt him. In the last couple of chapters, it appears that Heathcliff continually sees Catherine's ghost. Heathcliff fails to eat and eventually dies. At that time, Hareton and Catherine are falling in love, which is the only happy part in the book (other than Heathcliff dying).All in all, this is a very dark story. This is a story of love (at first) and then hatred. This is a story of how hatred can destroy a person as well as those around him. It is a good story but I don't consider this a love story. Heathcliff is an evil person that never changes his ways of making other miserable. He enjoys making other miserable. I liked the book but it is just a little too dark for me to give it a five star rating."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was recommended this book under the theme of Love and Romance but its so not Love....hate or greed would better describe it.This book is beautifully written however,among the best I've read. It flows. Too bad that Emily Bronte only lived to write one masterpiece. This book has been on my mind for quite some time after reading it.If you like good drama...this is the book for you...love, hate, obsession,abuse,marriage,separation, death,.....yes...this is DRAMA. I loved it.Some points I wanted to stop because it was evoking too much emotions but the suspence was too much. Its that good."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to read this book as a part of a literature class I took. When informed of my assignment, I was neither enthused or diappointed. I am always interested in reading something new, however I was unfamiliar with Wuthering Heights and did not know what to expect. I started reading it and by the third chapter, I was hooked. This book it probably the most painfully romantic novel ever. Unfortunately, the emotions this book arouses are unable to be put into words. Like a previous reviewer said, this book \\"has a certain something.\\" That it does."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the sad tale of thwarted love between two soulmates destined to be apart. Cathy and Heathcliff were one in being, but two in person and this was a torture neither got over.It's bitter sweet and painful to read at some points, but the love of Hareton and Catherine in the end makes one wonder if THEY were the ones destined for happiness, not Cathy and Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is a thin line between love and hate, and once Heathcliff crosses it, we see a grand, passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug. Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village.Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, \\"Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?\\"Sound depressing? It's not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one's heart, rather than one's head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off.Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That's the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place.Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher's daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"WUTHERING HEIGHTS was the most amazing book I have ever read. It's characters are so unique and unlike any displayed in any other novels. The characters are so realistic; so flawed, so horrible, yet able to be sympatized with by the reader. They leave us wondering why they take the actions they take while still making us feel emotion for even Heathcliff, the cruel revenge-seeker who spends many years divising a plan to ruin the lives of the people whom he hates. Emily Bronte is a genius and her book should not be insulted just because certain readers can not appreciate the beauty of this intense story of love and revenge."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you've always wanted to read one of the great works of literature, but was intimidated by the lengthy volumes, long-winded sentences and complicated language, then you may want to direct your attention toward \\"Wuthering Heights\\". Perhaps the most famous novel penned by one of the three Bronte sisters (though Charlotte Bronte comes a very close second with \\"Jane Eyre\\"), \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is reasonably easy to read, with straightforward narrative, fluid pace and of slim length. Though the content will definitely not appeal to everyone, it is an approachable novel in terms of readability.The story is predominately a love story, though a love story that is haunted by revenge, jealously, hate, greed and death; all the juicy stuff that people are magnetically drawn to. Heathcliff is a young foundling boy, brought to Wuthering Heights by his foster-father Mr Earnslaw. Mr Earnslaw indulges the small boy, but his wife and his eldest son Hindley are repulsed by the half-wild creature and treat him no better than an animal, though they are held back by Mr Earnslaw's influence. But it is in Cathy that Heathcliff finds his soul mate, and the children spend hours together, roaming the wilderness like gypsies, utterly inseparable. But the two are not angels: masters at manipulation and conniving, Cathy and Heathcliff are experts at shaping their household to suit their own tastes with total disregard to anyone beyond themselves; Cathy in particular delights in tormenting her father by doing \\"just what he hated most, showing how her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over Heathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do her bidding in anything, and his only when it suited his inclination.\\"But when Mr Earnslaw dies, the disgruntled Hindley returns to Wuthering Heights and immediately relegates Heathcliff to the servants-quarters. From here stems the rivalry and hatred that marks the central tragedy of the book, as Heathcliff and the two predominant families of the area: the Earnslaws and the Lintons, fight amongst each other in a bitter feud for power, love, the land and the estate, in a struggle that continues down into the next generation. Each individual seems to achieve a sense of power and control over others briefly, only to loose it again via a marriage or death, and the plot twists and turns though many intrigues and mysteries.It is Heathcliff in the centre of this storm, determined to avenge himself against those who have wronged him: \\"I don\`t care how long I wait, if I can only do it at last\\", and though he is the main character of the book, he is certainly best described as an \\"anti-hero\\", and many new readers are somewhat taken back with the idea that he is the central figure. In one shocking moment, he saves the life of his enemy's son - almost accidentally - and immediately regrets taking such action. He's an enigma that's for certain, as he has no last name and nothing is known of his past before he's brought to Wuthering Heights; his personality is unintentionally captured in the name his foster family bestow on him, reflecting the wild atmosphere of the setting: \`heath' and \`cliff'. Heathcliff and Catherine are a \\"heathen pair\\" as the narrative would say, and the reader is not expected to like or admire them; but as characters they are utterly fascinating and one can't help but envy the extraordinary bond between them.In terms of the narration, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is indeed unique. Not told by an omnipotent third-person voice, the tale is told to a new tenant at Thrushcross Grange - Mr Lockwood - by the former housekeeper at Wuthering Heights, Mrs Dean. This makes the levels of storytelling quite complex, for at some points (for example) we are hearing Catherine's testimony, as told to Mrs Dean, as she narrates to Mr Lockwood, who then records it for the audience. Anyone's whose played Chinese Whispers will know that stories change in the passing on from one person to each other, and the reader is challenged to untangle the gossip of Mrs Dean and the blandness of Mr Lockwood's records to uncover the true passion of the lives involved. It is a challenge you should relish.In terms of genre, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" can almost be considered the \\"poster-child\\" of Gothic literature, as almost every component of it caters to the \\"dark and stormy night\\" mentality of the Gothic style and narration; from vivid nightmares to the rugged landscape to the almost insane desires and fears of its characters, this novel is the very definition of \\"Gothic\\". Whenever you're in the mood for a dose of the twisted and heavy tones of the Gothic, then you should definitely have \\"Wuthering Heights\\" at hand. The critic Richard Chase says it best when he says Bronte was inspired by: \\"the sheer romantic exhilaration of escape from culture itself, into a world where nature is dire, terrible and beautiful, where human values are personal, alien and renunciatory, and where contradictions are to be resolved only by death...\\" No other critical quote I've read better describes the sheer melodrama of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" than this.Ultimately, the book is about opposites and extremes, and the very fine line that exists between them; between light and dark, man and woman, humanity and animalism, the wild and civilisation, and love which exists to both heal and destroy people. In gentle comparison to Heathcliff's soul-consuming love that prays Catherine's ghost will return to haunt him, is Catherine's quiet but absolute declaration that: \\"whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same\\".Wow. I love this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is one of the best novels I have evr read. The passions of which were intwined within the characters' was described so deeply that I could feel the pain so strongly as if I were the character myself.When Catherine and Heathcliff were blaming each other for breaking each other's hearts, I cried hysterrically. The love and friendship between the couple was so intimately written that you could feel the different melodies of their ongoing reasonings. Cathy accused Heathlcliff of murdering her, for having wanted her to choose between himself and Edgar. Cathy told Heathcliff that she did not care how he wold suffer without her for he broke her heart in such a way, that he did not even care for her sufferings. Heathcliff fired back exclaming that instead Cathy had killed herself for vowing to be with Edgar. He also said that forgetting Cathy would be forgetting his very existence. \\" I love my murderer, but yours, how can I?\\" This would have to be one of my fvorite quotes from the novel. Even thought that line is so short, it means so much. This line revealed the intensity of his feelings torwards Cathy; that it hurt him so much to see her in such a state of illness and emotional sufferings, felt for him.I hate to say it, but what made this story so interesting was the evil doings accomplished by Heathcliff. The vigorating acts such as the enforcing of the marriage of Cathy and Linton was thought out by Heathcliff so cleverly, that it amused me, in it's own devilish way.This novel touched emotions of passion, love and hate that it made me think deeper about the \\"inside\\" of a relationship between a man and a woman."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This movie was amazing and now I am reading the book.

It's kind of understandable that it received a lot of negative reactions when it was first published, because the lead character, Heathcliff, is one of the nastiest characters ever devised. And the second most important character, Catherine (Sr.), isn't all that nice, either. Still, this is one of the best books of its time period and a must read for anyone interested in 19th Century literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After reading Wuthering Heights, my love for litarature and the &quot;classic&quot; books have increased impressively. No, i did not read this for school, I read it to broaden my list of vocabulary words. (my ideal goal in life is to be an author, and i will be one). It pains me to see the thrashing reviews of a great book by high school students who simply shouldn't be reading books like this, not yet, or perhaps never. You can't really call this a romance. or, not a Traditional Romance anyway. The love affair between Heathcliff and Catherine is obviously doomed from the start. People continously say they hated the characters. I didn't. I loved them! Heathcliff and Catherine the most. Not that i didn't hollar at them when they did the idiotic things that became repetitive, as I've seen happen in real life. In fact, the only character i disliked was Nelly Dean, who seemed determined to ruin the already corrupt relationship Heathcliff and Catherine shared. This story is so true to real life. It's so bitter, so gothic. There's not a happily ever after in this novel, folks. I love tear jerkers, and that is what this book is. One thing that Emily Bronte is marvelous at, is her description. Her words plant a vivid picture in my mind. And she doesn't need to go on and on with describing either. She can make a place seem real with one paragraph! Read this book. For whatever reason, read it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I LOVED Wuthering Heights. Although the book gets bad reviews for its crudness, I liked that the characters were real. It is refreshing to find a book that has the main characters with tons of flaws.

I couldn't! It's not perfectly presented, but the novel does entice the reader into the bizarre world of Wuthering Heights. I normally read war novels (lots of blood and violence) and honestly, Wuthering Heights in some ways is as violent as they are. It is both disturbing and satisfying. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you are devoted to the Brontes and to _Wuthering Heights,_ you will probably want to swallow twice and pony up for this facsimile of the original edition of the novel. There's something breath-taking in seeing it as Emily Bronte, with only a year or so to live, saw her own work in 1847. The crudeness of the text--typos abound--somehow corresponds to the roughness of the sensibility that produced it. And since the original publisher wanted to spread it out so as to sell thicker book, it's easy on the eyes.The book is sewn in heavy, orangish cloth and feels substantial; in these days of flashy, cheaply produced volumes, this two volume set is a happy throwback."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is, with Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" my alltime favorite book. I've read it several times, beginning at age twelve. Even when I was too young to understand all of its complexities, I still appreciated its highly atmospheric qualities and the magic that makes it timeless.Over the years, I've asked myself, time and time again, just what it is about \\"Wuthering Heights\\" that gives it such power. I've finally come to the conclusion that \\"Wuthering Heights\\" endures simply because its characters dare to feel things and act in ways the rest of us don't. We all have times when we're tempted by obsession and revenge, but most of us don't act on those temptations. At times, we all feel driven almost to madness and we all have a wild side (some of us more than others) that finds perfect expression in the character of Heathcliff. In this book, the characters are always threatening to break the bounds of respectibility and civility.While some people see \\"Wuthering Hieghts\\" as the ultimate love story, I've never found much love in this book, not even between Catherine and Heathcliff. What I have found are obsession and revenge. Love would have watered this story down; obsession and revenge crank it up. Love is an acceptable (even prized) emotion; obsession and the desire for revenge, though felt my many, are definitely frowned upon. The fact that Emily Bronte allows her characters to give in to obsession, to go mad, to exact revenge, gives her novel a distinctly disturbing, unsettling power.There are many criticisms of this novel that attempt to analyze what Emily Bronte was trying to say. Many compare the domesticity of Thrushcross Grange to the isolation and wildness of Wuthering Heights. These ctiticisms don't interest me in the slightest. No matter how educated Emily Bronte was or wasn't, she certainly didn't study psychoanalysis and she certainly didn't write her novel keeping the finer points of analysis in mind. Emily Bronte was, by all accounts, a highly imaginative girl who cared more for the world of fantasy than for reality. Approach her book as literature; enjoy it and don't attempt to \\"pull it apart.\\"Many people have said that the \\"second generation\\" in this book redeems the one that preceded it; i.e., Cathy and Hareton redeem Catherine and Heathcliff. I can't agree with that assessment. All of the characters in \\"Wuthering Heights\\" show themselves to be capable of violence and obsession (even Edgar). I think, in seeing the \\"second generation\\" as restorative, we deny many of the passions inherent in this book. Catherine and Heathcliff are the characters most given to wild emotions but they are not the only ones; all of the characters can and do resort to violence when it suits their needs.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is one of those rare books: a truly inspired masterpiece. It has a very unsettling, disturbing, even fascinating quality about it because it touches the darkest regions of our soul. Heathcliff is the dark side in all of us; the side we don't enjoy even acknowledging and Catherine's failure to deal with her obsesion reminds us that we, too, can fail, we all are vulnerable to Catherine's fate.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a stormy, unsettling, often violent book that explores the darkest side of human nature. Its beauty is raw and savage; its emotions spill over the constraints of civility and common sense. It's a powerful book (one of the most powerful in all of literature). It's a work of genius that's truly unforgettable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Before I put in my two bits, I made a point of reading other reviews and most of what I read I agreed wholeheartedly with, But for the other 10%, I was extremely dissapointed. For those of you who complained, and said that Wuthering Heights was a dull and boring book, maybe the book isn't the problem, and you are. Could it be possible that you need to open your narrow vision and broaden your veiw of this worlds literature? I am fourteen and I totally understood this book. I was wrapped up it the whole time, and there was never one part that I thought was boring. I admit, at times it was confusing, but never boring.This book is without a doubt the best written peice of work I have ever read. The description blew my mind, and as for the characters, they were fully developed and I was able to bring them alive in my mind as easily as I ever have in any other book.Brontte made it so easy to imagine Heathcliff that I had to make no effort whatsoever on my part to bring him to life. As for Catherine, she was developed so well that I can honestly say I saw her as a real person.This novel left me wanting nothing more but a sequel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It's strange that as a lover of literature (it was my major in college too), I haven't previously read Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. I'm surprised that it wasn't assigned for any of my classes. I've read and loved Jane Eyre by Emily's sister Charlotte multiple times and Wuthering Heights has literally been on my shelf for years waiting for me to read it.Last week I decided to cross Wuthering Heights off my to-read list.I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting. You can't not have some expectations about Wuthering Heights. It's often a favorite novel of other literary/pulp fiction characters. A well-written, darkly romantic ghost story. That's what I was expecting. And in some ways, that's what the book was.The writing is really good once I got past the strange and sometimes confusing model of narration--the servant telling the story to a boarder who writes in his diary. This style removes the reader from some of the inner dialogue and thoughts of the main characters. However, if it had been narrated by Heathcliff, like Lolita's Humbert, I might be even more disturbed by his character. And who else could have narrated it? Cathy II, Hareton and Linton have no idea why their lives are being constantly manipulated by Heathcliff.There is a ghost. Her appearance early in the novel is the only moment of intense emotion and romance that I expected from the novel. It is the only reason I was compelled to continue reading. I was eagerly awaiting another such experience.The characters are either reprehensible and completely without merit or sniveling, abused pawns in Heathcliff's demented game of revenge.Needless to say, I was disappointed. Lovers of Wuthering Heights will no doubt claim that I have missed the point. Perhaps. Maybe you have to be younger to read and appreciate the immature and ridiculous passion of Heathcliff. Maybe I missed my chance to appreciate this novel. Still, I don't understand why so many teenagers actually like it. How is this an example of true love? How is abuse and vile retribution against others romantic?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte's only novel, is very different from her famous sisters', and critical opinion in the last few decades has decided it is the best of them, which truly says much. It first got mixed reviews but has continually risen to the point where it topped a recent poll of the greatest love stories, showing that it is one of the few classics with true mass appeal. Wuthering is indeed a masterpiece with a thrilling story, superb characterization, stunning prose, and more than a little sociopolitical relevance. Its power has enthralled readers for over a century and a half and shows no sign of lessening.The story itself is one of the most immediately engrossing elements. Tightly plotted and deftly executed, it draws us in irresistibly and never lets go; those afraid of classic literature because they think it boring, pretentious, or portentous should know this is a striking exception. It is the kind of tale that does not come off well in summary, as the blank faces staring at me when I gave a college presentation on it prove. Though short for a Victorian novel at about three hundred pages, the complex multi-generational plot is told via flashbacks, nested narration, etc. Suffice is to say that the action is intensely dramatic and highly emotional; it is drenched in pathos and runs us through a gamut of other emotions. It reaches a fever pitch quite soon and hardy lets up - a story of true immediacy and intensity. With its time jumping and non-linearity, the complicated delivery creates significant suspense, and we become supremely interested.The key to the book's success, though, is surely its characters. Many are vividly and memorably drawn with stunning realism and often with great sympathy; we truly feel with and for them. Catherine, the initial female lead, is one of Victorian literature's more striking heroines; an essentially unconventional woman stuck in a time and place where convention reigned unchecked, she has great passions that find no vent. She loves Heathcliff but cannot bring herself to defy society enough to marry him. Her character thus subtly critiques Victorian society, showing how oppressive mores were detrimental to many, especially women, crushing their spirit and denying them happiness.Heathcliff himself is of course the most famous character and the one most attractive to many. As a heterosexual man, I have never been able to see his appeal; he seems overwhelmingly selfish and cruel with almost no redeeming qualities. However, I have seen women discuss him as if he were not only real but the Sexiest Man Alive - even ones who have never read Wuthering! He seems to be among many women's favorite characters ever and, I suspect, is a large part of the reason the book topped the poll. What makes him so attractive is a very interesting question; I assume it is a combination of his profound passion - along with its consequent romantic and sexual potential - plus his bad boy status. He is in some ways the prototypical bad boy, living by his own code and not caring what others think - bravely and boldly original. One may well wonder how or why women excuse his sadistic qualities, but he certainly stands well above the drab gentlemen populating most Victorian fiction. They are stuck in a time warp, but he is distinctly alive, as much a part of our day - nay, any day - as his own. Even putting subjective attraction aside, though, he is undeniably fascinating, if far from traditionally likable. This is in one sense because, like Shakespeare's Richard III, he is upfront about his villainy - nay, positively revels in it. He does not try to hide his nature, and there is something perversely admirable in how he carefully meditates and follows his plans. More fundamentally, he is more sinned against than sinning; his detestable qualities surely stem in great part from his brutal upbringing. This not only makes him a sort of sympathetic figure - and certainly one of pathos - but also raises very currently relevant questions about parents and guardians' responsibility for their children's actions later in life. The topic received almost no mainstream, much less legal, attention until the last few decades, showing just how far ahead of her time Bronte was here as in many other ways.Of course no one can discuss the book without mentioning the love story, which in its way is one of the most monumentally engrossing. However, that it was ranked first truly surprises because it has nothing like a happy ending and is indeed a thwarted love tale; Catherine and Heathcliff do not even get as much time together as Romeo and Juliet. The depth of their passion despite this is surely a large part of the attraction, but it may very well be that the lack of consummation - not just in the physical sense - is precisely what moves so many. Love is perhaps the most universal feeling, but the rarity of its being requited - much less reaching full mutual fruition - is truly tragic. The sad truth is that, whatever happy love stories' escapist value, far more people can relate to unhappy ones. Wuthering's is bitterly familiar to the countless people who have loved only from afar, displaying the wretched phenomenon's broken feelings and often fatal consequences with stirring verisimilitude and extreme emotional vitality. The many who have been in similar situations will feel a great personal connection, but even those who have not will have great sympathy for this unfortunately common dark side of human experience.Some of the novel's social criticism clearly comes into play here, and it is to society's credit that things have changed to the point where very few would disdain a Catherine/Heathcliff union. Yet some of the love's story's other fundamental elements remain just as relevant - are indeed as old as humanity and will surely last as long as we do. It shows the dramatically high pitch that passion and other emotions can reach even - or perhaps particularly - when they have no release. Many works show love's greatness, but Wuthering is remarkable for showing its dark side; the heart has terrible truths hiding just beneath ostensible calm that can storm out at any time - often with dire results. The novel does not flinch from displaying how our most primitive emotions can easily have savage effects; if love brings out the best in humanity, it can at least as easily bring out the worst. Perhaps no classic love story is less sentimental or otherwise traditional; this made it stand out distinctly amid many superficially similar Victorian tales, but it would be unusual in any era. Critics did not like to see the unadorned display of mental and physical cruelty, but less prudish later eras have seen its terrible truth. Bronte seemed to have a profound understanding of elemental feelings and stark knowledge of the beastly facts about men and women in love, which seems near-preternatural considering her sheltered life. It is almost enough to make one believe her muse was truly inspired in the external sense so often described by artists but so hard for others to even conceive. No one can read this without a sense of the incalculable loss to literature when such a genius was cut off so early; that she did not live to write more novels is truly regrettable. However she did it, she clearly drew inspiration from a well at human nature's very heart, which is why the book continues to strike such deep chords so powerfully.The younger generation's love story is of course far more traditionally placid. It is nearly as compelling in its way and introduces important poetic justice and irony issues but takes a definite backseat. Those not as responsive to - or who repress - stormy passions may find it more relatable, but it serves primarily as a useful contrast for most readers. If nothing else, it proves Wuthering is more nuanced and subtle than one might think given its melodramatic reputation.All this implies a strong realist perspective, which the book certainly has, but it also belongs to the gothic school so common in the nineteenth century with all its associated supernatural overtones. Requisite ghost aside, we get among other such elements an immense storm that is not only a pathetic fallacy but seems to have some kind of paranormal, perhaps divinely-controlled, significance. The vivid North England moor setting contributes substantially to all this; the novel imbues the strongly, if unconventionally, picturesque setting with a near-magical air, describing it with great believability and stunning originality. Wuthering is one of the main reasons that the area has long had great, near-occult sway in the popular imagination. As all this suggests, the book also has more than a dash of Romanticism. Like most great works, it is hard to classify, the mix of genres and styles forming a magic all its own.A final noteworthy aspect is the deceptively simple prose. Despite the relative conciseness and lack of the florid description that turns so many off to Victorian fiction, Bronte manages to describe her setting at least as clearly and memorably as authors with far thicker works. The landscapes and manors are drawn with stark beauty; no one who reads Wuthering will soon forget them. The narrative, especially in the direct first-person segments, impresses with a spare yet lush style. Bronte knows exactly what words are needed to make her points not only clear but memorable - and, in the case of the immaculately worded and brilliantly portrayed last paragraph, simply unforgettable. Hard as the book is to summarize, it is easy to read in the best sense; those who have had trouble getting into other classic works may be at ease, as this is one of the few books as great as it is accessible - which removes the final excuse for the small number who have not already read and loved it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a well-red audiobook- the pacing is good, the enunciation is clear and the reader varies the vocal color enough to make individuals identifiable during dialogues. My only quibble is that a few characters (most notably Joseph) are rendered in dialect so authentic as to be hard to understand."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book mainly because it was talked about a lot in Eclipse. I was shocked by how dark and Gothic it was. I can't imagine what people must have thought when it was published. If I could pick two words to describe Wuthering Heights it would be \\"passionate\\" and \\"bizarre.\\" I've never read anything like it. I knew as I was reading it that I wasn't supposed to like Cathy. She has a passionate temper that was very unlikeable and yet I couldn't hate her. In fact, I related to her in a lot of strange ways. I kind of agree with Edward Cullen's assessment of the book that it's not a love story but a hate story. The ending was what made me like this book. A lot of the characters are run madly by their passions and I thought for sure the ending would be nothing but a disaster. I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. If Eclipse has made you curious as to what happens in this book, give it a try. You might actually like it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Re-reading this novel after 20 years I am still struck by its primal power, as if it erupted from the depths of Emily Bronte's soul and devoured its creator in its wake. This is the anti-Jane Austen novel. It is even the anti-Charlotte Bronte novel. Charlotte flirts with the darkness while Emily jumps into its chasm. The bond between Cathy and Heathcliff is forged in Earth, Heaven and Hell and cannot be sundered by all the efforts of humans or their institutions.Although never stated in the novel, the implication that Heathcliff is a bastard son of Mr. Earnshaw and, therefore, Cathy's half-brother has been hinted at more explicitly in at least one film adaptation of the novel. Even if such a thought entered Emily Bronte's mind, she was straining the limits of decorum and literary taste even without another scandalous level of meaning. She wisely omitted such a possibility. The Heathcliff/Cathy bond is so powerful that it frightens even the family that first witnesses it. Heathcliff's obsession is akin to Ahab's for Moby-Dick, created just four years or so later. Love/Hate are merged into one emotion that transcends boundaries of Good and Evil and this force runs roughshod and heedlessly destroys all the victims that happen to stand in its way.Like her doomed heroine Cathy, Emily Bronte died at a very early age, within one year of the novel's publication. One wonders what kind of follow-up novel she might have written had she lived. Would she have reigned in the primal inspiration and tailored her creations to suit the prevailing customs of her society? It is futile to speculate. The early death of the creator is perfectly matched to the dooms of the creator's characters and the one-of-a-kind quality of this wild novel.Although the novel bears a sophistication and complexity of narrative structure, especially for a first time novelist, there are certain weaknesses. The dialect dialogue of Joseph is a hindrance and absurdly out of place alongside that of other characters who speak without so many apostrophes. Later schools of realism might cast aspersion on the florid language of relatively uneducated characters. The power shines through the weaknesses, however, and this is a unique novel. There are echoes of it in later novels but few, if any, other contemporary novels exhibited such boldness of subject and structure."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights may be my all-time favorite novel. Heathcliff and Cathy's relationship resists - or defies? - categorization. It's as elemental and everlasting as the moors themselves. Love isn't a sweet confection in this book and is the all the more appealing for that reason."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Love is very painful and it is full of lust, want, and the things that made you go standing up in the morning when your mother introduced you to your future husband. It is very French, and it said, everything under the bright burning sun causes more money than you can shake a stick at. And it creates even more chaos than you wish for, still, no fond memory there. All said and done was a walk together in the grave undisturbed. Just once. It made an example of all those who loved must suffer a loss of conscience, and all that sweets and whatever the people who works must be driving all the tenants of Wuthering Heights into a crack wooden planck of a ship that is full of water 3 inches deep. When they do decide to take a chance on life, and fall for love, it does not catch them, but leads them into the most unromantic ideals of commitment ever. To be in faith with their long lost friend full from the beginning, end, and with no lacking in the middle. How was it possible, but that these people have no contacts with the outside world of travels to the continents, and little words such on this and this day, does not suffice. It is said lover takes in the shape of all form and shape, but it takes generations to heal a broken promise and mend the wounds. [Please, to have breath for a day, and to let escaped chances slip buy once again means that whatever your parents have gone through was not as romantic as you would imagined it. That seems to be the central message, beside peering through the soul.]"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This should be the \\"Book of the Year\\" for every year from 1847 to today - 154 years worth!

The love of Catherine and Heathcliff transcends all concepts of earthly love and their deep soulful connection is rather more of a curse than a blessing for them.People either love this book or hate it, but don't pass judgement until you read it on your own.

He took his bitterness and used it to make everyone else suffer in the cruelest of ways. More like a twisted obsession than a love story! All that being said, it was actually was a very good book, and I would recommend it... just beware!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I throughly enjoyed this work of Emily Bronte's (which I believe to be her only novel).

The only thing that I did not like is that I felt that having finsihed the book, I was never quite able to find a character whose motives I thought I truly understood--but perhaps this ambiguity is what adds an element of psychological intrigue to the plot."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I throughly enjoyed this work of Emily Bronte's (which I believe to be her only novel).

This is an incredible book! The thing that fascinates me is the realness of the characters. I have never read a book with characters as complex as Heathcliff and Catherine. The emotions contained in this novel are so real. Bronte created a masterpiece with Wuthering Heights!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a novel full of love,hate and revenge. This is a story about Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff and the strange love that they share. Their love changes in many ways, taking many different forms, from anger, to happiness, to violence. Their love changes because of people who come in and out of both of their lives, making them different. Through the book though, Catherine and Heathcliff find ways to share their love. Wuthering Heights was an interesting book that I found getting stuck in, and I never wanted to stop reading. Bronte twisted the plot a lot so I found that you had to pay close attention. It kept me reading it"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. There were lots of twists to it, and I felt there was always something happening. There wasn't a bunch of unnesscessary descriptions. I really like Emily's style of writing. It isn't the victorian style, and it is basically an easy read. I don't like reading a lot of the 19th century books like Pride and Prejudice because the woman are all proper, but this story could have just as well been written today. Some of the characters horrified me, but unlike a lot people I did find a few characters that I could accept. I say give this book a chance."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have to admit in high school when I was forced to read it I waddled through it and basically endured it. Years later now I've re-read it and I couldn't put it down. I'm glad that I picked it up again. It was a completley spellbinding novel. I don't think anyone in the story was likeable except young Catherine Linton, but it was definitely a fascinating story and worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I think Breadsticks and Blessing Places written by Candy Dawson Boyd is the best book ever written.

Or more acuratly I see something in a different light. This is a book about pure emotions, passions, and the cosequenses of feeling so strongly. It's a book where anybody can relate to at least one characters at least one time in there lives. Who wouldn't want to be loved the way Catherine was loved. Or how Heathcliff could have been. This novel is filled with &quot;what-might-have-beens&quot;. However it ends wonderfully, and the reader is satisfied. It will bring out the passionate romantic in you."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm forever indebted to my mother for convincing me to buy this book. I thought,&quot;Another boring 'classic'.&quot; Boy,was I wrong! Although it's long and sometimes confusing,I soon couldn't put it down. It's deep,delving into human emotions. Many of the characters have love-hate relationships with each other,and I felt the same way about them. Heathcliff and Catherine were evil,but who can't identify with their romantic feelings? The book showed how deadly obsession can be and how far-reaching its consequences are. It's one of the greatest books of all time. If you want to read something that changes the way you think and expands your horizons,get &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Good book...

Yet not all will be destroyed, two will weather the storm of Heathclife's wrath and come out together in a love destined to succeed"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm just gonna come out and admit it: I HATE Wuthering Heights. I hated the story and mostly I really hated the characters. I wanted every one of them to die and wished they had done so sooner. And, honestly, I don't think it's very good writing.The main characters, Heathcliff and Catherine, are impossible to like. Heathcliff is cruel and vindictive, and Cathy is petty and weak. They are both so selfish that it's hard to believe that they're even capable of loving, and it's impossible to want them to be happy. This takes the angst, tension, and hope out of reading their story, and there's nothing to replace those key aspects of reading a novel like this but disgust. Most of the secondary characters are equally unlikeable or at least unsympathetic, so there's no one a reader can identify with in the real story. It's hard to believe that so many people's lives could be ruined so dramatically and irrevocably, which makes the book seem pathetically melodramatic and more than a bit ridiculous. It's unrealistic but not at all fantasy, it's tragedy with no one to feel sorry for and romance with no one to love, it's gossip that no one wants to hear. Furthermore, while reading this I was disturbed and surprised to find grammatical errors!I expected to love this book, and really wanted to, because Emily Bronte's fantasy world from her youthful writing really appeals to me and I wanted her to become a favorite author of mine. But this is just awful."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The Bronte sisters were extremely remarkable women. They have left a literary place in history. Charlotte Bronte was the most popular one; she wrote Jane Eyre, one of the most popular fiction novels in history. But there is definitely room for Emily Bronte. Wuthering Heights, Emily's only novel is -- without a doubt -- the work of a genius. The tragic love story of Catherine and Heathcliff is one of the most memorable ones I have ever read. Also, I love the backdrop of the story. The story took place on the untamed Yorkshire moors in England. It symbolizes their wild love -- or more specifically, Heathcliff's wild ways. I love a story with symbolism. It saddens me to know that this is the only novel of Emily Bronte. She would have written other books if she hadn't died the way she did. I am consoled with the fact that she has left us this incredible book, a book that will be treasured forever."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This edition is the first i have ever read, im sure there are better ones out there. However i enjoyed this book thoroughly. It was a little hard to understand the text as im not used to way things were written back then, but overall it was a very good read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I stumbled upon a song called Wuthering Heights a month or so ago. It's an eerie, etheral composition speaking through the voice of Cathy to Heathcliff. The first time I listened to the song I thought the singer, Kate Bush, was speaking a bizarre and foreign language. I cannot say I enjoyed the song initially, but I admired how the singer had crafted such a haunting, vivid, and singular melody. You should listen to it--I must warn you that you may dislike it.I read the novel, Wuthering Heights, years ago in middle school and have forgotten most of the story. The song piqued my interest in the novel, and I began reading it yesterday. It has been described as, perhaps, one of the most original novels in the English language. Its wild and untamed story, written on the windswept canvas of the moors of northern England, is written in an excited and lyrical manner. Heathcliff and Cathy are so vivid in the imagination of the author they they violently spring to life in the conciousness of the reader--at least that has been my experience. I wonder if I will ever experince such overwhelming passion, though I guess it's well that I haven't, as it borders on the psychotic. Even the fundamental boundaries of one's own being are broken down in the cyclonic relationship of Heathcliff and Cathy.It has been a long while since I read any fiction, and I am truly enjoying this fine example."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a haunting story of love and hate, where human emotions and passions are presented through a range of excellently developed characters. The story is taut, the narrative is engrossing, and the novel has all the drama to make excellent movies. The novel is an underrated study of human psychology, of love, of jealously, contempt, revenge and of character and how it transforms through time and relationships. People call it the greatest novel of unrequited love; it definitely potrays love, hatred and melancholy in the same vein. Perhaps Heathcliff, who loves and hates with all the harshness of his character, leaves a lasting impact on reader's fancy, to make a memory of this novel as one about only hatred and unrequited love. Read it to discover the passions that makes this Bronte novel a classic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The movie American Beauty reminds me of this book. Both pull off the near impossible task of presenting the reader (or viewer) with horrible nasty people and then at the last moment making us see them as simply angry human beings fully capable of redemption and understanding, even if its too late to do anything with their lives.The book starts out with one of foppiest of English fops touring the Manor with a utter contempt for these people and their ways. The stories that he hears from the servants only confirm his view, but they are intriguing. No one tells what they want to tell and there are times when you want to strangle the servants telling the stories (especially the one that PURPOSELY hid a note that would have eased some of the tensions because she didn't feel that it would be right. How many interfering old bitties like this are in the world? Probably more in the Victorian era.)The love between Heathcliff and Catherine might have worked out in different circumstances, if Heathcliff had not been the hated adopted gypsy child, if Catherine's brother hadn't been an idiot drunk, if Catherine hadn't been pledged to marry the idiot next door. Of course, then it wouldn't have been such an intriguing novel. Heathcliff comes back the conquering hero to find that Catherine is married and her idiot brother is still a drunk and he can't have her so he plays dangerous games with people's hearts and gears everything to his twisted revenge. Included in his schemes are the marrying of Catherine's sister-in-law and the corrupting of Catherine's nephew (the son of the drunken idiot).It's pretty rough going and you want to like Heathcliff at least more than the rest of the people in this book, but he gives you no room to excuse his actions. He's just horrible. Then like Kevin Spacey at the end of American Beauty, he reveals himself and comes to a point of self-reflection and repentence that fulfils the hope you had for him at the beginning of the book. It's very rare that this happens and its believable, but in this case it's very believable."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte was well ahead of her time in writing this incredible love story. The plot was very complex, yet the intricacies of revolving a story within a story within another story never created an error. The author wrote on some very specific issues of the day and one would need to formally investigate the book in order to find any mistakes. This is a story by Mr. Lockwood who really comes in at the end of the story. He meets his new landlord Heathcliff and is able to discern some very strange happenings at Wuthering Heights. His servant, Nellie Dean, narrates most of the story as she lived it. She and Joseph are the only people to live through the three generations and the only one able to recount first hand knowledge. This is a love story, ghost story, and story of oppression all in one. Emily Bronte was able to describe the ill-effects of English property law in the 19th Century. Primogeniture--the law of inheritance, where only the eldest male child could inherit family estates without a contrary will, often could result in the younger siblings being turned into mere servants. This is how Hindley came to own Wuthering Heights and why he was able to ruin Heathcliff. There is much effort from various forces to keep Heathcliff and Catherine seperate. There is also much symbolism regarding various images such as locks that represent keeping people prisoner, or of dogs that demonstrate the character of their owners. Much forshadowing is accomplished with great sophistication. This was written from a &quot;Realist&quot; perspective and yet there are elements of &quot;Post Modernism&quot; included as in the case of ghosts and supernatural happenigs. One might question whether or not Emily Bronte Believed in the Supernatural and considered it as real and natural, which would then relate it back to Realism. There are many twists and turns and the symmetry is flawless. We have two seperate parents who are neighbors. Each have an elder boy and a younger girl. Heathcliff is a foundling who is regarded as a &quot;gypsy&quot; (possibly a slave child or illegitimate child of Mr. Earnshaw), The son of the Lintons (Edgar),marries the daughter of the Earnshaws (Catherine), and they have a girl named Catherine. Hindley, the son of the Earnshaws marries outside of the family and produces a son, Hareton. This helps to keep the incest down a bit. Heathcliff who was raised in the Earnshaw home marries the daughter of the Lintons (Isabella) and they have a child Linton Heathcliff. This child ends up marrying the younger Catherine and when Linton dies, Catherine marries Hareton. So in effect she has married two first cousins. The characters grow up in a very oppressive atmosphere. The servants are actually treated better than the children who are often whipped or starved. This is &quot;Gothic&quot; like in the dark, dreariness that seems to envelope the families and the frequent use of punishment. Even the environment is unfriendly often times. The moors are dangerous and the weather is often rainy or cold and snowy. It is a sad story with the only hope coming in the end when Hareton and Catherine marry and reclaim rightful ownership of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, which had been taken from them by Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am repelled by the absurd peregrinations of Bronte's spiteful, petty-spirited, self-absorbed characters. The character of Heathcliff is that of a nightmarish beast, and Catherine isn't much better. And yet Emily Bronte wants us to LIKE these people. I read this book at the same time as OTHELLO, and to be honest I found my self liking even Iago better than these shallow fools -- at least Iago probably deserved to be a lieutenant! If this is a classic, then so's the phone book. It's ludicrous, witless, and excessively overwritten to boot. At one point, the reader of WUTHERING HEIGHTS will realize that there have been five (or so) mawkish death scenes, some fights and scuffles, and countless effusions of absurd and overblown emotion. And yet one is less than halfway through the book, and Bronte's still wuthering along as if the reader were yet awake. Again, I must compare it to OTHELLO, and find that in all respects it comes up short -- Othello even has better Moors. It's not a classic -- it's a really old British romance novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte sure knows how to write about destructive love! I thought both Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff the stupidest people ever! I could hardly understand Joseph's tongue...perhaps because my language is too polished:)Ok, maybe I'm being too harsh. Wuthering Heights really isn't that bad. I actually understood it (for a thirteen year old, you've gotta give me credit)It was written nicely as Ellen {Nellie} Dean for the orator of Heathcliff's complete past. Catherine is pretty stupid though. And Heathcliff stupider for not trying to convince her to marry him BEFORE she married Linton. But I felt pretty sorry for Heathcliff when he called for Catherine the night that Lockwood spent the night. My favorite character was Hareton because i loved his speech! It was funny when almost every time he spoke, he sweared. I have to say that I hated Linton for being such a weakling, even though he could hardly help it. Despite Heathcliff's trickery with Isabel and hatred for Cathy, I couldn't help liking him a teeny bit, because he's just so unique! I really wanted Hareton and Cathy to make the match, and i positively despised Heathcliff and Linton for making him look so stupid. And i just loved Hareton's &quot;thundercloud&quot; face! Go ahead and read Wuthering Heights. You'll probably both hate and love it. It was a rather exciting and tiresome novel. Then again, I may be to young to criticize this &quot;great classic&quot; novel :)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is tale of deceit an forbidden passion.

The reader finds him/herself loathing each and every one of them. The only non-loathsome character is the doctor, and he's minor to the extreme. Heathcliff is of course abominable. Edgar Linton is appallingly stupid. Hareton Earnshaw is animalistic, but at least he's got the excuse of Heathcliff's abuse. Catherine Linton (the elder) is absolutely disgusting, easily and by far the most evil character in the novel, surpassing even Heathcliff. Even Nelly Dean is a waste of humanity. If it were not for her constantly making a hash of her meddling, none of the tragedy would have occurred to such a great extent. Whether her meddling is malicious or just through sheer stupidity is immaterial; she remains an awful character.That said, the story is absolutely riveting. Emily Bronte's one substantive work is truly a masterpiece. Her descriptions of the moors are wonderfully evocative, but it is her characters who are her main triumph. Despite the sheer horridness or stupidity or weakness of her characters, she nevertheless makes each of them - and their motivations - utterly believable. Even Heathcliff's excesses are believable, and the elder Catherine's petty maliciousness is also totally in tune with the selfish nature she is depicted as having. The younger Catherine Linton's stupidity is easily accounted for by her protected childhood and Nelly's inexcusable lapses. Everyone has a perfectly plausible reason for doing what they do, given the natures given them by Bronte. Is it then their fault that their actions create such misery?The only flaw with this book is the ending. One character has triumped utterly, and then inexplicably collapses with hardly a struggle. Another character overcomes a strong antipathy to a further character and changes attitudes utterly. Unlike the rest of the novel, the motivation is not believable. It is inconceivable that such a complete adjustment could have happened in so short a time. Perhaps it is true that the novel has come full circle, but I can't help but think that its grip on the reader would be still the stronger if it left us with the vision of the horror which appeared to be the future for its well-deserving characters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is a classic!

That is Heathcliff's main goal in WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Despite his love for beloved Cathy, Heathcliff wants a desperate revenge upon her family. After all, it was her family who supposedly ruined his life.Personally, this was a book much closer to real life than would be preferred. The main goal of a book is to transport you into another time, place, or dimension--a life beyond your own. However, this classic by Emily Bronte manages to bring to mind one's own everyday troubles. The writing is technically superb, but the story could be better. However, after more than a century of being a noted classic, the opinion isn't likely to change."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am another one of the huge group of students who had to read this book for a Literature class, but unlike many, I loved it!

Moreover, through the character of down-to-Earth, jolly Nelly Dean, Bronte makes plausible a story that would never be believed otherwise.It's a pity she had to waste her talent as a writer on a such a pointless story, centered on an incoherent, cruel, mean character like Heathcliff.

Now, as a senior, I have re-read it several times over. It has become a part of my permanent literary collection and a part of me.

And although that proves to be true, it's far more complicated than that. Filled with hate, revenge, and anger, you can expect to find very little happiness in this book. As for the characters, I found it impossible to like any of them except for Hareton. You have characters who are so self centered and filled with rage, that in their time of weakness you can't even pity them for they're that despicable. But don't get me wrong, each character has their moments that make you want to forget all their flaws, but those moments are limited.Emily Bronte created a book about love and hate, and what they can do to people. Driven with love and hate, people do crazy things and this books goes to show you that. And although this book had it's slow parts, I still found it to possess a well thought out story. And as for the ending..well that part I enjoyed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Brot's \\"Wutheting Heights\\" is a two sided coin. The whole narrative is contructed over doubles and juxtapositions -- with elements arranged into pairs. From the basic conflict of love against hate, the writer brings up the most and lest noble feelings and actions -- always making pairs and putting one against the other.To begin with, the narrative is divided into two distinct poles, each representing a different generation. Structurally speaking, the first part -- the one that includes Catherine, Heathcliff, Isabella, Edgard -- is stronger and more important, while the second segment works as a sort of anticlimax dealing with the love of the second generation --young Catherine, Linton, Hareton. Another double point is that there are two Catharines, being the second one the daughter of the former. They both have many resemblances, physically and psychologically. But the young Catharine is an amalgam of her mother's and father's personality.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a generational drama. Two generations have to face the same problems that they parents had. But at the same time, Bront deals with the gap of one generation to another. The same dramas do not have the same conclusion. Time has passed, minds and behavior have changed. In this fashion, the book tackles life as a process that is in constant change.Places are also battling against each other. The main stage for the action is the Wuthering Heights, while the other part of the narrative happens in the Thurshcross Grange. The first, as the name gives away, exploits the wildness, the extremity, the unstoppable love. On the other hand, the Grange represents the social status and the aristocracy. At the same time, they represent Catharine inability to choose between Heathcliff (WU) and Edgard (TG).Despite not being a success when first published in 1847, Brot's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" became a cult with time. Nowadays it is considered one of the most important novels ever written. Not a bad change for a book that received much critics when published and the writer had to use a masculine pen name in order to be considered serious.As Gothic novels go, not only structurally is \\"Wuthering Heights\\" a very brave effort, but also thematically this book defied its genre. Following the gothic tradition of the late XVIII Century, the books has elements like supernatural aspects, moonless nights, valorization of the grotesque. But, despite these strong points, what remains more popular in the book is its characters and their love story, Catherine and Heathcliff.The narrative is told by many different narrators from various sources, like letters, diaries entries etc, therefore there isn't an unbiased narrator. Nelly tells most of the story to Mr. Lockwood. She watched most of events she describes, however she remains as an unreliable narrator, once she injects her own view of the facts and characters. That is why it is so important to read between the lines in this book.Thinking of more contemporary concepts, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is like yin and yang, dealing with two basic principles of the universe: love and hate -- both inhabiting the same people. Since the novel deals with the human nature, Bront's single novel is timeless and appeals to most readers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I first read WUTHERING HEIGHTS as an assignment in 10th grade English class and was struck by how emotionally twisted the characters were. I also wondered if I was reading the book the right way, because I found a lot of the story very funny.So I decided to pick it up again recently and realized what a timeless, brilliant book WUTHERING HEIGHTS really is. It's as emotional and labyrinthine as any soap opera -- but so much more worthwhile. These are some of the most strongly-drawn characters in literature, and they will pull you right into the story with their caprices, turnabouts, fripperies, and cruelty.First-time readers may find the beginning a bit slow, but please don't be discouraged by that. A really wild, romantic -- and, yes, after all these years, still pretty hilarious -- story awaits you. This is a book that can move you to tears and make you laugh out loud.First-time readers may also have trouble keeping track of the two Catherines and who's married to/in love with whom. Even while rereading it, I had to remind myself who was who, who's the child of whom, who's the mortal enemy of whom -- but it is absolutely worth it. So many people go on about how romantic this book is, and it certainly is, but let's not overlook the sheer drama and insanity of this book.This book is more about obsession than pure romantic love. There, I've said it. This book will make you glad that your life is not like this. But any time you need a shot of histrionic behavior and violent obsession, Heathcliff and Cathy are waiting for you at WUTHERING HEIGHTS."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"...when you have nobody to love you...lonely like the devil and envious like him...nobody will cry for you when you die!I don't consider &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be a love story or simply a book about love, hate, and revenge, as it is often wrongfully described by many. I dare not say this is a social work either, but it is somehow concerned with broad issues such as social and familial oppression, the subordination and the disadvantaged nature of female lives at that time, the brutality of the patriarchal power, the unjustices of the inheritance law, etc. The most striking thing about this book is that it is concerned with extremities like love and hate, human and animal, life and death, masters and servants, earthly and divine.Of course the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff is maybe one of the main things of, at least, the first part of this work: they're like almost two waterdrops, both showing a fondness for freedom and nature. But their relationship (I don't know why I hesitate to call it love) is kind of dysfunctional, for lack of a better word. Maybe it's because of the lack of a mother for both of them, maybe because of their upbringing in an atmosphere of patriarchal brutality.And maybe it's not a pure coincidence that Heathcliff's origins are obscure: when he first appears at Wuthering Heights he is dirty, ragged, starving and houseless, ill-treated by the patriarchal and he is refused education. As a critic simply put it, Wuthering Heights can hardly be described as a social novel, but it deals with many social themes, as Heathcliff might be seen as a representative of, maybe not the dispossessed, but at least of the oppressed; on the other hand Edgar reads a great deal, but his reading seems more a means of escape from the emotional turmoil which surrounds him rather than a pleasure per se. Besides, towards the end of the story, Cathy begins to educate Hareton, which later leads them to falling in love, as preposterous as this might seem earlier in the book: their previous enmity and hatred has been forsaken in favour of union through learning. Interestingly, as this is happening, Heathcliff, formally the force for energy (not a positive one), now acknowledges the draining of this energy and the lost of his faculty of enjoying their destruction and his being too idle to destroy for nothing (I have to remind myself to breathe-almost to remind my heart to beat: conscience has turned my heart to an earthly hell).If the first part of this work depicts a fierce and passionate but also binary view of the Yorkshire moors society, the second part of it is about reconciliation, education, development and, thus, progress. At the end of the book the powers are much more balanced, the relationship between sexes more egalitarian, as E. Bront seems to emphasize the need of the society to develop and move forward with necessary cohesion.Or at least this is the way I see this novel, much more a social work rather than simply a book about love, hate and revenge, and that's what makes it, in my opinion, one of the best of its time. But hey, every reader may see and interprete it his or her own way: I guess this too is the beauty of literature, as that of music and art in general."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to read this in my senior year of high school and found that I could NOT put it down. I would linger after class to talk to my teacher about it, and finally she told me I could keep the school's copy for my own use. She could tell how much I loved it! I practically have tears in my eyes when I reread the first few sentences. This is the saddest, and yet the most hopeful book I have ever read. It's so beautiful, and Bronte has taken cares to describe the human condition of loneliness she doubtlessly felt during her own lifetime. These are some of the most realistic characters in all of literature, and YOU WILL NOT REGRET PICKING UP THIS BOOK!!! I can't even fully describe how much I love this book. Honestly, it changed me. The story is unforgettable, and exquisitely profound. I urge you to open your heart and let this book move you too."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Before reading WH, I knew its reputation as a dark novel but was taken aback a bit by the grinding dreariness and cruelty of the story. Noone who has read Jane Eyre will confuse Emily with Charlotte. I had also heard it described as a tragedy but, while it certainly has its tragic elements, it lacks the defining element of a truly gripping tragic story--sympathetic characters. In short, WH seems to defy easy classification and I suppose that's an important part of its allure.While I found the first three chapters, which establish the odd and mysterious inhabitants of Wuthering Heights, to be a bit slow in gathering momentum, the remainder of the book heightened my interest as the narrative of past events unfolded. I disagree with some reviewers who found the prose to be overdone and difficult to read; I enjoyed the narrative style and diction and found myself immersed within the wild moors setting. The story itself is compelling and, if one can stifle the desire for a hero in shining armor to alleviate the persistent suffering found within the pages, the flawed characters are fascinating.Putting aside some very minor problems such as the plausibility of the detailed recollections of Nelly Dean which constituted the bulk of the narrative, my primary issue with the book is the ending. In particular, I found the Cathy/Hareton union to be a bit difficult to believe and, more importantly, the potential suspense and suprise around the death of Heathcliff to be an opportunity lost by the revelation of his passing before its description within the narrative flow.Taken as a whole, WH is a very enjoyable read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I know that I will be tarred and feathered for denouncing the &quot;20th Century's favorite 19th Century novel&quot; but I have my reasons why as you shall see. Most of the novel rests entirely on Bronte's ability as a weaver of words, and not on her creation of characters. Bronte tried to imitate the passion of Lord Byron's characters and succeeded only marginally. Out of all the characters in Wuthering Heights only Heathcliff is strongly developed in the sense that although we may despise him at certain times, we always feel a sense of empathy, even compassion at times. For the character of Catherine Earnshaw/Linton one feels only contempt, with a thin veil of sorrow. It is the same feeling one has for Miss Havisham in Dickens Great Expectations. Catherine senior is a deceitful, destructive force who almost succeeds in passing on her vices and moral depravity onto her daughter. Unlike Dickens Great Expectations however, we see no reason in her madness, which is one of the failings of Bronte's novel. To most readers she is just a spoiled little rich girl who wants to have her cake and eat it too. This is never expounded on in any great length and Bronte, while not explicitly saying it, seems to condone it as a perfectly good reason to go to Edgar and not Heathcliff. It is at that point in the story that we have nothing but total contempt for Catherine senior and nothing else. But there are many morally bankrupt characters that populate great literature and they do not take away from the story, Dickens Miss Havisham and Estella, come up once again. The difference between Catherine senior and these characters is that Bronte's character is shown as a weak, whining woman with no clear direction either in her life or in the plot of the story. She is in short the airhead of the story. It is a very negative portrayal of women and I'm surprised that Bronte devoted so much time to this character. Her daughter Catherine junior is a much stronger character in every way, but here again is another downfall of the book. The characters of Catherine junior and Hareton Earnshaw are cast out of the spotlight in favor of concentrating on Catherine seniors whining. These characters, along with those like Nelly Dean and Lockwood have far less substance than they should. Bronte should have devoted more time to Catherine and Hareton than she did. Overall, I think that Heathcliff saved the story from bombing terribly, and Bronte's prose also contributes to the beauty of the book, but she was no Lord Byron. Bronte simply did not understand plot and character well enough to make this the novel it could have been, which is a terrible shame. Although some people indict this book as just being a 19th Century soap opera, its fault rests not in the plot being too unrealistic and trite, it rests on the fault that the reader only gets to know a few characters really well, and of those characters only Heathcliff is given the attention he deserves."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Charlotte Bronte is a great writer. I read Jane Eyre twice and comprehended every word, every nuance. Wuthering Heights was another matter. So much of it was obtuse. Just a little while ago, I read a very helpful review here by an English teacher no less, who said he had trouble comprehending the story the first time around, but he has read it again and this time it was a completely different and positive experience for him. I certainly have benefited from this particular review because now I am going to read Wuthering Heights again with a different attitude. It is not easy reading; it is a deep book. You have to concentrate, but I know I can do it, and I am going to do it! Even though I saw the movie before I read the book (I thought the movie starring Merle Oberon and Lawrence Olivier was outstanding), parts of the book were still obtuse. If I hadn't seen the movie, I suppose the book would have been a total imposssibility. I don't mean to seem so negative about Wuthering Heights, but I have never in my life read a book where I had to concentrate so much; it took the pleasure out of reading it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Enjoying a great novel sometimes requires a willingness to accept confusion, at least initially. Many readers who have trouble appreciating &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; are put off by the work's first 50 pages. The novel begins with a focus on a fastidious hypochnodriac who is not actually the main character and who never even has a first name: Mr. Lockwood, a tidy little man who enjoys observing love from a distance but is terrified by its proximity. He has no idea what's in store for him. Urged by his doctor to rest his over-wrought nerves, Mr. Lockwood rents a beautful manor in the apparently idyllic Yorkshire moors of northeast England, a decision he will soon both deeply regret and enjoy. In the novel's opening pages, Bronte successfully integrates Mr. Lockwood's mistaken conclusions with the reader's: 1)Mr. Heathcliff must be a gentleman [He isn't]; (2)The young lady by the hearth must be Heathcliff's wife or perhaps that of the coarse young man who also lives there [She's neither; she's actually a widow, and the coarse young man should be the house's master]; and (3)Catherine Earnshaw is a spectral demon with the power to return to earth in order to continue terrorizing those whom she once loved [Maybe she is; maybe it's only a dream], and so on. All of these errors in judgment are completely understandable, and during the course of the novel they are all satisfactorily explained. But initially, the situation Mr. Lockwood, as well as the reader, encounters is very, very confusing. Mr. Lockwood gets nearly everything wrong, and to a reader accustomed to lucid foreshadowing, Lockwood's mistakes are perplexing. What IS going on in this strange, strange house? Confusing the reader, however, is actually part of Bronte's strategy to transport Lockwood, and the reader as well, to a world of pure imagination, a realm of stormy passion where all thoughts are expressed in poetic speech (regardless of the damage they may cause), a world where one character is another character as well (&quot;Nelly, I am Heathcliff&quot;)--in short, a world that would be utterly abhorrent to the reader's rational faculties but proves irresistibly attractive to his emotional and aesthetic dimensions. So the novel's first few pages deliberately disorient the reader, encouraging him to abandon an everyday world where the apparent equals the reality, where most sane people restrain themselves, spending most of their days and nights in balanced, rational pursuits. Bronte's novel, restricted geographically to the Heights and the Grange, is a buttonhole in reality, through which the reader slips without fully realizing it from a more or less rational environment into a world where ghosts are not entirely unexpected, lovers dig up the corpse of their beloved, drunken louts drop their babies from stair landings, middle-aged men repeatedly curse--even brutally batter--younger women, and lovers punish each other to prove the depth of their love. &quot;Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore!&quot; Bronte's world would disintegrate if it were evaluated by generally accepted rational, moral precepts. Bronte instinctively realizes this fact and, within a matrix of purposeful confusion, seductively transports the reader from an everyday world of clearly articulated right and wrong where love is primarily a dalliance into one where love consumes entirely, lasts well beyond mere physical death, and is not the least bit concerned with traditional concepts of right or wrong, appropriate or inappropriate, acceptable or unacceptable. With meticulous attention to specific details and complex time frames, Bronte ultimately explains away all of Mr. Lockwood's and the reader's initial misunderstandings. If the reader--allowing for some intentional confusion in the novel's opening pages--continues reading, he will be rewarded by Bronte's ability to transport him into an utterly fascinating but repulsive, familiar but impossible world that is the essence of imaginative literature. Bronte's novel--populated by comic and tragic characters, set in beautiful but deadly landscapes, focused on restrained civility juxtaposed with passionate intensity--undoubtedly deserves its rank among the world's greatest romances and imaginative literary creations."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte is not as well-known as her sister Charlotte who wrote Jane Eyre, that, it must be said, far surpasses Wuthering Heights. I'd like to think that every book has a good, universal element we can relate to. And they do. Wuthering Heights is a story of revenge, passion and metaphysical love. It is a Gothic novel set appropriately in the bleakness of the Moors in England. Emily Bronte brings out a gorgeous narrative. It is confusing because it has the points of views quickly shifting from one personage to another. Nelly tells it for the most part. But the love story is incredible. Heathcliff and Catherine, as selfish and cold characters that they are, share a love that binds them even when they are apart in life and in death. It can be romantic. But the reason they teach this in school is because of the scholarly attention it receives, being a Bronte product. I think Jane Eyre may be of higher calibre but Wuthering Heights has its brilliant moments. It is a classic. I say it has many colors because we can be disgusted by the course actions of Heatchliff as he orchestrates his revenge on the people around him. We can also dislike the snobbish personality of Catherine and her choosing money over true love. But we can also sympathize for the lovers as human beings. This is a drama that can take place anywhere on earth. It is human drama. Bronte is as much in the same line as other universal writers including Dante and Shakespeare. Yes, Emily should be proud of her masterpiece. At times boring but worth reading on your own. I highly recommend this great work. Try to see beyond the boring parts and into the love and universalities !"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I just finished reading this book like ten minutes ago. This was one of the strangest novels I have ever encountered. At times I dislike it, at other times I was compeletely captivated by it, and now that I'm through with it, I am utterly haunted. There are more detailed reviews on this site about Wuthering Heights but I'll go into what I liked and didn't like and you'll forgive me if the story description that I give isn't 100 percent up to par with everything that happens because frankly alot of stuff occurred and it would be impossible to fit it all here. Catherine and Heathcliff are two people destined to be together as they have been inseperable since they were children and Heathcliff was adopted by her father Mr. Earnshaw. But as they grow older, people try to keep the two apart. The neighbors, the Lintons, have a son named Edgar who Catherine becomes friends with also and this will bring trouble in the future. Also, Catherine's brother Hindley hates Heathcliff because his father doted on him. This will bring more trouble. And finally, once they are fully grown, Heathcliff overhears a part of something Catherine says about how it would be degrading to marry him. Intensely hurt, he leaves for years and years before he can hear her proclaim how much she loves him with a passionate love if ever there were one. She marries the Linton boy Edgar and Heathcliff returns. A tragedy occurs and he uses every fiber of his being trying to get even. To say more would be major spoilers I think, so I'll leave it at that. Now to the good and bad. The narrative is told by both Catherine's nanny and by this other guy who came to rent a room from Heathcliff and sometimes I had trouble telling who was speaking. Also, I felt that it could've been cut shorter in some places with the dialogue, but these are minor problems really. So what's good about this novel? CATHERINE AND HEATHCLIFF. These two deserve to be together and you can feel that whenever they are in one another's presence. I have never read a novel that made me feel so strongly for two characters. Many times I became physically ANGRY that things were happening to drive them apart. Never has this happened. I found myself silently seething about some of this stuff. You really have to read it to fully understand what I'm talking about but so much happens against Heathcliff and the entire world is stacked against him and then Catherine goes and marries Linton. I felt betrayed by that, by a CHARACTER IN A NOVEL. Then later on when there is no longer any hope for the couple to be together at all, I felt such anguish for Heathcliff. It was a real anguish that he was being denied, even as he did despicable deeds to exact revenge. And I'm a guy, not some 16 year old girl. Another thing that was great was how Emily Bronte crafted her characters. Each and every one of them at some time or another does something shameful or mean or just plain evil. But I always understood their motivation and could not hate them for what they did. I felt compassion for some of them as if they were actual flesh and blood. Lord have mercy, why couldn't they just be together? There is something about this book. It is filled with such anguish, such unrequitted love, that it lingers and stays with you. It is the saddest book I have ever read and it will stay with me for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The book is mainly narrated by Mr. Lockwood and Ellen Dean.Mr. Lockwood is renting Thrushcross Grange near Wuthering Heights. A man named Heathcliff is his mysterious and rude landlord. Lockwood asks the housekeeper, Ellen Dean, to tell him the story of Wuthering Heights and its inhabitants.She goes on to tell him the story of Heathcliff and Catherine and Wuthering Heights. The first part of her story is of how Heathcliff came to live at the Heights, the seond half of the story is about how Heathcliff takes his revenge as an adult.It's the depth of love that I really like in the book, that timeless love that Heathcliff and Catherine possess. The woman is dead for God's sake, and Heathcliff continues to love her and she haunts the Heights unwilling to leave her soulmate behind. That's what I call true, enduring love. Catherine and Heathcliff's love affair affects everyone they come in contact with. There's no escaping it.Bront creates these imperfect and passionate characters, some of whom are borderline evil. I love the drama within the story, the setting of the dark and stormy Yorkshire moors sets the mood just right. This is a story about love, revenge, family and grief. It's a classic gothic love story that is not soon forgotten. Thank you Emily Bront for creating one of my favorite anti-heroes in literature, Heathcliff."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"But it's not a love story... I really wish people wouldn't call it a love story. Its a story about thwarted passion and what happens when almost obsessive love is taken to extremes.I started to read on Monday and I have now finished it.. I loved every page but I am completely at a loss as to why Heathcliff is so adored. He isn't a romantic figure especially not in the latter half of the book and Cathy is so selfish and spoilt that they can't be together.Brilliant examination of passion gone wrong but not a romantic novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This classic of English literature has certainly stood the test of time. From the commencement of the novel with moody images to its likewise saturnine conclusion, Bronte's work with tone and characterization sets the bar high for authors of all kinds. The raging zealousness of love that so possess Heathcliff and Catherine melts off the pages in molten waves - truly, has a romance so deluded and inherently doomed ever been described so well? The passions of Romeo and Juliet seem lame in comparison. But never have protagonists been so unlikable. It is hard to sympathize with either one of them, which is the major disappointment of the novel. It is with relief, then, that the romance between young Catherine and Hareton is established. Innocent and true without the sadness that is a trademark of Heathcliff's obsession, the reader begins to glimpse the true meaning of love. The book is intensely readable and page-turning, accessible and unique. The bulk of Wuthering Heights is a psychological exploration of what the past does to a person - it does not so much examine a passionate affair than it does the consequences of actions undertaken by the abused and misguided. Surely Bronte's masterpiece of the human soul will linger as long as Heathcliff's intensity for his lost idol."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The outdated writing style takes a little getting used to, but once you do, it's good. It's incredible to me how the author, with her unusually limited experience of the outside world, who probably never had a boyfriend or lover in her life and lived a secluded life in a remote part of Yorkshire with her sisters and died a virgin, could have created such an incredibly realistic and well-drawn character like Heathcliffe. I love the fact that he's flawed and I love the chemistry between him and Jenny. It's just amazing to me that so much passion could lurk in the heart of such an isolated and inexperienced soul as Emily Bronte. I don't suppose she and Charlotte got any real romance or sex as governesses. Emily's poems are full of originality and vision, but it is her novel that's a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Told in alternating flashbacks from the perspectives of two narrators, Wuthering Heights is the gothic love story of Catherine and Heathcliff. Their doomed love has tragic repercussions for them and both of their families.I absolutely loved this when I first read it as a teenager. It's like a creepy soap opera."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Of course, I'm not referring to one of the best novels (I don't say \\"best-loved\\" novels, because it's not a lovable reading, but an all-important, soul-searching and unforgettable one). As the noted critic A. C. Swinburne said in 1883: \\"It may be true that not many will ever take it to their hearts: it is certain that those who do like it will like nothing very much better in the whole world of poetry or prose\\".So it has been for more than a century. Nobody should miss this strangest and strongest of English novels, so hauntingly beautiful and intensely poetical in its dark and eerie otherness. By the way, don't miss Emily Bront's poems, or a good selection of them.The issue now, is this PARTICULAR paperback edition (Wordsworth Classics, 2000). What do we get and what not, how does it compare to the other editions in the marketplace.To begim with, it's ONE OF THE THINNEST EDITIONS EVER, light on your pocket and cheap as airborne luggage (6/8 inch vs., say, one full inch for Penguin Classics edition). The mass-market paperback, is as bad as you fear, and then some... for its paper quality and binding. A bit surprisingly, printing quality is good enough. The Introduction (18 pp) by John S. Whitley is not bad, perhaps one bit askew for the intended readership (I don't feel myself at ease with those Freudian interpretations). The Bibliography is good and so is the annotation at the end of the book, three pages in small type that aren't user-friendly, specially in the handling of the dialect tirades.So, it looks like a good edition, were it not for the outrageous material production; but then, Penguin's and Oxford's aren't so much better as paper quality and binding go, although their type is easier on the eyes and the printing quality a little better. And, mind, when I speak of bad quality paper, it's a matter of Penguin browned pages in only five years, and Oxford's little better behaving of slightlier browned pages in ten years. Wordsworth Classics pages haven't got brown so far but they sure will do (when you make paper out of whole timber logs, it always happens).The worst thing, by far, is the text itself. It's a careful and accurate 1850-type text, that follows that of the by then very distinguished Haworth Edition (1900), the same text used by Barnes&Noble; Classics noteworthy hardcover edition. Of course, there are texts far worse than that, namely Modern Library, Chatham River andTime-Warner ones, not to mention Gutenberg Project's most corrupted electronic text.As you probably know, the 1850 text was edited, or more precisely, in all good will tampered-with, by Charlotte Bront (who didn't like her sister's novel at all). The changes in the text from the 1847 edition were pervasive, and detrimental: there were some hundred of small stylistical or grammatical \\"improvements\\", now as useless as then; a toned-down, sweetened version of York dialect paragraphs that looks decidedly funny and almost as hard to understand; the punctuation was brought in line with Victorian practice (which isn't ours, anyway): professional, light and discrete, syntactical in concept, instead of Emily's rather inconsistent usage, rethorical in concept, as 18th century's prose and specially poetry had been. Even WORSE was the urgent need to save printing space at all costs, which resulted in the disparition of more than 600 paragraph beginnings (I mean just the paragraphing, not the paragraph contents!). Overall, it makes for a worse and distorted reading experience. Many of us (I don't know HOW many) think 1850 is a no-go textform, and would like to see it no more in the intricate textual history of this work.TO SUMMARIZE: I recommend strongly NOT to buy this edition, in spite of its real merits. And then what?If durability is not a must and budget is tight, go for either Penguin's Classics (Pauline Nestor) or Oxford's World Classics (Patsy Stoneman).If durability is a must, and budget is not so tight, then go for one of the best context-oriented, \\"study\\" editions: Broadview Press (Beth Newman),Longman Cultural (Alison Booth) or Norton Critical (Fourth Edition) (Dunn).If what you are after is a nice hardcover edition, the options are greatly reduced:you may try Barnes&Noble;, with the selfsame ignoble text as Wordsworth Edition, or go for a good copy of the 1978 Franklin Mint edition, the one with the Alan Reingold lithographs, with a very good 1847 text and no Introduction or annotation other than Charlotte Bront Preface (NOT to be read BEFORE the novel) and full and right glosses as footnotes for the dialectal tirades (the first edition to do so, as far as I know)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This purely wonderful novel is indisputably a classic, with many wonderfully unique and complex characters that are, at the same time, very hard and very easy to relate to.

That is how people had described it to me. I honestly don't understand what is so classic about this book. It was too dark and I couldn't enjoy it.I hated Heathcliff and Catherine. He was spiteful, miserable, and menacing. Of course this wasn't his fault. He had a tough upbringing and Catherine made it worse, by choosing to marry someone for convenience knowing that Heathcliff loved her and she loved him. Catherine was whiny, selfish, and spoiled. She was such a witch,I really hated her. I hated her more than Heathcliff. She married Edgar and had a happy marriage until Heathcliff re-appeared. It was all downhill after that.After a three year hiatus, Heathcliff decided to come back for Catherine. He made everybody lives miserable. I didn't understand this romance that existed between Heathcliff and Catherine. It just seemed like an obsession. I didn't understand the connection and what they saw in eachother.The only part of the book that I enjoyed was the romance that blossomed between Catherine's daughter, Cathy and her nephew, Hareton.I wouldn't recommend or read this book again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In \\"Wuthering Heights\\", Bronte subtlely presents to her Victorian audiences a condemning social commentary, and asks them to consider that the struggle between the good and the bad is not black and white. While Heathcliff seems the obvious steward of evil and badness in the novel, after careful introspection, the reader discovers that immorality and badness seep into the hearts of many other characters. Though perhaps not as insidious at the outset, most of the major characters experience a moral deficiency and by the completion of the novel, have acted in a way that makes the distinction between themselves and the clearly wicked Heathcliff more nebulous than before. Bronte startles the reader into the realization that regardless of conformity to Victorian social mores, each person nurtures a seed of immorality within themselves. Though there may be people who are excessive in their depravity, Bronte skillfully reminds us that an image of evil exists within everyone."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a classic novel from Charlotte Bronte and this unabridged audio recording is highly recommended to people who read the book and loved it and are interested in hearing the book being read.

If listening to this on a walkman style tape player you need the adapter and you need to read the instructions before using it and if you are listening on a stereo or car tape deck with balance control knob then you need to follow the instructions on how to listen to it that way. If you follow the instructions you will find that the audio recording is good and sounds normal and not at all like the Chipmunks. While reading reviews for an audio recording of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre I noticed she made the same speed reading comments and I felt that I should point out that she might have listened to the audio recordings either without the head phone adapter on her portable tape player or without adjusting volume control on her stereo."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I can appreciete the unique style of Bronte's prose and the fact that this book has relevant themes that may strike a chord with today''s readers. But I remember being let down by this book and the finishing with a sense of apathy towards the characters. Many people relate the theme and character interaciton in this book to the modern day soap opera, daytime talkshows or MTV reality shows and thus deaming the book to have some sort of everlasting social message. The problem is that for the most part all those things stink and always have so what are these comparisons saying about this book. Maybe there is a reason why everyone read's this in high school....becuase it is the only age that can appreciate it.Clearly Im not in the norm as most people disagree with me but if you are looking to get into a \\"classic\\" there are much better books you can turn to."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am absolutly stunned. Why do I like this book so much? How did I manage to finish it? I am a 21 year old man living in a modern city and I somehow related to this book. I have nothing in common with the characters or the author or the story or the setting. I had to read this book for college but dropped out before reading it. Several months later I picked it up and gave it a try. I'm not sorry I did. Thinking about it now I start to realize what is so good about the book: it's author's compassion for humanity. All characters in this novel suffer a great deal (partly because of their own stubbornness) but retain their essential humanity: they still need to be loved. And while reading it you can feel the author's longing to be loved herself. So this is what made me read through the book: it speaks directly to your heart in a way you can not ignore."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm very partial to the novel itself, but this treatment of it in the Norton Critical Editions leaves much to be desired.1. One big advantage of the Norton Critical Editions is that they have footnotes. This one, however, is extremely sparing of its footnotes, only giving one every fifty pages or so -- and that's usually to clarify a Biblical allusion. You're supposed to know a lot of other things, such as that \\"bairn\\" is Scottish dialect for \\"small child.\\" Terms like that pass by unremarked on, so don't think this version is going to help clarify all those dialect words you've been wondering about.2. The font is small and uncomfortable to read.3. The essays in the back, the other reason to buy a Norton Critical Edition, are somewhat absurd. Part of the mystery of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is that its author seemed to have zilch for sources: the whole composition seems to have sprung whole from her fertile mind. So what do they do? Print her juvenalia poems, her sisters' writings, etc. Not much that will actually help you achieve a deeper understanding of the text.The only advantage I can cite of this edition is that the footnotes (praise Heaven!) translate the ramblings of that screwball Joseph into plain, readable English.Boy, do they ever need to come out with one of these for \\"Wuthering Heights\\":The Annotated Pride and Prejudice"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is an amazingly dark and twisted romance novel containing the most repulsive characters you'll ever meet in all of Bronte fiction. . . . And I absolutely LOVE it! The Bronte sisters seem to have had real talent when it came to dark fiction romance and are quickly becoming my romodels in the genre.The story is about love -- but above everything else, it is about revenge. Heathcliff's revenge to be precise. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start at the beginning, shall we?::SPOILERS::::LOCKWOOD:: Lockwood is, well . . . a bit of an idiot. He's the sort of idiot who's exceedingly cheerful and can not strain past his own nose to see that his company is unwanted. He is new in the neighborhood and has moved into Thrushcross Grange, an estate not far down the road from Wuthering Heights. His landlord is the master of Wuthering Heights, a sour, grumpy, very cross man named Heathcliff.Lockwood presses his company upon his grumpy landlord and is introduced to a number of startlingly unpleasant people. When a snowstorm settles in on the Heights, Lockwood is forced to remain among his grumpy hosts, whose sour dispositions are so frightening the tension in the air could be cut with a knife. Lockwood can not understand why everyone is so cross, snappish,and rude, and attempts to make several weak jokes at supper that fall into a miserable silence on his part.When everyone present refuses disdainfully to accompany him home, Lockwood wanders home himself and comes down with a bad headcold. At Thrushcross Grange, he enquires after his landlord and his sour company. His maid, a woman named Ellen Dean, is more than happy to tell Lockwood the unpleasant tell of love, revenge, and death. This is how the narration of the storyof Wuthering Heights really begins.::HEATHCLIFF:: I absolutely love Heathcliff. He is the dark villian but also the sad hero of our tale. No one knows precisely where Heathcliff came from. He was found by Mr. Earnshaw, the man who owned Wuthering Heights and happened to have two children already of his own. Mr. Earnshaw took the dark \\"gyspy\\" orphan Heathcliff home to Wuthering Heights and favored him so much that his son, Hindley Earnshaw, was roused often to violent jealousy and set out to make Heathcliff's life a living hell.Mr. Earnshaw's daughter on the other hand, a wild pretty girl named Catherine, found in Heathcliff the playmate and soulmate she didn't know she'd been waiting for. The children ran wild together on the moors and were as close as if they'd grown together in the womb. Both had short tempers and wild dispositions and were nasty, unpleasant people to cross.Heathcliff was very in love with Catherine, and she with him. But when the two of them grew up, Catherine decided that she could not marry Heathcliff: his station was too low. Therefore, the stuck-up girl reasoned that the best thing for her to do was to marry Edgar Linton (the young man who happened to own Thrushcross Grange just down the road) and by this young man'sriches so help Heathcliff rise on the social ladder.Heathcliff was so stung by this rejection that he disappeared into a storm one night and did not return for many years, at which time he exacted his revenge against Catherine and her overbaring elder brother, Hindley.Yet not only does Heathcliff later in life mistreat his decieved wife (he throws a knife at her face, I believe), but he also treats his son, Linton Heathcliff, with open scorn and distaste. For Linton has none of his father's looks, but his uncle Edgar's instead, and is very sickly and poor.Meanwhile, Heathcliff is so tortured by Catherine's departure that he thinks he sees her everywhere. He even returns to her grave and attempts to dig her body up with the intention ofholding her close again but decides that he will defy everyone and be buried beside her. Thus, the rest of his life is spent exacting his revenge on those who harmed him and their children.::EDGAR LINTON:: Tall, blonde, effeminate Edgar is as weakminded a fellow as can have been invented. He knows full and well that Catherine Earnshaw is in love with Heathcliff, that she brags about how wonderful Heathcliff is, that she stood outside in the storm all night when Heathcliff disappeared and called his name -- but Edgar Linton wants her anyway. It's like he's dying to be used and abused. And moments after Catherine has flown into an appalling rage and even proceeded to beat him violently about the head with her fists --Edgar asks her to marry him and she accepts. Oi.::CATHERINE EARNSHAW/LINTON:: There's only one way to explain the tantrums and absurd pleas for attention -- Catherine Earnshaw is an obnoxious brat. She drove her father to drink as a child and frequently commanded her way with tantrums that followed her straight on to womanhood.When Heathcliff returned from his travels to visit her, she bragged tactlessly of her love for him to her husband and even proceeded to go on long walks with Heathcliff alone. When Edgar finally got the guts to banish Heathcliff from Thrushcross Grange, Catherine flew into a rage and deliberately made herself ill. But her true love for Heathcliff was confirmed at last when the lovers held each other prior to her death and wept miserably cheek against cheek. Such a tender love scene I've never known until I read Wuthering Heights. I don't think even Jane Eyre compares.Catherine was angry that Heathcliff had married her brother's sister (Isabella Linton) just to get her back for marrying Edgar, and Heathcliff was angry that Catherine chose Edgar over himself. But they forgave each other just before Catherine died and Heathcliff was ever after half a man without her.::ISABELLA LINTON:: This girl is as much a fool as her absurd and abuse-loving elder brother. She falls headover heels in love with Heathcliff without the slightest encouragement on the latter's part and \\"provokes\\" her future husband with fond looks and sighs. Heathcliff, seeing opportunity for sweet revenge, leaps on it and has soon run off with Isabella and married her with the intention of horrifying Edgar (whom he, needlessly to say, hates with a passion) and his lover Catherine.Like most fools, Isabella Linton gets exactly what she deserves. She is treated very poorly by her husband, who curses at her and calls her by unkind names, and laughs with scorn in her face as he watches her realize he is not the \\"gallant\\" and \\"noble\\" creature she had imagined. Isabella soon learns that handsome men are not always kind and finally stands up for herself. Her sharp tongue is rewarded with a knife in the face, and she flees Wuthering Heights, the unhappy home of many by now.::HINDLEY EARNSHAW:: Hindley, of course, lives to see adulthood and even marries. His wife, however, dies giving birth to their son, Hareton. Hindley falls into a miserable state and begins to drink heavily -- so heavily that on one occasion he nearly kills his son by accidentally dropping him from an upstairs banister. He is still a dismal drunkard when Heathcliff returns to Wuthering Heights intent on revenge. With Heathcliff returned, Hindley (like most of the people kin to him) loses his mind and paces every night with the intention of shooting Heathcliff dead in his sleep. For Heathcliff has taken advantage of Hindley's drunkeness and has won over the whole of Wuthering Heights in several card games.The doctor of revenge has checked in!I've never been so astonished, so happy, so moved by any story than by Wuthering Heights -- and I've read some good books!This is an awesome novel full of romance and despair, and I recogmend it to anyone who could sit through my bantering and actually read my review! Enter the dark recesses of Heathcliff's mind and see what it's like to be the devil!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have read this book at least three times. It seems to get better every time I read it. I read it for the first time in 8th grade. The novel is about a dark romance. I love the way Cathy's and Heathcliff's relationship is portrayed. They have a love that can never be because of Cathy's stubborn pride. There is a lot of suffering for all of the characters, but the book does end on a happy note. I highly recommend that everyone read this book at some point in their life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a classic only in the sense that it was written in the 19th century. But it is a compelling story w/ dark, violent passions, and emotions of love and hate. Heathcliff's only goal in life is to seek revenge on anyone associated w/ the Earnshaws and Lintons. His love for Catherine is evident, but his hate is chillingly cruel and violent that touches everyone between the two estates. Only when he is w/ Catherine is he pacified. Catherine is torn between her true love Heathcliff, and her duties to marry someone of her station in life. But she doesn't understand her love and emotions for Heathcliff. (Which makes me believe she's too childish, spoiled, and bratty to handle her emotions rationally or she's a manic depressive). It's a dark passionate story that is compelling to read. Unfortunately it's also hard to follow in the third person narrators. The long winded descriptions makes the book drag (which explains the 300 pages). And what in heaven's name is Joseph saying? Are most uneducated people of countryside England so hard to understand? This book isn't for the light reader. If you want something easier and more light hearted, go for Charlotte Br&ouml;nte's &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; Or books by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bront happens to be one of the three famous Bront sisters and also the middle of them. She had led a dark life without parents but managed to get by with her siblings and each made it to literature fame in different paths. With \\"Wuthering Heights\\", Emily Bront had created a shocking romance that's been unimaginable and has been read for around 165 years.In 1760, we are taken to the title farm and meet a poor gypsy boy from the streets and is taken by a farmer named Earnshaw of the place and then makes him a part of his family and renaming him Heathcliff and while trying to be use to his new life. While his new family is uncomfortable with a poor boy in the family and mostly with his stepbrother Hindley he begins a relationship with the farmer's daughter, Catherine which goes off good. Some years later, Earnshaw and his wife are dead and Hindley is now married and plans to take over the authority of the family while Heathcliff and Catherine's relationship continues to grow. But as they grow into their adult years, more troubles fall into their lives and their romance is left in a tragic bind and will leave both of them in darkness.It's no Hamlet, Jane Eyre or even Romeo and Juliet. It's a novel completely in it's own creativity. The story takes many twists and turns that you'll probably find yourself lost in. The characters are very vivid and lifelike and the plot is so surprising and will shock anyone. It's a shame Anne Bront only wrote one novel, since we would've able to see what other novels she would create. But \\"Wuthering Heights\\" will always be a novel that will show a truly tragic tale of romance."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was not an enjoyable book for me to read. It was depressing, dark and hard to follow. Yet the mood it creates is full of depth and is told in a mesmerizing way. This is a book that everyone feels they must read and it was really hard for me to finish, but finish it I did. If I could I would have given this book 3.5/5 stars for the excellent use of language and talent for create a setting."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It took me a few days to get over my initial distaste for the main characters, and this book in general, before writing a review. This book was not well received in its time and I understand why. Victorian England was not interested in perusing books with such irascible characters, as it didn't fall within their idea of how ladies and gentlemen of the period should behave. Heathcliff and Cathy are two people who are as twisted and tempestuous as the moors in which they live.Heathcliff is brought to live in Cathy Earnshaw's family as a small child by her father. He is greatly disliked by Earnshaw's son, Hindley, because he regards Heathcliff as an upsurper, and does all he can to torment the newcomer. Cathy takes Heathcliff on as her playmate and from that moment on the two are inseparable, running as wild and unchecked as the windy moors surrounding them. Heathcliff grows to love Cathy fiercely as he becomes a young man, but Cathy begins to take an interest in the quiet, refined way of life at Thrushcross Grange, the home of their wealthier, more respectable neighbors.Upon returning from an extended stay at Thrushcross Grange, Cathy is transformed from the wild, ill-mannered and incorrigible girl, to a seemingly calm and civilized young lady. She has caught the eye of her neighbor's young son Edgar and has designs to marry him. Cathy confides this to her servant, Nelly, who asks her if she does not care then for Heathcliff. Cathy expresses disdain for Heathcliff and remarks that she could never marry him. Unbeknownst to her, Heathcliff has heard this conversation and quits the house. Cathy continues to elaborate upon her feelings and reveals that though she finds Heathcliff coarse and unrefined, she loves him deeply to the extent of proclaiming herself to be Heathcliff. She cannot see herself ever separating from him because loving him is like loving herself--both are as one person. Nelly is exasperated with her talk and tells her that Heathcliff has overheard their conversation. Cathy panicks and stays up all night waiting for him to come home. He never returns and does not come back to Wuthering Heights for another 3 years.By then Cathy has married Edgar, but pines for Heathcliff. She is immensely happy with Edgar until Heathcliff comes back bent on revenge. He takes that revenge by running away with Edgar's younger sister. Despite the fact that both have hurt each other deeply, Heathcliff and Cathy continue to love one another with a dangerous, wild and destructive passion. That passion consumes and destroys everything around them and when Cathy finally succumbs to her end, Heathcliff continues his embittered path of hatred and destruction, revenging himself on his wife, his brother-in-law and their descendants.This was such a hard book to read because I internalized all the horrible feelings Cathy and Heathcliff exuded. I didn't like Heathcliff, I resented his love for Cathy. How is it that he can hate in such reckless abandon with the same heart that he uses to love Cathy and then treat her daughter with such contempt? How dare he profess to love when he hates and despises so cruelly. He has no compassion and, by God, I would have shot him if I was Cathy Linton.Emily Bronte wrote a book that breaks convention and draws comparisons between men and women, society, religion and class. It is superior to Charlotte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" and Anne's \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" which though well written, are products of convention."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I should probably like this book more than i did, but every page felt like a labor. Later, a professor told me that it was spoof/commentary on Jane Austen, and that made me like it more. Because who wouldn't like to see the nicely fitted, happy-endings of the Austen chick-flick genre of romance turned upon the issues and emotions of the real world, and with real world effect?Unfortunately, there are far more Heathcliffs out there than there are Mr. Darcys, and the sooner they are confronted, the more likely the Heathcliffs will be called to task.Thanks for the read, Ms. Bronte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily BronteThis book is dark, despairing, passionate, and breathtaking from first page to last. This is a true classic. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel is far from what I expected.I had listened to many of my friends judge Cathy and Heathcliff very harshly, and I went into the book expecting to explore the evilness of human nature. Instead, I found that Bronte broke barriers by producing two very real characters.Cathy and Heathcliff's story explores the consequences to the character's decisions. Bronte does not gloss over the reasons for the decisions (money, greed, breeding, retaliation, etc), but those reasons play a minimal role. Instead, she chooses to show how a human reacts to a good/bad decision, and when life doesn't go his or her way.My suggestion for reading Wuthering Heights is to place yourself in Cathy and Heathcliff's shoes and figure out if there was another choice for their behavior."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"(Like the curmudgeonly CAT in the COMIC...get it?)Great old-style classic novel. One of Henry Miller's favorites; that's what attracted me to it.I liked the style of the narrative, largely told through the reminiscences of the housekeeper Nelly. This is one dysfunctional family!Like many novels from this period it's all about the interpersonal relationships; there isn't anything external happening to anyone here of any particular consequence. But the masterful storytelling and imaginings of the authoress really do make this a worthwhile and rewarding literary journey.Read it! Classics rule!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have very mixed feelings about this book. While it's a beautiful book, and I will probably read it again, I could not stand the story! All of the characters are horrible people, in my opinion, and the only thing that kept me from throwing the book across the room was the last two chapters. If I had not had to read this for class, I would not have finished it at all - though I am certainly glad I did finish it.If you're looking to read the Classics, definitely do read this. Same goes for if you're looking to read a classic romance, or one of the Gothic classics. However, if you're looking for a \\"good\\" book, one that will leave you happy or going \\"aww,\\" you're at the wrong book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Okay, everyone has heard of this book so I probably don't need to give a review, but I will anyways.=) Some have seen the movie adaptations of this book as well so some already know the storyline and what this book is about.I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't stop reading until I reached the very end. I had seen both the 1939 and 1992 movie adaptations of this book so I already knew what happened, but the movies don't capture the essence and emotion of the story as well as the book can.Heathcliff is the gothic romance hero with traits that I think many romance writers use in their own heroes: brooding, mysterious, darkly handsome, and harsh (though of course, not so tortured and brutal). Cathy is gay-hearted and a wild beauty, but also selfish and manipulative in her behavior and actions. Both characters are so realistic in their human emotions and failings that you can't help but empathize with them and hope for that happily-ever-after you know will not occur (as the story is told in flashback so you already know their love was doomed). They are two people that are meant for the other, and each hold flaws and are not always the most likeable of characters.I found myself going through the \\"what-ifs\\" scenarios: What if Cathy hadn't spurned Heathcliff for the more wealthy and civilized Edgar? What if Heathcliff hadn't left to make his fortune to win Cathy? What if Heathcliff hadn't decided to seek vengenance and revenge on those who prevented their union?What made this book so tragic to me was the fact Cathy knew instinctly what she was doing (by accepting and marrying Edgar for position and wealth) was so wrong! She was going against herself by rejecting the fact that they were indeed soulmates and meant for each other. One half of a whole:\\"In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!\\"\\"I love him; and not that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire\\"\\"My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath--a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind--not as a pleasure, but as my own being\\"Despite her confessions of the heart, she goes through with her folly and dooms herself and Heathcliff and all those they encounter, and this passes on to the next generation. Her actions causes obssession and borderline madness in Heathcliff that continues long after Cathy dies. Even though he becomes so cruel and unlikeable in the second half of the book, I couldn't really hate him, knowing what he went through in the first half of the book. Although what he went through doesn't excuse his behavior and actions, you still understand the reasons behind them. You can hear the pain and anguish in his soul when he asks Cathy why she did what she did:\\"Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy?\\"\\"Because misery, and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, you, of your own will, did it. I have not broken your heart--you have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine.All in all, this book is dark, despairing, emotionally wrenching and passionate. Be warned, this book will make you cry."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a true classic. No movie has ever done it justice. The parallel structure within the characters' genealogical table is phenomenal.Highly Recommended.James Conroyd Martin, Author of PUSH NOT THE RIVER and AGAINST A CRIMSON SKY Push Not the River"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This compelling story of hate has enthralled readers for generations with good reason. From the classic scene of Lookwood encountering Catherine Linton's ghost, I was hooked. Though the plot is not always fast-moving, it is strong and compelling. It is fun for readers to draw parallels between the two generations outlined in this novel. The atmosphere of the novel is one of mystery, set up early in the first few chapters. Though most of the characters are despicable in some way, hearing about their lives through Nelly's eyes is irresistible. The novel is littered with violence, and the \\"moral\\" of the story is unclear to the reader, as it possibly was to the author herself, yet it does make a few important points. Love is not everything, for example, is stressed from the moment that Catherine Earnshaw becomes a Linton. With vivid imagery and extremely psychological characters, Emily Bronte created a classic truly deserving of the title."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this novel when I was a junior in high school, and I really did not enjoy it. I was an avid Jane Austen fan and usually read the sweet, courtship novels. Now, as a college graduate, I decided to re-read this classic to see if I might enjoy it more now that I am older. I must say that I was really taken by the spectacular writing, and the poignant view of human nature at its worst. Although Heathcliff and Cathy's romance is disfunctional at times, the extreme hold that they have on one another (even after death) is compelling. I really enjoyed this book, and I recommend it to all of you who have a dusty copy sitting on your bookshelf. If you haven't read this novel since high school, my advice is to read it again, and see if it has some new meaning for you."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wow! my opinion really changed from the beginning of the book to the end. In all honesty, at first, it was boring, then it got better, and at the end I was a little confused.

Try it out, you just might like it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A good example of pseudo-Shakespearean tragedy written about the time of Jane Austen. Lacks the crackling wit and sparkling satire of Miss Austen's works, and focuses on a love between Heathcliff and Cathy (neither of whom can the reader relate to, for they are larger than life and their peculiarities are never explained)which is, of course, doomed. Lockwood is the only character whom we can possibly hope to understand, for he tells the reader about himself (he is the narrator, except when Mrs. Dean is telling the story to him) during the course of the story. Maybe it's just me, but I found it depressing. Now, I can cry over a realistic novel like Sounder or Bridge to Terabithia, but these dudes and dudettes (forgive the modern Yank term, I do that sometimes (&lt;:) are acting really stupidly for no apparant reason. Now, I understand that time period, and I understand love. But you must agree that there was no earthly reason for H. to marry Isabella. ?Ah, well.

This book has taken me on a tremendous journey - once which saddened me when over. The forbidden love between Heathcliff and Catherine was, to me heartbreaking, and wonderful at the same time.

If you have, read it again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For those in high school out there, this book is NOT BAD and NOT BORING.

All of those people who claim it to be bad either are completely ignorant or uneducated (this is verified by their spelling and grammar in their reviews). If you have a choice to read this book or something else, read Wuthering Heights, because it will honestly change your outlook on so many things.

I could not put the book down as Heathcliff returns to carry out his revenge, and destroys the lives of basically everyone.

Thought it would be fun to read some without any assignments. Chose this one because i remembered it to be a love story and i had enjoyed Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Amazon almost always send an email asking customers to review books they have recently purchased. When I recieved one such email asking me to review Wuthering Heights my first thought was that I would not dare to even try to say anything about such a classic book. But I have just finished reading it again after many years and I had forgotten how wonderful and musical it is. The words flow on the pages like music to your ears. The characters are so engaging, even those you love to hate, and the settings are so real. I feel like I have spent the last few days in an eighteenth century manor house, in the kitchen, near the fire, listening to an amazing story being told by a humble house keeper. I think that sometimes today we forget how inspired beautiful prose, can really make us feel, for hours at a time I forgot all my modern day worries and my hectic work load and just enjoyed a truly wonderful reading experience. Do yourself a favour and reread this book, and if you have never read it then do so you wont be sorry."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I didn't care for this book, I found it quite boring, although I had wanted to read it for years and never had the opportunity, it just wasn't my kind of book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a beautiful tale of love and hate. It's a powerful novel, full of emotion and thought. It is a true insight to the human mind and soul. The story begins with Mr. Lockwood, a tenant for Heathcliff to live in Thrushcross Grange. Mr. Lockwood sees Heathcliff and goes home, only to ask one of the servants, Nelly, about Heathcliff's past. The story then is told from her narrative until she decides to end the story to allow Mr. Lockwood to sleep. The story continues in this manner, with Mr. Lockwood going back to Wuthering Heights to see Heathcliff, getting stuck there, etc, etc."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte brings forward the true masterpiece of her era in this novel. While many consider this novel to be one of hate, it is really the story of a love that cannot die, even in the grave.Catherine's slight of Heathcliff is one of the great moments in all of literature. He then goes about making himself worthy of her love. In so doing, he makes many enemies, but anything worth achieving is going to come at some cost. He hates Edgar Linton; he avenges himself through him. His entire purpose in the novel is to prove that he is indeed the true soul-mate of Catherine. All the destruction of earthly morals and customs is indeed okay if only he can be with Catherine for eternity.The ending of the novel also comes to bear. Showing young Catherine, who has the best traits of both her parents being married to Hareton Earnshaw. The story ends in light rather than the bleak atmosphere at the beginning. This point is in keeping with the importance of setting in the Gothic novel.The narration is well handled. For all the people who ascribe nefarious motives to Nelly, I say pshaw! She tells the story from the only point of view possible to a maid in her situation. Lockwood handles the beginning and the end with verve. What makes Emily Bronte so good is that she actually changes the characters in the narration. Nelly is not confused with Lockwood at any point in the story.I highly recommend this novel. I think it is the Masterpiece of English fiction of its era. I think you will like its many layers and its timelessness."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a novel you will not be able to put down once you started reading. It's very engaging!

I have a lot of people who want to borrow it, and would if it wasn't on my KINDLE."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a beautiful novel dealing with the human condition connected with love. Emily Bront&#1105; masterfully illustrates how love can dictate human emotion, devotion, and action in everyday life. Through Bront&#1105;'s use of juxtaposition between life and death or heaven and hell, we are introduced to the how love is one of the strongest metaphysical emotions humans acquaint with. This metaphysical passion transcends Mr. Heithcliff's daily routine and drives him to rash decisions of revenge, as well as producing an idea of active and passive forces throughout the novel. This includes the ideals of nature and society being such a force in the development of Catherine as she is unfairly controlled by the forces of Mr. Heathcliff. Bront&#1105;'s use of diction throughout the novel only reinforces the theme through an elegant Yorkshire style. Hefty English accents are thoroughly used, even to the point of confusion. This can most pertinently be noticed with Bront&#1105;'s character Joseph, who carries a heavy accent. All of these devices accumulate to form the imagery of underlying passion that is threaded page by page. Personally, her ability to use such complex and yet detailed imagery to advance the plot astounds me. I would wholly recommend this novel to any individual seeking an understanding to humans' mysterious and controversial collision with love."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Recommended by several friends & was well worth the effort!

This is probably my favorite book. What I loved about it? Everything. This is a book about unresolved passions and how they managed to ruin everything and everyone around them.Heathcliff is a \\"dark\\" solitary man whose only interest is winning the eyes of Catherine Earnshaw, a beautiful young girl, who is also his best friend. When she marries Edgar Linton, Heathcliff is resolved to (literally) make their lives hell. And he does, but also destroys himself in the end.

Therefore, I was unsurprised when I read it and discovered that it was THAT twisted. However, it was also gripping and very interesting. You do not expect a woman in the 1800s to write a book with such romantic passion - because that is where the darkness comes from, the passion that two of the characters have for each other.I really enjoyed this book, though I must admit I was feeling a bit down after I read it. This book will definitely have you re-think Romance. Do you really want that all-consuming love? A love that causes anger, hatred, even death?If you are a fun of romance and old-century books, do not hesitate to pick this book up. If you like gloomy moors, and tales of strife, you shall like this book, too. This is a perfect combination of the two genres.Good reading!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I especially enjoyed the add-ons at the end. Teens will find this fun and interesting."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I both love and hate this book. I've read it twice and every time it breaks my heart.It's wonderfully written and a must read for anyone that hasn't had that pleasure yet."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is beautifully written. I fell in love with Emily Bronte and her cadence of language from the very first chapter.Sadly, I loathed the characters. I sympathized with Heathcliff in the first half of the book and was disappointed to find myself hating him in the second half. I despised Catherine Earnshaw from her introduction in the story until her death. The only character I liked at all was Hareton, and I was happy for the way things turned out for him.Reading Wuthering Heights made me appreciate Jane Austen so much more than I already did! Emily Bronte's female characters continually made me wistfully think of Austen's Elizabeth Bennett, and long for her to inhabit Thrushcross Grange instead of Catherine Earnshaw. The difference between Austen's female characters and Bronte's is shocking. I definitely take the existence of strong willed women in modern fiction for granted, and this reminded me how ahead of her time Jane Austen really was. I would love to read a piece of Austen fanfic in which Elizabeth Bennet bashes Catherine Earnshaw over the head with a frying pan, usurps her as mistress of Thrushcross Grange, and gives Heathcliff AND Mr. Linton a sound thrashing.I was surprised that some describe this story as romantic; I didn't find one word even remotely romantic! I appreciated the Gothic and supernatural elements and the wonderful, descriptive writing style. I have a beautiful image of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights in my head; I can picture the houses and their rooms, the landscape, the gardens and the hills. Despite the personalities of the characters, I really did enjoy this story and I'm glad to have finally read it.I especially love this new Penguin Classics Deluxe edition. Ruben Toledo's cover is even more gorgeous than the Amazon picture portrays, and the pages and binding are high quality. I definitely plan to purchase the rest of these Deluxe Editions that Penguin has released."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I will refrain from giving a plot outline. Many have already done this and it is such a well known story that many people are familar with it having not even read the book. It is one of the greatest stories of love between two people that are too much alike to really understand each other in the English language. Is it an easy happy read no is it a realistic view of a violently passonate love that is doomed yes. You don't read this book for moon light and romance you read this book for the complete realism in it. We all want happy endings in life. Wuthering Heights gives us a more realistic view of what we all live through. Emily Bronte was over a century before her time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights has been reviewed ad infinitum, but I wanted to say that this is one of the most beautiful books I own.I was looking for a series of classics that I could purchase in hardcover to spruce up my personal library. I stumbled upon these special editions from Penguin Classics, with covers designed by Coralie Bickford-Smith. I love books, but these books still make me giddy with delight when I pick them up. The covers have so much character and they're sturdy. The fonts are classic and easy to read, and the paper is substantial. The ribbon bookmarks, that match the cover, are a really nice touch. The only bad thing I can say, and it's so minor, is that the binding is a little stiff when the book is new. It loosens as you read.There are more titles available, though some are still exclusive to the UK. I truly hope Amazon and Penguin make all editions available in the US and keep them coming!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is about the relationship between two people named Heathcliff and Catherine. Now, from everything I knew about this book before I read it, I thought the novel was going to be a great love story full of romance and hugging and declarations of devotion. Boy, was I wrong. At the heart of the book is a revenge drama carried out by a man so consumed by hatred that he makes Palpatine from the first Star Wars trilogy look like a nice guy.Heathcliff was raised from childhood with Catherine Earnshaw and her older brother Hindley, but Heathcliff was not related to them. Mr. Earnshaw brought Heathcliff home with him one day after finding him living the life of an orphan on the streets of London. I kinda suspect that maybe Heathcliff was a secret love child Earnshaw had with a mistress in the city. But that's just my take. Heathcliff rapidly becomes Earnshaw's favorite, even more so than Hindley, much to the son's disgust, which fuels an intense hatred and jealousy that only gets worse after the elder Earnshaw dies. Up to that point, Heathcliff had always been treated as a member of the family, but afterwards Hindley treats him as nothing more than a common servant to be abused and made to work his hands to the bone. And by abused, I do mean actual physical beatings. Catherine, the great love of Heathcliff's life, decides that he has nothing to offer her and instead marries Edgar Linton, the son of one of their neighbors. Hindley too, gets married. The only one left out of this whole lovefest is, you guessed it, Heathcliff, and he leaves the windswept moors only to return years later to exact his revenge on both families Monte Cristo style.I was really caught off guard by this book. Like I said, I was expecting a romance instead of a Shakespearean revenge tragedy. That's not to say there isn't a happy ending, but that it takes a long and convoluted path, wrought with broken lives and bittersweet death. What turns Heathcliff into such a monster is that both he and Catherine know that they were meant to be together but she makes the decision to reject him based solely on improving her social standing. And let's be frank, the supposed social mobility she craves doesn't amount to squat when you live out in the middle of nowhere in some backwater Gothic swamp. To me, I can almost see precursors to Faulkner's decaying nobility. Something else that really struck me about the novel was its haunting theme of sexual frustration. What Heathcliff and Catherine feel for each other is very sexual. There isn't any idealistic or poetic flowers growing out of each other's imagination. They see each other for what they are and love each other for what they are. Neither of them were cannibals but I almost felt like if they could find a way to eat each other, they would have.Bronte does a virtuoso job of moving between time periods and showing different generations of the Earnshaws and Lintons as the children of both have to deal with the legacy left them by the destructive failed love of Catherine and Heathcliff. The main narrators of the story are not the two main characters. Instead, the tale is told by Nelly, a maid just a little older than them who was a witness to everything that happened. She tells the story to a certain Mr. Lockwood, a man who is renting a house from Heathcliff many years after all this has gone down. Emily moves from present to past to future and back again during different chapters that really seems a more postmodern way of looking at things. This book was far ahead of its time in terms of novelistic technique.Bronte even takes up the issue of racism in Wuthering Heights, as part of the reason Hindley and the Lintons look down on Heathcliff is because of his \\"dark gipsy skin\\".I look at Catherine as a coward who recognized that Heathcliff was who she was meant to be with, but in her superficial thinking, she was more worried about marrying well (weren't all women of that time the same) than marrying for love. Marrying for love was for peasants. If you had money or land you had to marry an equal or someone higher than you. She chose wrongly and a lot of people had to suffer for it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Beautiful book. I love the fabric cover. There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"To give \\"Wuthering Heights\\" some credit, the story and characters aren't half bad. The plot is interesting in and of itself, and the characters are all easily imagined if not terribly well-rounded (with the exception of Heathcliff, who can be appreciated fully when you consider both his cruelty and his motivation and origins). All in all, the material is promising.Unfortunately, the writing is so convoluted and verbose that you'd need a machete to ... your way through it. And \\"...\\" is an accurate verb; typically whole paragraphs and pages are filled with needless complications so that it's more like deciphering a code than reading a story. The sheer amount of effort that it takes to get very little payoff quickly breeds apathy. After a while, I didn't care who Catherine married or who was narrating or anything else.The book has some other flaws (most noticeably the use of death as a cheap plot device) but the writing's really what sinks the book. If you like slaving away for minimal payoff, this book's for you. Otherwise..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Hands down, the worst novel that I have ever read. The only reason I finished it was to settle an oddly masochistic wager with a family member. The characters are all contemptible, the writing dull, and the story inane. When it was over I had mixed feelings of relief (thank God it was over) and regret for wasting that much of my life on it. What a horrible, horrible novel. If there is such a thing as hell, for me, it would be an empty room with nothing but a copy of Wuthering Heights in it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I must confess that I got kind of bored at the beginning of the book, I found it a little confusing but after reading some more pages I got the gist, maybe I'm wrong but it reminds me a little bit Lady Chatterley's Lover.I read the first chaptersin almost two weeks since I found it kind of hard to read, but there was a point when I just couldn't stop from reading it, I was so touched by the way Austen gave life to every single character.I'm looking forward to read more of this writer."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The great tragedy of this book is that the author didn't kill off Catherine and Heathcliff MUCH SOONER. Then she might have been able to introduce alternate main characters who were actually interesting.Although given Emily Bronte's track record with the aforementioned losers, maybe populating her novels with characters that the reader would find interesting just wasn't her strong suit...."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Haven't had a chance to read the book yet. But, it looks like it will be a great read. The book came as promised. It is a paperback - but a high quality one. If you are looking for this classic, I do recommend this printing."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've never before written a negative Amazon reader review. As an author, I know how much they can sting, and I try to limit myself to only reviewing books I've really enjoyed. However, since the author is long dead, I doubt I can hurt her feelings. And if by my words I can possibly prevent one other person from undergoing the suffering I've endured, I'll feel that my job here is done.I decided that at the age of 52, it was time I started reading some of the classics that I'd missed along the way. I read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE first, and though I found Ms. Austen's writing to be tedious, the book was mildly entertaining. I thought I'd try Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS next. I'd always heard how romantic the story was, and no less than three people, upon seeing me with the book, told me, \\"You'll love it! You'll absolutely love it!\\"Please tell me you're kidding.This book is wretched. Painful to a degree I've never before experienced. I've read books that put me to sleep, books I found impossibly dull, books I found too stupid for words. But I have NEVER hated a book so much in my life. The characters in their entirety don't possess a single redeeming value. They are miserable, obnoxious, hateful excuses for human beings. Even the DOGS are hateful. Why should I care what happens to any of these awful people? Why should I care if they've made themselves miserable through their own choices and then spend the rest of the book whining and complaining about how pathetic their lives are?I hadn't realized just how much I loathed them until halfway through the book, when a major character died, and all I could think was, \\"THANK GOD! THANK GOD!\\"And then, there's the dialect. Ah, the dialect! I could tolerate it if it was used sparingly. But when a certain character goes into a speech that lasts for half a page of small print, in a language that can only be described as Not Even Resembling English (yes, I know it's supposed to be Scottish), the result is unbearable pain. Every time this character speaks (which is, thankfully, not often), I find myself puzzling over his words in an attempt to translate them into something that seems even mildly coherent. Sometimes, it's possible to do this just by context. At other times, I shake my head in bewilderment and disgust and simply move on to a different page. Considering how slowly the story moves (is there a storyline? a point to all this suffering?), I could probably skip entire chapters and not miss anything.I'd also like to know where the romance is. Since everybody in this book seems to hate everybody else, with the notable exception of the uncouth monster, Heathcliff, and the spoiled-rotten, obnoxious Catherine, I can't fathom where that might lie. Am I too dense to understand? Or has the literary world been tricking us for 150 years, convincing the sheep of the world to follow along in praise of this \\"romantic\\" classic?I think I would rather have my fingernails pulled out forcefully, one at a time, than finish reading this book. I'm halfway through, and life is short. Am I really willing to spend that much more of my short time here on earth torturing myself just for the satisfaction of knowing I actually read the dreadful thing? I think not.I also think my foray into the classics has ended right here. I'm off to read some Robert Parker or Janet Evanovich. Maybe even some Jackie Collins. Anything to cleanse my palate of the terrible aftertaste of Heathcliff and Catherine.To each his own. I know there are people who rave about this book, people who love it. I'm glad somebody does. Every book deserves to be loved by somebody. But in this case, with this particular book, that somebody will have to be Somebody Else. Because it certainly isn't me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Far too drawn out, poorly written- Not at all engaging or otherwise, this book brings on suicidal tendancies to it's unfortunate readers.

It just didn't interest me, and it was confusing. I didn't like the characters too much and didn't get them. I think this book could've been better, and I personally wouldn't want to read it again. I had a hard time getting into it, the whole time I was reading it. It was pretty boring."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I just recently finished reading Wuthering Heights, and to be perfectly honest I have to say that it's a terrible story.The basic plot is centered around Mr. Lockwood and his visit to rural England and the house called Wuthering Heights where he is told the life story of a man named Heathcliff along with his love for Catherine, his hate for his bother (and his brother's son (Heraton) and his neighbors at Thruscross Grange and their son (Edgar) and their daughter (Isabella) [who he marries] and the son that he has with Isabella (Linton) and the extra hate that he gains when Edgar marries Catherine), and his story of revenge against the afore mentioned individuals who he hates.That brings us to the novel's problems. The true highlight of a novel is not its story, but rather its hidden significance, and while Wuthering Heights does bring out the extreme emotions that can be associated with love (i.e. passion, jealousy, spite), it does so in such a way that kills any male reader. It's true -for some reason, the ladies who read this book tend to like it much more than the guys.Perhaps the reason for this is the fact that the novel, with all deep and meaningful thoughts written in, reads like a victorian era after school special. Catherine totally had a crush on Heathcliff, and Heatcliff liked him back, but Catherine started hanging out with the wrong crowd -Isabella and Edgar. After a while Catherine just didn't want to hang out with Heathcliff, and one night she got so out of hand that she totally made out with Edgar! Heathcliff finds out and totally gets made, but he moved to another school for a year so it was okay then. Besides, his brother was mean to him. The next year he totally surprised everyone when he came back! Catherine was soooo regretful that she made out with Edgar, and she wanted Heathcliff back -but Isabella had a crush on him too! They totally got in a cat fight that day, saying how much they both hate Heathcliff. The problem was that Heathcliff was soooo made at Catherine (still) but had a crush on her (still) so he totally made out with Isabella! Then Isabella dies, then Edgar dies, then Heathcliff brother dies, then a few people get married until Heathcliff finally bites the dust.You're probably thinking that I have blown the story out of proportion, but the sad truth is that I haven't. In actuality, Heathcliff and Catherine do fall in love, but they never admit it to each other -they always bicker and argue and yell about how much they hate each other until Catherine dies. Just like how middle school kids will talk about how much they like so-and-so, but not to that individul. In actuality, Catherine does marry Edgar, Heathcliff does run away, and on his return Isabella does admit that she has fallen in love with him, Heathcliff does marry Isabella for revenge, and the rest of the story is then about people dying and Catherine's daughter Catherine and how she was forced to marry Heathcliff's son so that Heathcliff would get extra land when his kid died.Touching love story, isn't it?While some might call it a wild romance and a true testament to our inability to control the strongest of human emotion, I find that the love story is very elementary (on the account that it really does read like an afterschool special) and at the same time blown up -almost like Emily Bronte was a love-starved victorian era woman longing for a romance in her life (which she was) and the rest of the story was just a simple story where people are mean to each other and then die.Sorry Emily Bronte!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am aware that this is not a novel meant to put a smile on your face or make you think of flowers and rainbows etc. But I was unable to get any enjoyment out of this book because the characters are so completely ridiculous in their courses of actions. Granted, the theme of the book is how hatred, jealousy, envy, and the like can overcome a person's soul, but she took it too far. The overblown &quot;love&quot; between the characters would invariably be followed by an act of viscious cruelty. Many of the good reviews for this book are from high school students. The reason most of them liked it, in my mind, is because they are immature and have idealized images of the emotions described in the book and how people would react to those emotions. We all know what it is like to love, to hate, to lose, but even under the most painful situations no one would act the way these characters did."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I know this may sound disrespectful to all of you connoisseurs of fine Brittish literature, but I hated Wuthering Heights.

Number one, isn't it supposed to be a 'tragic love story' between Cathy and Heathcliff?

And why does everyone die from catching a cold? Living in England ain't that bad and also I could not understand ONE WORD of what Joseph was saying! The narrative in this book also confused me a bit.I'd start a chapter believing Nelly to be narrating only to find out half way through that it was actually Mr Lockwood. Also what really confused me was Who was Ellen? Was it another name for Nelly Dean?? This book was quite clumsy,and how did Emily Bronte turn a useless story into a 400 page novel? The only decent part of the book was when Catherine is dying and Heathcliff holds her and actually kisses her.That is the only part which shows their true feelings. Also Nelly was a back stabber - Every secret she was told by Catherine and Cathy and even Isabella, she tells someone else!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Did not like this at all.

Times have changed haven't they."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights - is one of the excellent classic novels that should be read by everyone, that likes Emily Bronte novels."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I gave this one star, not because you can go no lower, but because it is well-written and has a coherent story line. Aside from that, however, I found it quite lacking. I personally found the story to be dreadful and unpleasant. I generally have no issue with unpleasant characters or unhappy endings, but aside from the writing style and Bronte's ability to hold the story together in a clear manner I found nothing enjoyable about it, and pleasant or not books are meant to be enjoyed, elsewise you're wasting your time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book in high school. That was 34 years ago. I wanted to read it again because I remembered loving it in high school"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte must have had a great imagination, yet a brilliant sense of reality when writing Wuthering Heights. I say this because so many real problems are apparent in her slightly modified storybook characters. Problems that are faced all the time-orphaned children, undying love, and more than once characters are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Bronte's characters are unlike any I've come across. They are multi-dimensional, and unpredictable; they can be shady and suicidal.Events can unfold in the novel abruptly, or very slowly. At the turn of the page, the main character could be dead, or a new one brought into the world. Nevertheless, the events of one hour could take up two chapters, at the least. Some can be surprising, and quite disturbing, others awaited and welcomed. But, these events are almost never predictable.Many things are repeats of volume 1 in volume 2, but Bronte somehow manages to make a totally different story of the second volume, and you are not bored. There are parallels between the houses, characters, and events. Some of which will most likely be talked about in your language arts class. :)In conclusion, everyone should read Wuthering Heights at least once in their lives. Yes, it's fairly difficult to read and the tests may lower your grade substantially, but you will have attained something from reading it that no other novel can come close to. So whether you read it on your own time, or for a report, along with someone, or all by yourself, just read it!~ L ~"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Okay, maybe that's a bit harsh. Heathcliff is not satan, but he does possess many demonic attributes. I have to say that he is what dragged me through this story. His evilness is nearly absolute and bent on destruction of everyone in his life. But I still have to ask myself why, which may go to say that he is unsatisfactorily explained in the novel. I understand his love for Catherine and the hatred inflicted on him by Earnshaw, but I still can't grasp the depth of his cruelty. The moral freedom he possesses is also astounding, as he worries not about heaven or hell, only about his own personal heaven, in the ground, with Catherine by his side. To me, that may be where his true strength lies.My next favorite character would probably have to be Ellen"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"How could a girl with little or no contact with the outside world write a novel such as this? I was spellbound. My heart just wrinched in pain when I read the words of Catherine &quot;...I am Heathcliff&quot;. This is the story of two proud and passionate people. I looked all my life for a love like these two shared. I was told more than once that it is just &quot;fiction&quot;...real lives never have emotions and dramatics such as this. They were wrong. It took 32 years...but I found my Heathcliff. I recommend this book highly. Give it to your daughters. Share the gift of words. Rich and beautiful words. I can help but gush over this novel. Lovely. Truely lovely."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Ah, Heathcliff and Catherine. Literature's first twisted, truly dependent couple, coming together in one of the most original books in the english canon. What a treat.Emily Bronte's first and only book details the generational struggle between the Earnshaws, a poor farming family, and the Lintons, a wealthy group at Thrushcross Grange. The tragedy's catalyst is Heathcliff, a dark and rebellious boy of unknown parentage whom Mr. Earnshaw brings home and raises as his own child. Earnshaw's son, Hindley, hates Heathcliff with a fierce passion, but young Catherine is immediately drawn to the boy. As they grow older, they realize they are soul mates, but Catherine, attracted to the power and wealth at Thrushcross Grange, marries foppish Edgar Linton, incensing Heathcliff so greatly that he leaves Wuthering Heights for years, traveling the world and becoming a wealthy man. When he returns, it is for revenge, and soon his hatred tears apart the lives of not only Catherine, Edgar and Hindley, but their children as well.This has to be one of the most intense, fiery novels ever written. Bronte describes her wild, moorish surroundings with such vigor and passion that the moors themselves become a character. She also steers clear of nineteenth century melodrama and typical characters; there is no 'winsome heroine' or 'dastardly sneak' or 'good guy.' Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Though Heathcliff and Catherine are the primary focus of the novel, you will find yourself rooting for them one moment, then rooting for someone else the next. Bronte makes her characters real people, with a psychological depth and acuity uncommon in most nineteenth century literature; indeed, in literature in general. Everyone has their faults and their virtues. You will feel anger and sorrow for everyone at least once in the book.Bronte's dialogue burns with passion and intensity. When Heathcliff and Catherine allow themselves to finally express their love, it's with as much scorn and fury as adoration. Heathcliff seems to be straddling the line between embracing his soul mate and strangling her. Catherine, even at her most vulnerable, is still an impassioned and taunting lover. Each character has his or her own distinct voice; Nelly Dean, the childhood nurse of Catherine and Heathcliff and the story's primary narrator, immediately comes across as a pleasant, solid and mundane creature, while the villainous Hindley makes you want to black his eyes at least twenty times before the book's over. Bronte created characters of flesh, blood and SOUL. These are real people, really real people. You don't see that often. The characters and the brilliant description and evocation of the Yorkshire moors drench the story in a gorgeous, wild, dark mood. This book gets the heart racing.Emily Bronte wrote one of the great novels of all time on her first and only try. Wow."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For some reason I expected this to be a Pink novel. Much on the contrary, it's rather black. It is a little masterpiece with no true Romanticism (or maybe yes). It is more of a Gothic novel, at least in tone and atmosphere. A man recently arrived to the Yorkshire moors is told, by his maid, the story of neighbors Earnshaw and Linton, and the Earnshaw's adopted and misterious stepson, Heathcliffe. The story spans decades of pure hatred, envy, horrible offenses and revenges, as well as despise for the human race. Each character lives immersed in their own bitterness and pain, with very little communication between them. BUT, beneath this surface there is love, the love between Catherine Earnshaw and her step brother Heathcliffe. In a way, it is a pure love, but it is also somewhat twisted and inevitably star-crossed. Out of this ill-fated love, a more normal and hopeful love will be born, but that you'll have to find for yourself.For me, the best thing about this novel is the creation of an environment, the handling of the medium within which the tormented characters live. It is constantly tense, brooding, foreboding, with periodic explosions of anger, agression and grief. It is somber, macabre and rainy, like the place where it occurs."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Opion of Book:The book was pretty good, but a little confusing. Her language was a little out dated and hard to understand, but nothing to bad. The writting style is sort of informal because she has a narator and they lived and visited Wuthering Heights but a little hard to understand though.Support of Opinion: It was confusing because there were two Catherines and many people came from the Earnshaw family or were related in some way. She used very big words but ones taht went with what she was saying. It was about true love and more so romantic so that was a plus. Nelly helped narate the story and she was Catherine's maid so that was a little informal basis.Personal Preference: I like this book because what can I say, I'm a hopeless romantic. Some parts were sad though that was the only bad part..Recommendation: YES! I would recommend this book, exspecially to anyoe who likes romance and believes that true love will win out no matter what."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"To those who wish a first contact with the British literature, I invariably recommend reading the novel Wuthering Heights. After readind such book, one grieves the excessively early death of Emily Bront, and, yet, wonders seriously whether she would have been capable of producing another masterpiece to equal her first, had her fate been different.The characters of this incredibly intense story acquire so vivid a uniqueness as the narrative goes on that the reader, sometimes, even becomes unable to distinguish the characters from the \\"real people\\" around him, for he is inevitably beguiled into feeling for them all kinds of sentiment; from love to contempt, from pity to hatred; in a wild kaleidoscope of feelings which no sensitive reader will ever forget.But probably, the greatest triumph of this story is the character Heathcliff. Emily Bront creates a being singular in all its ways, especially its revengeful impulses. She renders Heathcliff something more than human, a true entity!, as she describes his life in that ingeniously exerted gossip fashion. By revealing to us only as much information as the closest person to his whole story (Nelly Dean) has, the writer presents him more as a legend of a superstitious countryside place than an ordinary person.Besides the gossip fashion used throughout the book, there is another element that helps make Heathcliff rather inhuman: his emotions; the consuming love he feels (which becomes more than idolatry for a godess after Catherine's death; she becomes the whole purpose of his \\"unlife\\"), the savageness of his worst outbursts of anger, the malignity he had to infuse to his personality in order to endure the harsh live that succeeded his misterious being born, and other traits which the heedful peruser shall most certainly divine from the many passages of the book.I just entreat that the new readers beware calling Heathcliff essencially evil; you try to analise the life he was forced to bear since his beggning, even before his being rescued from the streets of Liverpool by Old Earnshaw, ere trying to draw any unfair conclusions about this quite unfortunate being.Not only Heathcliff, but all the other characters call our attention in this heartfelt romance: It is quite impossible for Catherine Earnshaw's fierce wildness to pass unnoticed to us; she is the true representation of the unbridled spirit of those moors in her fits of passion, and her actions can reverberate as a thunderstrike on the people who love her, thus casting on them shadows of despair and sadness as swarthy as the ones that dwell in her soul at the moment. It is also interesting to perceive that the fact of her being a woman, a simple wife, and therefore having no great pihsical or social power of which to avail herself, does not render her harmless to the hearts of those who dote on her, for she has, and knows how to use, the power to hurt them in the most grievous way anyone could ever hurt; by degrading the greatest idol and reason of their lives, which is herself. Curious indeed is to notice that both the whole of her hate and the whole of her love are always bestowed upon the same people; another trait that leads back to her main one: her heart brimful with wildness.Actually, one could make thorough analyses concerning each of the rich and allegorical characters of this book; the puritan curmudgeon Joseph, the sweet younger Catherine, the noble - hearted rustic Hareton Earnshaw, the standard good - natured housemaid Nelly Dean, and so on; this is only a space for a brief review and recommendation however, and thus I ought not to indulge with composing an extensive critique on this amazing and unforgettable work of art; even because I would refuse to consider any article I could write in the moment completely worthy of being bestowed upon such a masterwork due to my having less time to spare for the performing of so important a task than I should now.Finally, i wish to praise and call the readers' attention to the skillfully written end of Wuthering Heights; with Heathcliff lying as an unearthly, unnamed interloper beside Edgar and Catherine; as what he had always been throughout his hapless life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Let's admit it, as good a writer Emily Bronte was, she wasn't as good a writer as her sister, Charlotte. Her only major work, WUTHERING HEIGHTS clearly illustrates that. The writing is superior to most fiction that one reads today and the story is rather interesting. Yet, it failed to catch my attention as easily as JANE EYRE did. There are very few likeable characters in the story (the young Catherine Earnshaw, the housekeeper, and the narrator) and the ending seemed rather hasty. Nevertheless, WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a classic and for good reason. It examines a love that defies death, how important our relationships with other people are, and the value of words. It takes awhile to get into the book, but once one passes the first few chapters, it's hard to put the book down."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is exciting and interesting, a good combination.

The novel was good, but it didn't interest me. The relationship with Catherine and Heathcliff wasn't a relationship that I appreciated.

So in my opinion, the novel was too mature for me and I'll probably be interested in the novel when I get older."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Love this classic story by Emily Bronte and loved reading it on my ipad.

I have heard of it since High School but never read it until now. Good classic reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I picked this book up again some 35 years after reading it in high school, and what I found was quite different from what I remembered. Our &quot;cultural&quot; memory of this great English novel is that it is a story of romantic, wild passion, and unrequited love. No doubt our preconceptions are heavily influenced by the famous film made many years ago. The reality is quite different. Catherine is a rather vain and willful girl who rejects Heathcliff because of differences in their class and upbringing. Heathcliff is full of hatred and resentment despite the great kindness shown him by his master in adopting him literally off the street. There is nothing romantic about the relationship between these two--they hurt each other constantly despite their almost spiritual bond. After Catherine's death, which occurs only halfway through the book, things turn bleaker still, as Heathcliff wreaks revenge on all around him. The wild, harsh countryside and climate, beautifully evoked by Bronte, echo the violent emotions that drive the lives of the characters. How cruel these people are to each other--how hard is Heathcliff's heart that he hates Catherine's daughter most of all. I confess that I found the unrelieved bleakness hard to take at times, and the redemptive conclusion a bit contrived, but it's a great work of English literature nonetheless--and to imagine this book was written by a young woman with virtually no experience of the world!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"WUTHERING HEIGHTS is without a doubt the greatest romance novel I have ever read. Anybody who has ever had a hopeless love for somebody else will understand the torment that Heathcliff and Cathy went through. The love shown here is everything that love involves: infatuation, lust, longing, and even hatred. Simply put, this novel is an absolute masterpiece! You owe it to yourself to read it! Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Amazing book. I have to admit when I first started reading it for my British Lit class I wasn't at all interested. I found the beginning slow and tedious. But once I got into the flashbacks from Nelly I was engrossed and couldn't put it down. The book is dark but a great read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the best book ever. I absolutely love it. It has so much feeling and passion in it that you can't help thinking about it long after you finish reading it. And, odd as it sounds, I think that Elton John's song &quot;Original Sin&quot; fits it very well. I love it so much and definately recommend you to read. Definately."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The book is written wonderfully, you may call it gothic romance, but the book's really got a style and genre of its own. Now, I only say this for GREAT romance novels, like the Brontes. The language greatly affects the way the story is expressed. It is told in a subtle and bumpy manner, going way ahead of the reader, its many pauses for the narrator gives the reader time to think the thing over, like the guest. Basically, the style and format is a fascinating one, it truly does intrigue the reader to a certain level. Now, it is hard to say if Heathcliff is the kind of man a girl would want( not that I'm a girl ), he is, if you want someone who truly loves you, he's not if you don't want someone to go CRAZY over you. It is--I think--clever of Emily Bronte, to leave this question for readers to consider as they sit comfortably in their beds reading this romance. But if you read it carefully, you will see that the narrator does not form a very high opinion of Heathcliff, yet the latter did deserve the revenge he got. Now, here we have another controversial point for us readers. Thus the novel is a quick one, without all the slow( at least very slow )descriptions and it forms different points of interest as it moves along just pulling the reader in. As the reader gets to the end he/she will feel a shocking yet not surprising end. The ending is a satisfactory one after chapters after chapters of points pointing toward the end. After all, the end is a slope for the way the novel is going. All in all, the book is satisfactory, and something that will--in a way--haunt the reader in later times. It is a masterpiece with all those interesting formats which I will never forget."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I see Bronte's classic novel as the celebration of imagination and the boundless possibilities that dreaming and strongly believing in the make-believe of dreams, as children can only do so well, presents to the reader. Heathcliff and Cathy were happiest when they cast off all of the pretentious cares, and embraced the simplest of things together. As with most classic novels, death is misunderstood; Death was only symbolic of that passage into a reality they both shared all along- a realized spirit of happiness. If anything, it is a strong and encouraging message that the flawed things we most trouble over in life are the very things not all that important. As one modern book puts it, &quot;Don't sweat the small stuff. It's all small stuff.&quot; One might argue that even in death, the romantic flaws would carry on; the distractions still beckoning. To the contrary, this classic novel is the celebration of whatsoever things are beautiful, gracious, carefree, simple, and worthwhile in right here, right now living. In biblical terms, Except ye be as little children..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm thirteen years old, and a HUGE reading fanatic. So one day I pick this up, and start reading. At first, it's pretty hard, but then you start to get along with the writing style. This took me a LONG time to read, but it was definately WELL-WORTH it! It's hard to explain what it was about, but I'll help you best I can. So there's this guy(Mr. Lockwood) and he is the current tennant of Thrushcross Grange. Through the whole story, a servant named Ellen(Nelly) Dean is telling him the history of the people who lived there, and in Wuthering Heights. I'd say that the story is mostly how Heathcliff ruined the lives of the Earnshaw and Linton families, but that is just my point. The story basically starts off about Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. Then, to the point after that, it comes down to start about Catherine Earnshaw's daughter, Catherine Linton. It's really good, and really hard too! Consider it a big accomplishment to have read it, cause it is amazing!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It's been a while since I've read this book, but I remember that I was entranced by it. It's a wonderfully tragic love story. I found it very romantic and a suprisingly easy read. Once you begin it you won't want to put it down. However, my only complaint is that some of the characters have the same name so it's harder to keep track of who's who."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"All of the novels of the Bronte sisters exhibit a genius of passion well surpassing their age. Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS, however - though perhaps not quite so endearing as the novels of her sister, Charlotte - possesses the most adeptly pondering prose, egregiously fathoming the terrifying extremes of love and hate.Born amidst the feral landscape of England's Yorkshire moors, the Earnshaw family and their ramshackle farm estate, Wuthering Heights, are at the center of this manifestly heartrending story. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw, with the help of several servants - most notably their poignantly observant maid Nellie, and their pious and stoic manservant Joseph - are raising two children: a son, Hindley, and his younger sister, Cathy. On a cold and drizzly evening, when Hindley's but a teenager and Cathy still a very small child, Mr. Earnshaw returns from Liverpool carrying a young urchin he'd found starving in the streets. Despite wary opposition from his family, he adopts the four or five year-old child and names him Heathcliff. Mr. Earnshaw, over the next several years, develops a fond affection for Heathcliff that surpasses even that which he feels for his own son. Mrs. Earnshaw dies not long after Heathcliff joins the family, then Mr. Earnshaw dies several years afterwards. From thereon, Hindley relentlessly vents a deeply embedded bitterness borne of jealousy upon his adopted younger brother.Hindley's hatred of Heathcliff is the force that drives this story on. His sister Cathy, however, from a very young age is as drawn to Heathcliff's quiet thoughtfulness, as he to her flighty impulsiveness. The two of them nurture a very deep friendship as children, which grows to an almost otherworldly love as young adults. This tempestuous love gets devastatingly shaken not only by Hindley's efforts to keep Heathcliff in the drudge, but also by wooings for Cathy from a wealthy blue-eyed suitor from Thrushcross Grange, a neighboring estate. This young strapping is Edgar Linton, and he as well as his sister Isabella cut a very severe contrast to Heathcliff. The Lintons are fair-haired, refined in manner, and have very openly expressive countenances. Heathcliff, on the other hand, casts a dark, gloomy aspect: intensely handsome despite dirty, messy hair and thick-browed brooding eyes. Truly Cathy's audacious, tempestuous spirit, wild as the blustering wind on the Yorkshire moors, is pure soul mate to Heathcliff's moody, devil of a gypsy, hot-blooded heart. \\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods,\\" she says, \\"time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.\\" Never - in all of the novels I've ever read - have soul mates been so intensely, so uncannily written.The only fault I find in this story is the utter lack of endearing qualities in either Cathy or in Heathcliff. Each displays, at turns, some form of careless frivolity or ruthless cruelty in either their actions or their words. And though I certainly cannot help but feel for their struggles and their pain, neither are the type individuals with whom I would possibly want to become a friend. They are amazingly self-absorbed, and wholly blinded by the radiance of each other.Mistake me not, though - reading WUTHERING HEIGHTS was indeed a wondrous experience. The writing interweaves the earthly elements, the people, and the landscape haunted by their ghosts with a deftness that's extraordinary. There is undeniable genius here - a brilliantly intense story of a love that refuses to be thwarted, coursing through the heart and soul of the next generation, thence onward, and beyond the grave."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights, by Emily Bronte is one of the greatest romances in history.\\"-Kristen Murphy.Within the text of this book, Emily describes events that take place revolving around a romance. The main characters of this book are: Catherine, Cathy, Edgar, Linton, Hareton, Hindley, Isabella, and Heathcliff. Isabella is very spoiled, and soon has a son that dies (Linton). Heathcliff's love life turns into a mess and turns into a lonely old man. Hindley is a jealous and rebellious child that soon becomes jealous of Heathcliff. Hareton is Hindley's son that eventually marries Catherine.Throughout the book the characters run into a lot of problems and adventures. For example, there is a tremendous amount of tension that burns off Heathcliff. My favorite character in the book is Heathcliff. The reason that I like him so much is because he keeps your eyes open. He is always changing, his appearance and his location.The themes that are reveled within the book are: Good vs. Evil, Revenge, Crime and Punishment, Passion vs. Rational Love, Ignorance vs. Education, and Selfishness. The characters display these themes in many different scenes and emotions.My overall opinion of this book was excellent. I would not change anything at all, and I believe that the ending is perfect. I would recommend this book to anyone that in joy's romance novels. It is a novel that keeps you wondering and not knowing what is going to happen next. You may think that you know how this book is going to end, but really you don't. This book sits way ahead of all the other romance novels."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is only one way I can understand this story, and it is to read Wuthering Heights as a parody of all other romantic novels. Just think about it: what would a typical romantic hero look like in real life? What would dark, intolerable passion look like in real life? What kind of ends would said hero be willing to go to in order to satisfy a love so intrinsic to his being IN REAL LIFE?Trust me, if you read the book from this point of view, you're going to want to continue reading just to see how far Heathcliff is willing to go to satisfy his desire.YMMV."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had always heard about the 'classic' love story in Wuthering Heights, but I never thought to read the novel until a few months ago. The main character Catherine Earnshaw is an idealistic, strong willed girl on her way to becoming a well-respected lady. One day her father brings Heathcliff, a brooding and mysterious orphan, into their home, and Catherine is immediately drawn to him. After her father dies, Catherine's brother Hindley takes over their home, Wuthering Heights, and Heathcliff is forced to be a servant. Heathcliff is in love with Catherine, and Catherine apparently feels the same way until she betrays Heathcliff to marry Edgar Linton. Outraged and hurt, Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights.Heathcliff returns a year later with the intellect and money of a gentleman. Heathcliff stays at Wuthering Heights with Catherine and Edgar. Heathcliff elopes with Edgar's sister, Isabella, finally getting his revenge on Catherine and Edgar. Isabella eventually regrets the marriage because Heathcliff really doesn't love her and abuses her.Catherine become pregnant, but she dies while giving birth. Before passing away, though, Catherine talks with Heathcliff, and they forgive each other. Catherine gives birth to a daughter who is named Catherine after her mother. The young Catherine grows up with Heathcliff planning a romance between her and Isabella's son Linton.As I was reading the first few chapters, I couldn't figure out why the book was a classic. However, I continued on and became completely engaged in the description, the characters, and the intense love story between Catherine and Heathcliff. Once I got past a fourth of the book over a few weeks, I hit the fascinating part that starts with Catherine's betrayal of Heathcliff and his subsequent revenge. I finished the rest of the novel in less than a day because I couldn't stop reading until I knew how it ended. The language sometimes is a little heavy and hard to follow, especially in the beginning, but once you read about the tumultuous relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff, you'll be sucked into the story. The characters are all well-developed and realistically flawed, so that you can really imagine this story taking place in another time and place. The love story with Catherine and Heathcliff is probably the strongest and most significant love story I've ever read, for there are so many thing wrong with their relationship -- Catherine can't embrace Heathcliff for who he is even if she does love him, Heathcliff is set on getting revenge on Catherine for marrying Edgar -- but the thing that is the foundation of their whole relationship is a fateful, unbreakable bond."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Did you, or did you not, want to kick Heathcliff and bite Cathy?

Didn't it cross your mind how awfully coincidental it must be to join two complete strangers who are in fact, in no time, 'soulmates', at one point Cathryn even says: I AM Heathcliff. In fact, they feel so much alike mentally, they therefore love eachother beyond the grave. There is never a scene where they actually love eachother physically. I think they are half brother and sister. It would explain so much.....For why would a middle-class farmer come home with a boy, an orphan? And his strong feelings for him, he must be treated as their brother...Well people, that is because HE IS!! They look alike (mentally) too much to be coincidental,unaware they recognize eachother, and not as lovers but unconciously as real family. The extent of their resemblance can only be genetic. The book itself is a masterpiece because it leaves everything in the dark and the reader may guess the real circumstances. When your book is finished, it still 'haunts' you. Please read it and have a nice time with it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am sorry for even hearing about this novel and i am very upset that it was required reading in my high school. It is horrible out-of-date novel about a guy named Heathcliff, and that's where i fell asleep. The description of things in this book take up 8 lines at a time and are unecessary! I don't reccomend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I recently read the novel Wuthering Heights, by Emily Bronte. As a student, I would not recommend this book to other readers. Unless falling asleep after every chapter of a book classifies it as good, Wuthering Heights is only good as a bedtime story. In the novel, it is said that Heathcliff and Catherine are in love, if this is so they wouldn't have spent their times together trying to hurt one another for pleasure. Heathcliff would have not wished that Catherine not rest in piece because she didn't mention him in her last breaths of air before dying (even though she was unconscious). This relationship that the author portrays as love, really is not love. It is more of a hate than anything. Another thing about this novel in which, I did not quite enjoy was its exaggeration in descriptions of everything. It is great to describe things well enough for the reader to create an image on what is happening in the story, in their mind, but don't push it overboard. For example, Liam O'Flaherty an author of short stories and novels uses great descriptions in his works. In his stories, he was able to create a mental image of the story in reader's imaginations, without letting the story get boring, and without over doing it. The thing is in Wuthering Heights, Bronte explained things out far too well and made the story less interesting. So coming from a student, I would not recommend this book to another student."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is supposed to be \\"one of the most famous love stories in the English language\\" (this is what the back flip of the Oxford University Press edition says), but where is the love? The characters are all selfish and self-obsessed, especially that monster Heathcliff, who even tortured his own son to death for he is hellbent on his imaginary revenge. The other characters are not much better, they are all psychologically immature and unstable, relishing on mentally and sometimes physically abusing others. As a book it also has little about the social institutions of the period, the story takes place within two households, which eventually merged into one with a couple of (I would say incestuous) marriages. The characters are also not very believable (for example, how do they earn their living? How did Heathcliff make his fortune in a short three years? The author does not say). They die far too easily from grief and anger. They have just one thing in mind: to hate and torture others around them. They have little interactions with other people except within their shrinking inbred gene pool. They seem more like the manufacture of a mentally ill social recluse, which I think more or less fits the description of the author herself. It is altogether a very dark and sordid story.I think Emily Bronte could actually write, but what a waste of her gift!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I gave this book 4 stars because after having read it 1 week ago I'm still thinking about it. I still can't decide whether I loved it or hated it. Many people think this book to be about love but I think it's about the opposite...hate. Pure evil takes shape in this book in Heathcliff. Heathcliff's obsession with Catherine is palpable and turns him mad with hatred for everyone and everything in his path. This book is dark, cold, unfeeling and wicked. The death can almost be felt and smelled from the pages. If you enjoy books about death, illness, hatred and obsessive love then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"actually, i didn't find this to be the book that it is pumped up to be. I braced myself for an exciting deep love story, tragic..instead i was bored. The style was not for me, I found it difficult to read, and in the end was just plain dissappoited. Maybe my generation is too tained by TV, James Patterson and Danielle Steele for us to appreciate the finer works."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Lockwood, the tenant at Thrushcross Grange, visits Heathcliff his landlord and the latter says \\"walk in\\" in a manner that sounds like \\"go to the deuce\\" to Lockwood. When Lockwood visits Wuthering Heights for the second time the area sees heavy snow and he is marooned there over night with Miltonian ice and snow around him, his hades complete with a half dozen four footed fiends like the hounds of hell inside. Catherine is even pretending to weave some black arts to tease Joseph. So we see that Bronte has painted us a picture of hell at Wuthering heights with, as we shall see later, Thrushcross Grange it's polar opposite. Dante Rossetti said of this novel: \\"The action is laid in Hell, only it seems places and people have English names there.\\"After retiring for the night Lockwood reads the names Catherine Earnshaw, Catherine Heathcliff, Catherine Linton written on a window ledge. This series of names tells the story of Catherine Earnshaw to her relationship to Heathcliff and then to marriage to Edgar Linton, read in the opposite direction it is the story of her daughter Catherine Linton who marries a Heathcliff and ends up an Earnshaw. Lockwood goes to sleep and dreams of going with Joseph to hear a Reverend Jabes Branderham preach on Seventy time seven and the first of the seventy first which was in a book he had been reading, and that Catherine had scribbled in. In a truly funny scene Lockwood is exposed as the first of the seventy first sinner: \\"'Thou art the man!' cried Jabes ... Brethren, execute upon him the judgement written. Such honour have all His saints!' With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim's staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in self-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most ferocious assailant, for his. In the confluence of the multitude, several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces. Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings: every man's hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham, unwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at last, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me\\".Bronte paints in Heathcliff as a goblin that digs up graves and torments the living but she also lets us look a little deeper and we see his torment at the loss of Catherine. Symbolically, I suppose, Wuthering Heights represents Romanticism in decline while Thrushcross Grange depicts the emerging Victorian values. Bronte gives us two main narrators Nelly Dean and Lockwood and we see most of the story through their eyes. Virginia Woolf said \\"It is as if Emily Bront could tear up all that we know human beings by, and fill these unrecognizable transparencies with such a gust of life that they transcend reality.\\" Emily Bronte's numinous and gothic Wuthering Heights compasses a literary zenith as the finest English novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Perhaps it is the signature of excellence that the character reviews of this novel are varying but the accolades given to the novel itself are not.I think the essence of the novel is in the housekeeper Ellen herself who tells most of the story. She herself had a hand in the senior Catherine's death. When Catherine was gravely ill, Ellen believed her to be a hypochondriac. Again and again Ellen speaks as negatively of the senior Catherine as she does fondly of the junior Catherine. Like all the characters, even the storyteller Ellen needs further examination. I, for one, found Heathcliff to be a sad, depressed man with many regrets.This novel is not an easy read, but an incredible one that has some of literature's most intriguing characters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights By Emily BronteThis book is mainly about a love story.A servant,Heathcliff,falls madly in love with a woman that lives in the house,Ms.Cathy.

Wuthering Heights is a work of genius, and a work of art. It is a well-written novel with an original, unique and solid plot, extremely well-done setting, good action, dialogue, etc. All these aspect alone would give the book 5 stars.What makes me say it needs an extra star are the characters. No other novel I know of describes its characters better, or makes them more realistic and belivable. You will never forget Heathcliff. He's a person so set in his cruel ways as to be almost unbelievable - it's hard to imagine someone like that could exist. And yet Emily Bronte pulls it off with her writing. She makes you BELIEVE. And as far as I know, that is the primary purpose of a novel.Don't be fooled by the fact that it's old and a classic. Reading it, none of that is noticeable. The writing is fresh, original, and beautiful. You won't be able to put it down. And when it's finished you'll wish it had lasted just a little longer, like you do when all great novels are done."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the most shocking 19th century novel I have ever read! And even though if the story happened today, the principle characters would probably end up on a talk show, I found it to be highly articulate as well as entertaining!I'm not sure why many people said this was a slow paced book, I found it to be quite the little page turner! The only thing that slowed me down at all was trying to decipher Joseph's speeches, but even that adds a bit of comedy to the story.I feel as though the narrative is being told as one sits eagerly in a sewing circle awaiting juicy details about their boss. I found that even though the double narrator makes me wonder greatly about the reliablity of the story, I also think it adds a great deal of the entertainment! I don't trust the condescending and conceited Lockwood, nor the flighty, biased words of Nelly, but they are what makes this story so great!It's fabulous to see a book that still holds a reader's interest today, (instead of just spouting off long tangents of philosophical thought) to be in the canon of great literature!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I loved the story. It is truly a classic. The story focuses around 2 lovers, Heathcote, a gypsy orphan who is mysterious and Catherine who is bubbly, bratty, spoiled, pretty, and rich. They make a true odd couple.However things don't always turn out as planned. Hearts are broken, hope goes, and mystery surrounds.

But I felt that if I was going to be an English Major I should have some knowledge of this book. This is not the drum I march to. Also, this book does not really match &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; Nevertheless, it is still an important piece of literature. Emily Bronte presents us with very beautiful images. She also offers us deep psychological insights into human nature. She also makes the characters fairly convincing. Emily Bronte also does a pretty good job in helping us to see why the characters act the way they do, and she does keep us in suspense. I can not say I cherish this book, but what I can say is that I am glad I took the time to read it even though it was not assigned."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book must be considered one of the greatest works of fiction ever written. Each character is so unique that I felt drawn into the story. Although one cannot identify easily with these characters, their desires and pain are shown clearly throughout the book and this is part of the reason it is such compelling reading. So compelling, in fact, that I almost couldn't put it down until the heartbreaking, yet very fitting, end."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Really liked this book. It has the strangest characters but in someway, I liked them. I reccomend you read this book. In fact, You've got to read it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What a fantastic book! I already scrolled through the myridad critical remarks, mostly positive, and I did note one fact: the negatives are always hostile and sound like they come from low class and uneducated people."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is little I can add to the body of work devoted to this excellent novel. But who doesn't love Healthcliff - the prototype for all tortured, romantic souls after him. A wonderful read that should be required for all. Bronte, like all great authors, is as much psychologist is she is an artist, and her writing could even be placed quite neatly, if one so wished, under the mantle of the attachment theories that came after her time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"First of all, this is one of my all-time favorite books. Wuthering Heights in general gets 5 stars from me, and there are plenty of other opinions about the story for you to read. I just want to add something about this particular edition, because it made me laugh in surprise when I opened up my package. This edition is very elegant, but it's very different from your average hard-backed novel. It's very compact and the pages are very thin, like a pocket Bible. The only reason I don't like it so much is that since the pages are so thin you can see the ghost of the words of the preceding page through the page you're reading. You get used to it as you read, but I prefer a print of more substance. Other than that, the cover is pretty, it's hard-backed, the pages are edged in gold coloring and it comes with an attached ribbon bookmark. The print is also average sized, so it's definitely readable, and the small size is advantageous if you want to carry it with you in a purse or on a trip."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"These books are wonderful!

I'm glad I bought it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"So I'm definitely a fan of the romantics, Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, and this book by Emily Bronte was by far my favorite bookwise. I was completely submerged in the world that she created and tangled in the emotions and desires of its characters. While I prefer the story of Pride and Prejudice, I wasn't as steeped in the story when I read it as I was with this classic novel about forbidden love. Just don't watch the movie adaptions they are bleh. Even with the handsome Matthew MacFadyen who plays Hareton in one movie and Mr. Darcy in the p&p movie with Keira Knightley. But this is a classic for a reason, read it! I read this paperback by the way"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Charlotte, Emily Bront's elder sister, wrote that \\"Wuthering Heights was hewn in a wild workshop, with simple tools, out of homely materials\\". This makes sense when we learn that Emily Bront did not care for social life (perhaps due to her extreme shyness) and seemed to scorn the outer world, living contentedly in the bleak scenario of the Yorkshire moors where her clergyman father's parsonage was located. Thus, it was with these \\"homely materials\\" - the wild Yorkshire landscape and its dour inhabitants - that she fashioned her only novel, which is, however, anything but homely.... The book is at the same time beautifully passionate and completely spare in its imagery and the depiction of its characters. The narrative is multifaceted and skilfully employs the technique of using several narrators: Lockwood, the naive Londoner who rents a Yorkshire farm in his search for picturesque landscapes; the commonplace and down-to-earth witness to the novel's amazing events, Nelly Dean; Isabella, the scorned and unloved wife; and so on. Each of these characters lends his or her particular voice to the story, thus making it a sort of patchwork where there seems to be no \\"official\\" version - but which is at the same time seamlessly cohesive.One reviewer, surprisingly, goes so far as to say that Cathy married Edgar for the money (she belongs to the same social class as he does - it is Heathcliff, the slum waif, who is the outsider) and that Heathcliff takes the kid Hindley and teaches him to hate his father (incidentally, the boy that Heathcliff takes under his \\"care\\" is not Hindley but Hindley's son, Hareton). In order to be qualified for writing a review, readers should make at least a honest effort at reading and understanding the book.I believe that the biggest mistake that readers tend to make on approaching \\"Wuthering Heights\\", a mistake perhaps fueled by Hollywood, is to think of it as a romance or love story - which it only secondarily is. This is, above all, a family saga, spanning some three decades and concerned with one individual's revenge on the families he considers to have wronged him. It is also a portrait of human passions - love, hatred, anguish and grief - in a wild, desolate setting where the forces of nature cannot be kept at bay.All in all, a work of great strength and beauty. It would have done Emily Bront a lot of good to know that her masterpiece has at last received the recognition it deserves."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"this book has haunted me from the day i've read it. however i'd read it again because it is written so well. Heathcliff and cathy show a love so intense and deep that hatred creeps into those very soulls who once loved more. a story which unfolds gradually, emily bronte has shown immense skill and talent and in the end produced a masterpiece which will never be forgotten.be patient though, it gets too dark and slow at times. but do read it ........its definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Although Wuthering Heights is written in very old english and is not easy to read, the story itself is very touching, romantic and parts of it is tragic.Heathcliff, an orphan, is raised by Mr Earnshaw as one of his own children. Hindley despises him, but wild Cathy becomes his constant companion, and he falls violently in love with her. When she will not marry him, Heathcliff's terrivle vengeance ruins them all - but still his and Cathy's love will not die.This is a book which gets quite intense and the relationships between the characters get quite complicated but it is a good book to read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was required reading for my Senior English Literature (I was 17) and it was one of the many books that I enjoyed that year. It probably helped that I had read &lt;i>Jane Eyre&lt;/i> when I was 12 or so and again in the same English Lit class in high school. It helped me get used to the style and time period. However, as much as I enjoyed &lt;i>Jane Eyre&lt;/i>, I liked Emily's writing and story telling much better.It is tragic story about passion, hatred, romance and a love that reaches beyond the grave. If you haven't already, READ IT!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have read many classics, I am an avid reader of them. I collect them all, and analyze which ones are truly classic. I got this book when I was younger than 10, which is pretty heavy stuff for a child. Yet I focused mainly on the actual misery of Heathcliff and Catherine, I think it is the most engrossing and provocative story ever. I also got nauseous from the constant &quot;happy&quot; storie that other kids were reading. I thought this book suits my deep, &quot;tortured soul&quot; kind of reader. I will always have this book on my top list, it actually is timeless. This book will make you yearn for the open moors and the old manor where Heathcliff falls in love with Catherine. It is the best love story I have ever read. If someone is overwhelmed by it, then I suggest to move to something a little bit more shallow. I know I follow this great example of literature in my own writings, which I hope to have published soon. Not for the impatient reader, that's for sure."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights met my expectations as well as exceeded them. I will admit i was tempted to give the novel four stars because of the difficulty in grasping the intricate intertwining of the characters. BUT I came to realize that the genius in the novel lies within the geniusly thought out symmetrical family plots. Many describe the novel as being very dark, but i , on the other hand, describe Wuthering Heights as being raw and original. Emily Bronte can only be marveled apon. How could someone with a secluded life, much as her characters lived, have such a great insight into these wild, but true characters? Its almost unbelievable, but I now give her respect, just as much as I have for her other remarkable sister Charlotte. Although Jane Eyre is still my favorite novel, Wuthering Heights is not far behind that coveted spot. READ WUTHERING HEIGHTS!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm fond of that novel because it tells you something about the dark side of man and besides that it's also a very profound love story. To be sure it is a really unusual love story because the two main characters never have a relationship like normal lovers have, they only become united after death. I very much liked that Catherine is close to us as readers. She is always present even though she is already dead at the beginning of the novel. But Nelly tells the story of her life and so it seems to the most natural thing in the world to talk about supernatural events and experiences. While reading the novel my feelings changed a lot, once I was very angry at Heathcliff, then I only felt contempt for Linton and his weakness. The novel is written in very thrilling way, you never know how Heathcliff will react next, he is so erratic. Even though Catherine is not an innocent person at all, you can feel with her and you can sympathise with her throughout the story. And although the character of Heathcliff is so mysterious and dark he attracts our attention in a special manner: He descends from a gypsy family and thus he represents the hidden and often violently suppressed sides of man."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights tells the tale of the passionate and jealousy ridden love of Cathy and Heathclif. Fate, social class, and family separates them. The tale has amazing descriptions, themes, and characters. Violence, passion, and envy are all themes in the book. It is inspiring and wonderful, truly intriuging."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The novel, Wuthering Heights, by Emily Bronte was a good story about the love two people have for each other, and how that love is never lost. From the time that they were young children, Catherine and Heathcliff always had a certain liking for each other, that turned into a deep love. When Heathcliff found out that Catherine may have changed her mind, he was crushed and he vowed to get her back. He used other characters to avenge his love for Catherine and to make her jealous enough to come back to him, one example of that is Isabella. The character of Heathcliff is a somewhat of a selfish and savage character, because he does anything to get back to Catherine and to avenge the hate that is shown to him by Edgar and Hindley. The character of Catherine seems somewhat of an innocent character, who is caught up in what to do, and whether money and status is more important or true love is more important to her. Heathcliff's return to his true love causes problems with her and shows that love can be painful and cause agony sometimes. The characters in this novel were well developed and characterized, which is important to me when I read a novel. I think that the novel Wuthering Heights shows the ideas and opionins that Emily Bronte had about love and how it can effect the lives of people. I found this to be a pretty good novel, a little confusing at the beginning though. I, however, in comparison liked the novel, Jane Eyre, by her sister Charlotte, better."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel has touched me deeply since first reading and I have enjoyed it many times over, again becoming engrossed in the characters with each new read, yet each time finding something new. A true classic. It is a little sad, though, that this great book averages four stars, the same rating as many of the comparatively poorly written, more contemporary but soon-to-be-forgotten fiction reviewed on this site. Not that one should confine oneself to reading classics, but at least recognize them for what they are."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights is an excellent story of love and hate. Both love and hate are powerful forces, but Bronte shows that loves conquers all in her book. I enjoyed this book and gave it a ten because Bronte shows that two people can be brought together in life and death. This book never has a dull moment once you really understand it, and from that point on, you fall in love with all of the outgoing characters. One woman is torn between love of a man and his money and love of a soulmate. Just because the soulmate is not rich, she will not marry him, and then starts the hate and jealousy. Even though the girl could not be with her soulmate in life, they are together after death. Bronte overall shows how revenge can drive a person to their graves, and how love always overcomes hate. -G.

Even though I didn't fall head over heals for the book, there are some aspects of it that I happened to like. As on page 230, where Heathcliif put Liton and Cathy out of the room and Linton feels the full affect of his rage and illness as &quot;his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushing from his mouth, and he fell on the ground&quot;. The fact there was blood in the excert didn't make it an eye catcher, but the fact that it was so well described. The way she wrote it made me close my eyes and visualize Liton at a door have an attack. I said the book was interesting as well as dull. The dullness happened to come at the very begining when Mr.Lockwood was the narrarator. The issue I had at the start of the book was the fact that the long and drawn out details of the kitchen. On page three, Emily Bronte took all my energy out of finishing the book. It seems as if she spent years reasearching design, and decided to put it in the book. She describes the floor &quot;of smooth, white stone&quot; the chairs as being &quot;high backed, primitive structures, painted green&quot;. Just to give you a taste, I only chose to write a few descriptions. but the book is filled with what seemed to me endless dribble of description."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Dear Readers, I found Wuthering Heights to be both depressing and uplifting in different ways. This book took very sharp turns in the charactor's lives. I found that this was what made this book so interesting. It is hard to explain my feelings on this book without giving away the ending, but I would recomend this book to every young adult. This book is about personal choices and in a way about moral values. The way that one person can learn from their elders. I feel that every young adult should read this book before going on their own."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though Wuthering Heights was well-written and captivating, the plot line left a bit to be desired. The love, lust, revenge, and hatred all added up to a story resembling a soap opera. While the novel did present a powerful love story, it was one that fueled manipulative plots of revenge. Even so, the book was enjoyable. But eventually, the positive aspects of the novel were overshadowed and it became difficult to continue reading because of the layered plot. Bronte was a great writer, but her characters were merely two-dimensional entities whose goals in life were the direct result of love or hate. The story seemed somewhat unrealistic, simply because the characters seemed to represent extremes. So, while Wuthering Heights was very well-written, it didn't keep my interest. So I give it a rating a little above average."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Bronte's _Wuthering Heights_ is a decent book about a man named Heathcliff who did not get to marry the girl he loved, therefore he dedicated his life to making everyone else as miserable as he was. This book had a few unrealistic parts and was not always practical, but it did have a pretty good plot line. I did not like the way Bronte made her characters so naive and how she made them have no common sense. I am glad I read this book and would recommend it to other people if they like confusing love stories about people who don't like each other.

Like the idea of marrying your own cousin was something i thought of as nasty, and would never happen. But after reading this book my views chang, but I still find it wrong. The book starts off slow and boring, but the middle of the book gets alot better. The love that Catherine and Heathcliff have for each other is something almost magical. But then the book has a cruel plot in which they never get a chance to get married, or really a chance at love. Like when Catherine quotes &quot;I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don't talk of our separation again:&quot; (Bronte 74-75). This love story ends in a cruel twist of fate for them, but Heathcliff plans revenge after he can't get his love. So for the rest of the book you get a chance to witness Heathcliff's evil heart at work, and his revenge on the Earnshaw's and Linton's."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte contains a complex, confusing and unreal story. Bronte begins with the end of the book, thus making readers think backwards in sequence. Also, Catherine and young Catherine become harder to tell apart as the story progresses. Bronte refers to both girls as &quot;Catherine&quot; and &quot;Cathy.&quot; Another baffling subject, the coincidence that the second generation coincides with the first. Catherine, Heathcliff and Edgar's relationship corresponds to Cathy, Hareton and Linton's relationship. Also, was it per chance that young Cathy's birth and Catherine's death lie on the same day? Bronte utilizes the first generation to model the second, making the story predictable and not interesting. Carrie Chandler"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights, to me, portrays a sorrowful story that shows the thin line between love and hate. Throughout the book the characters would reveal their love for one another; then all of a sudden, they would betray their loved ones. Like when Linton would express his love and gratitude for Cathy, and then quickly despise her when Heathcliff tells him she only wants him for his money. Heathcliff's attitude also changes. His impressions and appearance seemed very nice to young Cathy at first when they met at Wurthering Heights (199). Heathcliff also kidnaps her and Nelly, and strikes her (247). I also believe that Heathcliff did not start all of the problems. Cathy brought her woeful death upon own herself. She did not follow her heart; she should have married Heathcliff instead of Edgar. Isabella shouldn't have been so dumbfounded about marrying Heathcliff so quickly without really getting to know his true personality. For a while the book seemed kind of dull, and did not make any sense at first, but once I reached the apex of the story it seemed to get pretty interesting.

However the hate and darkness in the book pretty much drowns out the love story. Most of Heathcliff's hate is derived from Catherine's love but most of his actions are very severe. I believe the reason he acts like he does after Catherine's death is because he is without his &quot;soul.&quot; Death pretty much occupied the whole book. Almost everyone died and it caused people to act in strange ways. As strong as Cathy and Heathcliff's love was, I believe that Bronte's obsession with death and revenge drowned out this love. Again I pose the question, Why on earth is this book a &quot;classic&quot;?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Upon reading Wuthering Heights, I rate the book a 3 from 1 to 10. Such a low score relates to the long, drawn out wordiness on insignificant parts to the story. Over exaggeration of minor details really confused me in this book. The book made me think that a long, drawn out explanation of a minor detail such as Mr. Lockwood's description of Catherine's library as &quot;... select book choices,..&quot; delapidated &quot; (16) was important but as I completed the book, I realized it was just another attempt to go on and on. I feel if this book became a play people would say it is melodramatic and boring. The plot did grab my attention ( I must admit), and for that reason I gave the book a 3 instead of a 1. However, I think Bronte really &quot;messed up&quot; a developed, intringuing story line with insignificant details that gave readers the idea that the point contained a hidden point that one might find later in the book or one people needed to know. I mean, Who cares how Catherine kept her book collection. The story contains a completely different plot!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When it was first published, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" elicited strong criticism. Although Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" also received its share of negative criticism, it was not as markedly disliked as her sister's book. As time went by, the pendulum swung in the opposite direction, and it was Emily's book that eventually came to be hailed as superior to Charlotte's, particularly as the 20th century got under way.I have read the book three times. It was part of a high school English Lit assignment. To be quite honest, I could barely stomach the book back then. It was too strange, wild, and terrifying to me. The second time I read it, several years ago, I was much older. Thus, I was able to appreciate its masterful prose style and brilliant characterizations. In fact, it was these two factors that kept me reading until the very end. The same thing happened a few months ago. Once more I was hypnotized by this horrible tale of people whose lives went so very wrong. It was one character in particular who exerted a rather puzzling pull on me - Heathcliff. I read almost against my will, hoping against hope that I would be able to find some good quality in him. Of course, I vaguely remembered the plot from the second reading, so I knew that I would not find any such thing.This book, in its entirety, is about Heathclif. It's about how the abuse he suffered at the hands of his benefactor's son, Hindley Earnshaw, twisted him into a demonic caricature of a human being. As such , it is definitely not a pleasant read. However, it does serve as a testament to Emily Bronte's genius. That such a hideous creature sprang from this young woman's imagination is nearly unbelievable, considering her background. Something dark and cruel stirred in the nether recesses of her mind. M. L. Von Franz, a Jungian analyst writing in \\"Man and His Symbols\\", edited by Carl Jung, mentions Heathcliff, describing him as Emily Bronte's animus, the masculine part of a woman's psyche. The animus can be evil or good. Heathcliff is demonic indeed. Bronte brings him to life with great vividness, and this undeniably displays her great talent for making a character truly live in a reader's mind.Therein lies the rub. Heathcliff is so repulsive, so utterly demonic, and so overpowering, that he makes the book sheer torture to read. His influence is seen on every page. The one redeeming quality he might have possessed, his love for Cathy, turns into a monstrous, sick obsession toward the end of the book.While I can admire the powerful way the author delineates character, as well as her obvious command of writing style, I simply cannot say that this book is one of my favorites. I find it especially strange to see it referred to as a love story, and tagged as \\"romance\\" on Amazon. There is little to none of that in this novel. The supposed love story between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw is sketchy at best. They are separated for three years, due to her stubbornness, as well as his pride. When he suddenly reappears, determined to see her, she is already married to another man, one whom Heathcliff despises as a weakling, due to his passionless nature. Yet it is that very man who treats Catherine with kindness, catering to her every whim. Had she, instead, chosen Heathcliff, things might have been very different. Such a tumultuous relationship could very well have ended in tragedy. Had Bronte taken the story in this direction, the book could, indeed, be classified as \\"a dark romance\\". As it stands, however, it certainly cannot, nor should it be.Catherine Earnshaw herself is not a wholly pleasant character, either, although she never descends to the depths of depravity Heathcliff does. She is, however, a very self-centered creature; her sole reason for marrying Linton is so that she won't be brought below her station by marrying Heathcliff. She attempts to rationalize her decision by claiming that she can use Linton's money to \\"help\\" Heathcliff, but this is a rather flimsy excuse.Through Heathcliff, this also becomes a tale of family dysfunction, and of how that dysfunction poisons anyone who comes into contact with that family, whose most disturbed representative, Heathcliff, engages in a very elaborate plan of revenge throughout the latter part of the book.Allthough, again, the writing is brilliant, the book does have one major flaw, and that is the plotting. Characters are killed off when they are no longer necessary. Now, I do agree that a writer has to include sad and unhappy events in a novel, even if he or she is writing within the parameters of the modern romance genre. However, having characters die every few pages or so is just too contrived. Even Cathy's death is contrived. It's designed to make Heathcliff even more of a monster than he already is. Besides, there is no clear explanation for her death. True, she had gotten herself into a state of near hysteria due to auto-suggestion, but this is hardly enough to cause anyone's death; at least, not as suddenly as hers comes about. It's just not believable. Furthermore, the reader finds out, after her demise, that she was pregnant! She very conveniently gives birth, too, before she inexplicably departs from this world. This seems to be a rather forced way of increasing the pathos.Other reviewers have objected to the narration-within-a-narration technique Bronte uses. Actually, I found this quite intriguing. This is one of the elements about the book that actually maintained my interest. Nelly Dean turns out to be a very shrewd, highly perceptive observer, with an especially keen eye for nuanced detail.I was glad that poor Hareton got a chance at love with Catherine Linton. That was another element about the book that I liked. Still, their union is also a bit too contrived, since they happen to be cousins.All in all, although I do recognize the greatness of Emily Bronte as a writer, I have to say that I consider her sister's novel, \\"Jane Eyre\\", far superior, with a more polished plot structure"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If I were to go back and read a Bronte book, I would readJane Eyre. For 85% of Wuthering Heights I thought, This is just a book full of miserable people. I can't sympathize with any of them. I almost stopped listening (it was an audiobook) a few times. But...1. It has a lovely ending.2. It has an interesting narrative structure: The whole story is narrated by Mr Lockwood, who observes very little of the action firsthand, instead hearing most of it from Nelly (the story within a story) who hears key parts of it from other minor characters (the story within a story within a story!).3. The best of the characters love to read. How can I not sympathize, at least a little bit?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My daughter had to read this book over the summer for school.

Amazon--please fix."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is without question one of the darkest and most enigmatic classics in English Literature, you will find a miriad of opinion on the book. I for one think it's a great character study, and Bronte's prose are singular. At its heart this is of course a love story, but a brutal one. Heathcliff, is one of the most famous or infamous characters in English Literature, he is truly an enigma. His relationship with Catherine, and its consequences are of course the crux of the novel. Heathcliffs love for her is all consuming, you keep waiting for him to say, I wish I could quit you. Their love is at once beautiful and at second glance toxic. Everybody should read this book, whether you love it or not, I assure you it will stay with you..forever."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This story is very well written and told. It arrived in great time and shape."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Would you like to become acquainted with one of the greatest love stories of all time? Did you know there is an occidental answer to Dream of the Red Chamber, with that same kind of passion so intense it borders on hatred and madness? Would you like to hear a live performance of a really FUNNY novel, with slyly ironic or blackly comical vignettes every few pages? Or perhaps you're in the mood for a quintessentially gothic tale, an epic ghost story spanning generations? Wuthering Heights is all of these things and more. (For instance, one of its most remarkable features, instantly lost in any so-called \\"film version,\\" is its wonderfully intricate narrative structure, quite on a par with that of a Joseph Conrad novel such as Lord Jim or Victory.)Now, who on earth could read WH properly so that all those nuances and overtones might be brought together in a single performance? Michael Page and Laural Merlington, that's who! These two are perfectly attuned to all the qualities that make WH a masterpiece.(And no, there is no technical flaw to worry about. That reviewer was confused by the exotic settings required for playing back the audio cassette version, I suspect, although ostensibly she was reviewing the CD version, and that made the negative remark doubly weird, a true non sequitur. I've owned the audio cassette version for several years, and I just recently bought the CD version too. Either way, the recording is a treasure. If you love literature, buy it! If you're not sure what literature is all about, buy it! Then you'll see.)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the only novel by Emily Bronte, one of the three English Bronte sisters. Emily lived for just 30 years: 1818 to 1848.I bought and read this Penguin Classic version of Wuthering Heights. It has a good preface by Lucasta Miller, author of \\"The Bronte Myth,\\" and it has an introduction by Pauline Nestor, who has written two books on the Bronte sisters including \\"Charlotte Bronte' in 1987, and a related book \\"George Eliot\\" in 2002. I read the analysis after reading the book and I recommend that you not read too much about the details of the story until you have read the book. I read the book after reading \\"Jane Eyre\\" and \\"Shirley.\\" I read the three books one after the other.\\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte has touches of Dickens and Jane Austen in a fictional biopgraphy of a young English woman. That novel is more conventional in plot and structure and it is a compelling read. It was a big hit in 1847 and was a much bigger and more popular novel than \\"Wuthering Heights\\" - published the same year in 1847. Both sisters used male pseudonyms. The present novel has become more popular and better accepted with the passage of time. Even today, \\"Jane Eyre\\" remains as the more popular novel, but now there is a strong appreciation of what Emily Bronte has created: it is an unusual piece of literature. Some think that it shows much more originality than the popular work of Charlotte.In short, Emily Bronte has created a horror book which is mostly grounded in reality. The characters have the problems within themselves. There is nothing unusual or super-natural in the book. The novel is short and concise. It is a well written and entertaining novel. But unlike most novels, it is hard to have sympathy with any characters. One likes certain people in the book because they are not as bad or as outrageous as some of the others. I guess we could say the protagonists are Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw. The latter is somewhat sympathetic while Heathcliff is a man with serious problems. All in all it is very convincing.Also, Emily Bronte uses the story within a story technique: it is a narrative told by a housekeeper with the beginning and closing chapters used to form the story and bring closure.The novel is slow to start but most who can get through the first 100 pages will be well rewarded.I highly recommend this Penguin Classic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I confess that most of this book was completely over my head. There is a lot of passion in it, but it was a little to deep for me. I guess I'm more of the Jane Austen type. I'd recommend it to anyone who is intrigued by hate and dark passions."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My friend lent me this book, and at first I didn't want to read it, but I am SO glad that I did! One of my favorite parts is where Cathy is explaining her love for Heathcliff--&quot;Nelly, I AM Heathcliff!&quot; and the part where Heathcliff and Cathy are reunited. This book is one of the best i've ever read. Sorry I can't quote more extensively, but I don't have a copy handy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I love this book. I love this book. I love this book. It is a story of human nature. I think we all know people like the characters herein in real life. Wuthering Heights is the apotheosis of the classic. I know two people, very close to home like Catherine and Heathcliff who never reached union in this life. There are so many undercurrents to be picked apart in Wuthering Heights. I chose the relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine for my research paper. But there was the weather, and how it mirrored all the actions of all the characters in the novel. This is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was loathing this book, hating the heroine. Catherine Earnshaw is the most hateful and irritating woman in English Literature. Then, thankfully, around mid-point, Catherine Earnshaw does the reader a favor and dies, leaving the book to Heathcliff. The second half of the book, in which Heathcliff returns to exact his revenge, is one of the most gripping tales I have read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Since the age of 17 I have read this novel 6 times and I must say from the first time I opened its pages I was hooked. It is a story of the true love and true hate that is inherent in all human nature that engages its readers deeper and deeper with every word. Almost every character in the novel is both loved and hated by the reader at different times, and I always find myself longing for the reunion of Catherine and Heathcliff no matter how many times I read the story. Emily Bronte was an author well before her time, and I have read nothing so far that even compares to the beauty of this novel!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is by far the best book I've ever read. The important thing is that you read it slowly so you don't miss any important information. I cried several times throughout the story. My feelings towards the older Catherine and Heathcliff went back and forth throughout the book, but for the most part I liked Catherine and disliked Heathcliff. I like the way history repeated itself with Catherine's daughter and Hindley's son. It was a good way to conclude the story; it gave a feeling of things coming full circle."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A delicious book to read. Full of meaning and symbolism, I do wonder why no one else had understood this book at all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"At times the reader despises a character in this book, the next minute he/she loves him/her (and vice versa)! All characters have flaws: Cathy's haughtiness, Edgar's wimpiness, Linton's peevishness, Heathcliff's evilness, but these flaws only make the characters more interesting.Take Hareton and Heathcliff for instance; both posses a strong and profound character instilled with a certain degree of pride, and both posses the potential for becoming good or evil. Heathcliff becomes revenge-driven because he once had been loved and his love is taken away by Edgar, who is not even, according to Heathcliff, capable of being loved: &quot;I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued Edgar Linton's attachment more than mine. If he loved her with all the powers of his puny being, he couldn't love as much in eighty years as I could in a day...It is not in him to be loved like me; how can she love in him what he has not?&quot; Heathcliff is angered because he knows Cathy still loves him but is wasting her love on Edgar, who doesn't even deserve her love and is making her worse by trying to care for her: &quot;He might as well plant an oak in a flowerpot and expect it to thrive as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares.&quot; When Heathcliff was loved by Cathy, he had the potential to become good, but when he is deprived of her love, he becomes evil.Very engrossing book!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is perfect in every way.

A MUST!!!(I had the advantage of having the dialect explained at the end but even if you don't it is still extremely enjoyable) even though most of the characters are cruel some despite of that have an inner remorse. the book delves deep within the characters minds and presents them so well.

Not so! Not so! The novel encompasses a broad range of subjects amongst which the most profound is the effects of prejedice on humanity. Throughout the book, which basically, once started, takes three addictive days, themes of love and hate protrude from the pages. Though a first-person narrative, the novel becomes for the majority, a recollection of events in the past as dictated to the narrator. I assure you, once you read this book, you will relate to these words: pity Heathcliffe!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel brought me to tears...It proves that love for some people, is never meant to be.

It is a shame that this is Emily's only novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When you read it, make a chart showing the relationships between the characters, arranged in three rows (one row per generation). Also be alert for her intelligent, subtle, and pitiless sense of humor (&quot;Joseph's head appeared in the window.&quot;).The book works on all levels, including eloquent and sometimes beautiful prose (check out the last paragraph first, which won't ruin the plot for you). It will get re-read by me more than anything else except maybe Shakespeare's &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.I wish I could have had the privilege of having the friendship of the author, who was an accomplished pianist, famous in her neighborhood for her bread, and once beat a dog senseless with her bare hands."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The writing is not half bad, the language flows well. I'll agree with other readers, it's hard to tell who's leading the narrative. It's also hard to tell the relations of the characters until quite a ways into the book.

I'm glad I read it, but only because it kept me from buying it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Even though Emily and Charlotte are sisters, it obvious who the better writer of the two is, Charlotte. I chose this novel for my 12th grade students to read and I decided that I would never again read it. It takes too long for everyone to realize Heathcliff is a jerk. I think that if anyone is interested in reading the Brontes to read Charlotte. If anyone is interested in reading literature from that era, read Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte, one of the Bronte sisters, (the most famous being Charlotte, who wrote Jane Eyre) wrote a classic Gothic romance, chalk-full of the emotions and pathos that a tragic romance encompasses. As a literary work, it is well written and at paar with Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. This audio book, narrated finely, with a delightful box cover, makes a striking Valentines day gift for women. The story is set in the lush, dark moors of northern England, and centers around a wealthy family and the doomed romance of Catherine and Heathcliff. Catherine comes from a well-to-do family, set in their ways, and all of her societal expectations are heavy on her shoulders. She falls in love with Heathcliff, a deep, spiritual, soulful love, but unfortunately one that could not be consummated. Heathcliff was taken into Catherine's family as an orphan. Heathcliff and Catherine's love, described in the most romantic of terms, is so strong that there is one scene in which Catherine calls out to him in despair, when she is married to another man for his status and convenient position as a powerful family friend, and Heathcliff is able to hear her from his distant stance.The novel is Gothic, although there is no supernatural going-ons and the usual horror that can be associated with Gothic novels. It is a novel full of the dark despair and tragedy of two lovers who can not be together. The character of Heathcliff, in particular, cannot be considered heroic. He is brooding, he is dark, he vows revenge against those who have taken Catherine from him. Likewise, Catherine cannot fulfill the profile of an innocent, hopelessly romantic girl. She is instead, a vain, egotistical and bourgeois materialist, marrying a man for his money and not for his love. But although the immediate situation that occurs with Heathcliff and Catherine, Heathcliff's subsequent vendetta and extraction of revenge are the darkest aspects, the promising and more idealistic love transpires between their children (eventhough they are children of other parents). With stunning narration and a classic feel to the whole thing, this makes a perfect gift on the day that celebrates romance and true love- Valentine's Day."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Haven't read it yet -- downloaded for future reading. . . . . . . . . . . . ."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Downboaded to read on a trip.

It is moments of surreal force like these that make people love or hate Wuthering Heights.With so many reviews, I'll add a little. This is fiction to the extreme so WARNING reading W.H is like stepping into a giant colorful painting with abstract and realistic elements.Heathcliff (contrary to popular belief) is not the star of the show. Every character is allowed to bloom to the extreme and make you wonder if they lived to the full.Even with five stars over this review...I have an issue with the book it was and is still unsettling. In fact almost everyone except the two narrators...a tenant at the Grange and the housekeeper Ellen Dean...have either horrid language and seemingly do not care about their lives or anyone else's or they have other huge irksome problems.Also...the free Kindle ed. does not include translations of phrases or any special introductions or additional information."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In Wuthering Heights, two families are caught in a destructive cycle of love, hate, and retribution. At the center of it is Catherine, a proud, headstrong girl, and Heathcliff, an orphan adopted into Catherine's family. Catherine and Heathcliff are both romantic iconoclasts who defy convention. They prefer roaming the wild moors over the life of high society. They enjoy mischief and detest christian morality. Their love is one of passion and rebellion. Even though they are very immature, they are admirable in that they are true to their own natures and want to live lives of joy and ecstasy. In one insightful passage that illuminates the theme of the whole book, Catherine says that she dreamed that she was in Heaven, and she was so unhappy there that she begged to come back to earth. The angels kicked her out and she wept with joy to come back to Wuthering Heights, her home on the wild Yorshire moor. Even though these characters behave despicably, we can't help sympathize with their humanity.Wuthering Heights is a criticism of Christian ideology. Catherine and Heathcliff are full bodied, complex, emotional characters. They are both repeatedly referred to as wicked, devilish, heathen, selfish, coldhearted. But they are also genuine people with the courage to live in accordance with their convictions. It is this quality that makes the two \\"good\\" characters, Edgar and Isabella Linton, fall in love with them. Edgar and Isabella, raised as gentry, live as they have been dictated to. They are irrisistably attracted to these two individuals who don't care what society thinks of them. Heathcliff and Catherine glow with pride, passion, strength and health. While Edgar and Isabella are hollow and anemic. The other Christian character, Joseph, is hypocritical and debased.The landscape of Yorkshire is a character in itself described with immense appeal. In the winter, it is bleak and wild and hauntingly beautiful; with wind that moans with the voices of the past and moonlight that sparkles on the snow. In the spring and summer it is halcyon and exuberant, bursting with flowers, birds, breezes and green growth. We understand why Catherine and Heathcliff love it so much. The name Heathcliff itself references the heath of the moor and the cliffs that the two children were so attracted to. Heathcliff is the embodiment of the moor, the earth, and all that is real and sensible, all that Catherine loves and dies to be separated from. Wuthering Heights exalts the earthly realm over the heavenly realm that conventional ideology would have everyone aspire to.As sensitive as Wuthering Heights is towards these flawed characters, it is also a cautionary tale. The love that sustained so much joy and passion in Catherine and Heathcliff is also a love that destroys them. Catherine marries a wealthy, kind man who loves her, but she cannot look past his dull exterior to love him. She is consumed with her obsession with Heathcliff, wastes away pining, and breaks the heart of those who love her. Heathcliff, embittered by Catherine's choice, wrecks havoc by plotting an elaborate revenge on the second generation. His love for her fuels his hatred of everyone else who has a claim to her. While the story could be interpreted as the tragedy of thwarted love, it could also be said that had that love been consummated, it would have been just as destructive, just as dysfunctional. While Catherine and Heathcliff believe themselves to be deeply in love, it can hardly be called love when all they do is hurt each other and make everyone around them miserable and wretched.Wuthering Heights is an incredible novel. The language is resonant and fluid, the characters are complex and vividly brought to life, the atmosphere is masterfully invoked. It is discomfiting, moving, and challenging. It is really an ingenious piece of social commentary revealed through a love story. It is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The old classic that I had never read but have seen the movie many times.

It's quite slow-paced, as you might expect from such an old novel, but it's never boring.[SPOILER ALERT]It seems like pretty much everyone dies in it, it's natural death after natural death; the story would have been very different with modern medecine! It's easy to like characters one minute and detest them the next, plus it's quite difficult to grasp who is who initially; don't make the same mistake as me and look at a family tree because it sort of spoils the story when you find out who gets married etc.[END OF SPOILERS]It's a good story, and the final few chapters are very intense and fast-paced. Worth a read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is a classic and introduces so many themes that are prevalent in literature today but I find myself disliking the novel itself. Bronte tells the story of a man who is renting a room and learns the story of the man who owns the house and the neighboring property, Mr. Heathcliff. This may be the only novel that I've ever read in which every single main character is utterly unlikable: from Heathcliff who is cruel and sadistic to everyone except Catherine, who is shallow to her husband Edgar, who is proud and weak, to his sister Isabella, who is naive and immature, to Hindley, who is nothing more than a vengeful little boy who grows into a vengeful man. His son, Hareton is tolerable though he is depicted as stupid. Then we come to Cathy who is a spoiled little brat. Even the man original narrator, Lockwood, comes across as pretentious. The only redeeming character in my eyes was Nelly, who is flawed but loving. That being said, the novel is so well written and presents it's characters in such a light that you feel like you know them. The prevailing message seems to be that no matter how fall someone has fallen, they can redeem themselves with love. Not sure that I believe this but I can't deny that Bronte work prevails as a masterpiece of literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book as a teenager and felt so accomplished for making it through, what I considered to be, a very archaic book.After having just finished reading the book again, I was very torn about how \\"good\\" I thought this books was. It is indeed a very dark and brooding tale with mostly unredeemable characters leaving one to question why a person could be so vindictive.However I realized that while I didn't care for the dark and abusive topic, I absolutely loved the writing style, the grammar and the point of view that the story was told from. I also realized that as a teenager I saw this as a fictional tale and probably thought, naively, that people as cruel as Heathcliff just don't exist in this world... Why ever would a person spend all their energy and machinations on making everyone around them miserable? Indeed, why.I gave this book a four star rating, not because the tale was enjoyable, but because it offered so many epiphanies on how I regarding the experience of reading it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a fabulous book for a fabulous price. cant go wrong!

The book grabbed my attention immediately and was an easy read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to read this in high school (16 years ago), and I remember it being a much easier read at the time than it is now (for me). Although I love Bronte's extreme detail of setting the scene or describing the garb that her characters wear -- the old English writing is definitely something that took me a bit of getting used to. I re-read several parts til I absorbed what what being said or who was saying it.The story of Heathcliff and Catherine is definitely an amazing one, and was the reason I chose to do this re-read. With so many references in 'Fifty Shades of Grey', and that character's love for old English writing I chose to re-read this classic & keep it on my main page of my Amazon Kindle for easy access to read it, refer to it & mull over.It is a classic re-read, but if you are not used to the old English you may want to use the dictionary on the Kindle and look up some of the 'lingo' that the Brontes were so famous for using.All in all, it is a great book with deep rooted characters, unrequited love, anger, and jealousy -- and much more that I do not want to give away. For that, you need to acquire this classic for yourself!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Violent, gory, sexy, passionate, wild, untamed, exhausting, tragic, sick, but ultimately forgiving. And written by a parson's daughter living in the barren Yorkshire moors.How much of this novel is sexual fantasy and how much is experience? It's impossible to tell. There's no explicit sex in the novel, but we can say it's nothing but implicit sex. It's not about love or hate, it's about two people who've made themselves into a single being. Catherine Earnshaw of Wuthering Heights can neither love or hate her adopted brother Heathcliff: he and she have become part of each other, in their soul and in their flesh.If Wuthering Heights has a tragic element, it's not a conventional one: the moral of the tale isn't that one should resist one's animal impulses. Quite the reverse: Catherine and Heathcliff are one and the tragedy unfolds because of Catherine's decision to disregard her irrational but unbreakable bond with Heathcliff. Just as Catherine should have embraced a life with Heathcliff, maybe we should embrace our animal nature.Emily Bront is a woman of her time and her prose reflects this, yet there are scenes of intense physical violence. Where could a sheltered young Victorian woman have gotten the experience to write of these feelings and actions with such authencity?One of my very favourite novels. I first read it over 25 years ago, in Yorkshire as it happens, and I just read it for the fourth time, again in Yorkshire. A true work of art.Vincent Poirier, Montreal"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I finally read this classic after many years of intending to. My only exposure to the story was the film starring Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. About halfway through I'm thinking....was the movie this dark? Why do I not remember Heathcliff being so ruthless? Well, turns out the movie version I saw only covers the first half of the book (as I learned through Wikipedia). I imagine the filmakers found second-half Heathcliff to be so unlikeable that even the dashing Olivier could not redeem him.The book was immensely compelling literature, and frankly I tore through it, but I had a hard time sympathizing with Heathcliff's unsatiable appetite for revenge. The second half of the book is like \\"My Name is Earl\\" in reverse. \\"Hmm, who wronged me and how can I avenge them? Hindley? Check. Edgar? Check.\\" It overshadowed whatever love there was between he and Catherine. Not to mention that Catherine was by all accounts a spoiled, unlikeable brat.So 4 stars because it is a fine piece of literature, but wow....not what I was expecting. Dark, dark, dark. Not that dark is inherently bad (Anna Karenina and House of Mirth end shall we say, darkly, and they are two of the best books on earth), but I think I'll stick with Darcy and Elizabeth for my romantic leads."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As someone who is long out of high school, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Wuthering Heights (and properly this time!)One literary critic I read somewhere said that the sheer number of characters is deliberately confusing. Certainly, it doesn't make it any easier that there are two Catherines. Nor the frequent use of surnames, rather than first names and vice versa, quite interchangably.Like many reviewers before me I found many of the characters thoroughly odious and of moral outrage. Why Nelly Dean doesn't just leave them all is a mystery to me.One thing I found of great help to my understanding of the book was to paste a clearer copy of the family tree to the inside-front cover of the book. I found this on page 308 of The Scribner Companion to the Bronts by Barbara and Gareth Lloyd Evans. The marriages and births are clearer and far more readable.I also felt the need to take notes from a number of other literary critical works on the book to get my head around the whole plot, the characters, themes, imagery and Haworth landscape.Perhaps for the most serious among us there is a concordance to Wuthering Heights! This is great for those doing a paper on some certain theme found in the book, who want to find all the references to that topic all in one place. If you are wanting to find it: A Concordance to Bront's Wuthering Heights by C. Ruth Sabol and Todd K. Bender, Garland Publishing, Inc. New York/London, 1984, Garland Reference Library of the Humanities Vol. 428.Thoroughly recommended. It only loses a star because I would have enjoyed something slightly less complex, which is really just a reflection on this poor reviewer, rather than Emily Bront."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to study this book a few years ago and i think it was the novel that opened my eyes to all classics. The Bronte sisters are among my most well loved authors and Emily's Wuthering Heights top the list. In fact, my book was so often read I had to glue the cover back on when it fell apart.Wuthering Heights is a deep dark novel full of revenge, passion, love and hatred. I have once heard this book called 'dry' by someone who clearly hadn't read it as Wuthering Heights is so far from it. Heathcliff spends his whole life seeking revenge on other characters right from when Mr Earnshaw brings him home from London. However, it cannot be said that he is the only character seeking revenge. In all of the subplots one character is avenging his/herself on another.Lockwood is among the silliest men ever written about, he is right up there with the bumbling Mr Collins of Pride and Prejudice (another favourite). Lockwood is the only character to whom anything of humour happens to, providing the reader with some light comic relief. Having said that, the violence which taints all characters has not passed over Lockwood who tries slitting the wrists of the ghost of Cathy .The numerous allusions to the devil and supernatural were still a controversial subject, especially for a woman, to be writing about at the turn of the century and Emily Bronte was berated by many for writing such a book. However, without the references the book would lose so much of its full force. Heathcliff would not exist except as the evil man he is.Somehow I love the people in this book but I could not tell you why. The only characters who I find myself disliking are Linton and Isabella, however they are the only ones with any sense of goodness surrounding them. I suppose the reason I love the others is for their passion and love for another.This is the greatest of all the great classics and if you find it hard to catch onto do yourself a favour and persevere. I found it difficult the first time I tried to read it and now it's a favourite"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book aloud to my wife 23 years ago. At the time, I was working as an apprentice at a winery on the Rhine River. There was an old medeival castle across the river from our room. It was the perfect setting, as we two were the only English speaking people in the town. I think now is the right time to review the book, because I can only recall the feelings left behind by this powerful work of literature. Most of the plot and many of the characters have been long forgotten, leaving only the residue of strong emotion. I have read many works of powerful fiction by the world's great authors since then. But not one of them affected me emotionally the way this extraordinary tale did. I remember one gray German morning finishing the chapter where Heathcliff digs up the body of his beloved Catherine because he has gone mad in his desire to hold her close once more. And then off to the Altenkirch Schwanenkellerei I went. I spent the rest of the day working quietly in the cellars of the winery, deep inside the mountain with mold hanging all about, and brooding over the maniacal behavior of these highly romantic, insane characters. I've never been able to completely shake the feeling. There is something so entirely timeless about this work, as though it were a piece of ancient literature, old far beyond the 1840s setting, something so utterly classical and piercingly primordial, it's as though you already had the genesis of this material in your DNA and it only required this story to bring it back to life within you. You recognize the spell it weaves because it speaks to the humanity in you so clearly. It is as though you have been secretly drugged. The English language has rarely been utilized as well as it has here, and I dare say you would need to go back to Shakespeare to find its parallel. Romanticism reached its high water mark with this novel. Ms. Bronte has now become immortal because of her creation, and in the Pantheon of world literaure, she stands among the Titans. If you are a native speaker of the English language, you can hardly consider yourself educated if you have not read this astounding novel of romantic love and uncontrollable passion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have had Wuthering Heights in my possesion for 2 years and could at first only get past the first few pages.I bought it after reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. As soon as I got into it and got to know the characters of Heathcliff and Catherine I couldnt put it down! I found myself staying up till late at night just to see what would happen next and trying to study for a test but ending up opening it and getting totally absorbed in the plot and characters. I guess it is a curse to love books sometimes, and weird to make bad grades because of them at points. Get the book it is great for men and women! My dad loves it! Heathcliff is a very strong male character that boys will enjoy. And Catherine is a very real woman character and that girls will enjoy because she is far from perfect and has a nasty temper but the men in her life adore her anyway."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a very disturbing \\"what goes around comes around\\" type of story. I personally think that you can have a negative look at the story or a positive look. While reading this book I felt bad for poor Heithcliff, who was treated terribly as a child and fought his whole life to get his revenge. However, at the same time I hated Heithcliff for the pain that he caused everyone while getting his revenge. The setting is a very important part of the story. I think the reader is made aware of the darkness and evil mood of both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. As I was reading the story I could easily see what the author intended me to picture in my head. All I could see was darkness simply because everyone is just sad and depressed as though they hated their life and wanted to die, which just laid the way for all the tragedies, heartaches and most importantly, betrayal. They all sat around all day and had nothing to do but engage in silly drama.Even though the plot was clear I would have to say that it was rather hard to keep track of all the characters. If anyone has read this book they know exactly what I am talking about. In physics when they talked about how \\"every action has an equal and opposite reaction\\", they definitely must have had this book on their mind! In the beginning we meet a character named Earnshaw who adopts a child named Heathcliff. Heathcliff unintentionally makes Earnshaw's true son, Hindley, jealous. The trouble starts when Earnshaw seems to have more of a connection with his adopted child than his own. Sadly, after Earnshaw dies Hindley takes his revenge out on Heathcliff. For years Heathcliff has to live under his older brother's thumb, which makes the plot thicken. Heathcliff then devotes his whole life toward seeing that he gets his revenge for the way that he has been treated. Wuthering Heights is indeed a classic. However, this book goes too deep into description about certain things and the wording is a bit hard to understand. After I read the book I needed the cliffs notes so that I could fully understand specific things. This book is full of pure evil, which is why I do not recommend it for any lighthearted reader. It is more for anyone who likes a tale about wicked love and sweet revenge."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In such situations, it is customary to start out with a &quot;good and the bad&quot; scenario. So here goes.The good: This book has a complex plot that keeps you interested for the most part. The characters are believable (if somewhat twisted), and the setting is appropriate: a creepy old house in the Moors of England. Heathcliff is a maniac with a likeable streak (mostly it's just sympathy). Catherine is unbridled, wild and cruel. But it seems the narrator (Nelly) is a bit too perfect.The bad: The plot can be a little too complex at times, and it's hard to follow. And the first four chapters... don't even get me started.I'm still giving it five stars because, in the end, it was worth the sometimes boring reading and slow pace. This book is definitely a classic that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The story is narrated mostly by Nelly Dean who used to be a servant at Wuthering Heights but now has a job at Thrushcross Grange, another estate. The main character of the novel is a boy named Heathcliff who is an orphan brought to Wuthering Heights by its owner, Mr. Earnshaw. He has two children of his own named Catherine and Hindley. Heathcliff is soon favored over Hindley by Mr. Earnshaw. A bitter rivalry develops between the two boys which is only intensified later by the death of Mr. Earnshaw. Meanwhile Catherine and Heathcliff fall in love and it is this relationship which dominates the book.Catherine and Heathcliff meet the Lintons who own Thrushcross Grange. Catherine is welcomed by the Lintons but Heathcliff is excluded. Heathcliff disappears for three years because of a misunderstanding. During his absence Edgar Linton and Catherine marry. After his return Heathcliff's obsessive love for Catherine and his desire for revenge against Edgar provide all the necessary ingredients for a real tragedy.WUTHERING HEIGHTS can be looked at as a story about love and hate or good and evil. The characters are complicated and interesting. The literary quality of the novel is very high and it is easy to see why Emily is considered by many to be the best writer among the Bronte sisters."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a timeless classic, which will be enjoyed by generations to come.

A delight to the eyes and hands!Let's face it: Clarendon edition wasn't nice-looking, with a price tag of one third of the US Gross National Product. The Franklin Mint Editions (say the 1979 one) is a very fine item, but it has no introduction and the only notes are the well-done glossings of the dialect tirades. Barnes&Noble; hardcover comes near to parfection at a slightly more popular level, but their text is 1900 Haworth Edition, with its uncredible paragraphing and quaint distorted dialect, with some C.K. Shorter idiosyncracies for good measure.SO, LONG LIVE THE PENGUIN CLASSICS HARDCOVER EDITIONS, AND LET'S SEE IF OXFORD FOLLOWS SUIT (I fear not). By the way, a good signature-sewn paperback with flaps and good, durable paper would do almost as well, but there is almost none in the Anglo-American market."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is truly the definitive \\"epic\\" novel. The animated, wild mental scenery, the perplex love/hate relationships, and the extended tale of two generations. Its story is so dramatic and wrenching it almost borders a soap opera, but luckily Emily Bronte's writing skills and character dynamics protect it from ever being comparable. IThe plot revolves around a possessive, yet unconsummated relationship between the two main characters, a gypsy boy named Heathcliff and the daughter of a respected family, Catherine Earnshaw, and branches off into the consequences of a love too wild and profound to be controlled. A love triangle ensues involving a wealthy neighbor who wishes for Catherine's love and her hand in marriage as opposed to Heathcliff's instability. Her choice influences all the events to come and lives are ruined in the midst of the storm created by a passion too deep to renounce. With its dark themes and violent characters it is considered by many to be the original Gothic Romance novel.Upon its first publishing, the story was considered too harsh and the characters vile, and was rejected by many readers in the early 19th Century. Emily Bronte, having been born and raised amongst the moors and the people bred of it knew no other way of life at the age of seventeen when she wrote this novel.Ultimately, it is the wild and uncontrollable nature that makes the novel so affecting and believable, capturing your heart and your emotions. It drives you into feeling what the characters experience with it's descriptive writing and you then know what is the essence of the story. The book is a work of art made from minimal environmental resources, with the mind and the soul sculpting it into a true representation of love's ability to conquer hate."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is an absolute masterpiece, and I feel confident in saying that it is the best book I have ever read. I'm stunned that the average rateing is not five stars. This book is an amazing work. It was written by a woman who never married and yet her description of the vivid passion that exists between the hero and heroine in this book is so passionate and moving that you almost feel as though you can't understand the raw, almost jealous need they have for one another. It reverts to basic animal instinct. She creates characters that you love one momment and hate the next. These are real humans, not representations. They are flawed in every way that they should be and yet they are the ones you sympathize with. They truly are three dimensional, with all the motivations of love, greed, lust, jealousy, and anger that every human being must deal with. If the characters are not enough to convince you of this novel's superiority, all you have to do is look at the actual construction of it. It's like an onion, starting with Mr. Lockewood as the narrator, then Nellie, and eventually even Heathcliff and Cathy speaking to one another in the white hot core, the climax of the story. The two love triangles, emulating each other through generations, the first a tragedy, and the second resolving the fault of the parents with true love succeeding. It is absolutly fascinating how intricatly and beautifully the story is constructed to tell every aspect of the characters. This novel is so moving. It faces every aspect of ourselves as human beings, at the best and the worst of our capabilitys. It may have been written long ago, but it still holds true to problems we face every day. What emotions do we allow to motivate our deeds? That is the real question that this book asks. The images, and the lasting feelings continue long after you have finished the final haunting paragraph. That is why this is the best book I have ever read. If you think I'm simply babbling, all I have to say is read the book yourself. It will be like nothing you have ever read before."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There is a thin line between love and hate, and once Heathcliff crosses it, we see a grand, passionate and absorbingly interesting man turn into a fearsome thug. Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village.Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, \\"Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?\\"Sound depressing? It's not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one's heart, rather than one's head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off.Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That's the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place.Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher's daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Often held up as the standard of the classic gothic novel, Wuthering Heights is, for the most part, a showcase of emotional savagery and a dismal portrayal of the human heart. Not well received when first published under the pseudonym Ellis Bell, Emily Bronte went to her grave believing that her one and only novel was a complete failure. A subsequent edition, edited by sister Charlotte, was released after Emily's death and became a worldwide success.Everyone has heard the name Heathcliff, and that must be due to his being surely one of the vilest, most hateful literary characters to ever exist on a page. An unidentified foundling who is brought to the Earnshaw home as a young boy, Heathcliff is forever painfully aware of his lack of identity and culture and lashes out at everyone with whom he comes into contact. For awhile, his dearest childhood ally, Catherine, is his one sanctuary, but in time he begins to hate her almost as much as he loves her. From that hatred is born several generations of misery and pain, as Heathcliff devotes his entire existence to ruining Catherine, her family, and everything she ever held dear, and no one is immune from Heathcliff's wrath - not even his own children.Most of the story is told as a look-back by aging housekeeper Nelly Dean as she relates the whole sordid tale to Mr. Lockwood, a tenant who comes to Wuthering Heights to rent for a short time and becomes curious about his angry, tormented landlord. The past soon fuses into the present, as Heathcliff's revenge continues to plague both his and Catherine's hapless descendants.As dark and depressing a story as it appears on the surface, Bronte's unfettered examination of the twin emotions of intense love and equally intense hatred is powerful, and stays with the reader long after the last page has been turned. It's nothing if not a poignant and eerie lesson in the damage one person's tortured soul can wreak on everyone around him. I found myself much more affected by it than I thought I would be. Recommended for any fan of classic literature, particularly the gothic era of the 19th century."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Love sometimes encompasses the dark component of obesession and this obsession is beautifully and hauntingly explored in Wuthering Heights, perhaps the most intensely original novel to emerge from 19th century England. This is the story of the passionate love between the wild Heathcliff and the reckless Catherine Earnshaw, both inhabitants of the Yorkshire moors. So passionate, in fact, are Catherine and Heathcliff that their love is doomed to tragedy rather than to fulfillment. When that does, indeed happen, Heathcliff, one of the most original and fascinating characters I have ever encountered, spirals ever downward into a morass of self-destruction and obsession. The symbolism in this novel is rich and complex and not so easily recognizable as one might first suppose. The presentation of the duality of human and non-human existence are deftly explored. Catherine and Heathcliff are violent figures striving in vain to identify themselves as ordinary human beings while disrupting all around them with the voraciousness of their appetites. Both ultimately disintegrate from within due to the passion out of which they are made. These two wildly intense characters stand out all the more sharply when contrasted with the simple ordinariness of Nelly Dean and Lockwood. The novel's central question, of course, concerns the meaning of Heathhcliff, who is both diabolical and yet, at the same time, irresistible. The power of the novel, does not, however, reside solely in the interpretaion of its theme. The setting, the relentless elements of the fire, wind and water of the moors only serves to deeepen and reinforce the intensity of the story. The language, although archaic, is poetic, reflecting Bronte's brooding personal vision. Extraordinary effects have been achieved with a remarkable power of formal organization and a brilliant handling of the time scheme. While encompassing the most domestic of scenes, this novel still achieves the depth of an ancient tragedy. Unforgettably haunting and beautiful in every way."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Having read a number of books in my life, I must say I was not convinced this was one I could enjoy when it popped up on my mandatory reading list for my first year in university.How wrong one can be.Ever since Catherine visited MR Lockwood on that stormy night at the Heights, I have been completely spellbound by this novel. I have tried to rationalize my affection and utter amazment over this book, but I have so far not succeeded. To give a reweiv with any kind of substance when it comes to the theme of this book would be pointless. After having read the book over and over again,and having watched the movies made about it, I still cannot tell you what this novel is really all about. Don\`t get me wrong, the plot is easy enough to follow, but the underlying drama is something that keeps haunting me. Maybe that was what Emily Bronte wanted. For the reader to put down the book and forever be spellbound by what he or she had read. I know I am.Maybe, in our sedated worlds, we long for this kind of emotion, this kind of passion. Not just in our love lives, but in our lives in general. The story touches timeless subjects, it erases the line between heaven, hell and the world we know. It might even suggest that heaven and hell are right here on earth among us all.It is utterly compelling and I would recomend it to anybody. Give it a couple of chapters before you judge it, and I asure you it will be the reading experince of a lifetime.This publishment is even more rewarding because you can read the different analysis of the book in the Critical Edition part of the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read what the self-proclaimed &quot;immature&quot; reader wrote, and I beg to differ. I love this book not because I'm supposed to, but because I just do. The austerity of the language, which you term &quot;dull&quot;, is what sets the whole tone for such a troubling work. I doubt that Bronte set out to write a classic romance; I believe she was denouncing the sins of her characters. This novel is multi-faceted with its never-ending parallels: two houses (Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange), two love stories, two heroes, two heroines, two narrators, etc. The inexplicable love that two heartless people like Heathcliff and Catherine share is fascinating to say the least. When Catherine cries out, &quot;Nelly, I AM Heathcliff,&quot; I'm sure many a girl's heart has thudded in her chest. This book sweeps you away to a place and time far removed from us and gives us a view into a harsh and distant world. You don't have to like the book. But don't be so dumb or immature as to assume that no else does either. The longer you study literature, the more you'll see that some books have passed the test of time, because, well, they're just that damn good."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I picked up a copy of Emily Bront's classic after being very much impressed with her sister Charlotte Bront's novel Jane Eyre. However, while I did find much to be meritted in Wuthering Heights, I also feel that it fell short of my hopes. The story initially focuses on the lives of Catherine and Heathcliff, childhood sweethearts forced apart by their families. Catherine marries another man, vainly thinking she can love and be loved by both Heathcliff and her husband Edgar at the same time. As an act of revenge, Heathcliff married Edgar's sister Isabella. What ensues is a dark and stormy emotional battle between many very troubled people.Catherine dies halfway through the novel, starving herself to insanity and death when she realizes that the two men in her life will not share her and instead demand that she make a choice. She leaves behind her a daughter of the same name, young Catherine. Heathcliff and Isabella in turn produce a son, the weak and sickly Linton. The remainder of the novel concerns the love affair that develops between Linton and young Catherine, and Heathcliff's violent, vengeful manipulation of their lives.I thought the book was very well written (as it ought to be, to have achieved a rank among classic literature), and I was able to read it with no trouble. Some of the words and terms are a bit antiquated, but someone familiar with works of the time should not find these too daunting. Though keeping a dictionary close at hand is a surefire way to avoid trouble. Bront has excellent word choice and creates very vivid imagery. My one criticism of the writing itself regards the manner in which Bront has chosen to express dialects. The Yorkshire accent of Heathcliff's servant Joseph (and later of young Catherine's cousin Hareton) is nearly impossible to read, with phrases like \\"ut's soa up uh going\\" intended to mean \\"who is set on going\\". My copy of the book has an appendix that \\"translates\\" the most incomprehensible of his words, but it is a great irritation to constantly flip to the back (sometimes several times per paragraph) for explanation, and even the notes there do not decipher everything.The found the story itself to be profoundly disturbing. Wuthering Heights undoubtedly contains one of the largest collections of mentally unbalanced characters I've ever come across in any novel. It is choc full of sadists, masochists, and otherwise troubled and violent personalities. The whole book has a very dark, opressive feel about it, and there were times I found it downright unsettling. I must tip my figurative hat to Bront for her skill in creating atmosphere and invoking feeling in her readers.However, the storyline is a bit weak in my estimation, as the characters' feelings about and behavior toward each other is often quite illogical. The different culture of the time can explain some of this, but there remains, I believe, a general unrealistic quality about the plot. Why, for instance, would Catherine and Heathcliff have ever fallen in love in the first place? Their childhood attraction is easy to explain as the passing fancies of the very young, but their relationship as adults is more troubling. Heathcliff is moody, egocentric, obsessive, and extremely violent; Catherine is vain and naive, narcissistic, and given to wild emotional tantrums when she does not get her way. What would posses anyone to fall for either of the two? Even harder to understand is the timid Edgar's proposal to Catherine. She abuses him repeatedly, mentally and physically, and yet he claims to love her. Why?The next generation of characters is equally unbalanced and ill-matched. I think young Catherine is probably the only main character with some claim on a sound mind, though even she is not without issues. Though she is intelligent and generally strong-minded, she is for some reason a complete pushover when it comes to the frail, sniveling Linton's outbursts of self-pity. Even when Catherine herself recognizes Linton's problems and appears to have lost her romantic interest in him, she still obeys his every whining command when there is no incentive whatsoever for her to do so. Heathcliff is even more violent in the second part of the novel than the first. He physically abuses nearly all who cross his path, including his own son, taking his only pleasure from the misery of others. Another relationship that raises questions in my mind is Catherine's attraction to young Hareton following Linton's death. Catherine has been brought up as a proper young lady with manners and education, and Hareton is a slovenly, shadowy figure whose speech is as difficult to comprehend as the servant Joseph's. The two young people seem to have absolutely nothing in common.On the whole, I recognize the literary merits of Wuthering Heights - as I said it is very well written and invokes strong reactions in the reader. The character development is excellent, even if those characters are mentally and emotionally unbalanced in the extreme. The book explores the themes of love, jealousy, and obsession, and provokes thought. However, it is by no means a feel-good book and I can't say I'd recommend it for recreational reading. This one is probably best left in the academic discussion circles and not brought home to read before bedtime."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Of all of the audio books of Wuthering Heights, this is my favorite. Janet McTeer brings the characters of Cathy and Heathcliff to life and fully captures the wild passion and pain of the novel. The Patricia Routledge audio play is quite good, as well, but if you are looking for a reading of the complete text of the novel, this is by far the best."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you ever find yourself trying to read this novel, please do it with an open mind. I started out with some very narrow tunnel vision and gradually, I accepted the fact that this story is about 18th century British Hicks. And when you figure this out, the story unravels into something absolutely amazing. You find yourself drawn to Heathcliff, even if he is troubled and deranged. You find yourself wanting a happy ending and wanting a little more from the characters. AND, Heathcliff does surpass Hamlet or Othello as the most troubled romantic lead character of all time. Long Live Heathcliff!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This story was a bit hard to follow. It skips around a bit and if not followed closely, can become confusing. Wuthering Heights is set in the late 1700's to early 1800's. It is centered around two people madly in love. Catherine puts her love for Heathcliff aside to marry the wealthy Edgar Linton. Heathcliff cannot deal with this rejection and runs away. A few years pass and he returns. Upon his return their lives are turned upside down because of their unyielding love. Heathcliff brings revenge upon anyone that had wronged him prior to his leaving. This story shows the destruction that can come from uncontrollable love. Revenge, jealousy, and death are all results of a love that was never given the chance to fully grow.There are some similarities between the author's life and the story as well. One that is immediately recognizable is that the female characters all die after giving birth, as Bronte's mother did. Another similarity is the drug addictions. Bronte's brother was addicted to opium and had a drinking problem. Hindley, Catherine's brother, takes to drinking after his wife dies."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I thought this book was tragic in that two people who obviously love each other very much and have so much in common that they actually refer to themselves as the other person, end up spending most of their lives in other relationships trying to make the other lover jealous or hating their choices. Ultimately, Heathcliff's desire for revenge was hard for me to understand because I suppose I have never loved anyone enough to go that far. And the end was especially tragic because he actually begged Cathy's ghost to haunt him for the rest of his life: &quot;...drive me mad! Only do not leave me in this dark alone where I cannot find you.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights tells the story of the impossible love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a foundling adopted by Catherine's father. Wuthering Heights is the name of the spacious dwelling of the family, located on the desolate moorlands of England. After the death of Mr. Earnshaw, Heathcliff finds himself constantly humiliated by Catherine's brother Hindley. When Heathcliff assumes wrongfully that his ever growing love for Catherine is unanswered he sees no reason to stay and leaves the moorlands in search of better luck. Returning years later as a wealthy man he sees an opportunity to get revenge on his stepbrother, but neglects the intolerable pain he causes to his one an only love. Caught in a spiral of vengeance Heathcliff ruins everything once dear to him.The sole novel Emily Bront (1818-1848) has written in her short life will undoubtedly continue to stand the test of time. Although I myself am not a big fan of novels that write Romance with a capital, this story has touched me in a way that very few have succeeded in before. The powerful description of the unrecognized energy between the two main characters is simply overwhelming. Although Emily was -in the true spirit of Victorian novelists- clearly not afraid of adding an enormous list of extremities to the character of Heathcliff, this embodiment of boundless revenge and pure fatherly despotism is one of the strongest characters ever created in English literature. The fact that not a lot of people will classify this novel as \\"the greatest love story ever told\\" is most likely due to the never ending grimness of the tale. This darkness is nicely illustrated by the high number of deaths weaved into this family epos. But then again, love is not always as nice as in the movies... or is it?For a real romantic this is truly a book to be treasured forever."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had avoided Wuthering Heights because I thought it was purely a love story and a corny one at that. Pleasantly surprised is a tremendous understatement. This was fantastic. There is no scene - in the book at least - with Heathcliff and Catherine running into each other's arms across the moors. That must have been from a sappy movie version. In fact, there are no scenes like that - no mindless romantic drivel at all. The preface of my copy actually said that the book was not that successful during Bronte's time because the characters were altogether \\"too odiously and abominably pagan to suit the tastes of even the most shameless class of English readers\\" (as stated by the Quarterly Review).It is certainly dark. Wuthering Heights is the story of Heathcliff who, spurned by Catherine, wreaks havoc on the lives of everyone who has ever had anything to do with him, covering three generations. Is it a love story? Well, yes ... sort of. Catherine did passionately love Heathcliff (as he did her) but nothing ever comes of that, at least in the traditional sense. The extent of Wuthering Heights being a love story to me is the inevitable question of \\"If Catherine had married Heathcliff would things have been different?\\" Given the almost demoniacal personality Heathcliff bears throughout the book, I hardly think so.If you have only ever seen the movie, you have only heard half of the story - literally - and that is extremely \\"brightened\\" from the novel's intrinsic dark and spooky overtones. This is one of those books when finished, I found myself wandering around saying, \\"Wow, that was a good book\\". I even waited a few days before starting another."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's literary masterpiece proves a Gothic novel of classic proportions, with characters whose twisted passions etch themselves upon the reader's mind over successive readings. Set in the rugged Yorkshire of her childhood, WUTHERING HEIGHTS depicts a literary canvas of desolate landscape, where Nature ranges from fury in winter storms to indifference to human endeavor. Over the course of three decades we gradually learn the strange personal history between the Earnshaws of WH and the Lintons of Thrushcross Grange. This grimly violent tale of human passion and supernatural revenge reveals the devastating effect of a dark-skinned foundling lad who is adopted into the family of a kind country squire. With this charitable act Mr. Earnshaw unwittingly introduces restless energy and unbridled emotions into the placid neighborhood--ultimately destroying the decaying dynamics of relations between neighbors. Genealogies are rewritten as unleashed jealousy threatens the flow of lives yet unborn.Recounted in extensive flashback sequences by a faithful servant, Nelly Dean, to a recuperating new tenant at the Grange, this twisted story is also taken up by subsequent narrators--since no single character witnesses very event at both houses. Two gentlemen chose to reside in a remote region, to escape wordly distractions, but the arrival of a young, gypsy-like orphan, Heathcliff, proves the catalyst to disrupt their comfortable social decadence. His passion for Cathy, the wild daughter in his new family, would rule him for life--ruining himfor Life itself. Neither teen could live without the other, although she defied her heart; in so doing she destroyed the lives and peace of mind of innocent relatives and neighbors.Pursued by his private demons of despair Heathcliff knows no peace or valid existence apart from her, tormenting everyone in his intense, constricted social sphere. From foundling to Master, his morose moods and vindictive nature throw a pall upon both houses, as he conspires to control that which is not rightuflly his. All because he was denied sanctioned union with Cathy, his soul mate. Sowing a legacy of vice and despair, Heathcliff privately strives for reunion--not closure--with the shade of his other half. Chasing shadows he morbidly controls the destiny of those involved at Wuthering Heights, threatening to engulf even the detached outsider. A Gothic Classic for all ages."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Having had this book as an assignment in college.... I must say the years have given me a deeper appreciation of it. I really tripped my way through it as a freshman. But now over ten years later I am liking this one more and more!The story centers around poor Heathcliff and his sister/ loved one, Catherine. Heathcliff has lived a life of struggle and woe. He has been disadvantaged and mistreated. Even when he is saved by Catherine's father and brought to live with them he is still, disadvantaged. He is tortured by Hindley, Catherine's brother and made to live a life of pain and anguish.When Catherine leaves home and marries Edgar Linton. Heathcliff become even more tortured as the person he loves is taken from him.This story is one filled with regret, longing and revenge. We see Emily Bronte's excellent rendering of the corruptness of human nature... and in Heathcliff we can see a human going to the depths of depravity and hatred. The scarey thing is that we can... if we look hard enough see a little of ourselves in him too.The novel is dark and foreboding, just like the windswept moors it takes place on. The mood is expertly rendered by this genius author.When you read it allow yourself to be swept away by it's darkness and get caught up in the atmosphere.That was the draw for me and I'm sure you'll will feel it too.Excellent Book!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is the classical novel dealing with undying love and loss. Set on the moors of mid-nineteenth century England it tells the story of a love between the orphan boy Heathcliffe and Katherine. Katherine and Heathcliffe fall madly in love with each other, but there love is not to be as both end up marrying other people. However, their love for each other continues even after their marriages and after their deaths. This is a love that cannot be stopped by death and endures forever.In Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte wrote of one the classic novels of the nineteenth century. Her characters are well done and the story moves along at a pace that draws in the reader and won't let go. The story is told through the eyes of Katherine and Heathcliffe's nanny, Mrs. Dean, as she tells the story to man who has rented out part of Heathcliffe's property. Mrs. Dean's perspective is always humorous and one almost wonders how much of it has been changed to cover over her own role in the events. It is a testimony to her characters that by the end of the book you will end up hating some of the characters. I personally could not stand, Isabell's son Linton - he was whiny, selfish, pain in the a*s and I was routing for Hareton to beat up him up.The only slight problem with this book is it was written in the old style popular during the nineteenth century - at times this makes the reading some what ponderous. In particular, Joseph's dialogue is a labor and in order to understand it I had to almost read it out loud.Wuthering Heights is a wonderful story about two people who love each other so much that nothing can stop their passion. It is a story as old as time and that will endure until the end of time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Not to be hyperbolic, but Wuthering Heights is one of the most well known and critically acclaimed novels in the English language, and there is precious little that I can add to the volumes already written on it. It is the story of two British households inhabiting the wilds of the Yorkshire moors, and illuminates the destructive undercurrents that come to uproot and ultimately destroy both clans. At the center of the tale stand the headstrong Catherine Earnshaw and the brooding Heathcliff, one of the most celebrated romantic pairings in world literature. Treated abominably in his youth at the hands of both households and having lost his love to another man, Heathcliff descends into a horrifying abyss of brutality and revenge still harrowing to encounter nearly two centuries after publication. Although the novel progresses at a leisurely pace compared to modern works, it presents the most complete and thrilling portrait of passion ever set forth in the English language. Passion is not a synonym for love in Wuthering Heights-it is an unbridled conflagration consuming all rationality and rendering its victims ravenous beasts, terrifying and magnificent in their hunger. When Catherine declares that her soul will roam the moors forever after her death, even the most confirmed atheist will find himself believing her- passion is such a billowing force in Wuthering Heights that the human body is convincingly rendered a prison of something altogether greater. At the same time, the primordial forces the book presents never become exhausting, contained as they are within a highly unique narrative framework channeling them through characters secondary to the main line of action. For those patient and courageous enough to immerse themselves in its richly textured reality, Wuthering Heights presents a world boarding on the mythic, and it comes highly recommended to the imaginative reader."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Perhaps it's the winsome imagery, perhaps the profoundly real characters one switches between loving and hating, or maybe even the dry humor that is the style of the British, but Wuthering Heights is my all time favorite book. How can words possibly do it justice...the only way to surely judge it is by reading it. Never before have I been so moved by a story; it might be Heathcliff's overflowing love for Catherine that drives him mad yet, ingenious in his revenge, or Cathy's shallow duty to society that denies her the power to be true to herself (I believe the main point of this novel is to not deny your feelings; go with what you feel rather than what should be), but I always find myself reading it on days I need to be cheered up or am really lusting after a good book. If one's not paying attention, you know, one of those days where you just read to take your mind off of something, it can get rather dull and confusing (the diction isn't as simple as say...Ethan Frome), but if you're concentrating, Bronte's words are so amazingly beautiful, it's hard to put it down. When read aloud it sounds like Shakespeare, and I like Emily's work a lot more than Charlotte's, for some reason. Gothic literature is so peculiar and wonderful: a class of it's own, and she really masters it. At the same time she avoids stereotypes and entertaining happenings (the spectre that appears to the somewhat insecure Lockwood early on foretells the chilling story, while at the same time hinting there is something deeply wrong about Wuthering Heights that needs to be corrected), actually writing the book with a purpose behind it. All the characters have very cool qualities about them; all have the potential to be irritating, but hey, we're all human. By imperfecting her people she has perfected the novel, and I'm so thankful I've had the privilege to read such a piece of art. This book forever remains with me; it's a part of me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I believe Wuthering Heights to be just an average book hardly capable of any noteriety. The book seems to be the same old story of a vengeful man who takes his anger and hate out on other people in a useless effort to please himself. This deep inner hatred results from the untimely death of Heathcliff's lifetime love, Catherine. The reason I gave this book a three was because it was so difficult to follow. Bronte used the same names and the same situations over and over and I could never understand who she was talking about. The theme of Man vs Man was overly developed with the continuing acts of hatred from Heathcliff. I reccomend you read this book if you want to avenge something or you withold a deep hatred for someone. EMILY SMITH"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a strange ,but powerful book. Revenge is most likely the dominent theme in the second half of the book. Even though Heathcliff abandons his plan for vengence. There is no traditional happy ending for the principal characters in the book. It was also brought out that it was a spiritual love rather than a physical one the binds Heathcliff and Cahterine together. There is also a theory of crime and punishment. All the characters sin in some way and are punished, with the exception of cathy and Hareton. Another would be conflict between good and evil. The difference between the feeling that Catherine has for Heathcliff andthe one she has for Edgar is that she responds to Edgar only on the more superficial and shallow level. She seems aware that this love is far more important than the civilized and wordly advantages that Edgar offers. Despite this she goes against her natural instinct and marries him anyways. This action turns the good in Heathcliff to evil, taking revenge on everyone except Cahterine. This tears her up and her only option that she looks for is death. After many years he finds his revenge dying away and prepares himself for death and reuniting with the spirit of Catherine soon after. Love is the only element that remains constant. Everything else withers away. It boils down to nothing on earth matters ,but when we are dead and merge with the Almighty Being then shall we see our greatest satisfaction. The power of good is stronger than the power of evil and will eventually prevail."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to read Wuthering Heights in my 8th Grade English Class last year, and I thought that the book was brilliant! It is filled with love, passion, deceit, greed, and everything in between. A word to the wise. Be willing to spend some time with this book. You will thank me. Wuthering Heights isn't something that you just read over the weekend, you really have to put some time into it. This has to be one of the most complex books I've read in a while, and its complexities is what makes it brilliant"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Very often Wuthering Heights is represented as being purely a great love story between Catherine and Heathcliff. This, in my opinion, is far from the truth. It is a classic book and there is certainly a great deal of passion in it, but it is about a great deal more than just the love of these two charachters. It is also about the wild moors and the people they produces, about how evil propagates itself and how ultimately a little bit of compassion can overcome years of hatred and mistrust. Read this book, but not just because you think it's going to be a beautiful love story.

But, instead of whining about it Heathcliff does something about it, thereby makeing life miserable for everyone (including himself) but by doing so keeps his love alive, instead of just moving on.

How masochistic are we?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The achievement of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne is an unprecedented phenomenon in English literature. I've always thought of what lessons could modern parents learn from the raising of the Bronte sisters, in years when education was not a recognized priority in women's life, and yet no girls of the Bronte family was left behind. Amazing, wasn't it?It is unnatural to review this book without comparing it to Jane Eyre, another masterpiece of the Bronte sisters. I tend to put both of the two book in high rank, regardless of critiques from different directions. Jane Eyre is admirable for the ambition that is high but not wild, the emotion that is heated but not burned, the action that is courageous but not aggressive, and the totality of natural elegance and inner nobality. While Wuthering Heights is the opposite to the extreme. In WH, the ambition is wild but not high, the emotion is burned before it get's comfortably heated, and the action is often violently aggressive yet not courageous. The boundaries of humanity is ignored, the nobality is not admired or even hated, and the anger is allowed to vent at any cost.Said that, it is a great worth to read for the craftsman of the storyline and the superior language skills. It depicts deviated, obsessive, violent, and destructive personalities that need psychiatric help in my opinion. If it is just for the sake of reading a good novel, I would give WH and JE the same score. However, due to the fact one can not realistically seperate the entertaining effect from educating effect of any literal work, I would like to save the highest score for the truely and entirely best."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Nowadays, if we want a good edition of this strangest and strongest of British novels, deeply haunting and intensely poetical in its rather dark and eerie otherness, we have a variety of options, both text-oriented editions or context-oriented (\\"study\\") ones.To name them all (see my overall review on the Norton Critical Fourth Edition (Dunn)): Oxford World's Classics (Patsy Stoneman), Penguin Classics (Pauline Nestor), Oneworld Classics, among the text-oriented ones;Longman Cultural (Alison Booth), Broadview Press (Beth Newman), Norton Critical Third or Fourth ((Sale)/Dunn) among the context-oriented ones.But when it comes to choose a good-looking hardcover volume, it turns out to be an impossible task to get the right text with an adequate annotation (it seems as if nobody cared for it!).Oxford's World's Classics Special Centennial pocket hardcover issue, now very hard to come by, is a most lovable volume and features the Clarendon reference text, but we add a rather unperceptive and dull Introduction to an absolute absence of notes to get as a result a perfectly useless edition.Barnes & Noble is a really nice hardcover, together with a good Introduction (Daphne Merkin) and a very good annotation (Tatiana Holway), but theirs, while a reliable and well-known text (Haworth Edition, 1900), is a 1850 second edition text, that is to say, Charlotte's highly tampered-with posthumous edition, further disfigured at the hands of the Publisher. Many people think -as I do- that thistext-form is a no-go.Now we come to the Franklin Mint 1979 edition (and its version for Oxford University). It's a very beautiful hardcover volume, leatherette on boards that really looks at least like bonded leather, with all edges gold-gilt, with an excellent125 gram per square meter almost opaque paper (without mineral loading);an excellent quality two-color printing with 11/14 pt Linotype Garamond type and ornate chapter initials. It features the beautiful if not daring Alan Reingold five double-page lithographs with its photographic-like impact...And then what? The text -forgetting for a moment Clarendon and its derivatives-is a very good 1847 first edition text (in the line of SCHORER's, Moser's and Daiches's editions), and it features -for the first time in the novel history- a full and right footnote glossing of the dialectal tirades.Any misgivings? O...yes! Two little ones:a) the Charlotte prefaces should come at the end of the novel rather than at the beginning, not to condition our reading, andb) there is no modern good introduction to the novel (and there were by then a great deal many very good to excellent ones from where to choose); and a very big one:c) the absence of any note whatsoever other than the dialect glosses.Now, it's up to you to choose (and, should you go for this, do a little looking around to get the best preserved copy within your budget).Within its constraints, it's a very nice book and an interesting buy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"How odd that Amazon does not consolidate the comments on the various editions of this book from different publishers.I read this book out of a certain sense of obligation -- I'd been reading other 19th century English literature and, with some trepidation, picked up Wuthering Heights to complete the set. The book was wonderful, with fully developed if sometimes quixotic characters, and rapid and often unexpected plot twists. The prose is denser than, say, Jane Austen, but not as bad as the stereotypical gothic novel. The main character, Heathcliff, is famously attractive to women but, as a male reader, I thought he was a thoroughly bad egg. Worthy of discussion, though, especially with women who have read it and are likely to have a different opinion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though this story overall had a dark essence to it, I believe that an unrelenting passion was shared between Catherine and Heathcliff. Of course, in my view, both characters are selfish and share a fury in great magnitudes. But then again, these similar characteristics are what make them such a match made in heaven...or more accurately, a match made in hell. Even with the hatred, I still believe this is a great love story. Love can be shrouded in varying shades, from happy gay tones to the more darkening hues.The greatest burst of sunshine in this dreary novel would probably come fron Nelly Dean, who was practically the only character with a head on her shoulders. Just the fact that she was able to serve with such a crazed family for so long and come out sane in the end is and indication of her strong, noble personality.In this story, the line between hatred and love is precariously thin."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What an amazing insight to the harshness of those times.

Note that the initial description of \\"the book\\" is actually a detailed review of an Audio CD version referred to as an adequate abridgement.

The tone of the romantic movie is nothing like the book, and the series is much closer only if you've read the book and can fill in the blanks in your mind. That said, the book is much more dense and dark than either and would appeal to modern audiences much more than the rather frilly movie and disjointed series. In the book, Catherine Earnshaw is self-centered and could easily be termed as mentally deranged and Heathcliff is a sadist. They mentally torture each other and are cruel and thoughtless of everyone around them. Bronte's book isn't the grand love story it's made out to be in the movie. Catherine and Heathcliff are more obsessed than romantic, and there's really not much of anyone to like. The setting is grimy, not grand. The characters are hardscrabble in a bleak, brutal world. I can imagine that it would be shocking in its day, but in the era of slasher movies, it's merely a pretty good read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A little slow starting but the mystery of it holds you.

Many classics do not deserve that title, but this is definitely not one of them."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte wrote a novel that is both rough and sweet at the same time. This novel is fantastic in its voice. Mostly it is told through the eyes of Nelly Dean, housekeeper/protector of Catherine/busybody who is bold, blunt and strong. The novel is very much linear making it an easy read. Helpfully, in the front of this edition there is a family tree which will aide the reader immensely, because not only are there a lot of characters, there are many with the same name (though different ages). The novel itself is beautiful in its portrayal of everything; from the moors to even Heathcliff (though spiteful and mean as he is), Bronte created a world that truly exists for the reader. Be warned: this is not a world of balls and romantic marriage proposals as Austen, but rather base life as was most likely lived, isolated on the moors.What really I loved about this book was perhaps what came before and after the actual contents. Bronte and her two sisters originally came out with their books within a year of each other under the guise of being three male brothers Ellis, Acton and Currer Bell. In this particular edition, there is a \\"Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell\\" written by Charlotte Bronte after her sister's passing and on the commencement of new printings of their novels. This edition also includes and Editor's Preface by Charlotte. Commentary from E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf and a review by George Henry Lewes printed in 1850 come at the end and are very interesting, just to see how two famous authors and one critic looked at the book. These \\"bonus pages\\" made Emily (Ellis) come to life for me.Read this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've been trying to read more classic literature recently. And Wuthering Heights was really worthwhile. Yet I find myself almost at a loss for words in describing this book. This gothic romance was a very intense read...and I felt almost in another world as I read it. It creates a \\"feeling\\" that remains with you long after bedtime!The main characters Heathcliff and Catherine are larger than life somehow. How do you describe their dark and stormy love? It is a deep love that descends into obsession, despair, and revenge. Typical of gothic literature, the brooding and haunting landscape of the moors somehow seeps into the characters. And seeps into you... My words can not do this book justice. My advice? Read it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS is by far the best novel I have ever read. The novel's main characters--Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff--are ingeniously written, and the melodramatic scenes are not too \\"cheezy\\" for the modern audience. Bronte's superb authorship allows readers of all backgrounds and of all generations to feel the characters, experience the novel's moods and tones, and appreciate the art of literature. If you absolutely despise reading, you will learn to love it after reading this novel. The novel's themes of passion, hate, love, loss, revenge, and individuality are something we can all relate to and evoke powerful emotions from within any reader. Every educated person should read this...It truly deserves its place among the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Annotation: \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is about Heathcliff, an orphan, who is raised by Mr. Earnshaw as one of his own children. Hindley despises him, but wild Cathy becomes his constant companion, and he falls violently in love with her. When she will not marry him, Heathcliff's terrible vengeance ruins them all - but still his and Cathy's love will not die.Author Bio: Emily Bront was born in Thornton, Yorkshire, in the north of England. Her mother died in 1821. Between the years 1824 and 1825 Emily attended the school at Cowan Bridge with Charlotte, and then was educated at home. Her first novel, Wuthering Heights (1847), a story-within-a-story, did not gain immediate success, but it has acclaimed later fame as one of the most intense novels written in the English language. Emily Bront died of tuberculosis in the late 1848. She had caught cold at her brother Branwell's funeral in September. After the appearance of Wuthering Heights, some skeptics thought that the book was written by Branwell, on the grounds that no woman from such circumscribed life, could have written such passionate story. After her sisters' deaths, Charlotte edited a second edition of their novels, with prefatory commentary aimed at correcting what she saw as the reviewers' misunderstanding of Wuthering Heights. The complex time scheme of the novel had been taken as evidence by the critics, that Emily had not achieved full formal control over her narrative materials.Evaluation: Hate is proven to be weaker than love when it comes to Heathcliff. Heathcliff and Catherine are meant to be together. Since the time when they were children they loved one another. Many people tried to keep them apart and they succeeded at times, but their love for one another always shined through. Heathcliff went through a period where he felt that getting even would mend what everyone put him through, but the last part of his revenge remained undone and there was finally some sort of happiness. Love finally outweighed hate creating the happiness between Cathy and Hareton, and Heathcliff and Catherine. It is truly better to love than it is to hate.Overall, \\"Wuthering Heights\\", is extremely enjoyable. I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys gothic elements incorporated with romance and drama. There are so many themes explored. One thing happens after another, making you want to keep reading and find out what happens next. I liked the fact that love overpowered hate at the end. Jealousy, love, hatred, and tragedy are all mixed together in \\"Wuthering Heights\\", leaving you with a novel that's hard to put down."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I must admit I did the unthinkable. I watched the epic 1939 version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; before reading the book. The book portrays Heathcliff as a brash, violent man unlike the movie, where he is brash, but his heart is still carrying a torch for Cathy. I never knew that the two main characters had children, and reading about the deep contempt Heathcliff had for Linton, his son, I was appalled. Nevertheless, I loved reading the book. The tragic love borders many other great novels written for the period, and I would suggest anyone who loves two lovers trying to deny the feelings between one another, read it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights has very real, lively and more animated characters contrary to Austen and the like; and is told in a distinctive narrative form. I think the particular narrative style has been chosen because she wrote the book under a male pen-name.The story is very realistic, perhaps livelier than real life stories, but is very disturbing; mainly because of the seemingly morbid presence of Heathclif. Though his character can be attributed to his disappointing childhood experiences, there is still a hint of that 'savage' instinct (as is often stated) which provokes him to be brutal to the core.Catherine represents a typical girl caught in between 'real love' and 'wealthy love', finally chosing the latter since she fears she'd have to live an extremely poverty-stricken life if she chooses the former.A question that arose in my mind while reading it is the unnatural importance given to a servant like Nelly, who seems to have witnessed each and every scene in the novel.Reading the novel is an experience in its own; and,the novel, I'm sure is one of the best novels of its kind."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am indeed lost for words...a book of unprecedented power and imaginative scope."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is the story of two families in the Yorkshire Moors and how they are all but destroyed by the evil Heathcliff, who was brought to Wuthering Heights as an orphan by old Mr. Earnshaw.It is in many ways a paradox: It is set in a rustic and tranquil environment and in many parts dwells on a picturesque domestic environment, which I believe, would do the hearts of the best of us good.And yet, that is in itself scarred by a regime of hideous terror and cruelty brought on by Heathcliff.From the beginning of the book, we see in the dream of the city fop, Lockwood, how the latter violently rubs the wrist of the phantom Cathy through a broken windowpane. This sets the mood for deed after deed of cruelty and violence.Hence the key word of the novel is paradox. Between the blissful and violent, the homely and the horrific, between the evil of Heathcliff and the goodness of Nelly Dean who muses of the former: \\"\\"Is he a ghoul or a vampire. I had read of such hideous, incarnate demons'.His cruel treatment of Isabella and the second Catherine, is something that would revolt all descent human beings, and cause us to hate Heathcliff.Even Shakespeare's Macbeth shows some conscience, some guilt about his evil actions, as does Lady Macbeth, but Heathcliff never. No plea, nothing at all, can cause him to show the mildest mercy.If he had, but a shred of decency, he would have at least treated the younger Catherine with compassion as this was the daughter of the great love of his life.Heathcliff is a usurper, who mistreats the rightful heirs to Wuthering heights and Thrushcross Grange, Hareton Earnshaw and Cathy Linton II.The other evil folk in the novel, Heathcliff's son, the degenerate Linton Heathcliff and the spiteful manservant Joseph, are but pale shadows of the demonic Heathcliff.The novel focuses on the intense passionate connection (for one could not call such a thing love) between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, and the rage of Heathcliff before and after her death, that he could not be untied with her.Wuthering Heights was written in 1847, at a time when the rustic tranquility and wellbeing of the England where Emily Bronte lived, was being shattered by the twin forces of the Industrial Revolution and mercenary profit, and the radical and amoral revolutionary ideologies which would be chartered in The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx. Perhaps one can see a parallel between the way in which the peaceful routine was being destroyed by both mercantile capitalism and by violent revolutionary socialism , and the way in which the peaceful and tranquil houses of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights where marred by the diabolical monstrosity of Heathcliff.A key character in the novel is the nurse Nelly Dean, a wonderful woman who shows strength and goodness, throughout in the face of all the evil and cruelty in the saga.She is not much older than Hindley and the first Catherine and I would imagine she is about 16 years old when old Mr. Earnshaw brings Heathcliff to Wuthering Heights, and about 46 therefore, at the time of Heathcliff's death and the redemption of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.The second Cathy, while showing a fierce spirit, is a fundamentally better person than her mother, both beautiful and good.Heathcliff and Catherine I are the anti-heroes of the story and Hareton Earnshaw and Cathy II, the heroes."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is really fascinating.

I'm 13 years old and I've read this book in my spare time. I've read it in German but I'm going to read it in English too.

Catherine Earnshaw is the wildly passionate offspring of the master of Wuthering Heights and his wife. Her father brings home a gypsy looking boy from a trip to Liverpool and this little \\"silent heathen\\" is integrated into the family. Catherine and Heathcliff, as the gypsy comes to be named, become inseperable and untamable. However there is another family in this picture who lives in the much friendlier and luxurious house of Thrushcross Grange. Catherine is wounded while sneaking about the Grange with Heathcliff and his welcomed into Thrushcross Grange to be cared for until she heals. Edgar Linton who is Catherines age and will inherit the Grange upon his parents death takes to Cathy and she to him. But Edgar does not feed Catherine's wild nature and is for all intensive purposes a milksop. Catherine returns to the Heights far more mannered and tamed than when she left and Heathcliff is furious that she no longer cares to share in his savageness. Some time passes and Edgar asks Cathy to marry him, she cries to the lady keeper of the house that she wants to marry Heathcliff but she will lose all of her status as upper class if she does. Heathcliff overhears and in a rage of pain leaves and we do not see him again for three years. When he returns Catherine is married and living at the Grange. Heathcliff has become wealthy but is still the cruel savage from his youth and is bent on revenging himself upon all those who wronged him when he was the title-less gypsy boy. (I'm leaving out some important bits and pieces but for the most part the storyline is intact) The ending is a secret known only by those who choose to take the journey across the moors to Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange to hear Ellen tell the story. I will tell this: Both Catherine and Heathcliff beget children and death figures big in the plot. This novel contains unbridled passion, heinous revenges, festering anger, unfathomable pain, and the intensity of a storm on the moors. Read the whole book before passing ANY judgement. Bravo Bronte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Oh, where to begin? Yes, some people complain about the melodramatic (some even say soap-operatic) quality of this book, but it is simply wonderful. It's hard to find a book about the dark side of love, and this book (which offered, perhaps, the first \\"modern\\" character in Heathcliff) has the dark side of love in spades. The story is centered around the Earnshaw and Linton families, who occupy the Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange estates, respectively. While it would give away many important and poignant moments to go more in-depth, rest assured that there is betrayal, violence, and passion. The character of Heathcliff may very well be the best character in literature (in my opinion, at least). His inner conflict between vengeance and love is tragically human, and the fact that he knows that he is doing the wrong thing but cannot stop his drive for vengeance makes him that much more human. This book is excellent. Maybe the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"but I did not really enjoy it. I understand why it is a classic: Miss Bronte delves into the depths of the human psyche and recounts the agonies of lost love and the despair and cruelty it drives Heathcliff to. She describes the deep bond of love between Cathy and Heathcliff, a bond which is stronger than death and causes as much pain as it does pleasure, and as much agony as comfort. What I cannot understand is how people actually enjoy reading it. I do not mind a lack of action in a book: Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorites and contains far less action than this book. However, Pride and Prejudice was a pleasant read because it had pleasant overtones and a pleasant ending and pleasant characters. This book, however, has nasty overtones, an ending barely passable as neutral, and nasty characters. Most of the main characters were self-centered fiends: Cathy loved her friend more than her husband and made it known to all, Joesph was a foul hypocrite, Linton was a wretched weakling, Hindley a abusive father, Heathcliff an evil fiend, etc. The story itself was an awful tale of lost love leading to a collapse of characer and it's resulting consequences (all bad) on the people in contact with Heathcliff. Why people celebrate this of all love stories is beyond me. Why on earth would people hold up as an example of true love the story of Cathy and Heathcliff? A story which runs as follows: Cathy and Heathcliff are in love. Cathy marries someone else because Heathcliff has a low rank. Heathcliff causes jealousy for Cathy's husband. Cathy dies, and Heathcliff nearly goes insane and spends the rest of his life mercilessly torturing those around him. Someone explain to me why this is held up as a great example of love? Give me Miss Bronte's sister (Charlotte Bronte)'s Jane Eyre any day over this. Jane Eyre is just such a story as should be held up and shown to the world as an example of true love, not Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is an example of love gone horribly wrong, not perfect love. I do not think that it was the author's intent at all to have this lifted up as an example of what love should be like, as many have mistaken her to have done. She was simply showing the power of love: that it has both the power to do both great good and great evil. That is the strength of this book.Overall grade: A"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If the craft of writing appeals to you, this is a gem. There is only one word out of place (one pronoun with an ambiguous antecedent). The story is told from multiple points of view and includes a variety of sad and sordid relationships but ends with a vision of love nearly unequaled in literature.One overarching theme is the relationship between love and control. As we know today, control is often manfested in anger but also in eating disorders. Yes, two of the main characters would be called anorexic today. Emily Bronte herself probably died of anorexia--her coffin was less than 20 inches wide.This is romantic in the traditional sense: Wuthering Heights emphasizes emotion. And when emotional people are thwarted, they turn angry. Add love, jealousy, class conflict, sibling rivalry, supernatural dreams, and the wild moors of Yorkshire, you've got a gothic novel that has been often imitated but seldom duplicated.Because of the multiple narrators, there is one warning. Many of the episodes are told more than once from different points of view. In each case, though, the perspectives are so different that you might not even realize at first that you are reading about the same event.If you want to read a fascinating story and want a sense of how a great story should be told, read Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A TRULY EXCELLENT EDITION of this strangest and strongest of English novels,hauntingly beautiful in its impassionate poetry,a novel that reads us instead of the other way round,more about important questions than about too trivial answers.The text is roughly the same than Clarendon's reference one, without correcting the error at the beginning of Chapter 16 (we get \\"inhabitants\\" for \\"inhabitant\\", and the reason for NOT emending both 1847 and 1850 readings, although duly explained in a note, is most incredible). The punctuation is even a bit heavier than Clarendon's(I fear a bit too heavy for American habits) and the implied two-volume division with independent chapter numbering looks as funny and cumbersome as in Oxford's.The Introduction, although shorter than Stoneman's for Oxford, is excellent nonetheless. So are the notes, that more often than not give full quotation of the references involved, while Oxford gives only the references. Material production is as bad as you fear and then some, as regards paper quality and binding: pages will get brown in only five years (and Oxford's don't fare much better). Printing quality, on the other hand, is fair-to-good.Don't miss the very first page (the one about Emily Bront life),then read Lucasta Miller's preface,skip both the excellent Pauline Nestor Introduction and the controversial\\"Charlotte's materials\\" (the Biographical Notice and the Preface to the New),and -giving an attentive glance to the Genealogical Tree- go to the TEXT (perusing the notes).Afterwards you will do well to read the previously skipped material, and, perhaps some months later, to peruse the excellent Bibliography.IN SUMMARY: as far as text, Introduction and notes are concerned, no other edition is better. Material production and durability, on the other side, are even a little worse than Oxford World's Classics.Have a haunting, unforgettable read!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is one book I've read over and over again, to understand how it appears to other people. Whomsoever have I met consider it to be rude and strange at first. What this book means to me is unsurpassed literature. It depicts rough love- a love that is as wild as the moors of England. Wuthering Heights breeds initself a &quot;horror of darkness&quot;, we sometimes breathe in our lives. The love existing between Heathcliff- the most loved villians of all time and Catherine stands strong. This book is about a stranger entering a household where he is rejected, and during this course betrays the one solitary feling in his heart- not being his love for Catherine, but compassion. The other half of the story reaches a point where Heathcliff takes his sweet revenge. There are no answers to questions like: Should a character like Heathcliff exist or not? I do not know. This is a masterpiece in literature depicting love, innocence lost, friendship, forgiveness and above all acceptance. Unfortunately, this was the first and last book of Emily Bronte. Wish there were more novels like this one!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a novel that creates a love story between Heathcliff and Catherine. This is not however a regular love story. Bronte's ability to create real emotions puts Wuthering Heights in a category far from a &quot;Cinderella&quot; story. Bronte's remarkable ability to conceive almost twisted stories can be seen not to far into the story. It can be seen once Mr. Earnshaw brings home Heathcliff, basically treats Heathcliff as his son and neglects his birth son, and Catherine begins to love Heathcliff that the story will be far from regular. Bronte uses these unique ironies to create detailed stories.In this book Bronte uses her ability to mimic real human reactions in her characters come about. Such as when Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw die Hindley, their birth son, forces Heathcliff to leave because of his hatred towards him. Hindley knew his father loved Heathcliff more than him and he couldn't stand it. Heathcliff leaving causes problems between. It's Ironic that when Heathciff comes home after three years because of his love for Catherine, she has already married another, Edgar Linton.Emily Bronte's story obviously wasn't that of a regular love story. Not too long after Heathcliff comes home Catherine dies. Heathcliff becomes filled with anger and seeks revenge. He causes pain to all that have hurt him or are related to those that hurt them. Although Bronte didn't create a storybook love story she does end it, in a way, like a love story should end. The lovers are of course united in death. I liked this story by Emily Bronte because it wasn't just a regular love story with a happy ending. Although it did end with the lovers together, it is hardly a &quot;Cinderella&quot; story and the plat twist and intricacies make it a memorable story."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Reading Wuthering Heights is like a journey into a dream abound with entangled relationships, bitter vengeance, and how the innocent heirs from feuded families struggle to escape the macabre legacy of the past. The person who unraveled the history behind Wuthering Heights was Lockwood, a new tenant of the Thrushcross Grange who was forced to seek shelter one night at Wuthering Heights, the home of his landlord Heathcliff.Heathcliff was kidnapped and shipped to England, grew up under the roof of the Earnshaws. Old Earnshaw took a liking of the young Heathcliff while his son Hindley persistently and insidiously grumbled long string of tales against him and treated him like a house servant after the old Earnshaw passed away. At Wuthering Heights the young Heathcliff cultivated a consummate bonding with Catherine Earnshaw who later on betrayed him and married Edgar Linton.LoveThe novel's pivot tends to focus on the power of the central relationship between Catherine Earnshaw-Linton and Heathcliff. However dark and vindictive the novel might have turned out, the work's attraction, as a love story is not difficult to extract. Catherine loved Heathcliff because he was more herself than she was. Their souls were made of the same materials. Her soul, her heart, and her conscience reproved and convinced her that it was wrong to marry Linton, though Heathcliff might appear to be an unreclaimed, uncultivated creature, which would degrade her. In her final words to Heathcliff, the embittered Catherine Earnshaw writhed in torment. Here the novel has attained to the fullness the celebration of such transcendent love, which has surpassed the bounds of mundanity and death, despite the fact that their reunion was marked by dejection, regret, and bitterness. To Heathcliff the entire world was such a dreadful conviction of memoranda that he had lost his beloved Catherine Earnshaw, even though her daughter Cathy asserted that nobody would love him nor cry for him when he died.VengeanceHeathcliff's eye-for-an-eye vengeance visited upon the next generation. To revenge on Hindley Earnshaw's being acrimonious to him, Heathcliff determined to make Hindley's son Hareton a brute. He never taught him how to read or write, never rebuked him for any bad habit and never led him a single step toward virtue. When Heathcliff later became master of Wuthering Heights, he reduced Hareton to a mere house servant and deprived him of any wages. Edgar's daughter Cathy was forced to marry Heathcliff's sickly son Linton who braced the brawl of the previous generation by reviving how Cathy's mother had betrayed the man she loved for her father Edgar Linton. Through his son Heathcliff meant to usurp Edgar Linton's property at Thrushcross Grange and confiscated Cathy's fortune. The heirs (Cathy Linton, Hareton Earnshaw, and Linton) strived to escape from the bitter rift of the previous generation. The second half of the novel (volume ii) somewhat signifies such restoration of order and balance in this second generation.Dream/Stream-of-ConsciousnessThe appearance of Catherine Earnshaw's ghost in the early part of the novel proves to be such an appropriate notion to set the tone of Wuthering Height. The house servant only proved the house was haunted at the expense of the new tenant Lockhood, the ghost also challenged the limits of life. Wuthering Heights as a whole conveys a sense of vagueness and ambiguous plausibility. The notion of dream proved to be a significant source of understanding as both Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff envisaged their happiness in dreams, and Catherine articulated the dreams' informing power to Ellen Dean, who narrated the story to Lockwood over the span of a night at Heathcliff's abode. The warped sense of time, the geographical remoteness, and social aloofness contribute to a dreamlike, stream-of-conscious setting. Such dreamlike setting offers an uncensored realm, free of logic and boundaries, to the transgression of identity, sexuality, violence, and vengeance.\\"May you not rest, as long as I am living. You said I killed you - haunt me, then.\\" The book obviates a transcendent love that surpasses grief and death. It is meant to be haunting. 4.5 stars.2004 (1)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Several years ago, tired of reading the latest novels, I decided after a few forays into classic literature that maybe I should devote more time to them. After all, anything hailed as a \\"great literary work\\" by millions of people has to be good, right?I'm glad this wasn't the first classic I picked up, because I never would have continued reading them. The book itself isn't all that thick, which while I prefer thick, I was grateful it wasn't in this case. It is a book about torment. Everyone in it is in a perpetual state of plain, downright torment. And the kicker is they bring it on themselves. Reading it I felt bad for Heathcliff as a child and sympathised with his plight. The fireworks begin after Heathcliff returns from some unnamed place or places with millions in the bank. The apple of his eye is the wishy-washy (I just can't come up with a more fitting term for so wretched a woman) Catherine, who can't make up her mind what to do throughout the book until her dying breath. Thank God that happened.When I read a book I generally try to find a connection with one of the characters, someone who might share the same views as I would or who might take the same action as I would in certain circumstances, but I'm sorry to say I couldn't find a single one. I found myself more or less taking the side of Edgar, although he wasn't very enjoyable either. As for Heathcliff I felt like reaching into the book, smacking him around a few good hours while screaming \\"Get over it!\\" Wuthering Heights is filled to bursting with detestable people doing deplorable things for no other reason than greed, selfishness, and what must be some kind of masochistic desire for misery. And Heathcliff is the King of Pain in this one. I felt actual relief at his passing as I would that of a rabid dog.This would be a one star review, but for the last 40 pages where at least some semblence of hope and happiness comes to this stupid book, something it was completely devoid of throughout the rest of it. It's a wonder half of England didn't commit suicide out of severe depression after reading it when it was first released. Even more troubling is that the up and coming youth who read this tend to really believe it's a classic \\"love story\\".

Anyone who says otherwise fails to understand the true meaning of the novel. I'm not going to waste time stating the general plot premise. This story is a classic and the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff is well known.Wuthering Heights is about classicism, torture and religion. Heathcliff is a representation of the devil. The entire story focuses on getting into Heaven or Hell and being smiled upon by providence. The love between Cathy and Heathcliff is the quintessential abusive relationship. The main characters are not likable; they are repulsive and cruel. The estate of Wuthering Heights (and by virtue of its name) is the focal point of the ever changing social dynamics (from Heathcliff and Catherine to their respective children).It sounds like I hated this book but in fact I loved it! It shows the raw and sadistic elements of human beings and the need for kindness and compassion.

I cannot rejoice in a love that is so destructive that it cares not for what happens to those around it, it merely obsesses about its own gain. Yes, beautifully written and constructed and I've had to read it a couple of times for various studies over the years, but I find life has enough problems so I turn to romance novels for a feeling of warmth and a brief feeling that somewhere love could be beautiful, not something you get from Wuthering Heights. The hopelessness of so many of the characters makes me uneasy and I'm left feeling as though those cold winds from those hills are blowing through me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a well-structured, inspiring literary classic that is very deserving of its place. I found it to be a little slow to begin, and a bit hard to follow, but it picks up fairly quickly. The story is partly love story and partly tragedy. All the tragedy that occurs in the novel makes the reader feel a little depressed at times, but it is well worth it for the ending. Heathcliff is an unlikeable character initially, but as the story unfolds I can almost be sympathetic towards him. In the beginning Heathcliff appears selfish and greedy without cause, but his behavior is not unjust. True, he is still vengeful and unlikeable, but at least he had a reason. The characters portray the downside of humanity, the not-so-good aspect of ourselves, but also explains the why not just the what. Emily Bront did a wonderful job of pointing out humanity's imperfections while still providing readers with a good story. Given the era she lived during, it seems to me that she was far ahead of her time when she wrote this. The novel holds great power over the reader, and once I started reading it, I didn't want to put it down until I had finished it.I didn't particularly like the fact that almost all the characters were self-destructive, but I was pleased with how Hareton Earnshaw turned out. Of all of the characters, my least favorite was Joseph, who just seemed like a bitter old croak to me. Indeed, Lockwood says this of him, \\"Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps, though hale and sinewy [...] vinegar-faced.\\"To me, a good story has emotion. Wuthering Heights left me feeling appalled at some of the actions the characters did, and saddened at times, and angry at others. The story is filled with vivid details and depth, making it an awesome read. It is a dark novel, but absolutely stunning. If you're looking for a fairy tale ending, you won't find it here, but that doesn't mean this isn't a good book. I highly recommend this, even if you only read it once."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte is one of those authors who has an extreme grip on the English language, and I just loved having this on my Kindle to read at my leisure. This was a great buy for the price, and the fact is that Bronte is always good to read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book was hard to read. It is just amazing to think that a woman that died at 30 (just 2 years after this book was written) could come up with something like this. It makes you wonder what kind of life she had.I enjoyed the book but it took me several tries and quite a while to get through it.A classic worth reading but not easy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"this book is my favorite novel of all time, even though I have read virtually thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of novels of all types. I have several printings of this book, and have re-read it no less than 5 times, and I am never disappointed in the novel itself, although sometimes the edition might not be that great. I prefer a book as close to the original (unedited) as I can find, but don't mind extras included (articles, thoughts, essays, poems, etc), as long as the story itself is untampered with. this novel is about love, in all of its many forms, and about the vital importance of truly knowing yourself, and living your life accordingly. Not by other people's standards, nor how others might wish you to be, or even by who you may wish you were (instead of who you really are). If you do not do this, your life will always be a misery for you, and probably for everyone else around you as well. I have never found another novel to take it's place in my heart or my soul. I \\"am\\" this book, and it is me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've been reading and re-reading Wuthering Heights for 45 years, and each time I open this novel I find something new. From my first reading at the age of 12, I was and remain intrigued by the format of the novel: told by a rather dim-witted tenant intrigued by his decidedly odd neighbor/landlord named Heathcliff after he hears the tale from his housekeeper of Thrushcross Grange in remote Yorkshire during two lengthy stays. It's a complicated and elegant structure that serves the reader very well. As a 'tween I was captivated by the romance of Wuthering Heights. In my 20s and 30s it was Catherine Earnshaw Linton, who chose respectability over passion, who interested me. In my 40s, I looked again at Heathcliff, who is just about the most diabolical and evil man in literature. And now in my 50s I find myself especially interested in Catherine Linton Heathcliff, Heathcliff's chosen victim for his revenge of the supposed sins committed against him by her parents. She is the daughter of two weak parents: Catherine Earnshaw, whose mind and body broke before she reached the age of 20, and Edgar Linton, who lacked the physical vigor to fight Heathcliff or protect his daughter. Yet though Heathcliff chooses Catherine Linton Heathcliff for his revenge, she is no victim, and it is Heathcliff's inability to destroy her that leads to his ultimate despair and death. To many readers, the story of the second Catherine feels tacked on (and many movie versions leave it out altogether), but in it resides Emily Bronte's message. The second Catherine and second Hareton offer a new start for Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange with a new kind of masters -- not a pampered and privileged pair who've been protected from the harshness of the world, but a couple who've survived the worst treatment that Heathcliff could devise for them and have emerged with their humanity intact."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"All time favorite classic. A MUST read. The love story is beautifully heart-breaking. Best quotes of all time... \\"He's more myself than I am, whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The Longman Cultural Edition is not what you get when you buy the Kindle version. It is text only without TOC, annotations, commentary or anything else. Buyer beware."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights was the 1st novel I read a a child. I love this book and am so glad to have the opportunity to have it in a portable mode. Timeless and Classic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Honestly, I read this because it was mentioned so much in the Twilight Saga. It kept nagging at me until I read it and I am so glad I did. It's a classic for a reason. I haven't read a whole lot of books from past centuries, just enough to fully appreciate Wuthering Heights. Love love love it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have heard about this book since high school and finally decided to pick it up. Wow. Every night I couldn't wait to get into bed and read what Catherine and Heathcliff were up to. Now I'm finished and I've started 4 different books, just to be disappointed. None are nearly as good as this one. It will suck you in."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Nice novel for rainy weekend :) I would say this one is mostly for girls.

I just put tape around the book so they wouldn't peel anymore. Other than that, great buy and I love the cover :)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I swore I wouldn't like this book, and I spent years trying to avoid it. I have a very short attention span and have always had difficulty with the verboseness of 19th century literature. But I was finally required to read this for a class so I was left with no choice.I am incredibly grateful I took that class. Once I got through chapter 1, I could not put this book down. Bront has a way of making your emotions go to war over even the most wicked characters. Wuthering Heights is daring, disturbing, and captivating. The psychology in this book is extraordinary and the plot will have you hooked.It is rare for a book to wrap up so flawlessly that you're left 100% satisfied, but Wuthering Heights was that book for me. Even my most cherished stories left me disappointed in some way or another. I couldn't describe the feeling I had when I finished reading Wuthering Heights. It really will test you, but if you want a story that doesn't play it safe, I say start reading this as soon as you can."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Classic story, love it each time I read it. Highly recommend everyone, especially the ladies to read this story. The Bronte sisters never wrote a &#34;typical&#34; romance...always a dark side before the light!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Once required reading for many English classes, this book too often has been cast aside as supposedly too archaic in style and point of view, which is a shame."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Every time I read this book I love it more. I am always surprised how lost I get in the the story."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wow! I read tons of books, love classic literature, have eclectic tastes and I am a very passionate person...I can definitely get into the dark, forbidden romance thing & have definitley felt love sweet love!! I actually, usually enjoy... to absolutely love what I read......I have to say that This was I think my least favorite, the worst book I have ever read....probably in my life. Strange how things hit us just a certain way. I found all of the characters despicable, and love story? where was it? I felt nothing for or between any of these sickos. I could go on in detail about why I feel this way but basically it was just Pathetic...."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Maybe it's just me but this was SOOOOOOOOOO boring. I read the first 50 or so pages and had to put it down. Too many characters were introduced and the story was lost almost immediately. I know it's a classic and I know I'm supposed to revere the writers of old, but this was a waste of time. Nothing against Bronte, just not my cup of tea. Stephen King said if a writer does not hook you in the first twenty pages, move on! I did."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Sadly, I couldn't even finish it. It is well written and interesting but it is depressing in the extreme. I read about half and I had to stop reading it and start reading a more uplifting story.I was expecting something closer to her sister's Jane Eyre, oh how wrong I was."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is supposed to be a story about forbidden love, right? Well, it is to a point... but mostly it is just depressing. They both die near the end and they never get married. She marries an entirely different man, and after she dies he basically goes crazy with sadness. This story is extremely confusing, as well as slightly boring at times. It is hard to understand because of the time frame it is supposed to be in.This book is probably not for young readers, because of the difficult vocabulary and small print. It was hard for me to understand, so i can imagine what it would be like for, say, a ten year old. I do not recommend this book to someone who has a short attention span, because it is hard to follow and hard to get into. If you, by chance, like older literature and are good at comprehending, go for it! But it is not the best choice for someone who is used to reading newer, easier reads. Wuthering Heights is defiantly not a thriller."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The savings were beaucoup! This was a required reading book for school. The price was great, the delivery was quick, and the book was in great condition! Thanks!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you're looking for a classic that's a great read, then this is your book.This book is about a man named Lockwood who comes to Wuthering Heights for a job as a servant. When he meets a man named Heathcliff and becomes interested in his heritage. He learns from a woman named Nelly Dean that Heathcliff is a very interesting person. Heathcliff, a dark mysterious person, was in love with Catherine and it turned into a love and romantic story. But Heathcliff get torn away from Cathy by her brother and a family living four miles living down the road named the Lintons. Heathcliff has a son named Linton. Catherine has a daughter named Catherine and Hindley (Catherine's brother) has a son named Hareton. Now a new love story comes out consisting those three children.You will not be sorry you read this book. It's a tragic reality love story and it's a classic. What do you have to lose?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Heathcliff is a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man inside and out. His character makes this an interesting story. But, it was a little tedious to read.Margo, a former college professor, enlightened me with some thoughts on the book which I am quoting here. This is from her comment below dated 2/4/09. \\"Younger readers are fans of the story because they see in it the tumultuous passions of lovers obstructed by \\"outsiders.\\" I think they \\"get it.\\" My college students love it because they are mesmerized by the slow, agonizing destruction of one of the lovers as he takes his vengeance.\\" Thank you Margo.Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: none. (I mention sexual content solely for the purpose of providing information. Some readers may want to know this when recommending to young adults.) Setting about 1775 to 1805 England. Published about 1847. Genre: Gothic Romance (romance about obsession)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Perhaps the author, Emily Bronte, had the need to write an anti-Jane-Austin story, because this sure qualifies. This tale of interleaved sociopaths is the antithesis of Jane Austin. The people of Quality and Breeding are all mentally disturbed, only the female servant is with sense (she declares herself so in Volume I, chapter 12, page 1). Given the continuum: Perfect Family - Normal Family - Dysfunctional Family - ?? (my vocabulary fails me), these folks rate the \\"??\\". Clearly the quality of the literary effort is superb, the writing and characterization is terrific. The story does have a useful function in illustrating the Darwinian nature of life, but don't read it for its ability to elevate. Is this book entertaining? Yes. But it raises a disturbing question about ourselves that this should become a Classic (think gawkers at a terrible car wreck). The story does conclude by throwing a contrived happy ending as one might throw a bone to a starving dog. (November 2012: I gave this two stars? One was too many. What was I thinking?)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, I was looking forward to reading this work of her sister's. I was mortally disappointed. It was like an extremely bad soap opera, with pointless obsessions and passions ruling the lives of the characters with an iron grip. With pathetic, dying lovers, doom, and desperation, it has no redeeming virtues."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm sorry but I just did not like this book. It feels sloppily written at times and sometimes I wonder if she wrote the book just to compete with her sister (hey you never know). The only thing that I can compliment this book on is it's character development, by the end of the book (if you can stand to read the whole thing) you feel like you know them personally."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I call this the worst book ever, but that's largely an assumption on my part. Perhaps an extrapolation. I have not read all of the books ever written. But this book is horrid.If you are a tween girl, this might be a good book for you, though. If your dream fella is one of those dark and broody types, the kind that seems mysterious but turns out to be just a basic kind of jerk. It's a shame that some people find this book romantic. The dark, disturbed guy in this book is called Garfield and he's a lousy person.If you like this time period for fiction, you should try Anne Bronte. She wrote two fantastic books. But avoid Charlotte Bronte. She, too, is a terrible writer.Full disclosure: I do not know Emily Bronte, nor would I care to."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The story about a low class guy (Heathcliff) in love with a rich upper class girl (Catherine) is a classic theme. I could deal with that because it reminded me of a movie. but, after Catherine dies because of giving birth the book just looses interest. It is obvious that Heathcliff is a Psycho! he does so many bad things that you go from feeling bad for him for not ending up with Catherine, to hating his guts and wanting him to die. There really is no protagonist in the story to take on the antagonist of Heathcliff because there is no way that he is the antagonist. There are much better books in British Literature that I would have rather read in high school than this one. Overall it was a very dissapointing book. I was expecting to read a real classic but I was dissapointed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I love the classics as much as anyone but I really can't get into a novel that makes me hate the main characters. Catherine is a petulant, spoiled ***** and I never wanted to lay into anyone as bad as I did Heathcliff. He is a deranged psychopath, and there is nothing remotely 'romantic' about his character. I'm not sure why the novel caught on the way it did, it was 300 pages documenting spoiled, self absorbed people and their unrelenting quest to destory any trace of happiness around them. Not my idea of a good read, but it was worth it to get to the end just to see his ass DIE. Good riddance!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am reading Wuthering heights in preparation for and AP English course, and am finding it to be the most tedious book I have ever read. I used to think that Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea dragged, but i was sadly mistaken. This book is a drawn out and dreary affair. I have enjoyed &quot;classic&quot; literature in the past but this is unworthy of being dubbed &quot;classic&quot;. I would never reccomend this book to another living person, but maybe I'm just and &quot;immature&quot; reader."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Hi there, it's me again with another 'Classic'. You probably don't know I recently made a resolution to read some of the 'Classics'. I had avoided them successfully for decades and then decided that perhaps I was missing out on some really great stories. So, I carefully selected some novels that sounded like great 'Classics' to read. 'Wuthering Heights', 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Jane Eyre' rose to the top of the list.They all sounded like fabulous stories, everyone raves about them, the book jackets make them sound like the absolute be all end all for engaging fiction. And maybe they are for the vast majority of people, but not me. Jane Eyre being the exception of the three.I did LOVE 'Jane Eyre', love, love, loved it. However my strong feeling for both 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Wuthering Heights' swing dramatically in the complete opposite direction.I really strongly disliked (okay, I hated) almost everything about Wuthering Heights. I thought the characters were absolutely horrid and rotten, the only exception being the innocent and unrelated tenant, Mr. Lockwood, who Ellen Dean tells this awful tale to.The relationships were completely dysfunctional, violent, abusive and destructive. I can not comprehend how this came to be called \\"one of the most romantic novels of all time\\". I have no idea who said that but in my opinion whoever it was should have their head examined. If this is what people call romantic it is no wonder that 1 in 2 of all marriages fail.Perhaps, I have some sort of completely unrealistic expectations when it comes to the classics and my expectations set me up for failure...? Perhaps. But I am going to stop searching out any more 'Classics' for the time being.One more hostile note that some of you will appreciate. I swear I wanted to cudgel the servant Joseph who spoke in a northern dialect and could only be understood by reading the notes to the text in the back of the book.I would have to place this book at the top of a list for 'Most Likely to Create Hatred of English Literature'."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you don't know anything about Emily Bronte or you don't like her style of literature, then I would warn you to stay away from this and look up one of the many other classics like &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;. Here's why:Confusing -- Several characters all share the same/similar names which sometimes makes it confusing.Unsympathetic characters -- I felt that Heathcliff was such a total jerk that he didn't deserve any sympathy whatsoever. So that made it hard for me to sympathize with the woman who loved him, which in turn forced me to reject the concept of this being a love story. Even the most vile villans of all time usually exhibit one small redeeming quality. I felt that Healthcliff didn't and thus I didn't care what happened to him or his love interest.Boring -- Nothing good happens.If you like Emily Bronte nothing I say here will change your mind, but if you don't or are reluctant, then stay away from this one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am torn on this one but mostly negative. The language and the story were both excellent (though the Yorkshire lines were tough at times) but all but one of the characters were annoying to the point of distraction and the book was not well edited for length. She could have told this story with the same impact, had she dropped scenes and words.She has a gift for darkness and moodiness though, and the book, in general is a bit of an elaborate Victorian ghost story. The opening scenes and set up of the novel is quite masterful but the story rambles and everyone and everything seems just a bit watery by the end of it.Trivia: This book ranks pretty high on the \\"books in which characters catch a chill from wet feet and die\\" list. All the characters sound like my mother not wanting me to swim after eating."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i dont know if i would love or hate this book because i couldnt read it because im not the best reader and have to sound things out sometimes and i couldnt understand half the words on the first page alone and so i had to keep looking in the dictionary half the time to under stand and so i gave up and deleted the book but other people tell me its a good book i just coldnt understand it i hope other people like it"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Although it took me 2 tries reading this to understand who the heck was the narrator, once I figured it out, I loved it!Listening to the stories being told with Heathcliff and Cathy..it's sad yet amazing."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I used express delivery and it left the warehouse the same day I ordered it and I received it promptly.

However, this book is not for the faint-hearted. It was written as a gothic novel and is faithful to its genre.

It is valuable to increase the reader's awareness of English literature, but if the object of one's reading is pleasure, I would recommend reading a book by either of her sisters, Anne or Charlotte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book because I thought it would further my knowledge in vocabulary and because my mother absolutely loved this book. As I read through it, it was hard to understand who was speaking and what was going on. Towards the end of the book I caught on but I still thought the book to be depressing and not at all uplifting. I think you should read it because it is a classic, but if you're looking for a light, romantic book, you've picked the wrong book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i hated this book.

No passion and pain like Charolotte's JANE EYRE or LUCY SNOWE of Villette, and unlike the flighty creations of Anne's novel, this one was rather hard to finish. All in all, another over rated book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i hated this book with a passion! i felt no sympathy for any of the characters and i thought that it was pointless and boring."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If Jane Eyre is free on Kindle, then why isn't her sister's book, \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" free as well?It is a classic that should be available for free like so many other classics that are available for free as an eBook.Shame to the person that is making money off this eBook. (This goes for all the other \\"authors\\" on DTPAmazon that are selling this eBook here.)This book deserves all 5 stars, but the fact that they are selling it for a profit, brings it down to one star (I would have put zero, but it wouldn't let me).As soon as I can get my hands on a computer document for this book, I will be putting up on the Kindle store for FREE!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you had a feeling that this book was written a long time ago, well, you're right! The novel, Wuthering Heights by Emile Bronte, is along the lines of most romance/drama novels out there. It has a very familiar story and plot twits that will not keep the reader occupied. When I tried to invision the settings and characters all that I could invision is a grey bloob with generic settings and overly used characters. The same generic plots may suit some people fine but it seems to me that the average reader may want to move onto something alittle bit more innovative and interesting.Now, onto the characters. The three main characters in the beginning of the book are Heathcliff, Catherine, and Edgar. Heathcliff is a poor waif that has been friends with Catherine seince they were little children about the age of 6 and is now madly in love with Catherine. Secondly, Catherine has always loved heathcliff but her greed gets in the way of thier love often. Edgar, who is ALSO in love with Catherine, is a very rich and well educated individual. As the plot continues Catherine marries Edgar for his money, not doing what her heat deisred by marrying Heathcliff, which turns out to be her biggest mistake.Although this book has its \\"up's\\", it also has a large share of \\"down's\\". And the lacklust enviorments dont help one bit. The lack of plausable discription takes its toll on this could be great story. At one point in the book while discribing a trellus of flowers it was depicted as follows: \\"I noticed that there were flowers surrounding the barn.\\". Not to be rude... but... What kind of barn was it? was it old, or new, or red, or green? Flowers? What kind? What color? This very bland discription of what MAY be a older barn that MAY have help horses, and that MAY have had flowers the MAY have been yellow creats no mental image of the area that MAY exist. Wuthering Heights was once descibed as a gloomy building. I mean, excuse me? A gloomy building? Is it 2 stories high, or maby 3? What color is it? Surroundings?Over all the only thing that this book did for me is show me how NOT to write a book. I would not recommend this book for anyone unless you have read EVERY OTHER BOOK in the world. The only reason that this book did not get 1 star is because it is not a total loss of reading. It does have its good points. I would like to talk more about this book but I am pressured for time at the moment. In conclusion I wouldn't reccomend this book and think that it is almost a waste of time. If you are extreemly into classic liturature then go pick this novel up. But besides that then no."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This review is on the \\"other\\" Wuthering Heights Penguin Classics edition (Corot's \\"Gust of Wind\\" on the cover), 1995, reprinted with a new Introduction, Chronology and Further Reading 2000, Reissued with revisions and a new Preface 2003.Forgive me as I have read only 38 pages. But I find it necessary to say now it has been an extremely frustrating experience. The novel is oddly laid out, with tricks of the flashback filling in details that should have been straightforwardly presented at the beginning, such as WHO IS MRS HEATHCLIFF? Honestly, I went back and scanned over the first 38 pages several times and just could not figure out who she was, despite consulting other helps. Was she (is she) Heathcliff's wife, his son's wife, some other wife? Heathcliff says she is my daughter-in-law but then it is stated later his only son died. WHAT? Maybe the \\"Harleton Earnshaw\\" is an adopted son. Some of the characters have the same name or nickname such as CATHERINE versus CATHY. There's another Cathy (Linton) that is different from CATHERINE EARNSHAW but CATHERINE is also called Cathy, which just causes unnecessary confusion and is indicative of slipshod writing.And then there's the ghost story and the dreamscape which is a cheap trick (many movies include the nightmare scene you think is real but the oh so clever movie scriptwriters cause the malignant balloon to pop, the protagonist waking up! and you are tricked once again). At least I am thankful the local Yorkshire \\"Wuthering\\" dialect is not overused, but thankfully there ARE frequent footnotes you'll have to look up to make any sense out of some of the text and dialogue.

And the first four chapters... don't even get me started.I'm still giving it five stars because, in the end, it was worth the sometimes boring reading and slow pace. This book is definitely a classic that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"and better than any Hollywood production. One can read this novel over and over, and still not be sure of Emily Bronte's intentions (btw, she had a wonderful, witty style). She seems to have been portraying the detrimental effects of social class rigidity (the mal-treatment of the waif Heathcliff, ideas of what constituted \\"proper behavior\\" for girls/women, among many other things), of violence on children, and of poor parenting.One problem with the book is the all-too-convenient (and nearly perfect) character of Nelly the Narrator. She is the most likeable character in the story but not very realistic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Before posting my review, I always read several other reviews. I swear, some people would write a review that says, &quot;drinking water makes my mouth wet&quot; and then give water one star. The Victorian novel typically isn't your light hearted, Erma Bombeck-ish literature. Yes...it is dark, brooding, mysterious, and long. It is supposed to be that way! I think it is sad that Emily Bronte died at such a young age, leaving only this one novel. In my opinion, the Victorian novel is the pinnacle of great literature and Wuthering Heights is among the best.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the language of Joseph was too difficult to understand. It took great patience for me to &quot;translate&quot; those passages. Bronte obviously wanted to describe that character by his speech and it was very effective, but it was too much."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a good book and another one I had to read for senior english in high school..It had a good plot and a captivating love story between Cathy and Heathcliff....The action went at a good pace and WH was a page turner for me...good job Bronte! While it was quite depressing, it taught me a lot about love and hate, which are two important things in life. I would recommend this book to everyone that likes classics and love stories"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte should be on the next Oprah. There is so much love and deception in this book it would make a great topic. This is the second time I have read this book the first time was in high school and I hated the book. It was partly to do with all the Cathy's. Once you get passed who is who in the book and you understand the relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff you begin to understand the book better. I found that is easier to map out the families so I knew who was who and what family they belonged to. This is truly a great novel of love and deception and is now off my bad list and on my good list."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is a shame Emily Bronte died so young. Her novel is fantastic. The characters may be hard to accept for someone who lives in middle america suburbia and thinks no evil exists. This book deals with love, jealousy, revenge, hatred, dueling neighbors, and more. This novel is a must read for a lover of the classics. ... I am not going to recap the story as many as done, I would just like to say if you love a torn romance novel, this one is a must."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"One Caveat: This NOT my favorite novel.

I enjoyed it greatly."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is one of the true classic romantic novels for all time. Emily Bronte's novel was controversial at the time because of the lovers who defied social mores,and that Heathcliff was an anti-hero. It's the original gothic novel. Stephenie Meyer claims to be an heiress to Bronte,even having her heroine Bella read \\"Wuthering Heights\\",but can't hold a candle to the classic.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" has a simple premise. Catherine's father adopts a gypsy boy,Heathcliff. The two have a bond like brother and sister,but as they grow older it becomes more romantic. Catherine marries the gentle,kind,aristocratic Edgar despite the fact Heathcliff passionately desires her. Their love remains ambiguous. Did they have a mutual longing for death? Heathcliff is abusive to Catherine,avoiding her when she pines for him,wishes she were in Hell after she dies,and abuses his children. Did their love have a sexual element,making the lovers at the end unknowing half-siblings,the children of the same mother but different fathers? Some have argued that Cathy&Heathcliff;'s love is so metaphysical they never shared the bed,and that Cathy despises sex anyhow. Cathy's passion for the moors drives her to mental,then physical illness.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is as beautiful and fierce now as it was back in the 19th century. Bronte powerfully evokes the wilderness,as well as the cruelty,obsession,and passion between her leads. The moors remain as wild today."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i came across wuthering heights while i was reading the twilight series,specifically \\"eclipse\\" as it was mentioned in it..i was curious as to what the book was all about so i read it..in my opinion, it is tragically beautiful especially the catherine-heathclif's moments. true, both of them are horrible, horrible human being but when it comes to their relationship, you can't help but to root for them. One of my favourite part was when catherine was deciding whether or not to marry linton and had explained what heathcliff meant to her to her housekeeper. My favourite quotes from that part: \\"my great miseries in life has been heathcliff's\\", \\"he is more than myself than i am\\" and my favourite which was mentioned in eclipse, \\"if all else perished and he remains, i should still continue to be. but if all else remained and he were anihilated, the universe would turn into a mighty stranger\\"Another favourite part was when both of them were reunited before catherine died. there was a speck of humanity in them when they were reunited and you somehow forget how horrible they were.Another favourite part was when heathcliff learned that catherine died and the way he handled the news, it was devastating and for that moment, i feel sad for him and again, forget for a moment of how rude and vicious his character is. that one small paragraph was a mix of love and grieve all together which was written with so much power that I had to stop reading for a minute to digest it.the story is mostly about the consequences of the love between catherine and heathcliff..their love affected a lot of people and i guess it shows the dark side of love and obsession."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've tried to read a number of Classics, and usually think people must have been awfully bored before the electronic age to slog through them and enjoy it. This was the exception. These people are so weird (and savage) it's practically like reading science fiction. A fascinating, and compelling, glimpse at what life might have been like at one time, rather than the white-washed image we usually get -- spun to our current sensibilities."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't know what else to say beyond that. How can you not love a classic?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As an English teacher as well as parent to several kids having gone through high school, please recognize that boys (even Honors level students) are turned off to reading even such beloved novels as Wuthering Heights. Classic novels primarily about love and romance can be offered but should not be assigned to 15-year-old boys since, generally speaking, they are not interested in this type novel and tend to avoid reading it at all cost. There are so many wonderful novels (Of Mice and Men, Lord of the Flies, for example) that will engage even the most reluctant readers, and can be offered as a choice to the more girl-oriented classics. Teachers, please be conscious of assigning these books without offering an option. Otherwise they do the opposite of that which you hope to instill in them . . . deterrents to reading! To those choosing to read this book for its classic value, this version of Wuthering Heights is very reader-friendly. I liked it the best of the many versions, especially for younger readers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a good version, the whole book is there (some versions have made it two volumes) with space between chapters to write your notes. Short, concise and helpful notes on the themes and motifs in the front of the book.As for the book itself, it has old-fashioned language though it is poetic enough for anyone to enjoy. The tone is dark, but en-capturing and exiting on a social psychological level. It can teach you a thing or two about the effects society and upbringing have on people."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is easy to understand why Emily Bront's first (and only) novel was ill-received upon its first publication. Perhaps the ultimate Gothic novel, Wuthering Heights is a far cry from the simple tale of ill-starred lovers one might expect from the pen of a Bront. Dark, sordid, even vulgar at times, the story of anti-hero Heathcliff - a gypsy child adopted, but never accepted, by the Earnshaw family of Wuthering Heights - teems with all the basest passions of mankind.Befriended only by the younger Earnshaw child, a girl named Catherine, Heathcliff grows to hate all those who dare tread upon him because of his low birth. He grows obsessively attached to the beautiful, wild-spirited Catherine, and when her pride forces her to marry another rather than stoop to Heathcliff's own station in life, he begins plotting the grand revenge that will send all of them to their graves.Few - if any - likable characters populate this book. It is a tale of love, but it is not an uplifting tale. It is a story of cruelty, selfish passion, vengeance, and finally madness. Despite its depressing theme, however, Bront's exceptional writing raises it to the deservedly lofty height of a classic.Told mostly through the first-person narration of housekeeper Ellen Dean, the story progresses through Heathcliff's tormented childhood, Catherine's marriage to Edgar Linton, Heathcliff's elaborate revenge against the child of Catherine and Edgar's marriage, and finally his strange departure from the world of the Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Seriously hated every page of this book. Not that it matters, but I read a lot of classic literature, and this is by far the worst book I have ever read. The characters were mean, vile and had no redeeming qualities. It must have read like absolute trash in the time period it was written, and still does today. I fail to see how anybody could find this story romantic. If a man told me that this book epitomizes his idea of romance, I would run for the hills and never look back. I honestly can't waste any more time on this book, even to write a lengthier review."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I received this book in a timely matter and it was also in great shape and very clean.

I get it that Heathcliff and Catherine had a deep, passionate love for each other. But neither is a lovable character and I can't imagine falling in love with either of them. I wonder if this is a book that does not translate well from the era in which it was written to the modern day. (I think Heathcliff would be reported to child protective services in today's world.) I got through it, but it just wasn't the epic love story I was anticipating."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Maybe I wasn't paying attention- I had no idea this would be a tiny little book (about 3\\"x4\\") tiny little pages, tiny little print....I'll have to order another book--adult size"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I really didn't like this book. I know it's supposed to be a classic, but there are hundreds of really good books in this world, and this just isn't one of them.We always try to compare the Bronte girls to Jane Austen, but each of the Bronte sisters published her first book in 1847, and Jane Austen's books were published between 1811 and 1817, so they aren't really contemporaries. Austen's books really describe everyday family concerns, mostly relating to marriage. Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights both described families and their connections, but the stories were more out of the ordinary; these are almost more like soap operas than like Austen novels. This book contains some references to a ghost and lots of cruelty and intrigue, none of which exist in Austen's books.Another huge difference between this book and Austen's is that none of the main characters are likeable: Hindley was mean to Heathcliff, Heathcliff is a jerk to everyone, Catherine and Cathy are both a little spoiled, Hareton is proud and rude, and Joseph is just annoying. There are only three characters who aren't awful, and one dies pretty quickly.English teachers will probably still force their students to read this, but I'll stick with Austen myself."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My only complaint with this Oxford version is that the explanatory notes are all at the very end of the book, not on the individual pages (ie, footnotes).

'Wuthering Heights' is amazing. The story is intense and passionate. It makes a bold statement on bi-racial love, class and cultural barriers, and revenge. My most favorite character is the most evil of them all - Heathcliff. His story just shows how much damage resentment, pride and revenge can do to a human being. It is a timeless lesson. The only negative of this book is that the relationship between Catherine, the younger and Hareton feels underdeveloped. It just happens too quickly. Otherwise, I think the ending is appropriate. The younger characters don't repeat the mistake of their elders. Too bad they're cousins. It gives the story a twisted, perverted edge. In the end, though, this book is most certainly worth the read. The story is captivating, suspenseful and intense. When you read it, you don't know what's going to happen next. You just want to keep reading to find out. A genuine treat.

It is no wonder that during the life of the author, she never received the satisfaction of knowing what a classic she had written - it was only after the reprinting of her novel, posthumous, that Emily Bronte received the praise that she deserved, for a book that deserves much more than a praise.I read \\"Wuthering Heights\\" often - not because I believe in I believe in the dramatics of love, but simply because I believe in it. Love, that is. Wuthering Heights is full of characters who are morally bankrupt, and despicable to the core - but you cannot help but feel for them anyway. One moment you feel sorry for Heathcliff, and with the turn of a page, are filled with such hatred for him. But that an author can create such convincing characters, that they can evoke such emotions in you, is what makes this book so special. For me it's a lesson, that when one finds love, one must look past the color, the creed, the caste and the credentials to embrace what you have found - for if you let it go, you will break your own heart, and in the process, bring pain to all hearts enjoined with yours. A classic tale, about love, friendship and betrayal - a must read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The basic premise is about two children growing up in the same house- clever and mischievous Cathy and enigmatic Heathcliff. They soon go beyond normal sibling interaction and enter an obsessive an disturbing love affair with one another, but due to Heathcliff's status as an adopted street arab and Cathy's death, they can never be together. Gradually, Heathcliff is driven to near insanity, and the story continues from the eyes of Nellie, a maid, and Cathy, the first Cathy's daughter.*** SPOILER ALERT***A little warning to anyone who was expecting a happy story- this isn't one. Cathy and Heathcliff's \\"love\\" can best be described as creepy attatchment, and the ending gave me nightmares for a week.That being said, there are some genuinely touching moments in Wuthering Heights, such as when Cathy 2 makes peace with her cousin and tries to teach him how to read. Cathy 1's and Heathcliff's childhood interactions are also sweet.But at first glance, there is little that's likeable. The characters are fairly unpleasant and cruel to one another. What redeems them is that they're interesting; even if you were rooting for their deaths at the end (hi, Heathcliff), you still want to know what happens to them.What really makes this book soar is a gorgeous and dark writing style. Emily Bronte manages to pull off a very difficult piece with flying colors. The details make the book come alive and the sense of urgency was beautiful. It's hard to describe, but there's a dreamy lyrical quality, almost as though you're in a seductive nightmare. What makes me give her even more props is that everything about Wuthering Heights is balancing delicately- a wrong chapter or so and the story would collapse.The overall method of telling the story is also great. Told through Nellie's careful first person PoV, Heathcliff and Cathy are allowed to remain enigmatic and seem as though there's more than what meets the eye, like a veil over everything.I would recommend this, but not for most children. It's more of a psychological thriller than anything else, but wonderfully written and a compelling story with beautiful development."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i was made to read this in high school and hated every word of it...how could i like a book where i despised every character, right?? then i read it again in my mid 20's and i still despised every character...but absolutely loved it! it's now one of my fave novels and i've read it many times over. i think the style and subject matter is a little beyond the reach of most teens and it's a shame it's offered to them as it has probably put many off trying many of the classics later in life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Such a dark love story that started from two people but affected everyone around them. Filled with anger, obsession, revenge, and pride."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In my opinion, Wuthering Heights is one of the greatest classics of all times, ranking up their with Romeo and Juliet and Pride and Prejudice! The way Emily Bronte wrote of the unending love between Heathcliff and Catherine is captivating, especially when you read the story of Ms. Bronte and how she came to create the story. A must read for all lovers of classic novels!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The book, Wuthering Heights is a classic love story set in the time period of the 1700s. Emily Bronte focuses on the sad and tragic unforbbiden love between Catherine Earshaw and Healthcliff as well as the even more heartbreaking story of Catherine Linton. The story of the two young women is told by Ms. Nelly Dean, who is relating the story to a character by the name of Mr. Lockwood, who lives on the propety owned by Heathcliff, the major antagonist throughout the book.The setting of the book is set during the 17-1800s, which is stated by Mr. Lockwood in the beginning of the story. He starts out by describing his \\"days as a tenant at Thrushcross grange in the year 1801\\" (chapter 1, page 1). Healthcliff is relating his adventure to Nelly Dean telling her that he and Catherine wanted to get \\"a glimpse of the grange lights,\\" (chapter 6, pg 46). This is a clue because grange lights are lanterns and it shows that electricity was not invented just yet, so it can't be anything after the 1800s. Another clue came from Heathcliff again when he states, \\"or reading sermons, and being catechized by their manservant, and set to learn a column of scripture names if they don't answer properly?\\", (chapter 6, pg 46). Religion was prominent all throughout Europe in this time era, so the setting is appearant in the beginning of the book.Conflict is a major reappearing event that is found throughout this entire novel. The first and the most significant is found in chapter 9, pg 78. \\"It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; and he shall never know how I love him...he's more myself than I am.\\" This is the beginning of the love triangle that develops because Catherina loves Heathcliff more than anything else in the world, but they can never be together, (while they're living). The next major conflict in the story arises from Catherine and Heathcliff's offspring. \\"And believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if i deserved your love...,\\" (chapter 24, pg 243). Linton's declaration of his love for the young Cathy is shown, which signifies the beginning of their love and the horrible revenge that is exacted on them by Heathcliff. The interesting and tragic conflict that occurs between Heathcliff and Catherine comes when she passes away from insanity and a broken heart. I adore the love between Heathcliff and Catherine, aside from the turmoil and havoc it brings. \\"She has disturbed me-incessantly-remorselessly-till yesternight and yesternight i was tranquil\\", (chapter 29, pg 275). This quote showed me something different. A conflict felt within Heathcliff's heart about loving Catherine and being haunted and agonized by her soul for 18 years while still loving her and withstanding the pain.Wuthering Heights was defnitely a book I'll always hold dear to my heart. Emily Bronte knows how to write an epic book that kept me raptured from beginning to the end."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A young girl by the name of Emily Bronte delivered the world a story. Although 'love' is contained in all aspects of this book, this is not a love story. Wuthering Neights is the tragic and heartbreaking story of two lovers destroyed, and the outcomes that follow.From beginning to end, this novel was a page-turner for me. I simply did not want to put it down, and at times, I couldn't. We begin our story with Mr. Lockwood, a new tenant in the manor of Thrushcross Grange. Throughout the story, he writes in his diary, documenting the life of the inhabitants of Thrushcross Grange. Though Wuthering Heights is told through the viewpoint of more than one person, everything is documented by Mr. Lockwood himself. The setting is in England, 1801. If you are a fan of the Bronte sister's or tragic British literature, then this is the story for you! We have our resident of Wuthering Heights: grumpy Mr. Heathcliff, the landlord. The state of the manor is unacceptable to our newcomer, but he leaves determined to make a better impression than his first. His sights of the manor are atrocious as he describes it on page 9 as, \\"the walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment, 'Go the to Deuce', even the gate over which leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words.\\" As rude as the atmosphere was, he returns for more, to write a story.On our new day, we meet Joseph, our very own illiterate and unhappy servant. Following, we meet the beautiful but pale young man, Catherine Linton and a young man by the name of Hareton Earnshaw. The names confuse Lockwood and he recognizes the tension and mystery within this 'family'. After a strange and frightening encounter that you will read about, he retreats to his home.Meeting up with his servants, we are introduced to Nelly, who has great ties with the residents of Thrushcross Grange. The story unfolds into a mess of tragic love, as we are whisked away to 20 years in the past, as told by Nelly. She was a servant to the Earnshaw family, whom we meet early on. There is Catherine, Hindley, Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw. One day, after returning from a long trip, Mr. Earnshaw brings back a boy rather than a souvenir. His name is Heathcliff and he is a gipsy boy from the streets of England who comes into their family, and leaves them changed forever. There is tension within this household, but only towards the two young boys who you will read about. Heathcliff and Catherine hit it off early and are the best of friends. However, society would have things different.As I mentioned before, this is not a love story. As we progress, we find this to be more of tragedy, failed love and revenge. So much evil doings and rebellion unfolds as you read on, that it will make your heart burst! Every harsh and cruel decision made through rude intentions causes you to be ripped apart, but it gets better! I cannot even put to words the way that Wuthering Heights will mess with your emotions, but it is definitely worth it! Catherine and Heathcliff find love, but the standards of the world would prove to be stronger than they could handle at such a young age. The bond they would create is soon left to wither away and haunt them forever. The legacy they leave is known by all. I encourage all readers to not underestimate the tragedy of these pages. It is gripping, heart-wrenching and unforgettable. It has personally moved me and I could not ask for more!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have just finished reading Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. It's probably safe to say that this was about the millionth time I have read this classic. Forget the Twilight Series and Edgar! When I was a teen, I thought it was all about Heathcliff's brooding devotion to Catherine even 20 years after her death. With that in mind, I was curious to reread Wuthering Heights now as a middle-aged mom. The verdict?

It is definitely not appropriate for someone who isn't an avid reader."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"You can't go wrong with the Bronte sisters when in the mood for a romantic novel. The characters are complex and compelling."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If one wants to be bored into tears, one should invest in this unreasonably terrible. The only thing I liked about it was the fact that it cured my sleep deprivation problem. At the end of the book, nothing has happened other than a bunch of funerals. I may be young and stupid but I believe that I am advanced enough to know the work of a inept writer. You can cast my opinion away because my young age, but from &quot;See Spot Run&quot; to &quot;King James' Bible&quot; there has never been a book so gargantuously horrible."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Bronte does no follow up on any characters and leaves us grasping at what the meaning of all the action. For example, someone will get married and then Bronte just leaves it at that. Just because they fight with each other later on merely shows that self absorbed people don't get along. Dear Bronte, if you're going to write a book, add more to the characters and don't just state the obvious. Also, why did you include that dream about Cathy Linton in the beginning and not have any more supernatural stuff later? You should involve the supernatural and not just mention or include it. One star is generous"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Set on the moors, it is a pity that the Hound of the Baskervilles didn't get 'em.

Itis the five miles of country which makes the danger.\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"OK, I'm not an absolute fan of Victorian Era novels, and never will be, but I am a lover of classic literature. I read this book as a Freshman in High School, and let me tell you, unless you want something to prop up a wobly table (and with abouuut 400 pages, it does a very good job), don't even consider buying this wretched novel. I'd rather read Jane Eyre again before even attempting to read this terrible piece of literature. If you want something from the Victorian Era, go grab Sense and Sensibility, that at least makes some sense. For the love of all that is Holy, though, don't buy this book!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was expecting something in the vein of Jane Eyre when I began to read this book. I was sorely disappointed. True, the violent love between Heathcliff and Catherine is heartwrenching; however, the most difficult part of this novel for me was that there was no character that was lovable, or sympathetic. Just when I started to think that Heathcliff was not so bad after all, he would commit another shocking deed of horrific cruelty. Catherine was just annoying. I also found the plot hard to follow, what with a third person telling the story, and then swinging back to first person narrative. If you want a really powerful, uplifting love story, read Jane Eyre, or The Blue Castle by L.M. Montgomery."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For someone who spent her whole life in a churchyard, Emily Bronte had an astonishing amount of imagination...but, why waste it on this horribly pathetic, melodramatic garbage? I read it when I was thirteen, didn't like it, and was forced to read it again in high school. Do yourself a favor and read Jane Eyre instead."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights great example of mid-18th century literature but lacks the hook needed to engage the reader. The overly dramatic love scenes and long drawn out sections provide the periods of ennui. The characters are poorly developed, and the lack of minor characters leaves the reader wandering. The novel seems to start off sluggishly, and then it picks up, only to be followed by the slowness again. If anything, Wuthering Heights shows the destructiveness of love and revenge through the character Heathcliff. The novel seemed to be one long drawn out soap opera, where the characters rarely changed and new characters were rarely added. Overall, this novel does not meet the adoration that it is constantly given."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"And just why would Ms. Bronte write a book with not a single likeable character? In fact, everyone in the novel would be rejected by Jerry Springer as being too degenerate for his show. No doubt the writing is facile enough, but by page 5, the story itself descends into what has to be the most turgid potboiler imagineable. It's all there: lynching a litter of puppies,hanging a springer spaniel,unceasing child abuse, the brutalization of women, and pretty descriptions of the seasons. Highly recommended for the budding mass murderer."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What a waste of time, precious time in my life that I will never be able to get back. The only good part was the end when I tossed the book into the fireplace and watched it burn."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Possibly the most uninspiring and redundant book I've ever read, Wuthering Heights is inundated with Emily Bronte's so-called unique style. It's style is unique alright, if by unique you mean a brand new alternative form of euthanasia. Nevermind the fact that Bronte's \\"paragraphs\\", which are actually composed of one or two extremely long sentences, have superfluous clauses slapped on top of each other repeatedly. The syntax of these sentences is not stiff or constipated, but in fact, it is just the opposite. It is more like the imbibement of heavy laxatives, and the resulting inducement of loose and watery diarrhea that runs across the pages, unpredictable in its rampant tides that sends everyone over the hills. When do the prepositional phrases stop Emily? When? Unfortunately, this was a book that I was required to read for school, and I managed to read a grand total of half of the book before I shut it, never to bother it again. However, what do I know, I'm just a high school student that is just following his personal intuitions about Wuthering Heights. For a more thought-provoking and relevant book in modern-day society, go read George Orwell's 1984. You'd be surprised at how its content trumps the romantic trainwreck that is the brainchild of Emily Bronte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i wrote my full review on my test mr matta im just lazy because i dont want to type it allWuthering heights is a good book. If one does not pay full attention and not try to multi task while reading u will get lost, and end up hating classical literature and then not getting a good education then working as a a bus boy for those who did get a godd education (dramatization)Wuthering Heights is the height of classical literature and shows the best of victorian literature (yet another dramatization). I still think the book is a must read because it is very entertaining and it makes u look smart when u talk to stupid people about it: )in closing words i have to quote the most psychologically insane, obsurdely stupid person in mr matta's class \\"Cleafy!\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you're looking for a classic that's a great read, then Emily Brontes Wuthering Heights.This book is about a man named Lockwood who comes to Wuthering Heights for a job as a servant. When he meets a man named Heathcliff and becomes interested in his heritage. He learns from a woman named Nelly Dean that Heathcliff is a very interesting person.

Now a new love story comes out consisting those three children.You will not be sorry you read this book. It's a tragic reality love story and it's a classic. What do you have to lose?It's a great book that is a lesson for life. Wuthering Heights teaches you about the difference between your body and your soul."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you don't know anything about Emily Bronte or you don't like her style of literature, then I would warn you to stay away from this and look up one of the many other classics like &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; or &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Here's why:Confusing -- Several characters all share the same/similar names which sometimes makes it confusing.Unsympathetic characters -- I felt that Heathcliff was such a total jerk that he didn't deserve any sympathy whatsoever. So that made it hard for me to sympathize with the woman who loved him, which in turn forced me to reject the concept of this being a love story. Even the most vile villans of all time usually exhibit one small redeeming quality. I felt that Healthcliff didn't and thus I didn't care what happened to him or his love interest.Boring -- Nothing good happens.If you like Emily Bronte nothing I say here will change your mind, but if you don't or are reluctant, then stay away from this one."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Well as if the Nineteenth Century weren't bad enough we now have Penguin shoving it down our maws every other day with another re-issue of some tepid &quot;classic.&quot; Miss Bronte has done it again and wielded her magic pen as a wand and cast her net of sleep on the unsuspecting reading public of America.
