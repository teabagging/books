The story is written in Eliot's astute and intelligent way with words, and also sparks discussion of some underlying themes (such as religious faith issues). It would be wonderful if A&E or the BBC would give it a faithful movie adaptation. We only have Steve Martin's movie, \\"A Simple Twist of Fate,\\" that is loosely based on the text of this timeless story.

It begins with our hero, Silas Marner, a lonely, luckless old man, being robbed of his life savings. But then a mysterious appearance of a homeless, golden-haired little girl opens up an unexpected new chapter in his life. Silas Marner was a weaver who through loneliness and through life's occurrences becomes bitter and miserly. The theft of his life savings causes him to rethink everything about his life. Ms. Eliot also introduces Godfrey Cass to her cast of characters. Godfrey is a foil to Silas. He is the real father of Eppie, the young girl that Silas adopts. We watch as Silas' lot and outlook on life improve, Godfrey's life dissolves into disappointment, fear and guilt. The book is not \\"preachy\\", but a reader cannot help but be improved by reading and learning the moral lessons that it delivers."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"When I first started reading this book years ago my first impression was how boring, but as I read on it became more and more interesting.

This book changed my life."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"This 19th century classic by George Eliot/Maryann Evans retains its timeless appeal; it charms and touches us no matter how jaded or sophisticated we consider ourselves. Perhaps the characters are something out of Dickens (in their extreem personality types and the idealized heroine). Yet this novel reaches our inner selves, where it is safe to applaud the unselfish and the compassionate, to appreciate social redemption and sincere devotion.Silas, a disillusioned weaver who lives the life of a recluse, has never been accepted by the villagers of Raveloe. Paid in gold for his fine cloth, Marner hoards most of it in an iron pot buried in the sand under his loom. Having lost faith in God, church and his fellow men because of a tragic injustice in his former town, he lavishes his lamentable affection on indifferent gold. Until it is stolen.The theft of this gold--his only friend as it were--leaves him desvastated. Yet fate seems to compensate him by the sudden apperance of a golden-curled baby, who toddles over his doorway one night when he is in a mild catatonic state.How Eppie pulls at his heart and transforms his miserable, miserly life is the soul of this novelette. Evans' weaves a tapestry of tenderness and redemption through juvenile affection. SILAS MARNER remains a contemplative read for students 14 and up, and for all who enjoy British classical literature. The action is in the Heart."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"George Eliot's SILAS MARNER is a literary classic. What does that mean? A classic is a book that has passed the test of time. A book taken out of its historical milieu and placed in a contemporary one, e.g. our 2008 society, and still reads fresh is a classic.SILAS MARNER still reads fresh, if you are a sophisticated reader or have a teacher to guide you through the ground mines of vocabulary and complex writing. However, wrapped inside those is a great story, even a soap opera that students recognize as soon as the Cass brothers are introduced.Two story lines run parallel until they intersect with the theft of Silas's gold. Silas Marner has been in this village for seventeen years, living a life of isolation, while he makes a living as a weaver. Even if he had chosen to live amongst people, he possesses two things that would always hinder acceptance: he is a herbalist and a victim of catatonic seizures. He discontinues his use of herbs early on, but he cannot stop catatonia, which of course becomes a metaphor for his life with others before Eppy appears.It is these quiet seizures that result in blackouts that--bottom line--cause his banishment from a religious community where he was highly respected. In the seventeen years near Raveloe, nothing has happened to change his life with a dead heart. His great love in this time is his growing stacks of gold. He loves it! He idolizes it!Enter Godfrey and Dunstan Cass, two landed gentry, both dissolute in differing ways, both catalysts in the change in Silas Marner's dull life. The younger brother, Dunstan, is a n'er-do-well, a gambler in debt and subject to embarrassment by a man to whom Dunstan owes a great deal of money. He finds gold in Silas's house. On the other hand, Godfrey leads a superficial respectable life, because he too has indulged himself and has a child born out of wedlock.One cold, dark, stormy night two stories intersect: Dunstan steals Silas's gold, then disappears forever, and Silas is devastated by the loss of his gold. However, this loss brings Silas into community. The night the golden-haired child appears magically on Silas's hearth clinches Silas's total acceptance into village life. Silas adopts this child and Dolly Winthrop becomes his guiding angel in helping to raise the child.When the two secrets are revealed concerning Dunstan and Godfrey, the reader cheers Silas on, directs hisses at Godfrey, and stands amazed at Dunstan's revelation.Inside this \\"soap opera\\" is a fabulous story of love and redemption. Without love one man lives a life of solace in gold with a heart dried and shriveled. With love his heart beats passionately and lovingly and makes him live fully with family and friends. No greater lesson can come from a story as one of redemption. From the still-point of one golden-haired girl radiates a life that redeems a man.George Eliot, or Mary Ann Evans, is a genius in depicting the lives of men and women and their influence on others for good or evil. Eppy is the source of good out of sinful circumstances and selfishness on Godfrey's part. Godfrey continues his static life force by not claiming his child at one point and trying to claim her when it is too late. The contrast between one man who has little and the other who has everything is instructive in explaining the ways of the heart.If I were marooned on a deserted island and could take ten books with me, SILAS MARNER would definitely be on the list. It is a great book to teach and listen to students respond to it (and NO, I won't be stranded with students). Watching their faces in class discussion concerning Dunstan's re-appearance in Raveloe is absolutely priceless. Even though the foreshadowing is huge, students never figure out what happens.Just think of all the choices we make in our lives, some irrevocable as to cause and effect. SILAS MARNER is a caution and a beacon to making the right choices. Making wrong choices to hide one's actions, more often than not, results in dire consequences. Silas shows us that right actions produce right results. I love this book!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"This is George Eliot's most compact novel, but it is a stunner.It is basically the story of loss of faith, and its replacement--first, by money, then (when the money is stolen) by love. It is also a secular resurrection story: Silas, after losing his friends, his faith, and his fiance, becomes a reclusive, obsessive weaver, who is essentially dead to society and himself. He hoards his money, but when it is lost, he finds the baby, Eppie, who is a greater treasure, and who essentially restores his life.It is also a terrific study in Class Conflict--a favorite of Eliot's. Silas, of the lowest (almost serf) class, is hardworking, honest, helpful, whereas the Casses, Dunstan and Godfrey, are both aristocratic scoundrels. Dunstan steals Marner's money; Godfrey attempts to steal his child.The language may be daunting to modern readers, but it was standard prose for Victorian novels. Oddly, the most difficult chapter for readers today, Chapter 6, was the one most loved in Eliot's day: it is a tour de force of local dialect of the Midlands.Eliot, as usual, sees clearly, almost like God: she knows everyone's flaws and strengths, and is harsh on what causes harm to others; but she is always generous-hearted and understanding."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Silas Marner is a classic.

My parents adopted 3 children, so I love this story's look at adoption and how it's the love and time put into raising a child that are important; being related by blood doesn't matter. This book shows that our mistakes can't truly be hidden; they will always be there in the back of our minds bugging us until they are exposed in the end. So it's best to take responsibility for our mistakes and go through the repentance process, instead of hiding mistakes for \\"convenience.\\" I love how Silas is healed from his suffering and gloom through the love of a child. George Eliot is a masterful author."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"As usual, Focus on the Family does a wonderful job at dramatizing this classic story. They use first-class voice actors and sound effects. However, this version does not quite reach the level of the original book. It is not that there is any lack of quality, but just that something is lost in translation when a book is dramatized. No matter how good a dramatization is, it loses some of the depth of the book.However, this dramatization is high-quality entertainment and I highly recommend it.

And as the book went on, I almost felt myself getting dimmer,more cut off from society. It was rather sad.The book isn't the best representative of what life in 19th century England would have been like, but it is a very good picture of how uncultured people treat other people from other lands. It's only when misfortune falls upon that person, do they accept them.I absolutely loved the fact that Silas found a \\"golden-haired replacement\\". That was the sweetest thing I've read in my life, how he instantly wanted to protect her and give her the best things in life. Godfrey seemed nice at first, but as the book uncovered his past, I started to like him less and less. He needed to act like a man, buck up and take control of his life, and not be constantly cowed by his father. I can understand due to the time period why he thought Eppie would come with him and Nancy, but still, the way he kept asking even after she said no the first time was rude.The book was very uninteresting in the beginning. I had to force myself to read it. It was only after Dunsey stole Silas's money that it began to be interesting. Still, it was a sweet book and I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"George Eliot is the best woman author I've ever read. She had God-given talent that you or I, no matter how much we read, no matter how much we write, could not consciously replicate. She had something which can't be taught, a kernel of genius hidden somewhere in the brain, which was allowed to express itself...to our collective benefit.Silas Marner, while not perfect, is something recognizably special--a book with lingering phrases, a book with extraordinary insight, a book that instates the reader with the feeling that the author knows what the hell she is doing. It's a book that matters.I know what you are afraid of: you are afraid this book will be a bloated succession of tea parties and persiflage with mutton-chopped vicars. No fear: the plot is credibly organic, and moves along briskly, wrapping itself up in just over two-hundred pages. It should hold your interest so that you can discover the ten or so gem-sentences dispersed throughout. Sentences that are not just airtight, but that meld with your mind, and cause an \\"Aha!\\" reaction. You know what I'm talking about.Perhaps the most convincing signal I can offer of my sincere regard for her abilities is the fact that I'll now seek out her other works...something I can't say about Virginia Woolf, for instance, whose literary inferiority to Eliot I would take as axiomatic. (Ironic, isn't it--or maybe not--that feminists seem to esteem Woolf more highly than Eliot?)"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Silas Marner by George Eliot, the pen name of Mary Evans, is a well-written story, made more so by the fact it was written by a woman in the Victorian Age. The novel is set in the early nineteenth century England, during a time that society had three distinct classes: the rich and powerful, the working people, and the tradesmen.While the characters personalities in the book seem exaggerated to make there qualities or faults more obvious, Eliot's detailed descriptions of the people made it easy to create a mental picture of them. Though the book is well written, the style of language makes it hard to read and even harder to understand. I found I had to read it more then once and spend time thinking it through to get to the point of enjoying it. Silas Marner has many valuable moral and lessons in it, the most important one being that people are worth more than gold."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"The fact that Amazon has so many editions of Silas Marner available indicates that it is truly a classic if it is still being read more than 150 years after it was written.It is unfortunate that some high school reviewers (or former high school readers) feel that they had this book \\"forced\\" on them. Yes, the English language has changed since the early 19th century, especially for American readers of this British author.My suggestion would be to listen to \\"Silas Marner\\" as an audiobook, perhaps while reading along. I recently finished listening to this fine book narrated by Margaret Hilton, but I couldn't find her rendition among the titles available here. I'm sure there are many fine versions available.So, give this tale a listen, and let the language flow into your ears. Then you will discover why this tale about a miserly old weaver, who has been wronged by his neighbors more than once, finds redemption and a new life when he adopts the little girl left on his doorstep is truly a classic."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Here's a blast from the past. I must have been nearly illiterate when Silas Marner turned up as part of my 9th grade English class. By all recollection, the text was reprinted into our English text book for that year; and it was a class-wide assignment during that year.My best memory is that I couldn't read it; I couldn't understand a thing about it; it was daunting. Somehow, I got a good grade in the class: it was either that the standards had already fallen or maybe that it was just the Cliff's Notes allowing me to escape the experience with pretense that I may have actually read it at the time.So, it happened to come across my desk four decades later (February 2013); actually it showed up on my Kindle app when we purchased the complete works of George Eliot, when my wife wanted to read Middlemarch --- who knew that George Eliot was a pen name for a female author of the early 1800s, at a time when only male authors could garner a readership.I suppose a theme of man's moral certitude and the perseverance of man's spirit could be a central message here. But I wasn't struck with a particularly artistic nor elegant narrative. It all seemed a bit on the stilted side, although with some flowery language sprinkled in. The unfolding of events is more or less just told straight out, and not revealed using a colorfully narrated unfolding of events.I ploughed through it with a sense of duty to complete something that I only pretended to complete in high school. And I was immensely relieved to discover that it wasn't unreadable, as I had thought all these years.

This is definitely a book that you cannot read/skim like you can in most others. You have to carefully read and think about every sentence in order to comprehend the plot. The book gets better about half-way through, where more conversation takes place and is easier to follow.

The book starts off slow but gets more interesting as you get into it. It's a good book about how lies can ruin peoples' lives. I am giving a mixed review because it has both good and bad points to it. In the book Silas Marner, there is a man named Silas who lives in a small town. One day he is betrayed by his best friend and gets into a lot of trouble. After that he moves to another town were he is an outcast. He works as a weaver; he was the only one in the town so he made a lot of money. One day something happens that causes great pain to him, but one day someone comes to him and turns his life around. He is happier than he was before because he realizes that there is more to life than his money. The book has many good points to it. It has some good morals to it which are nice to know. One of the morals are that people shouldn't tell lies or keep secrets because they aren't good for the people involved. That is why this book is a good one to read. The book is bad because it was hard to understand what is going on all the time. It wouldn't be a good book for people younger than the ninth grade to read because it is hard to understand. It would be a hard book for younger people to read. It is also slow through the first part of the book because it just gives information and nothing happens. That is why it isn't a good book to read. Even with these problems, it would be a good book for older people to read."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"After Silas Marner's hoard of money was stolen, I was afraid this would be another dreary, Bronte-like novel, full of doom, gloom and cruelty.

The author paints for us all kinds of interesting scenes of life in a small English village in the 19th century. We read of virtue and vice, pompousness and humility, love and devotion, and even of good intentions backfiring.All in all, this is a pleasant read. The good are rewarded and the bad get their just deserts."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"I give the book Silas Marner a mixed review because although it is a good book with a lot of details, it is hard for younger people to understand. I am a freshman in high school and I found it difficult to read. Geoge Eliot has written a fable about Silas Marner. After his friend blackmails him, Silas moves to Raveloe after losing his faith in the Lord and starts a new life. He gets rich from weaving and becomes obsessed with his gold. His life starts to crumble after something happens and then it all comes back when a little girl with golden hair comes to his cottage.Silas Marner is not the best book because the narrator tried too pack to much information in to this book for how short it is. It is too hard for younger people to read because of the hard words like metamorphosis and the time period it is written in which was the Victorian age. Another bad thing about it is there are too many coincidences in it that makes it seem like a fairy tale; for example, like when Silas has his fits at the most convenient time in the plot. Some good things about the novel are that there are some good morals in it for people to learn. Eliot helps up realize the importance of love, trust and religion as Silas loses and gains these things back again. Some other morals that I learned from reading this book are not to keep lies from the people that you love and to always think about your decisions. All an all, Silas Marner is a good book.

However, that's not how this book is written. The basic plot doesn't get set into motion until about 120 pages in...and the book is 183 pages. To put it bluntly, the first 120 pages are spent aimlessly pondering life's many riddles and offering sometimes interesting, yet mostly tiring social commentary (I really don't care how the people at the Red House and the Rainbow act similarly despite class differences. I just want to finish this reading assignment so I can actually enjoy my summer).

The middle and the end are the best parts because they at least have some excitement with some people dying in the snow and the water. I think there should be some more action in the book like fights. I am a freshman in high school, and I thought that the book was kind of hard to read because of the long paragraphs and the hard vocabulary in the book. I do not recommend this book to high school freshman because it is hard to read and hard to follow.Silas Marner is a good book because it teaches you some lessons on life. It has some good morals like to think thoroughly before you marry or before you have kids. I think that George Eliot did a very good job of writing the story with the morals even with the hard vocabulary and the long chapters and paragraphs.

His growing isolation is described in a fair amount of detail, but his transformation is glossed over too quickly. It is simply not believable that someone who shuns others would be so willing to adopt a child and change so quickly. The message that love can transform even the most hardened person is beautiful, and the ending is wonderful, but I found it difficult to make it through most of this book."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"If compared to Eliot's best (Middlemarch, Mill on the Floss), Silas Marner is almost a disgrace. The brilliant literary style of Eliot seems all but gone, and the story could have easily been dispensed with in a form of a short story. The story, taken on its own, is heart-warming. But there is so much &quot;background noise&quot; to contend with. Overall this book should be a definite miss, even for Eliot fans (like me!).In addition I'm quite surprised this novel is used as part of the English literature curriculum in many schools (here in England at least). I feel sorry for those young minds having to wade through this. I hope schools will choose Mill on the Floss instead despite its length."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans)wrote \\"Silas Marner\\" in 1861 and it is still being read to date. I read it first in junior high school, so long ago I had forgotten what it was about so I reread it. I had high expectations for it, lasting so long but I was disappointed. First, it is a hard read, her sentences are so long and so convoluted it is hard to maintain the connection from one sentence to the next. In addition many sentences are written phonetically, to create, I guess, the sense of the spoken word in the time period (early 1800's) as well as its sound and locale(Warwickshire, middle England). Add to that the coincidences involved to have the novel generate the correct happenstances of most of its characters and you have a novel incorporating most of the defects most stressed in English writing courses. How could this story have survived 150 years? If the reader is a juvenile he or she empathises with the characters and wants them to get their just desserts, and the reader has an opinion of who gets what. Eliot satisfies these desires and the young reader has read a story with characters who strike a responsive chord with the reader who then keeps the story in memory.Most accounts of the novel speak highly of the effect of Eppie, the supposed orphan, on the protagonist, Silas Marner. But she does not appear until about two thirds of the book has been read and I think this makes her a minor character. The book is primarily devoted to character changes in Silas Marner and Godfrey Cass, that is what the book is about. Yes, Eppie is the major factor in Silas's changed character but first his character must be developed. The same is true of Godfrey Cass, the biological father of the girl. His character is developed independently of her; Nancy Lammeter does her duty towards him but she does not get the attention Eppie does. The title of the book is Silas Marner but he only gets a slightly greater mention than Godfrey, the title must be the deciding factor. I think the book is highly overrated and is a book for juveniles except its construction is so difficult it is hard to praise for young readers. But I think I read it in juhior high, has reading changed for present day youth?"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"A wonderful story of love and commitment.

Going in, you have to know that Eliot is a master at words and dialects and that this will not be easy reading. I did find that reading it was tedious at times. It wasn't the kind of book that I couldn't put down or that I'd look forward with eagerness to picking up again.That said, there is much to recommend this book. The morals and the values are excellent. From the first few chapters, you might be afraid that the book is going to be filled with rather amoral, money-grubbing characters, but you will soon find that the good, decent people here are head and shoulders above many people. There is one thing about certain writers of classics--when people are good or evolve from good to better they are superior people. You'd be hard put to find such perfect people. The father-daughter relationship in this book is incredible. I'm always amazed at the classics that have extended families living together and it's all so beautiful. The in-laws become beloved family members and look after the old folks as though they were blood relations. It's a fairy-tale experience, but if you can suspend judgment and believe that people can live together in harmony, not to mention choosing the spiritual over the material, your heart and soul will be warmed by this story.But be warned that although it's a short book there is a multitude of wordiness to get through. You may have trouble with unfamiliar dialects and long sentences that never seem to end, but your patience will be rewarded. There is nothing stereotypical about this story. It's quite unusual, has some twists and turns, and ultimately a very satisfying finish.Just a postscript: I decided to read this book because I remembered a nun who recommended it. She had just had our junior class in high school plow through Eliot's Adam Bede which is considerably longer, but we all enjoyed it. So she said that Silas Marner was good also and several girls groaned audibly. This was all I needed to hear--those groans convinced me that this wouldn't be easy reading for a 17-year-old young woman. But the nun said, \\"Oh, girls...\\" in the most wistful manner. I always wondered what there was about Silas Marner to make Sister look so moony-eyed. Now I know. I had to groan a little through all the verbiage, but I did find the warmth that Sister had evidently discovered."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Silas Marner is something of a rustic parable, in which the concept of wealth is held under a critical, moral light. It concerns a miserly hermit-weaver, who, after years and years of hoarding his earnings--reveling in the shimmer and chime of his beloved coins--is robbed of all his money. Yes--the thieving Dunstan Cass is punished for his wickedness, drowned in a nearby pond. But most intriguing is the way Silas's monetary misfortune marks the beginning of his passage to spiritual wealth. From the moment he is robbed, he is compelled to go out among the townsfolk, and establish relationships with his neighbors. Eliot's description of Silas's coins as \\"children waiting to be born\\" will remind some readers of one of Marx's descriptions of money as \\"monetary larva.\\" But the central transformation in Silas Marner does not occur in the market realm of commodity exchange, but in realm of symbolism and spiritual reformation, when Silas discovers the little \\"orphaned\\" Eppie in the ruddy glow of his hearth. It is, of course, a new, human treasure that Silas discovers in Eppie--one of rejuvenating import. And one of the most poignant scenes in the novel is when Silas confuses Eppie's golden locks of hair with his stolen gold coins, for it offers him a startling, new vision of human wealth. It's rather a queer novel, but not without its charm."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"A simple but beautifully written morality tale.

She makes the characters more interesting, and the whole story more enjoyable. The large development of Silas in the beginning to the end is apparent and important.

It has some pretty good points to it because it is pretty realistic, but it has its monotonous spots to it too, like the introduction. Toward the end, the book improved though the beginning was pretty dull because there is so much background information. I wouldn't suggest this book to readers below eighth grade since the way it's written makes it a little hard to follow for younger readers. The novel, Silas Marner, could have more action in it because there wasn't much to keep me on the edge of my seat. The book also could have used some more dialogue between the characters; some of the paragraphs got pretty long and hard to understand. Younger readers would probably lose interest in it because the paragraphs are so extensive. Although the book gets pretty good toward the end, the person reading it has to be patient to reach the exceptional parts. Although it is very challenging, Silas Marner is still a fascinating book because it teaches a lot about trust. The end of the book is pretty commendable because it's suspenseful. I like it more than a lot of other books endings. This book had things transpire that may happen in real life, like the mom dying from an opium overdose. This novel is a really good book to teach about the way one would want to deal with people and the way one may want to be treated.

But then he suffers an injustice at the hands of his Christian neighbors and blames his community and God. He suffers a self imposed alienation from both. He resorts to greediness. Suffers injustice again and hits bottom. Then the focus appears to turn to how does such a person redeem his faith in neighbors and God? How does a community redeem an outcast like Silas Marner? Also interesting was how the Church functions in the community to provide for the aged and and the disabled. Marner is told he would be taken care of despite the fact that he for years made no contributions to the Church to help it provide for his old age and disability.

It is one of my favorites from classic English literature."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"I failed miserably at reading The Mill on the Floss by George Eliot, but I loved Silas Marner. I think it was just that my edition of The Mill on the Floss has really off-putting font, and seems really long. At any rate, I sped through Silas Marner, which is a slim little volume, and is quite interesting. \\"Wrongly accused of theft and exiled from a religious community many years before, the embittered weaver Silas Marner lives alone in Raveloe, living only for work and his precious hoard of money. But when his money is stolen and an orphaned child finds her way into his house, Silas is given the chance to transform his life. His fate, and that of the little girl he adopts, is entwined with Godfrey Cass, son of the village Squire, who, like Silas, is trapped by his past. Silas Marner, George Eliot's favourite of her novels, combines humour, rich symbolism and pointed social criticism to create an unsentimental but affectionate portrait of rural life.\\" (from the Penguin Classics edition). Yes, \\"her.\\" George Eliot was a pen name. My question is, why do we still use the pen name in this case, but Charlotte Bronte's pen name (Currer Bell) isn't used anymore? I might research that...The actual edition that I read called it a moral fairy tale, and I would agree with that term. The book is fairy-tale-like, and highly entertaining, but also thought-provoking, as moralities (and fairy tales for that matter) are supposed to be. The sentences can be very long, but somehow, unlike Charles Dickens, they don't seem overwritten; they seem to fit the tone of the story just right.I loved how the little golden-haired orphan Eppie made her appearance; she is the child of Godfrey Cass, and when her mother keels over, Eppie toddles into the cottage of none other than Silas Marner, who now has a chance for redemption. She is the reappearance of his precious gold that he lost.A chance for redemption. I suppose that's not really the right phrase; Silas Marner isn't bad per se. He's complicated, and yes, he's miserly, but that's because he was wrongfully accused of a crime in his past life. He's just drawn into himself, and he no longer wishes to associate with the rest of the world or have anything to do with religion. But bright little Eppie gives him a chance to get past that and start again. Godfrey too isn't strictly good or evil. He's conflicted, and he's done some bad things which he wants to forget about, and he's done some good things. I won't tell how the book ends, but suffice to say that Silas Marner is an amazing classic novel, for its social commentary, and its humor, and its symbolism. I would highly recommend it, and am thinking of trying to tackle The Mill and the Floss once again. Or perhaps Middlemarch. I do think Silas Marner is a good book to start off with if you're going to read George Eliot; it's short and (it seems to me) less overwritten.My blog is at novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"It has been several decades since I last read it.

For those interested in character-driven stories and with the patience for 19th-century prose, however, Silas Marner is worth reading.This short book tells the story of a man who more or less withdraws from life after a crushing betrayal, to be eventually reawakened through his love for a child. It's a sweet story, at times saccharine and with some all-too-convenient plot elements, but still, it's a good one. The writing, of course, is excellent, sometimes sarcastic, and peppered with incisive observations about human nature. For the most part, the characterization is excellent; I fully believed in the Raveloe villagers, and even the minor ones are distinct and realistic.But then there is Eppie, the original Pollyanna--so perfect she's more plot device than person. Even when she misbehaves, she does so adorably; as a toddler she never throws tantrums, and as a teenager she's never for a moment rebellious or selfish or withdrawn. She's a fantasy child, with none of the human foibles the other characters display, and it's because of her that the later part of the novel sometimes becomes saccharine.Overall, though, a sweet, enjoyable story from a gifted writer.

On the other hand, I felt the story lacked the powerful dramatic ending I was hoping for, and so I cannot say it is one my favorites by her. All in all a good read that leaves you with plenty to think about and ponder when you look at your own life and what are the things that are most important to you."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"oor Silas. He can't get a break. After falsely being accused of a crime, he relocates to another village, where he focuses on working and earning money, living an isolated, antisocial existence. He loves his money. In fact, that's all he loves. Then someone robs him, taking every last coin.George Eliot, pen name of Mary Anne Evans, wrote several novels capturing life in 19th century England. Silas Marner, first published in 1861, remains a timeless, moving story of one man's struggle and redemption in the face of adversity. When Silas was a young man, one of his closest friends betrayed him by framing him for a crime and stealing his girl. As if being betrayed by his friend wasn't enough, he was also betrayed by the church; the drawing of lots declared his guilt.Moving to a new town, he earns his living as a weaver, and lives a miserly existence. He had no other purpose in life but to earn and save money. \\"His life had reduced itself to the mere functions of weaving and hoarding, without any contemplation of an end towards which the functions tended.\\" His only pleasure, all he looked forward to, was taking the money out every night, counting it, stacking it, sorting it, and handling it. Until one night, it was gone.And as suddenly as the money disappeared from his home, a little girl appeared. Silas found the mother frozen by the road near his home. Without hesitation, Silas took on the task of raising her as his own, finding the fulfillment he had been missing all those years: \\"Now something had come to replace his hoard which gave a growing purpose to the earnings, drawing his hope and joy continually onward beyond the money.\\"As the mystery of the missing money and the unknown parentage of Eppie, Silas's adopted daughter, come together, the story comes together in a clash of class and family that, while perhaps bordering on melodrama, is nevertheless moving and satisfying. When Godfrey, Eppie's biological father and a nobleman, comes to Silas and Eppie, the reader takes heart in Silas and Eppie's love for one another. On a personal note, I found the thoughts of Nancy, Godfrey's wife, on adoption were interesting. After they lost a baby and weren't able to conceive again, she had resisted Godfrey's wishes to adopt a child. \\"To adopt a child, because children of your own had been denied you, was to try and choose your lot in spite of Providence: the adopted child, she was convinced, would never turn out well, and would be a curse to those who had willingly and rebelliously sought what it was clear that, for some high reason, they were better off without.\\" I wonder how widespread this attitude was then, or even today. Certainly Silas's adoption of Eppie contradicts Nancy's view; Eliot clearly strikes a positive note for adoption here.As you might expect from a novel of the mid-19th century, many passages seem overly wordy and unnecessary. But even the dialogue and action that seems irrelevant to the story, like the men chatting in the pub, and the girls chatting as they're getting dressed for a formal dinner, add to the ambience by giving a realistic portrayal of the culture and language of the time.Eliot, decidedly not a believer, has little good to say about the church in Silas Marner. But Christians can don't have to try very hard to resonate with the moral lesson of the novel. The joy and rewards of life can be measured not by how much we save of what we earn, but by how much we give ourselves away in the service of others. James says pure religion is looking after orphans; Silas certainly embraced that call.Eliot's story is timeless and moving, and though it's a bit of a slog at times for the 21st century reader, it's certainly worth your time."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"I've always heard Silas Marner described as a drab read, a lesser work of George Eliot that is forced upon school children because it is George Eliot's shortest novel. I am happy to report that Silas Marner is neither drab nor a lesser work of Eliot. I found it to be an engaging, ultimately heartwarming and moral story about the true price of gold and human relations. It was a story that in many ways I found to be very relevant to today's society. As Jane Austen did before her, Eliot writes about human characteristics that transcend time.As the story starts, Silas Marner is a happy man with a good job as a weaver, a productive member of his church, a great best friend, and a fianc&eacute;e. Things suddenly take a turn for the worst when Marner's best friend frames him for a crime he didn't commit, and also steals his fianc&eacute;e. Bitter against his fellow church goers and town, Silas Marner moves away to a place where he is not known and where his weaving is prized. Making a good living, Marner values his gold and puts it above all human relations. Things soon change when his gold is stolen and a young child shows up on his door step shortly thereafter. He raises young Eppie as his own, until her real father shows up when Eppie is a teenager and wants to take her back. Will Eppie stay with Silas Marner or go to the father that abandoned her as a child?George Eliot created a wonderful cast of characters in Silas Marner. Silas is the main character, but his neighbor lady Dolly Winthrop, is a wonderful lady who helps him raise Eppie. Squire Cass and his family are also fleshed out and discussed in great detail as their lives often intersect with Marner's. I enjoyed listening to all of their lives. Nadia May was a great narrator. This was also the first book I listened to on my phone from the library. I love the system, but wish that there were more copies of digital audiobooks available to check out!The most fascinating part of the book for me was how George Elliot captured timeless qualities in human interactions and life. My favorite example of this is how a bunch of old guys are together talking about how the youth of today are lazy and nothing like when they were young lads. How often have I heard this talk throughout my life about how the youth of whatever day are terrible compared with older generations.Another example of this is problems with drugs. We hear about drugs in the news often and it seems like a problem just of today, but in Silas Marner, Eppie's mother has a drug addiction that leads her to take one last fix that ultimately kills her and leaves her child an orphan in the snow. The drug of choice may have changed over time, but the deadly effects of them haven't. As I continue to explore Victorian literature this year, I've noticed that drugs play a prominent role in many famous novels of that time.Overall, Silas Marner is a moving, intriguing story, with characters and situations that are timeless."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"One of the best classics that have been written.

I give it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"I dutifully read this book decades ago in Junior High School. The sum total of what I remember is the miser and there was something about a girl. It did not make any kind of impression, much less a profound impression. Now, many years later, I decided, for unknown reasons, to read this book again. And I am happy I did.Yes, this is a story of a miser who lives for his gold and silver coins. Having closed himself off from a world that has betrayed him, he finds his only solace in working to obtain his treasure and bringing his treasure out every night to look at it. But he is not a hard or cruel or even selfish man. He is nave and gentle. If he could just get rid of his gold, his life would be much better.Like its main character, the story itself is gentle. The villains hardly ever appear, mercy is prevalent and justice while an important element in the story is nevertheless mild. The story celebrates the quiet, unfashionable happiness of love at home.One of the features of this story is the revealing glimpse it provides of small town life during the era. Those familiar with Eliot's Middlemarch know that few portray small town life more accurately or sympathetically than she does. One has the sense that this is really what it must have been like to live in that time and place. From this accurate depiction, the story develops in such a natural way that new insight is given into why people become misers, and why rigid class distinctions exist even in rural country neighborhoods.The digressive, descriptive writing style prevalent in the Victorian era, is certainly present here, but this is a short book. My copy was only 150 pages. One can enjoy the leisurely pace of the story without having to make a long term commitment to the book. But the book still delivers an arresting climax that stays with me now that the book is done, and I expect I will remember it years from now. I did not remember any of it after reading it for school, but that is the difference between reading against your will and reading for pleasure. Silas Marner is a pleasure!

But when an orphan appears in his cabin and nobody steps forward to claim her, Marner finally finds something of meaning in his life.This is a really sweet story of how a child's love can melt even the toughest of hearts. The path to Marner's destruction is long and heartbreaking, and my only complaint about the book is that there is so little about the life Silas and Eppie live together.

Answer: Make her read it for 7th grade English class, make sure that the language is old-fashioned, and above all, make sure that the ideas and concepts are over her head. If that's what happened to you, and that's why you have an aversion to Silas Marner, and you are now over 30, pick it up again. Read it twice. Silas Marner is one of the greatest novels in the English language.Yes, it starts out sad, as our pathetic hero looses both his trust in humanity and his faith in God. But the power of love replaces his lust for money, and wins out in the end. Meanwhile, morally poor but financially rich, high-living Godfrey Cass provides a counterpoint to simple Silas. At the end there's a surprise when the fate of Godfrey's evil brother is revealed.When you're all done, before you file Silas Marner on the shelf, go back and read the paragraph about Silas' thoughts when he discovers that his hordes of coins are missing. If you have ever felt sudden extreme loss, you will recognize the stages of despair from disbelief to acceptance \\"like a man falling into dark water.\\" Which is why this book is not suitable for children, and is most appreciated by those who have undergone their own moral redemption.Silas has been the inspiration for many other characters, including Dicken's Scrooge. He has been portrayed in movies, including \\"A Simple Twist of Fate\\" starring Steve Martin. But none is as good as the original. If you haven't read it since junior high, try it again.

Due to his now secretive and reclusive ways, the people of Raveloe never really come to know Silas, and he lives in solitude, having turned away from his former faith and happiness.But one winter's night, a small orphan girl comes to his house, and everything changes. Silas cares for the child (with the help of his neighbor, Mrs. Winthrop, whose family soon befriends him), and his heart begins to soften.This is a very good representation of the redeeming power of love, and the consequences of a person's actions. For people who enjoy classic literature, this is definitely a must-read.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Reviews of this novel, seem to fall into three categories: those written by people who like to read great literature; those written by people who would prefer to read brain candy; and those written students forced to read the novel as a class assignment and,in some cases, would prefer not to read anything (if the third category is discarded, the average rating is much higher).One of the most remarkable things about this novel is the fact it was written by a woman, using a male pen name, in 19th century England when women were generally oppressed, i.e., they were not encouraged to have careers or to do anything outside the home. The story is well known. A man who blacks out during seizures, not remembering what happened, is falsely accused of theft of money from his church. He is shunned by his former friends and becomes a recluse. When he is later robbed of his savings, and an abandoned child appears on his doorstep in place of the gold, his life is changed as he takes responsibility for the child.This is classic literature from that time period, and is most certainly easier to read than many other novels from the same period (students should consider themselves fortunate that they were not assigned to read one of Thomas Hardy's novels). I first became acquainted with the novel when it was assigned reading in a high school English class. That was over 50 years ago, and the story is one that has stuck in my mind."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"I used to hate \\"Silas Marner\\" when I was forced to read the thing for my English class in Middle School (1959). The teacher I had was terrible AND I was not a gifted student. Since then, over the years, I have reread this classic about four times. Now that I have my Kindle I decided to read it again. The text is laid out very well for the Kindle. At this price it is truly a must-read. What a terrific book!This is a tale of how love conquers all. A bitter man, Silas Marner, who was done wrong gave up on humanity and decided to live in a cocoon of his own making. Silas' only joy and purpose in life was making and hoarding money. He spent hours on end working himself to no end all for the purpose of earning, saving, and collecting money. Then one day his money hoard was stolen. The rest of the story is a lesson in love.I have no idea why; here in America, George Eliot's \\"Silas Marner\\" is not well known. None of my friends have ever heard of this book. In India this work was well known. Anyway, if you have the time, patience, and inclination for a good read this is it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"George Eliot, born Marian Evans in 1819, spent most of her early life in rural Warwickshire. This early upbringing is apparent from her easy comfort in writing about country settings, with attention to detail and niceties that a born-Londoner would generally not be able to provide. Eliot's life was not that of the typical Victorian lady; she worked in publishing, including periodicals, translations, and writing her own fiction. Eliot led a 'colourful' life; living in a common-law marriage with Lewes, a man who left his wife and children for her, she then married after his death a man twenty years her junior, only to die eight months later.In this novel, Silas is a weaver, a rather grumpy and sour man, whose primary occupation and avocation is the making of money. He is an outsider in Raveloe, having been driven from his earlier community under the false accusation of theft, an accusation that also cost him his engagement to his beloved, and left him with little faith in human nature, particularly that of the church-ly humans.The high society in Raveloe reached the pinnacle in the Cass family. Squire Cass had two sons, Godfrey and Dunstan, each his own unique form of scoundrel. Godfrey, who had an illicit marriage to a local barmaid Molly, is being blackmailed by his spendthrift brother Dunstan. Alas, Godfrey is expected to marry another, Nancy Lammeter, daughter of another society family. Godfrey attempts to buy off Dunstan with his horse, Wildfire, and during a journey to sell the horse Dunstan accidentally injures and kills Wildfire.Dunstan is stranded in the countryside, but sees light from a cottage -- the home of Silas Marner, reputed after fifteen years of weaving and miserly activity of having accumulated a large stash. He steals the bags of money he finds in the deserted cottage, and disappears into the night.Silas reports the theft, but is unaided. He is heartbroken, for his life's purpose has been the accumulation of this wealth. No one seems to make the connexion between the lost money and the disappearance of Dunstan (one flaw in the novel, in my opinion). Silas gradually recovers from this blow, and the people of Raveloe begin for the first time to see him in terms of friendship.At a Christmas party, the Cass family is in full celebration, for the upcoming marriage of Godfrey and Nancy. However, Nancy is not pleased, given Godfrey's reputation. Later in the holiday season, Molly makes her way to the Cass estate and confronts Godfrey with a two-year-old daughter in tow. Upon her return from the estate, she falls and dies in a drunken, drug-induced stupor, and the child wanders through the snow to the cottage of Silas. Silas lays claim to the golden-haired child, and Godfrey is relieved to be free from Molly and paternity.Sixteen years pass, and we come to meet a very different Silas, one who is now a truly human being, who is loved, and has an object of love in his daughter Eppie. Eppie is in fact about to be wed to the nice Aaron Winthrop. Godfrey and Nancy, however, have had a loveless and childless marriage.Things develop rapidly near the end of the novel. A pond near Silas' cottage is drained, and the remains of Dunstand with two bags of gold coins is found. Godfrey feels compelled to tell his wife now everything, how Dunstan dishonoured the family, how he (Godfrey) was being blackmailed, and admits his paternity of Eppie. Nancy is strangely tolerant -- she only complains of not having been told sooner. They decide to demand that Eppie be returned to them.In a beautiful scene of compassion and love, Eppie, given the free choice of deciding between Silas and connexion with the noble Cass family, opts for the man who was her true father, and chooses to remain with Silas.Later, Silas and Eppie revisit Lantern Yard, from which Silas was expelled so many years before. Here in no longer the old church, his old home, or his old friends -- all has changed; life has gone on. The old place is dirty and noisy by comparison to the serene Raveloe. The question of Silas' guilt or innocence cannot be resolved, but then, is no longer a question of concern for anyone in either place. Eppie then marries Aaron, in a wedding paid for by Godfrey, who cannot attend due to business, and Eppie declares in the end that 'nobody could be happier than we are.'Elliot intended to show that misfortune can lead to greater things, and provided a typical Victorian happy ending.This novel has been a traditional one assigned to students of secondary school age for decades now; it is a classic, fairly simple in construction and vocabulary, and brings up the timeless themes of good, evil, fate, and has a wide range of characters who change over time. Alas, many school-age readers come away cold, often determined never to read another novel again, as it is presented poorly and not put in a more modern context which students will more readily understand. But, it remains a good story, and a fine representative of the Victorian novel.This particular edition contains many extra pieces of commentary, notes and other study aids that will be helpful to the student trying to understand the text, the motivations of the characters, the world context of the story, and different ideas of interpretation."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Silas Marner is a very interesting book. It is filled with excitement and suspense. I liked the book very much, but as a freshman in high school, it was very hard for me to read. George Eliot uses a lot of dialect along with some Old English words in her lovable tale. Eliot tells the story of a lonely weaver. After getting betrayed by friends in his old town of Lantern Yard, Silas moves to the town of Raveloe searching for a new life. His delusions keep him from getting accepted into the Raveloe community. After losing his faith in God and having his money stolen he gets a very special gift from someone he doesn't know, a little baby girl with golden hair. After that things work out for Silas and Eppie. George Eliot tells her classic novel in great detail with a lot of adjectives and metaphors. She has made a great novel that while a challenge is good for everybody. Silas Marner is really easy to comprehend because it is so realistic. I live in a small town and it reminds me of Raveloe. Sometimes I imagine that I am in Silas Marner's place and all my friends are the villagers. I think about what I would do if I was in Marner's place. Eliot also created a great plot for this book. This classic is great because it teaches people about life. It teaches people not to be selfish and to be kind to people no matter how good you think you are. Eliot has made a great book that would be great to read as a family."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"Silas Marner spends his days weaving for the village-folk of Raveloe, weaving and saving, hiding his money in leather bags in the floor of his home. At nights, he counts the money, tinkling it between his hands, memorising the increasing total. He spends little, and has no friends or family. His life consists of waiting to leave his life, an endless weave that seems to have no beginning and no end.But Silas was not always a weaver. As a young man, he was engaged, and living in another town. But his best friend, William Dane, who was jealous of his good fortune and hopeful prospects, engendered a plan to strip Silas of everything he held dear. His hometown, convinced he was involved with the robbery of a senior deacon, accused him of theft and he was forced to leave. He stumbles upon Raveloe and begins to weave, and fifteen years past.It is to George Eliot's credit that a story with such fairy tale qualities is so successful. From the very beginning we are made aware of character-types and ideas, with Silas being an innocent man wrongly accused, and then, as a weaver, a giant metaphor of toil and struggle in an unfair world. The townsfolk of Raveloe, as they are outlined, remain simply that - a thick line that purports to show the broad details of a person, but in no way offers the subtle shading that makes a character come to life and become a person. But this is to the story's credit, for we are not interested so much in depth of character and complexity of situation, as we are in the constant weaving, the endless sadness, of Silas Marner's self-imposed exile.While we learn of Marner's new life as a hoarder, a miser, a weaver, we come to see other characters and situations. There is a young man, Godfrey, who is running out of money and seeks a desperate measure to fix his worries. There is his father, who disapproves of his life and choices. One New Year's, the two stories intersect, and after Silas is robbed of all his money, a young girl, blonde and innocent and nameless, is found on his doorstep. Her mother, an opium addict, is discovered nearby, frozen to death. A father, if there is one, does not step forward.Here, Eliot allows us to know the secret well before Silas or Eppie, his newly christened adopted daughter. Godfrey is the father, and it is a secret he carries with him well past necessary. His duplicitous action is flagged at a very early stage, which sets in our mind the idea that a comeuppance, or a truth revealing set piece, is somewhere along the line. Because this is known - for what fairy tale does not, in the end, end in goodness and retribution and justice for those who deserve it? - we are able to enjoy the experience of Silas as he becomes a good father, and learns how to love.In a sense, the themes surrounding Silas are trite and over-used. The idea of a sad, lonely man discovering the beauty of the world again through love, is nothing new. Yet Eliot's mastery of character and evocation of place allow us to sail along with Silas as he sheds the hard carapace of armour that he has placed around himself. He becomes, as we do, devoted to Eppie. She is a caricature, a purely good and ultimately pure girl who, through the tutelage of her father, understands the meaning of love even where Godfrey, her real father, does not.Eliot makes heavy use of dialect in Silas Marner. As a personal taste, I distinctly dislike dialect, because I find I spend more time translating what is being said than enjoying and understanding the character as they are presented. Yes, it can aid in characterisation and 'realism', but at what cost? Much like Wuthering Heights, several characters in Silas Marner were ruined for me, purely because I had to work so hard at what they were saying. And of course, upon figuring out their obscure words, I realised that they were saying nothing meaningful at all. A great disappointment, that.Throughout, various characters are introduced and then pushed to the background, as needed by the story. When Silas is in difficulties concerning the raising of a child, a goodwife is found, Dolly Winthrop, who provides him with advice and stresses that the child must be christened. Later, a love interest is given to Eppie, because what happy ending does not finish with a wedding?But these are minor quibbles. As a fairy tale, Silas Marner excels. There are good people done wrong, and bad people who come right in the end. There is a happy - or mostly happy - ending for everyone who deserves it, and a few that don't. But more than that, there is the construction of a wholly sympathetic man, and that is Silas Marner himself. Eliot does not stray down an easy route with him - when he becomes a miser, there is sadness, not avarice, in our minds as we sympathise.This novel is considered minor Eliot; it is not hard to fault that estimation. Middlemarch is a towering literary achievement, whereas Silas Marner is merely a single flower in a garden of like experiments with words. But what flower does not deserve to be smelled, at least once?"},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"While reading SILAS MARNER, I kept thinking of a scene from Season Five of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, in which Tara's father and other relatives come to take her back home with them, very much against her inclination. Once Buffy realizes that Tara wants to stay, she states that they can take Tara only by going through her first, which causes the father to ask, \\"We are Tara's blood-kin. Who are you to interfere in her affairs?\\" To which Buffy replies, \\"We're family.\\" The same emotions that I felt watching that episode of BUFFY came roaring back in the marvelous scene near the end of this novel when Mr. Cass decides to reveal after sixteen years of denial that Eppie is his daughter and will take her to live with him instead of Silas when he says, \\"Your coming now and saying 'I'm her father' doesn't alter the feeling inside us. It's me she's been calling her father ever since she could say the word.\\" And Eppie herself adds, \\"And he's took care of me and loved me from the first, and I'll cleave to him as long as he lives, and nobody shall ever come between him and me.\\" It is one of the lovelier climaxes of any 19th century English novel.SILAS MARNER is very much a novel about faith and the search for those values that make life worth living. Marner himself seeks early on to find hope in a superstitious religion that ultimately disappoints him, and later in the acquisition of gold through hard labor, gold that is stolen from him. The money is later returned to him, but during the long interval he discovers the power and greater importance of love and simple human relationships, as he inadvertently inherits a young toddler who miraculously appears inside his cottage whom he adopts as his own child. Despite his hurts and crusty personality, Marner in loving the child is brought into the larger community as well, and achieves a kind of happiness he scarcely imagined earlier in his life.These concerns were very real to Mary Anne Evans, better known by her penname of George Eliot. Though of humble intellectual origins, she was precociously intelligent, and no figure of the 19th century overcame such obstacles to become one of the leading intellectuals of her day. In the 20th or 21st century, Evans would have held a chair of religion or literature at Cambridge or Oxford. Instead, she wrote literary reviews on a host of books on a wide range of subjects, made some of the most important translations into English of crucial German theological texts ever made (Feuerbach's THE ESSENCE OF CHRISTIANITY and David Strauss's THE LIFE OF JESUS), and wrote some of the most intellectual novels of the century. Eliot's novels are remarkable for their intellectual diversity and depth. Her novels constitute a fascinating exploration for how to have faith in a post-Christian world, and in this way she is the most typical post-Darwinian novelist of the 19th century. Furthermore, during the first half of her career as a novelist, she brought the novel down to earth. If Dickens was unique in writing in his books about many lower and working class characters in an urban setting, George Eliot did much the same for the rural poor. In novels like ADAM BEDE and THE MILL ON THE FLOSS, the bulk of her characters, even the landed characters, are very much below virtually all of the characters in Jane Austen's novels, and set even more off the beaten path than hers. Although she would turn to more universal, less specifically rural characters in themes beginning in ROMOLA and her later novels, SILAS MARNER represents her last exploration of the rural poor. She manages to catch in her pages a rapidly changing world, setting SILAS MARNER in an area where the lone weavers such as Marner were disappearing in favor of industrialized cloth manufacture and the countryside was giving way to a rapidly expanding coal industry (Eliot's part of England is very near what would later be the setting for D. H. Lawrence's coal mining novels, with Lawrence also reflecting in his pages on the changes industrialization had wrought, although he writes from the end of the process while she writes at its beginning).We tend sometimes to think of those who reacted against the Christian faith following Darwin and David Strauss as having forsaken faith entirely, but that is very much not the case. Most Victorians who forsook Christianity looked instead for alternate forms of faith. Take the philosopher Henry Sidgwick, who ceased to believe in Christianity, but founded the Royal Society of Psychical Research. Like many of his age, Sidgwick believed that a supernatural realm was essential to provide the ultimate validity of morality, and no longer believing in Christianity, sought to investigate like a 19th century Fox Mulder a wide range of supernatural phenomena to validate some vague form of faith. Eliot in this novel is desperately trying to believe in something. Like Mulder with the poster on his wall reading \\"I Want to Believe,\\" Eliot wanted faith. Not merely that, but she was convinced that there had to be a viable form of faith to make life worth living. She was hardly the atheistic materialist that many wrongly believe that Darwin produced.Just as Sidgwick believed that there was a supernatural order that make sense of morality (in particular instances of self-sacrifice), so George Eliot clearly sees a divine order in the workings of the world. This is illustrated over and over in SILAS MARNER, where everything balances at the end. Although she no longer believed in the Christian teachings, she remained very much a person of faith and ultimately an optimist. By the end of the novel, no bad deed has gone unpunished and no scales are left unbalanced. In the old expression, \\"Bad deeds will out.\\" But it is also a novel of redemption, with Marner finding his anti-social sins being forgiven and through family and friends discovering, very much to his surprise, happiness.Though George Eliot always liked to write superficially simply stories that were in fact paragraph by paragraph commentaries on the intellectual debates of her age (she had, for instance, been reading widely in German and English theorists on the folktale when writing MARNER), her surface simplicity always feels real and unforced. And the story she created is a lovely one, with vivid characters, a marvelous plot, and a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. I will confess that I came to this novel much, much later than most others who read the book, and only after having read many of her other books. This is one unquestionably one of her most enjoyable and marvelous works."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"I was under the sexist opinion that George Eliot was a man. How pleasantly surprising that George was actually Mary Ann Evans, a woman gifted with powerful insight into human behaviour.The story of Silas Marner is that of a wronged man who finds solace in solitude and hoarding. The ritual and monotony of his loom keeps him captive, the reckoning and manifestation of his gold gives him companionship.One day his gold is stolen replaced by a far more precious gem, an orphan girl. An abandoned child offers Silas salvation, a withered miser offers the child a home. Together they change each other and those around them.The story is replete with penetrating behavioural analyses applicable to all of us but just beyond our reach."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"With the publication of SILAS MARNER in 1861, George Eliot countered the rise of what she saw as the patently false view of life that the conventional pastoral engendered. Eliot opposed the cheery images of villagers happily frolicking in their quaint but comely homes. She intended to inject a lasting note of rustic realism in the person of Silas, a character deliberately conceived as a fairy tale creation. By depicting the metamorphosis of Silas from one of twisted values to one of traditional humanistic ones amidst the background of the pastoral fairy tale, Eliot was able to present a believable tale of personal redemption that made use of the political, economic, and social changes that were transforming England from a rural to an industrial based economic system.Silas is initially seen as a sympathetic character who suffers from a false accusation of theft in his small rural village. It is this village that connotes a totality of pre-industrial images of which much of England's older population still retained vivid memories. After his journey to Raveloe, he lives in a small cottage where he works as a weaver and slowly accumulates a hoard of gold which he keeps buried in the floorboards. He likes to play with his gold in a non-productive manner that now calls to mind the similar antics of the cartoon character Scrooge McDuck, both of whom saw their treasure only in terms of watching it grow. This gold is the central symbol of the book, for when he encounters the golden haired Eppie, he transfers his fascination from coin to strand, a changeover which mirrors a similar melding of gold as non-functional to gold as human functional in that a growing capitalist society began to include increasing numbers of newly rich middle class entrepreneurs who put their gold to productive use. As Silas raises Eppie from baby to young woman, he similarly raises his own consciousness so that the bitterness that led him to Raveloe he now sees as but the first step in his redemption. It is not only his ability to shed his bitterness that marks his emotional growth. He now can reintegrate himself into the community of men that he symbolically discarded when he entered the isolation of his secluded home. He further comes to trust in a Higher Power that he was sure had discarded him earlier. Finally, through Silas, Eliot shows that personal redemption also includes the belief that justice delayed is not justice denied. Contrapuntally, the one who stole the treasure for which Silas was blamed did not escape justice. He was killed by falling into a stone pit. Godfrey Cass, who refuses to identify himself as the true father of Eppie, is punished for doing what Silas does willingly. Godfrey must endure seeing his daughter raised by the very one whose purse is dwarfed by Godfrey but whose heart dwarfs Godfrey's. In the regeneration of Silas' nearly lost humanity, Eliot shows that as long as one has someone to care for, then the giving of care results in its return with interest, sort of like investing gold rather than hoarding it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"George Eliot, born Marian Evans in 1819, spent most of her early life in rural Warwickshire.

I had to read it for school, and it was excellent! I would have given it a five had it not been for the ending. aFter all that Silas goes through, yes, you are happy for him, but things work out too well. There is not enough tragedy or bittersweetness at the end to make you think about it constantly and writhe in the pain of the characters, thinking, if only. I really get into books like that. But this book, however good and painful throughout ended TOO happily. I do like the fact that Silas had to endure so much. It made it a tempestuous book, and painful to read. That quality makes the book all the more wonderful. You can really sympathize with the author. It's a good read though, and I reccommend it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"George Eliot, a.k.a. Mary-Anne Evans, was a popular novelist in her time, which has immediately made her books classic reads in schools, libraries, or even a novelist looking for inspiration to write a novel that shall be a classic in the future. Evans crafted a beautiful plot, and captivates the readers once the background chapters have been set up, and the action begins. It is rare that such a book in our day and age exists, and it is nice to read the popular things that were back in that day and age. I, being in high school, had the option of reading this book or Evans' other brilliant novel, \\"Middlemarch\\". I thought this might be an excellent read, so I chose this.At first, I thought I had made the wrong choice and thought of switching to \\"Middlemarch\\" before it was too late. It starts out slow if you are reading Eliot for the first time, but the mind is only preparing itself to the odd language of the period (thank goodness it isn't Old English). However, once the background of Lantern Yard and Raveloe have been given to us, along with Silas Marner's history, we dive straight into the plot -- Godfrey and Dunstan Cass, Nancy Lammeter, The Red House, The Rainbow, Silas, Eppie, Molly, Priscilla, Squire Cass, Dolly Winthrop, Aaron -- all characters and places which set us into the story. With the dialogue and tension perfectly set, it is no wonder why this has become a classic.Perfect for a classroom, Silas Marner promises each person who reads it a lesson in what really matters to the heart -- in Silas' position, I would have chosen the golden locks too."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"I cannot more agree with the reviewers who say Silas Marner is slow moving at the beginning, and that it is slow moving for the first half of the story, however I find that Silas Marner is not actually a story, more a biography, or a discription of the times. The scenes are that era are very vivid; the characters are very true and clear. Silas's betrayal, his 'death' and his obsession with money are reflected in the monotony of the book, just when you begin to feel the story has completely lost track of any clear-cut line, something new happens. Then, Silas is reborn, he remembers who he has been and his family. The most wonderful thing about this book is its summing up, happy ending. Nothing is left hanging, this book definatly has a good ending, and a book with an ending such as this is clearly the work of a gifted author; such as George Eliot.

First published in 1861,this masterpiece has transcended much beyond the bars of time and even in the 21st. century retains its ambition to tell a colossal saga in a genteel fashion boldly underlined by a conversational tone. \\"Silas Marner\\" is a brief and tightly cultural story invoking a symmetrical plot and adroit symboism to depict the tale of a linen-weaver who loses everything in his life only to discover them in a more divine,vibrant and concord dimension.Silas Marner is a poor,hapless linen-weaver who leaves his own village after being framed in a robbery case by his friend William Dane who goes on to marry his lover Sarah. Ignominy,betrayal and a haunting sense of being abjectly wronged conspire to lead him elsewhere and Silas Marner finds respite from his unforgiving past in the village of Raveloe. Here none is cognizant with his bitter history and Silas becomes a \\"simple weaver\\" and all the more enigmatic for it. He creates an atmosphere of mysteries around him and remains confined in this narrow scope of self-development for fifteen heavily limping years. He hoards up a massive amount of gold and silver but favours miserly expenditure. And then when everything gives the impression of being normal and steady,life takes a sharp bend for Silas Marner and forces him into a strange world.Running parallel with this story of a diminutive figment of the domain of village is the gentryfolk version of a life inndated with posh manners and biting apprehensions,this too in Raveloe. Godfrey Cass is the eldest son of the Squire who succumbs to his brother Dunsey's blackmail and leaves him his horse to sell. Dunsey Cass epitomises all that is lavish and bad and nonsense and grotesque and crooked and deceitful and cunning in a gentry society. He kills the horse in a freak accident and then to save his skin,steals the money from Silas Marner's dilapidated house. At the heart of \\"Silas Marner\\" lies his robbery---it lends an excuse to George Eliot to intersect two different,and at times poignantly contrasting,worlds and in this scheme,the reader is invariably led to ruminate on William Shakespeare's \\"The Merchant of Venice\\",where the two parallel stories,one concerning Antonio's plight thrusted upon by Shylock and the other describing Bassanio's endeavour to win Portia,coincide at the critical junction to shape the drama into the right posture. This comparison is not to say that Shakespeare's \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" and Eliot's \\"Silas Marner\\" resonate with each other but goes a long way really to prove tat the intersection of the various works of literature are not that detached from the intersection of events in a single work of the same.This robbery transmutes the eponymous protagonist of the novel from \\"a half-crazy miser\\" to a God-fearing man of depth and substance. That very same night Silas Marner's house is radiated by the return of the lost gold and silver pieces in a more divine and colourful form:\\"a tamp's child\\". Silas is bold enough to accept her as his daughter and despite being a bachelor,he undertakes for the development of the girl-child he baptises as Eppie. Eppie's growth and realisation of the world in the subsequent years spent amidst poverty and few glimpses of fortune results in Silas's own comprehension and rise from a one-dimensional figure to a pluralistic person,\\"There's good i' this world---I've a feeling o' that now;and it makes a man feel as there's a god more nor he can see,i' spite o' the trouble and the wickedness\\"---this may seem as the ultimate realisation of Silas Marner but it's not as much the understanding of Silas about life as the authoress's recurrent theme:that life,despite all the human,divine and unforseen forces perpetually thretening to distort its shape,is always beautiful.\\"Silas Marner\\" is virtually a ballad inprose and so inevitably always soaked in a gentle reassurance of poetic justice. Throughout these pages,the reader discerns elements of ballad structure,most notably in instances where the vivid flow of the tale is punctuated by phiosophical discourse. George Eliot's general framework of things in this book is great and occasioned with touches of delicate humour and subtle satire blent with the accent of superstitions so vehemently disturbing the society during the writer's era---all these features being reflected in the conversation at the Rainbow---augment the authoress's successful employment of a taut and intense yet elaborate and defining language. George Eliot may be focusing on a particular character in this novel but she doesn't neglect the suitable etching of other characters. art is symbolic in tone with singular effigies representing wider landscapes and in \\"Silas Marner\\" this nature is made pretty evident. Geofrey Cass embodies a man repressed by circumstances and personal fears,Dunsey is the sole villain in the piece,Nancy Lammeter proves a dedicated and devoted wife to Godfrey despite illustrating herself of a meek submissive nature bordering on self-denial,whilst Dolly Winthrop is the most accomplished of women characters in the novel,a constant source of sometimes vain but forever honest judgement and help to Silas Marner.George Eliot's language in this book is typically idyllic with a stunning coupling of narration and dialogue,the former being personal as well as philosophical and the latter neither lofty nor mundane but in essence commonplace and genuine. Dunsey's end is an apt revelation of the writer's belief that truth can never be obscured or erased. The book doesn't attempt to keep many mysteries from the reader---Eppie's father is forever a known person,Dunsey's ultimatum is never in doubt and the conclusion isn't that difficult to fathom. \\"Silas Marner\\" is not a superb classic only for the easy flow of its plot but also for the easy fairy-tale gratifications that it manages to combine with massive social and personal insights. This work must rank alongside the best novels of all time and indeed when George Eliot remarks this about Nancy's elder sister Priscillia,\\"She serves a little pepper to sprinkle over the talk---that's the reason why she never puts too much in her pies\\",we can easily qualify this statement to the authoress's ability to weave magic with her own talks and pies."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"This book explores the best and worst of human nature in people, when they are at their highest and when they are at their lowest points in life.

I can see how some do not find it interesting. It was several weeks after I read it that I realized that maybe Silas Marner was not the main point. He doesn't actually do anything, after all. Everything happens TO him. He simply responds to what happens to him. To rediscover life through the love of a child is a good theme but look at Les Miserables. There is no comparison.Look instead at Godfrey Cass and consider the story with him as the main character. If Silas Marner is actually the counterpart for him instead of the other way around (like a constant in a science experiment), it starts to take on the qualities of a classic. Godfrey Cass is also jaded and harassed but he schemes. He tries to manipulate the circumstances to his best benefit - not in a malicious way, no more than Voltaire's Candide. If we look at it that way, what we have here is an English Candide for, with Silas as the counterpart instead of Godfrey, the moral changes to become, basically, 'Roll with the punches', or - as Voltaire put it, 'We must cultivate our gardens'."},{"Title":"Silas Marner (audio-CD)","review":"So, you've savored Middlemarch and reveled in Mill on the Floss. What do you read when you're in the mood for the kind of witty observations and perceptively drawn characters you loved in Eliot's masterpieces?

(In this case, non-standard English dialect as supposedly spoken -- and perhaps, 80-100 years ago, actually spoken -- by Jewish people?) It's embarrassing, to say the least, for most young moderns of the 21st century -- Jews and others sensitive to stereotyping, but especially, in this case, perhaps Jews -- who simply want to be known as INDIVIDUALS, and not as stereotypes! (Don't forget, that once, not too long ago, \\"non-standard English\\" used to be called, \\"sub-standard English\\"!)Well, at least the recipes are not written in dialect, which is a refreshing change from the text of this book. There are still people, I realize, who enjoy reading \\"the way momma and poppa used to talk\\" -- but for those of us who did not have parents who spoke in dialect, and who remember cringing when listening to any dialect, (of any ethnic group -- especially one's own), in a film, theatre, or TV production -- this cook-book, however well-intentioned, can easily make a sensitive reader loose his or her appetite!Thus cautioned, however, (and I was not), one might look into this book further, and try to rise above the not-so-funny dialect, and look for other things which can make a book enjoyable: good illustrations, large, readable-sized type, good quality paper, a quality binding -- and, in the case of a cookbook, easy-to-make, easy-to-follow, delicious-to-eat recipes. I am glad to report that, along with the difficult-to-digest dialect, and dialect \\"humour\\", these other \\"ingredients\\" are also all in this book!It's nice to see, for example, that the drawings of the author -- a blonde, and thin lady -- are accurately drawn. Yes, the \\"fat Jewish hosewife\\" of lore IS also shown....but this is another person -- probably the author's mother from whom she has learnt cooking. Thd drawings are delightfully humourous....and if they do show a stereotyped expression or two, at least their realty is grounded in the NON-stereotyped, true-to-life thinness and blondness of the author, whose picture is on the back cover.One can lear a lot about Jewish cooking from the many authenic recipes in this book. Most are easy and fun to make....and even easier, and more fun, to eat!A full index is given in this book, but sadly, no glossary. So, you must either gather the meaning of words like \\"shmaltz\\" from the surrounding text, (not a difficult thing to do), look them up in a Yiddish/English dictionary, or in a book like Leo Rosten's \\"The Joys of Yiddish\\", etc.(\\"Shmaltz\\", by the way, is chicken fat....)This is the first, (and hopefullly the last), Jewish Cookbook I will come across that is written in \\"pig-Yiden\\" English. (Or perhaps, as pigs are not kosher, one should say \\"chick-Yiden\\" English.) This is one good cookbook, designed and printed....but those \\"funny\\"? dialect-ridden words of \\"explanation\\", betwixt the receipes, are enough to make at least my own stomach, turn and churn, with the greatest of discomfort!"},{"Title":"Love and knishes;: An irrepressible guide to Jewish cooking","review":"Along with The Joy of Cooking for everyday basic cooking, I learned to prepare tradiditional Ashkenazic (Eastern European) Jewish dishes from Love and Knishes when it was first published 40 years ago when I was a newly-wed.

Not the best, certainly, but it was a great way to spend my afternoon. I had just discovered King's Bachman books, and I was amazed to see that the movie &quot;The Running Man&quot; was actually based on one of those stories. I had enjoyed the movie (hey, I was a teen in the eighties, and Arnold movies were my life's blood), so I was hopeful that the book would be as good. Well, the movie and the story are worlds apart, but luckily the book far surpassed the movie in every way (don't they always?).But now, looking back on the game show crazy that has developed over the past few years, and how crazy they have gotten (namely, shows like Survivor and Boot Camp come to mind), the story now seems eerily prescient. Could we be headed toward a Running Man type game show, where death is a possibility? Three years ago I would have said no. Now? Now it doesn't seem so fantastic anymore. Anyway, read this story.

It is completely different than the movie. The only thing common between the two is the Running Man game and it is set in the future. It is much more of a social commentary than an action movie, so don't wait..."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I had read a few of Stephen King's bestsellers before this one, but &quot;The Running Man&quot; is the best novel of the lot. This fast-paced, action-packed story was fantastic, and I almost finished all 300+ pages in one sitting.Ben Richards, the main character of the story, is a person with true grit and determination. He enters a life-and-death game called &quot;The Running Man&quot; to get money to pay for a doctor for his sick child. He comes across as a good-hearted and caring individual, even though he uses foul language and violence. Stephen King brilliantly creates a two-sided character who is both morally good and outwardly bad, depending on your point of view. Despite Richards' witticisms and snide remarks, I couldn't help becoming attached to his character and his struggle to come out of the game alive. His never-ending push forward through the throws of life was well-written by King. More than once it seemed as if Richards had been beaten, but then King added a new twist to the tale. I never really knew whether Richards was safe from the hunters or in danger of losing it all. This is one of the reasons why it is hard to put the book down -- you don't know what to expect will happen next.The story progresses with increasing tension as time goes on for Richards. It reaches a climax at the very end of the novel that was unexpected by me, but also served as a suitable ending to Richards' plight. In a way, Richards had already decided the outcome of the game from the very start. This adds another element to the book that makes it even more interesting.A lot of people who may not have read the book have likely seen the movie, made in 1987 and starring Arnold Schwarzeneggar. If you saw the movie, regardless of whether you liked or hated it, read the book! The movie is only remotely similar to the book with regard to the general scenario, but from there, the book takes over and makes the story far greater than the screenplay. The movie was interesting, but the book was astounding!I am not a big-time fan of Stephen King, but I have to say that &quot;The Running Man&quot; is a great piece of literature from an author who is renowned for writing horror stories. The novel is about a struggle for survival and a story of one man's rebellion against the upper-class. Horror fans need not despair, however, because King throws in some of the guts that have made his horror stories spine-tingling. Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is willing to let his/her imagination run wild on an adrenaline rush."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I first read this book when i was a lot younger (about 12), and back then i just liked it because it was a fast-paced, action packed thriller. I still love it now because of that! It's not your average Stephen King novel, but for something that's not his forte he's done it amazingly well. The future he's portrayed is dark and sinister, and is all the more scary because it COULD happen (kinda reminds me of 1984 by George Orwell in that regard)."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Not supernatural at all, but briefly psychological, like a number of his books. I believe all Bachman books explored the human spirit to some degree, and this one offers the concept of love over life, and of course, pride. The world he sets is very gray, but his writing style has always been light. An easy read, one designed for the non-King fans."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This Bachman guy writes a lot like stephen King! Seriously though, why do writers publish stuff under different names?I like the book but was expecting a different ending."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"'The Running Man' was published in 1982 under Kings pseudonym Richard Bachman.Without ever seeing the movie cause it looked crappy I decided to finally read this book knowing that the book is always better than the movie. And this is not a bad book by any means, it's quite good but I felt that it should have been explained a little better.The book is about a man, Ben Richards, who is married to his wife Sheila who share a five year old daughter, Cathy, who is dying from Asthma/Lung Cancer. It's why Ben Richards enters the Running Man contest, prize money for a doctor for his daughter. Taking place in the year 2025 the pollution of the air is so toxic that most deaths are lung related and Asthma is always the cause of death.The Games Network, a government operated game show station that runs live all over the world via free-vee(TV). Once the game starts you are free game for anyone in the world, a enemy of the state. The goal is to survive thirty days, 100 dollars per hour or deduct a hundred if you kill someone. No one has ever survived the entire 30 days. Ben meets various people in his trek, whether he can trust anyone or not, his braveness and quick thinking are his strong points. During the games 'Hunters' are sent out to capture the running man, trained elites/assassins.I don't want to give to much else away. It's a very fast read and I mostly enjoyed it, yet I did not expect the ending, and even now I don't know how I feel about said ending. Classic King?(Bachman?)maybe, you decide.Maybe if the lead character, Richards wasn't such a jerk and a tool, I could have liked him and the book more, so I didn't feel anything for him except for his unfortunate family."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This is a very good book. Panomanal, exstrodinary, great! But not 5 star King. You see, I'm a very big fan, huge fan, but I don't throw out 5 stars. 5 stars in my opinon is like, The Shawshank Redemption, or Desperation, bouth very good. It's definetly, positivally worth the read. So go ahead, read it!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"It is the year 2025, TV is truly the opiate of the people, and society is divided sharply between the haves and the have-nots. Ben Richards' family is in the latter group. He's been unfairly blacklisted and his wife has had to resort to hooking to pay the bills. Meanwhile, his baby daughter lies ill with the flu - perfectly treatable if only they could afford it. Desperate and at the end of his rope, Richards opts to participate in a game show called &quot;The Running Man.&quot; He is to become the quarry in a deadly hunt that will last no more than thirty days. For each day he successfully evades his pursuers, his family earns a large sum of money.No one has ever lasted more than eight days.The games network, of course, hardly plays fair. The rules require Ben to periodically mail in videos, thereby running the risk of giving his location away. And rewards are given for any information leading to his apprehension, so Richards is also playing against a bored and bloodthirsty public -- in other words, everyone. The ongoing hunt is very suspenseful, but it's when Richards finally confronts his true nemesis that things get really interesting.As I was reading I couldn't help thinking that this story was ready-made for film. It moves along at a rapid pace, especially once the game is underway. It's not simplistic, but neither is it complicated enough that it should require much tampering. (I've not yet seen the movie, but from what I have heard they somehow dropped the ball. Too bad.)The concept of reality TV probably seemed outrageous or at least far-fetched in 1982, when The Running Man first appeared. Now it seems disturbingly prescient. Though the book belongs in the science fiction genre, it is more frightening than many of his horror stories. One warning about this edition: the story is prefaced by an introduction lifted from the earlier Bachman Books publication, and for some reason King gives away the ending in it. Maybe it's an editing oversight. In any case, save it until you've read the book. It will allow you a more powerful reading experience."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I am only leaving this review for one purpose, to warn you about a spoiler in the intro. Don't worry I am not going to spoil it for you to. In the intro by King called The Importance of Being Bachman, he quite literally tells you the ending.

Not just a \\"Oh, and then something negative happens\\" but \\"Blah, blah, and then he blah blah\\" specifically. If you want to enjoy the book (as I am CERTAIN I would have) DO NOT READ THE INTRODUCTION!!!!Who does that?? Yes, I get it, it has been republished so you want to add a note, but for those who would have picked up the book for the first time (never had seen the movie either so I don't know if it tells the true ending) the book has been ruined!!!. . .

Add a HUGE SPOILER warning before you give the ending of a book before the story even starts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"If you have ever wanted to read a book purely for the sake of enjoyment, then &quot;The Running Man&quot; is definately for you. Written by King in his early days, this work displays all of the author's talents outside of those involving horror to create a story that is impossible to put down, and prone to numerous re-readings, especially because of its size (just over 200 pp). Just to warn you, this book has NOTHING to do with the motion picture that starred good 'ol Arnold quite a few years back. If the movie did have anything to do with this book,...well, let's just say that it would have been much, much better. The story revolves around one of King's simplest but best literaty characters, Ben Richards, who exists in a futuristic world of disease, capitalism and the all-important &quot;free-vee&quot; that has brainwashed the planet and caused massive seperation in the classes. In order to save his wife and young daughter from a terrible fate, Richards enters the free-vee's most popular game-show, The Running Man, where he voluntarily becomes the most wanted man on earth in order to survive 30 days and receive his billion dollar prize. ANYBODY is capable of turing him in, and trust me, this element alone adds to the story in such a way that causes the pace becomes frantic and the excitement to reach a fever-pitch numerous times throughout the story. Whether or not you a King fan, this book is a DEFINATE MUST-READ. If you want to read a book for yourself and just for kicks, than look no further. Read &quot;The Running Man!&quot;"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I've read online reviews of Richard Bachman/Stephen King's novel The Running Man, and some of them claim that this book lacks a certain something that relegates it to being the worst of the Bachman Books. For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would think that. As far as I'm concerned, The Running Man is not only one of Bachman/King's best books, it's one of the best straight-up action novels I've had the pleasure to read.When you think about it, there are a ton of action movies out there, but not very many action novels. Sure, you have a plethora of low-grade action series, such as Mack Bolan, Remo Williams, etc, but there aren't very many stand-alone, pure action novels. The Running Man is one, though, and from beginning to end it's a thrill a minute.I grew up in the \`80s, and of course loved the Schwarzenegger film, loosely based on this book. Matter of fact, I still do. But the movie just doesn't compare; whereas it's goofy, WWF-type fun, the novel is dark, brutal, and brimming with mean-spirited, hardcore action. Ben Richards, the scrawny, underfed, cynical protagonist of the novel, is a far cry from Schwarzenegger's he-man. This is one of the best features of the novel, witnessing the \\"pre-tubercular\\" Richards (per King's description, in his \\"The Importance of Being Bachman\\" foreword) take on the forces sent against him.According to King, the novel was written over a 72-hour period, and the published version supposedly isn't much different than that first draft. This speed of writing is reflected in the novel: it chugs along like a No Doze-popping trucker. Whereas most King novels are bogged down by excessive description and detail (something King is normally criticized for by the literary critics), The Running Man is a trim, fat-free exercise in the concept of \\"less is more.\\" A grander scheme (and theme) is hinted at in the subtext of the book, but like all good novels, it isn't beaten over your head; the story itself is the star, and after reading it you'll reflect on the little details ingrained within.Since this is a Richard Bachman novel, expect his trademark, downer ending. However, the ride there is exciting and excellent, and this is one of the few Bachman/King books I would consider re-reading in the future. The novel begs for a more faithful film adaptation; the modicum of description, the streamlined action and characters, and the black humor dripping from the dialog all make the book read like a well-done, action-packed screenplay.It's never been considered a part of the subgenre, but I think The Running Man is an early example of what has become known as cyberpunk. Though it doesn't feature the trademarks normally associated with the genre, such as computers and hackers, the atmosphere in which the novel takes place - a grim, technology-ravaged, depressing world in which a large wall separates the rich from the poor, and the media reigns supreme - could come straight out of William Gibson, or even the film \\"Blade Runner.\\"Simply put, The Running Man comes highly recommended, whether you're an action fan, a King aficionado, or even if you're looking for an introduction to the world of Stephen King/Richard Bachman."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"For those who have only seen the movie, this book will not be what you expect. It seems that the producers of the film only wanted the bare concept about a life and death TV game show and then made up their own story from there. This Ben Richards is a volunteer who wants to earn enough money to pay for his daughter to get medical care. He is a fairly bitter man in a bleak world and the overall tone of the novel is largely pessimistic.Regardless of the dark tone, this is still an entertaining book. Richards is not the most likable character, but the network executives and hunters are so odious that you can't help but root for the underdog. The story moves along fairly briskly and there is enough character development to make you care what happens to Ben and his helpers. This may not be one of King's best novels, but it makes for an entertaining read and I would recommend it on that level.One word of warning, however. King has added an introduction in which he gives away the ending to the book. Why an experienced writer has done something so foolish is beyond me but the knowledge badly damaged my ability to read and enjoy the book. If you have not read Running Man before, I highly encourage you to skip the introduction until after you have read the story."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"It's 2025. The world's poor live in abject poverty while the rich live in highrises ignoring the starving masses grovelling around them. Dissent is repressed by heavy handed police, and the ironically named Free Vee (the TV went out of style years ago) with its sadistic game shows. These macabre shows - with names like 'Fun Guns' and 'Dig Your Own Grave' - tempt desperate slum dwellers with quick cash but in order to obtain the prize money the contestants must put their body and pride on the line for the enjoyment of the millions of viewers across the world. One man, Ben Richards, driven by the inability to provide for his wife and influenza stricken daughter, decides to join the hundreds of impoverished who line up before the enourmous Games Building for a chance to win the elusive prizes. Richards however is different from the average drug addict or street bum who tries out for the games. He's fit and smart - exceptionally smart. So intelligent that he's picked for the most grueling show of all: 'The Running Man'. A game where the player must try to stay free as long as he can as he tries to hide from the rest of America and a group of elite special forces called the Hunters. If the contestant is caught before thirty days (an impossible goal) the game is over and the contestant killed.I immiediatly began to enjoy the main character, Ben Richards from the very start. King creates a typical outcast of society, and rebel of authority but then adds a more sensitive side to the character. Balancing Richards' scathing wit with his powerful love for his family the author makes Richards both intensly charismatic and convincing. Defintely one of my favourite literary characters ever. However King doesn't stop there. The supporting characters are all really realistic as well especially people like Evan Mcone - the sinister leader of the Hunters - and Bradley - the streetwise visionary who is attempting to start a revolution.King also adds a little bit of satire in his novel. In 'The Running Man' he brings to light how TV is a dangerous weapon which can be used against people. The Free Vee in his novel is a horrible object which pumps propaganda and manufactured happiness into the homes of millions across the nation. It easily suppresses the masses who would otherwise rise up in rebellion. With America today inudated with war propaganda and mindless reality TV shows it is not difficult to find the parallel between the story and reality. In times like these this novel gives an important warning that not everything you see on the boob tube is real.The novel combines this satirical edge and realistic characters into an exciting storyline which will keep you 'running' through the book as fast as you can to reach the action packed conclusion. An excellent intelligent thriller every one should read."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I read this book when I was a young teen and I like it still as a good indication of Stephen King's still developing talent when it was written. I only hope that this work doesn't share the same fate following 09/11/01 that The Rage did following Columbine."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Citizen-neglecting government. Truth of horrible realism. Self-serving, spiteful nation. These are a few of the themes that are portrayed in Stephen King's novel The Running Man. This action packed thriller is one of King's best novels. There are 100 chapters in The Running Man, and at only 300 pages, there are only three pages in a chapter on average, giving this book an excellent plot and lots of action. There are many characters in the story, but the major character is Ben Richards, who enters a contest in the future in hopes of winning money to buy medicine for his daughter who has an unknown disease. The game is called 'The Running Man' and the game is just as it sounds. The contestants will be set loose onto the world where he will try to survive his enemy - the world. The individual who successfully kills Richards receives ten thousancd dollars from the government who runs the series of life-taking game shows including Treadmill to Bucks where heart-attack and stroke prone contestants run until they drop. Ben Richards must survive the horde for one month or die. He lays his trust on no one; doing so will get him killed. He must also survive the hunters, a trained group of people who's jobs are to hunt down and kill the contestants. Richards will do anything, incluiding killing others to survive, if not for the money, then to spite the government. The Running Man is a great book that any thrill-seeker would enjoy. It's a short read, only being about 300 pages, but a good one."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"We've all heard the story about the writer who booked himself into a hotel on Friday and walked out Monday morning with a complete book in his hands (it was the Bible - he'd stolen it from the room). With The Running Man, though, we have a complete novel that was written in only three days - and was published with almost no changes to that original draft. Is it even possible to write a decent novel in three days? Yes - but, obviously, The Running Man is not your typical Stephen King novel (which is a large part of the reason it was published under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman). Action is the gas pedal, and King floored it from page one until the very end. Surprisingly, though, there is some pretty decent characterization of the main player - and a heavy undertone of social commentary worked into the book.The setting is a future America in which society has totally fractured, leaving those on the wrong side of the tracks doomed to a life of misery. Ben Richards personifies that social inequity - unable to find work because of his antiestablishment ways (for some reason, he didn't want to keep working at a job which exposed the old family jewels to dangerous amounts of radiation leakage), he can't take care of his family - his wife keeps turning tricks for money, and his 18-month-old daughter has the flu and will likely die without proper medicine. There is only one way out for him - the Network Games. The whole nation is fascinated with the Free-Vee game shows, shows such as Treadmill to Bucks or Swim With the Crocodiles. No show satisfies the bloodlust of the public like The Running Man does, though, and a man of Richards' temperament is just the kind of player the show is looking for.The game is simple. Richards is paraded out in front of the cameras, castigated as a dangerous low-life, then turned loose on the streets. A few hours later, the show's Hunters begin going after him. Richards wins money for every hour he can avoid capture (and by capture, I mean bloody death - broadcast live to the whole country), with bonuses for any cops killed along the way. Best of all, the viewing public can win money for themselves by turning him in if they see him. Richards proves himself a worthy contestant indeed - the Game in fact, will never be the same.This is one of my least favorite King novels, primarily because it's so action-oriented. It doesn't put down roots, and it doesn't delve completely into the minds of any characters other than the protagonist. It is, in fact, like a weak film adaptation of a King novel - stripped of all the nuances that make King such a special writer. That's not to way this isn't an exciting novel because it is - that's about all it is, though."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I decided to take another look at the \\"Richard Bachman\\" novel \\"The Running Man,\\" because I wanted to check and see how much Ben Affleck and Matt Damon had been ripping it off last year with their idea for a reality game show contestants tried to get from point \\"A\\" to point \\"B\\" with the entire nation keeping their eye out for them to cash in on a reward. The show got the plugged pulled on it after 9/11 and somehow the punch line to that particular story ends up being \\"Push, Nevada,\\" but that is not important right now.Ben Richards lives in a futuristic bleak America where his only hope of getting the money he needs to take his daughter to a doctor, is to be \\"lucky\\" enough to get a spot on one of the big television game shows. Ben hits the jackpot and becomes the contestant on \\"The Running Man.\\" The rules are fairly simple: you are given a head start and head off into the world where the government will give $10,000 to anybody who kills you. Add to that the show's hunters, who will be in hot pursuit as well, and it is no wonder that no one has every survived the one month necessary to \\"win\\" the game. Of course, \\"The Running Man\\" has never had a contestant like Ben Richards before.Anyhow, \\"The Running Man\\" is what they would have called a potboiler in the old days. The gimmick is how each of the 100 chapters countdown to the thrilling climax (a ploy Dickie Bachman likes a lot if you remember what the author did in \\"Thinner\\"). Reading \\"The Running Man\\" reminds me of watching \\"Survivor,\\" (albeit with a killer twist on the old \\"Queen for a Day\\" game show) because the chief fun with each is wondering what you would do in that selfsame predicament. The original game concept is a lot more interesting than the lame version they came up with for the movie version, which was more a take off on \\"American Gladiators\\" to suit the peculiar talents of star Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is a quick and easy read, which is exactly what you want with a plot like this one.Final note, if you read this one you might as well do its evil twin, \\"The Long Walk.\\" If not taken separately certainly when considered together these two stories will convince you that Mark Burnett does not have anything on Stephen King when it comes to creating reality game shows. Then again, I am not sure if King is amazing prescient, or if this is simply a reminder of how close King has his finger on the pulse of popular culture."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I read several Stephen King books before attempting this one. No, it wasn't long like 'The Stand' or 'Bag of Bones', and in fact, it is one of his shorter books, just over 300 pages long. But I saw the movie, and, well, I hated it. I thought it was terrible, really, and somehow I thought the book might be the same. I am aware that books are nearly always better, but come on! How could a movie go so astray from the book? It seemed to happen here.First, the book is broken into 100 chapters, and at 300 pages for the book, each chapter is only about 3 pages long. I think the longest is 5, which means you breeze straight through it in less than a day if you try. The action is non-stop, the plot is great, and you're hoping that Ben Richards survives when you close it again. However, with such a great plot and ideas, this book should have been longer. LONGER?! Yes, I know, I never thought I would want a Stephen King book to be longer, but this one should have...I just hated to see it end.Since reading it, I have borrowed the book to a few friends, and they all love it, too. (Much for the same reasons!) There are no monsters or spirits in this book, but a man fighting for survival in the near future. And with CBS's 'Survivor' and ABC's 'The Mole' now airing on TV, it looks like the world may soon reach 'The Running Man'. That's what makes this book so scary; it's just too real for words. So if you're looking for a quick read--like for a roadtrip or for a plane flight--or just for your own enjoyment, grab this one. But if you're looking for something to get completely involved with for the next 3 months, think about a different title. You'll love the characters, but it might not be long enough for some people."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"First off, do *NOT* read the preface from King. He gives away the ending. Arggh. His comments should come at the end of the book.Good, enjoyable easy read. Little darker than the movie."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I had a plane ride across the United States so I read this as my form of enjoyment. I may have seen the movie before reading the book (I am a huge Stephen King fan and have read almost all of his books so I figured it was time to pick this one up) and the movie brings the realistic element that King is known for.Overall, decent writing - which is why it got knocked down to 4 stars. The premise is good and execution is good but some of the time you feel like you are reading a novel and not engulfed in the game. I'd recommend it as a fun and easy read to anyone looking to waste time."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This was the first Bachman book I've read by Mr. King. I was just expecting it to be another SK book that followed most of his guidelines, and I was wrong by a long shot. This book was a lot more gritty and cruel than a lot of his other books. King doesn't beat around the bush when he writes as Bachman, he gets straight to the point. It was fast paced with a lot there to keep you turning the pages. The only complaint I have is that in the introduction of being Richard Bachman, King gives away the ending to the book for some stupid reason. Other than that, it was a great read. Highly recommended, especially because this was the only SK book I ever read that made me crack up on the last page (In a good way)."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"When I first read this book in the early 90s, I thought the plot was so far fetched ... now in this age of shows like survivor, I'm not so sure. Stephen King gives us a look at our not-so-distant future, only slightly exaggerating the world of television as we know it. Be prepared to be shocked by the lengths people will go to for entertainment!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Sthephen King is not a science-fiction or fantasy writer. He is a horror writer. But - since he's an excellent one , he tried his hand at both - and succeeded more or less (his fantasy is better).&quot;The Running man&quot; is a sci-fi thriller in the near future. the story of Ben Richards and a giant T.V corporation. Ben sighns a contract that allows the &quot;The running man&quot; stalkers to hunt him down , for a period of 30 days.If they win , he dies - for the viewing pleasure of the mind-numbed masses. If he wins - they lose one million dollars.Anyway , unlike in the movie - that is excellent - Ben's not restricted to some &quot;zones&quot; , he can go anywhere in the world only that he got to keep moving , 'cause the stalkers are on his back - and the stalkers are'nt flamboyant killers with fans , that go one-on-one - they are regular guys (killers , I mean) dressed in &quot;The running man&quot; overall's , trecking him down in groups , and killing with simple guns.Pretty nice book , though I saw the film first , so it kinda ruined it for me (the film is more exciting).I like King's work - especially his &quot;regular&quot; horror , but if you want to try something a bit different by him try &quot;Eyes of the dragon&quot; or &quot;The Talisman&quot;."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"The future is not what it used to be, as the old saying goes. How should we look at a futuristic novel 29 years after it was written? I call the book futuristic, as it does not earn the name of science fiction. What immediately struck me is the similarity of this book and the recent blockbuster, The Matrix. There are differences, obviously, but they are not crucial. There is the Matrix, and there is the Network. In both environments, people in their whole mass live either terrorized, or corrupted, but almost everyone is living in a sort of a bad dream. The Bachman's world of 2025 is not a pleasure to live in. Inhuman institutions which took the earth over - that has been the dread of XX century, now coming slowly to its end. Many authors fantasized about it in a great many of ways and it does not really matter whether the novel is framed as realistic, naturalistic, pure science fiction, or just futuristic, as in the case of The Running Man. We may sketch yet another comparisons. This book and The Long Walk sport the same theme of a wild national pastime, where human life is sacrificed to entertain the bloodthirsty masses, and by no means the boogeymen - all the ordinary people, all of us, or, rather, all of them. Circus and bread, that's all the society need, sad but true, at least since the Roman Republic. Similarities may be pointed out between the book and the last to date Bachman novel, The Regulators, in the sense of the power the media have over us. The danger of detachment from reality. In The Running Man, the evil is personalized in the Free-Vee, an Orwellian, omnipotent super-television. Coming back to what I mentioned at the very beginning, the future-world Ben Richards lives in is a little funny from the point of view of a guy who lives in a cyber era of the Y2K. Technology is faster-paced than the best industrial prophets can estimate. A funny thing is that Ben's aircraft is Lockheed. Well, the firm went bankrupt several years after the publication of the novel. One can list such oddities, but why the hell? Does the fact that 2001 the Space Odyssey was directed in the 60s DETER all the entertainment? No, it doesn't. Same goes here. To me, it's a sort of fun to read old futuristic prose and compare to the reality. One might wonder why King wrote such a novel, so much unlike the other ones. First of all, it only proves his ability and breadth of his capacity as a writer. On the other hand, what we look in his prose is not so much the scene, the environment, as the characters themselves, narration, dialogues, and IT, something unique and King-ian (or King's King-ese? King-ous?). All in all, I liked the book very much, was entertained throughout, was brave enough to disagree with the author that Schwarzenegger is not a good type of guy to portray Ben Richards, and of course I was sad with the way it ended. Before I finish, I have to complain, though. I have just bought a Signet paperback sporting FOREWORD by Stephen King. What is the purpose of foreword? We all know, I suppose. Nevertheless, as I worked my way through it, I had to grimace when King revealed the ending of the book in his preface. Oh, Master, why have you done it? You, who often complained that readers have itchy hands and peek at the last pages because they can't hold to the end? You, who published The Green Mile as a serial novel and publicly admitted that you liked the idea that readers couldn't just open the last page and see the end? I am angry with you, Mr. King. But just a little. Inside, I am glad as hell that I had an opportunity to read this outstanding novel. Thanks. And I ask for more."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"A seat gripper all the way through! Couldn't put it down once I started it. Belie able characters & expressive content.

I read the book in about two days, staying up really late the second night to finish it. I haven't read a book that quickly in many years.The 100 chapters are titled \\"...Minus xxx and COUNTING...\\", where xxx is a number starting from 100 and counting down to 000. These titles convey a sense of time running out for Richards, which is exactly what's happening. A huge bounty is on his head and the latest info on him is televised every night, so practically everyone on the US eastern seaboard is trying to find him and get the bounty. Somewhere in the middle Richards uncovers what looks to be a massive government operation to deliberately misinform the public about rampant industrial pollution of the air. Then it becomes a race against time both to survive and to reveal what he knows.If you're looking for a quick reading thriller that you can enjoy even without 100% concentration, The Running Man would be a good choice. The setting is Blade Runner esque: Set some 100 years in the future with the migration of the American people to mega-cities completed and the government running practically everything either directly or indirectly. Factories belching smoke everywhere. Seedy underground societies comprised of people making illegal trades to stay above the poverty line. The length of the book and the focus on Richards' flight prevents King from fleshing out this fascinatingly grim future world that I sincerely hope for succeeding generations doesn't become reality."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I picked this book up, as a big fan of Stephen King, but wanted something short.

The good news is that it didn't ruin the ride.This story just keeps \\"running\\" in a man-against-world, pulse pounding story. I felt my adrenaline rise more than a few times--an odd feeling while sitting passively in my boring, long commute. Also, I've seen the Schwarzenegger movie a long time ago. While that is fine entertainment, this is way better, different, and more dimensional.This was my first time listening to this narrator. Like any new narrator for me, it took a few chapters to settle into his reading style and intonation, but once I did I thought his voice blended perfectly with the story's mood.

He never fails to explain details that a reader would never consider such as, in this case, he shows why each of the charactors think the way they do instead of only looking at the main charactor's point of view. As usual, there are many unexpected twists and turns which keep readers on the edge of their seats. The only reason I have for not giving this a higher rating is that the choice of readers in some of his latter books have been a little disapointing. As someone who must rely on audio books, I find it much more interesting when the reader uses several different voices. I realize there's no replacing Frank Muller but there are many other readers out there who are still great story tellers. This reader was also disapointed in the fact that the volume was constantly having to be adjusted.

Excellent short story and great voice from the recording."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This shouldn't be taken the wrong way, but one of this book's best virtues is that it is short. King knew the idea was not developed enough to drag it out any further. It was 230 pages or so, and that was the longest it could be, at this stage of development, to maintain meaning and interest the whole way through.It is a very good idea, but I got the feeling it was something King came up with quite early in his writing career, then released later without really going over it again through the lens of several more years of top-level writing experience. A bit of tinkering here and there, shaving off or rerouting some areas where the behavior was slightly unrealistic or unjustified, could have really made this a truly great novel.At any rate, it is a worthwhile read. As with Jaws, those who adapted it into a screenplay did a pretty good job of focusing on the important throughline and reworking things for the pace and punctuation of film.I would be really interested in reading a full length novel if King ever decided to go back to this one and really flesh it out as a truly mature writer."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

Someone mentioned that this book was similar, but perhaps a little more adult version and it came a lot earlier. Of course, I was intrigued. Fresh off my previous addiction, I decided I needed to read this - right away. There were so many comparisons drawn and people kept saying this book was much better.So of course, I downloaded the Running Man right away via my Kindle. I was not disappointed. From the beginning, it went straight into the plot. It is an alternate future with many similarities to our own. People faced desperate times and were going to great lengths to just stay alive. It kind of reminds you of current events. This book read very quickly and definitely made me think. I finished it in about 3-4 hours. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the forward did give away the ending and also I didn't necessarily like this ending, but it probably was the best that this type of book could give for an ending.*SPOILER ALERT*I was upset that at the end, the hero really got screwed. He got even but it was disappointing because I got so attached to him. I was hoping after reading the Hunger Games, I could find a book that was as interesting but would end happily, I guess. I felt really invested into the main character. He kept hitting all kinds of road blocks but was so clever about figuring ways out of almost certain doom. It seemed unfair that he had so many odds stacked against him. I liked the book very much, but again I was angry at what happened.In the end, this book was still so gripping and engrossing, I would still recommend this to people who like books similar to the Hunger Games."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"At a time when the most popular games were Family Feud (1976-1985), The Joker's Wild (1977-1986) and The Price if Right (1972-current), The Running Man is an oddly prophetic look at game shows forty-three years in the future. In the year 2025, the mega-corporations control society and the most popular game shows are reality shows... reality shows of death!I read The Running Man as a science fiction novel (not as a King/Bachman novel) but I became most interesting in King's early vision of the future of TV gaming and the control it has on people. Look at all the abysmal shows that have been run over the past two decades, especially the ones where conniving producers purposely mismatch the characters for the sake of artificial drama (The Real World) or pin humans against each other in challenging conditions for prizes (Survivor) or just viewing dysfunctional people (The Osbournes and so many others).Stop and think about it. Isn't it just perverse?Well, ethics beside, The Running Man has a more lethal twist to the genre, as you can probably read in every other review. Considering King/Bachman's future, it is dystopian in the fullest and filled with all sorts of evils. In a sense, it's unilaterally drab. The whole \\"dreary, dystopian Big Brother\\" future has been done in the 70s, the 60s and before - so that aspect isn't anything new. The characterization is also fairly unilateral. It's a short novel so it doesn't have much time to build up the character of Ben Richards, besides his socio-economic status and his love for his daughter and wife (hmm, that's about it).The ending is obvious even to someone who hasn't seen the movie (I hate sci-fi films, with a few minor exceptions). The unfolding of the ending, while predictable, was a blow-for-blow series of bluff, call, bluff, call. It's very well-scripted, nerve racking journey to the end."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I am a dedicated S.K. reader, and i have read probably 25 or so of his countless books.

I started at takeoff and finished during the descent- and I have to say that it was one of the few S.K. books that I was sad to have end. It was well thought out, and it made me want to kneel down before the good lord and pray that this isn't what the future holds.All in all, if you just starting to read Stephen King, this is the one to start out with. It's not as far-fetched as some of his other books, and it will make you want to read more and more.Buy it. Read it. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"A very successful, but unlikey King novel. Characters are developed quickly. The pace is fast and furious. Nothing is supernatural or overtly frightening, but, oh man, is this a sinister place set sometime in the future.The Running Man is a nationally televised gameshow featuring ordinary US citizens, who through their own personal circumstances, volunteer to be chased by professionally trained headhunters with the goal that the citizen contestants will be executed for pure entertainment value. It is possible to for a person to win by outmaneuvering the executioners, but in reality, nobody has ever survived for more than 8 days.Despite knowing the odds and probable outcome, Ben Richards enters the game, with the hope that he might last long enough to earn enough game money to provide medical treatment for his daughter, gravely ill with pneumonia. Or perhaps from pollution created by the capitalistic, greedy country that has evolved. However, Richards proves to be the ultimate player and his experience is cliffhanger. I could not put this story down.My secret favorite character is McCone, the premiere headhunter, who King describes at one point his snarling at Richards as \\"a completely unconscious gesture, one that could probably be traced all the way to McCone's ancestors, the Neanderthals who crept up behind their enemies with large rocks rather than battling to death in an honorable, but unintelligent manner.\\""},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I was pretty surprised to see this book lurking around a second-hand store. You see, I've been familar with the film since growing up. If you'd asked me prior to seeing this document I would have bet on that movie NOT even beeing based on a book, let alone a book by the famous S. KingMy second surprise was of course that the book was good. I probably shouldn't have been so naive as to think the book would be anything like the spandex rubbish that the movie was, but whatever.Running man depicts a future where the underclass are controlled by television, whether being glued to the screen at home, or being part of the show. All the while pollution, corruption and elitism run rampant. Our main man, decides to take part in the Running Man, a reality show where contestants earn money per hour of avoiding death or capture by pretty much anyone in the communinty who cares to take a shot.the book is much more politcal than the movie, and doesn't quite have the same ending, the other major difference being: where the movie depicts a world obsessed with ridiculous 'superhero' characters, the book shows us a decrepit wasteland of America populated with scumbags and ruffians, who will do anything for a 'new dollar'Definately recommended, at around 200 pages reading Running Man will probably take the same amount of time taken to watch the movie..."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Forget Arnold. Other than the character names this book is entirely different. Ben Richards is on the run. This is the future of reality TV. Richards is poor and has a 3 year old child - sick with respiratory ailments - just like all the poor folk who cant afford clean air filters. He is chosen to be on the running man - the Mack-Daddy of all prime time shows. The runner gets 100 dollars an hour and wins a billion if he can run for the full 30 days without getting caught. All he has to do is send in a tape to the studio once a day to show he is still alive. Easy right? Then how come the record is only eight days? Because the entire county is looking for you and will get rewards for sightings or even killing you! There is also a team of professional hunters that will stop at nothing from killing their prey. Friends and relatives will be bribed or tortured as the case may be for information. This book moves at breakneck speed and the pressure does not stop until the incredible ending. The only advantage Richards has is a twelve-hour head start and the fact there are no rules. If you thought Ken Jennings was a tough contestant on Jeopardy you haven't seen Ben Richards. Buy this book and get ready to run...Relic113"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"The Running Man is a quick and exciting read - nonstop action will keep you turning the pages. In 2025, reality television dominates the airwaves, putting health and even lives at stake. King's vision in 1982 is uncomfortably close to the current state of entertainment media. It's more unsettling to read today than back in the early eighties.For a Stephen King novel, The Running Man is unusually concise and not too gory. He describes only what's necessary to sketch out a bleak future. Unfortunately, this is also why his characters suffer a bit. The hero has but one motivation (to stay alive) and his feelings aren't really discussed. However, as a plot-driven story, it's understandable that character development takes a back seat.The Running Man is designed to thrill and chill! Recommended for any fan of science fiction and action movies!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Let me preface this reveiw by urging anyone who has seen the movie to not judge the book by it. This book, although not 1984, is far more profund than anything with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it.Ben Richards, the lead character in The Running Man, is accurately described by one character as an anachronism- he beleives in fidelity and virtue in a bleak dystopian world obsessed with 3D Perverto Mags and watching their fellow man killed on the &quot;Free-Vee&quot;. However, he is poor and his daughter is ill...the paltry unemployment check must be used for food and he does not wish to see his wife reverting to prostituion. He turns to the Games, barbaric exploits of human suffering to appease the masses, and is chosen for the most prestigious, dangerous, and rewarding game- The Running Man.In The Running Man the one doing the running must elude the Hunters for 30 days, using the whole world as his arena. However, the running man must send two videotapes per day back to the Network- enabling the Hunters to pinpoint his location. Nonetheless, Richards is resourceful and skilled at dissapearing into the bowels of large cities- he has nothing to lose except his life, and knows that the money he makes will reach his wife regardless of whether he lives or dies.I couldn't put this book down, but upon finishing it, (incidentally the ending hits a perfect note for a dystopian novel) I realized there was more to the book than &quot;met the eye&quot;, if you pardon the cliche. Stephen King (although this book was writen under the psuedonym of Richard Bachman) includes enough social commentary -be it concerning class division, pollution or the television's ability to put blinders on one's eyes- to entice someone looking for more than just an exilarating action novel.Highly reccomended, but avoid the movie like the plague."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"read this book. The movie simply pales in comparison. The underground post-apocalyptic game area of the movie just made no sense. This book actually takes part in the U.S. and regular people can call in and tell the Hunters where the Runners are. It's like America's Most Wanted turned in to a game show. All the characters are as real as they come and there's no cheesy weapons or story lines. If you are in to action stories this is it."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Well the story it self was great, fast, and enjoyable. Overall the book is well worth the ten bucks it costs, and more. HOWEVER, if you have not read this book yet, do not read the forward until you have. The foreward gives away the ending, and the ending is amazing IF you haven't read the foreward. So, ya, read the book, but read the foreward as if it were an afterward.OVERALL: Great read!!!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"The Running Man is the story of Ben Richards and his risk to make money for his desperately poor family. It is the year 2025 and there are the very rich and the impoverished. Free-Vee is a television that is installed in every person's house that shows game shows where people are used for entertainment so they can make money-- even if it costs them their lives. Richards decides that he has no other choice other than to be on one of the game shows to win money. The book talks about what he has to go through in order to be chosen to be on a show. Finally, he is chosen for the show &quot;The Running Man&quot; where he is sent out into the streets and then proceeds to run from hunters who are trying to find him and kill him. The book talks about his near escapes and his encounters while running across the country from the hunters as well as everyone in the country. The book is excellent from beginning to end and is hard to put down. The chapters are short which makes the book goes extrememely fast. The ending is one of the best endings to a book I've read in awhile. A must read!!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Well, short, but effective. That is what Stephen King chose in one of his thrillers, the Running Man. The theme of the story, is so creative and exciting ; that it takes you to believe everything Ben Richards says (The main character). Simply, the book if not one of the best, the best I have ever read. I myself, I am a 13 year old kid who loved the book. I understood it too. I plan to read a lot more of these books...."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"As some of the reviewers imply, if you are a hard-core Stephen King horror fan, maybe this book isn't your cup of tea. Me, I simply enjoy Stephen King as a master storyteller, and that means in any genre he wishes to write. Think &quot;Different Seasons&quot;, which I usually refer to my friends who don't get why I like Stephen King, where he does mostly-mainstream fiction. And this SF actioner is also one of his best works. Truly, &quot;Richard Bachman&quot; allowed King to write out of the box people used to enclose him in, and we are all the more richer for that.Don't be afraid to step in and try it."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Steven King is totally amazing. I started to read it and was automatically hooked to it. I loved the main character Ben Richards. He was a shrewd tough guy who took out practically the whole evil world. This book had everything. I could not put it down. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes action-packed books."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"i found the book to be very exciting and fast-paced, but i unfortunately read the preface \\"the importance of being Bauchman\\" which tells the ending of the book...so i you do decide to read this book, read the preface (which is quite interesting) AFTERWARDS"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I loved the movie so I decided to get the book. If you loved the movie you will adore this great work actually masterpiece written by King. I could not put the book down. I am not what you would call a great reader; I never really spent much time with books, but I could not put this one down. The main character is about the exact opposite of Arnold Schwarzenneger. Though it is a great book. I don't want to give too much away, but look out for an explosive ending."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I am avid reader of Stephen King and this book is definitely one of his best. It can be kind of confusing at first because the book is set in the future. However, King does an excellent job of using his running theme, the media, to illustrate the fascination of popular tv and its connection to human survival."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Stephen King is great at making a long story short as he did with the earlier Stand. The character Ben Richards is nothing like Arnold(who portrays him in the ridiculous movie). I like the way King makes Richards so vulnerable and confident at the same time. You will love the friction between Richards and his rival, the top ranked hunter."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Please do not let the movie diminish any thoughts you have of possibly reading this book. Of all the Stephen King books I've read, this is my favorite. Like many of the people who have also reviewed this book, I could not put it down. The characters are realistic and the ending is awesome."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I first read this book when i was a lot younger (about 12), and back then i just liked it because it was a fast-paced, action packed thriller. I still love it now because of that! It's not your average Stephen King novel, but for something that's not his forte he's done it amazingly well. The future he's portrayed is dark and sinister, and is all the more scary because it COULD happen (kinda reminds me of 1984 by George Orwell in that regard). Oh, and don't listen to that guy who was ranting on about how it sucked because it was predictable (the one who was babbling about Cujo). The guy can't even spell, so what are the chances of him knowing anything about good writing?"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This was the first King book I ever read. Since then I have read many of his best books. This is one of his best. Richards is is one bad mother and I just couldn't wait to see what he would do next. The books ending was really cool. All I could say was WOW! I know King wrote this when he was young but this book could have been a full fledged novel. I only give it a 9 because of that. I mean I couldn't put it down so I finished it way too quick. Also, the movie doesn't do the book justice. I am an Arnold fan, don't get me wrong but they are not alike at all. I think it would have been a much better movie if it did follow the book. Anyways, I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This novel kept me reading. It was the first of many Stephen King books that I have read, and as a freshmen to the KING genre, that I now realize goes far beyond just being horror, it delivered to me one thing I did not expect, namely action. With this action came a series of characters that were as likable as they were realistic. The only thing for which I deducted a point was the movie for which it was based. If you have seen the movie don't think for a minute that it shares anything with the book except a name"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"The Running Man is a fascinating account of a future America in which game shows are reality and people who hate the government attack 100 story buildings with jumbo jets.I've just read the book for the 4th time and this has been the most depressing read of them all. All along I felt the end of the book was justifiable, but events of recent weeks have made me rethink.Of course, it's easy to see why it seems justifiable in the book. The government is a giant TV network and they require everyone to own a television so that they can watch undesirables be dispatched at an alarming rate on the many game shows that run all day. The poor are treated as villains and there is no regard for basic human rights. It's Jesse Helms' dream of America.Ben Richards enters the top show, The Running Man, to try to win enough money to get his daughter a doctor and cure her pneumonia. As he runs, he realizes that far more is at stake than his daughter's well being and he becomes a crusader for the downtrodden.Of course, the network distorts his messages and vilifies him. But clearly the tide is turning as people actually find themselves rooting for him to win against incredible odds.His final act is heroic and liberating. You see that the world will forever be changed and that it will be for the better. But now you have to stop and think that the terrorists on September 11th were thinking the same exact thing. Clearly violence is never the best solution, but to some it seems like the only way to deliver their message.Over the 15 or so years since I first read the Bachman Books I've seen many things in our society that make me refer back to two of them. Rage involves a student who goes on a shooting rampage. It's now become an all to common occurrence. When Survivor premiered I thought, \\"Here we go, Stephen King was hitting the nail right on the head.\\"After the World Trade Center attack, everyone was saying, \\"I never thought somebody would actually crash a jet into a building.\\" I did. I don't know how many times I sat in a stadium, or looked at a high rise, and thought how easy it would be. Stephen King put it into words that made it seem all too plausible.King wasn't the first to come up with something like that. Years earlier, in Black Sunday, Thomas Harris described crashing a blimp into a stadium. After the WTC attacks people started thinking about that and worrying that blimps shouldn't fly over sporting events. Maybe they should have been thinking about these things all along. After all, clearly some people were."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"It's the year 2025 and Ben Richards, resident of the dystopian Co-Op City, is out of work, his daughter is dying of pneumonia, and his wife is prostituting herself to feed their family. The only thing left for him to do is run. He auditions for Games Network, a government-run reality television station, that run compulsory program on all of the city's televisions 24 hours a day. He is selected to be a contestant on the Network's most popular TV show The Running Man. On the Running Man contestants are branded enemies of the state, released into society, and win 100 New Dollars for their beneficiaries for each hour that they are able to evade capture and execution by the show's hired \\"Hunters.\\"Let me stop right here and preface my review of this book by saying that I am a HUGE fan of King. He can weave stories so convincing that I am able to suspend disbelief for literally anything that he is able to come up with. Seriously. The man could write about homicidal bananas, and I would be completely on board (and most likely terrified of bananas for the rest of my life).With that said, on to my review . . .I really enjoyed The Running Man. Like King's other \\"Bachman Books\\" The Running Man is grittier than a lot of his other work, and that's one of my favorite things about King writing as Bachman, he really makes you feel the desperation of the situation.Ben Richards is a great character. Initially I found him annoying, but as the book progressed his snarkiness really grew on me. The cast of supporting characters is excellent as well. Bradley, one of the people who helps Ben in New York is one of my most favorite King characters ever, and \\"Chief Hunter\\" McCone is so appropriately sleazy that he made my skin crawl.The story moved very quickly. There were a lot of well written action sequences and completely unexpected plot twists. It held my attention so well that I was able to finish it in a single sitting.My only real gripe was the ending, which is the case with quite a few King books. To me it felt a bit rushed, but maybe that's because I was hoping for a different outcome.Overall I'd recommend The Running Man to any King fans or fans of dystopian literature; and with the popularity of more recent works like The Hunger Games and Battle Royale it's really worth a look for fans of those series as well."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Wow, this was just a fun book to read. There isn't much depth here, which I usually look for in a book, but it was such interesting action...beginning to end...that I'll give it 5 stars even though it's not going to change your mind or your life or your philosophy. It was just fun.Of course, the ending came as a total surprise to me and was really interesting given events that came long after the story was written. I was actually in shock as I read it happening.Not much else to say - this book was incredibly fun from start to finish. Just not deep..."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Once again, just as Thinner, this book was not very good. It was entertaining enough to get through it but it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat as his other books do. For some reason, he has a different writing style in the Bachman books. Maybe that was done purposely. I don't know. Whatever the reason, I don't like the writing style at all."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This book is about Ben Richards. In the year 2025 he goes on a game show called &quot;The Running Man&quot; because he needs the reward money to pay for his daughter's medical bills. On &quot;The Running Man&quot; they send people out on the streets and hunt them down. If the people survive for a month they get 1 billion dollars.

It was perfect, it was the only way to bring &quot;The Running Man&quot;(as in the TV show) to justice."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I thought since the great Steven King wrote it, it was going to be a lot better. But he hardley used discriptive words for the characters. I think this is not one of his better stories. I think he should stick with horror books for example &quot;IT&quot; it was your classic mind twisting novels. But the Running Man was a rather boring book. You could see what was going to happen before it happens. there was not very much suspense in The Running Man. But in the books lik &quot;IT&quot; and &quot;CUJO&quot; every thing was a surprise.

If you liked The Running Man, you will like The Long Walk."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I ordered this a year ago because I loved the movie. Unfortunately this book is nothing like the movie. The movie is so different that I wonder why the writer didn't claim his own credit. In the book poor people and criminals can enter death games for chances to get rich. Ben Richards gets into the riskiest, but most profitable game. Ben gets a few hour headstart and can go anywhere in the world he wants, why the nation hunts him. His family gets paid more for each day he survives, as long as he keeps contact with the producers.This world starts out interesting, but quickly turns boring. I'm not a huge King fan, but believe this must have been one of his first. It has that writing style we all had when we were seventeen thinking maybe someday we could write. Bad pacing, too much action in spots with some of it being unbeleivable. Ben resembles the Ben in the movie, but the books comes off all wrong. He was angry, greedy, and a lot like a criminal. When following the Ben in this book, I felt like I was following a gang banger. A murderous guy, who would cut your throat because you had a nicer car.I post this now since the Hunger Games is so popular. TRM movie and THG book resemble each other, but I have to warn fans to avoid this book. It's not even half as good as it's movie and won't satisfy your Hunger Game addiction."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This is where they got the idea, I bet."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"The Running Man may have a plausible future, it may have a realistic character, and it does have suspense.

Like an ignorant fool, I read through the intro part of the book and already knew how this book would end!

So if you get this, just go straight to the actual story, you will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I picked this book up for one reason, I enjoyed the movie. By the time I finished the book I realized something, the movie sucks by comparison! The Running Man is quite possibly the best of the Bachman books!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Meet Ben Richards. Ben lives in the United States which has gone all totalitarian in the year 2025. His life sucks. Unemployed. Daughter sick. Wife turning tricks. So Ben wants to be on one of the reality shows run by the Games Network, a government-backed station. The problem is that these are violent games in which participants often die.Lucky Ben! He gets to be on the best show--the running man. Simple rules. Each hour he stays alive earns him money. Hunters are sent after him. Prizes are offered to the public to help catch him. The game ends in 30 days or when he dies, whichever comes first.This is the first King's book I like. I even like Ben Richards. A good man in desperate situation. He wants to work. He cares for his daughter and his wife. He is brave but not a superhuman showoff. The book is an easy and fun read. It is not as exciting as \\"Hunger Games\\" but the writing is better here, the story better told.Futuristic does not seem to be King's thing. (OK to be fair the book was released in 1982 and was banged out in under a week.) I mean, every reference is just so dated. People in 2025 live the same way as in the 1980's except that they have funky names for things (newsie for newspaper, Free-Vee for T.V., etc). The network relies on the Postal Service to get video clips back from Ben. At one point Ben needs quarters to use a pay phone!**SPOILER** I did not like the ending. I was rooting for Ben and would be much happier if King goes with rebels bringing down the regime. There is more going for that than in \\"Catching Fire\\". **END SPOILER**"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I haven't met a Bachman book so far that I haven't been a fan of. While this isn't my favorite from the pseudonym, it is still very enjoyable. This book was originally published in 1982, and like \\"the long walk\\" focuses on a futuristic America. (this time the year 2025).It's always interesting to read books written over 20 years ago about a futuristic America in which we now live. (even though we're not quite to 2025 yet) Some of the small things you notice are that cigarette vending machines are present, the costs of items are more representative of what they were in the 80's, and the dialogue has obviously changed. Most would look at these as distractions, but I actually found them enjoyable. It made me appreciate that much more the story Stephen King wrote because it gave me better perspective on when he wrote it.In King's novel every household is, by law, equipped with a \\"free-vee\\" whose programming is designed by \\"the network\\". The \\"games\\" that people watch exploit those participating for the entertainment of those who are watching. (sound familiar?) This was written long before reality television was mainstream. One of the games depicted by King is called Treadmill to Bucks. The contestants run on a treadmill and have to answer questions. If they answer incorrectly the treadmill speeds up. According to the author, \\"they only accept chronic heart, liver, or lung patients sometimes throwing in a crip for comic relief\\".Like all of his books, especially of the Bachman variety, the story centers heavily on the people. In this case it is Ben Richards an unemployed father whose daughter has pneumonia and he can't afford medicine. His wife is prostituting herself just to be able to buy black market medicine for the child and food for the family. (This is no Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film of the same name. They have very few if any similarities.)Very enjoyable, and a quick read. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Years before reality tv was even thought of by television companies, Stephen King presented the idea (writing under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman) as being a mass-opiate to the public. Set in a dystopia future in 2025, THE RUNNING MAN revolves around Ben Richards, a down-an-out common worker who can't get a job because he won't fit into the system. Being unemployed and practically unhirable, Richards' 18-month-old-baby-girl begins suffering from a chronic cough and he and his wife have no way to pay for medicine. Knowing that his child will die unless she gets the medicine she needs, Richards registers and enters himself in the Free-Vee games. People can win lots of money on these reality shows, but they're also highly dangerous and usually lethal. Richards knows he's not old enough for Treadmill to Bucks, so he hopes for a shot at a show like Swim the Crocodiles. Instead, Richards finds himself selected for the biggest money show of them all, The Running Man. Presented to the public as a wretched criminal, Richards is released into the public. For every hour he stays alive, he earns money. If he can stay alive without being caught for a predetermined amount of time, he'll win a life of luxury. The catch is, no one has ever survived--everyone is eventually hunted within a few days. But, Richards is a man living not for himself and every moment he's alive gives his baby girl a better chance of surviving.THE RUNNING MAN is a very tight and action-based book. It fits more into the genre of science fiction than the horror/suspense that King is usually known. However, except for the motivation of Ben Richards, the book lacks any characterization that King writes so well. The book is a quick read, but not as fulfilling. Also, in the post-9/11 world we live in some people may have concerns about the novel's ending. I, however, enjoyed THE RUNNING MAN, but didn't find it as fulfilling as much of King's other works."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"In 1982 Stephen king wrote the running man; a science fiction action adventure set in 2020 or so. The portrait he painted of the future in this novel is remarkably acurate in our world today, 14 years shy of the running man's. King prophecized a number of things including, reality television with cruel overtones, media influence over gov't, the use of airplanes as weapons, and air pollution. This was a thoroughly enjoyable read that was far superior to and much different than the movie."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This is Stephen King's second best book, behind only The Stand. This is a superbly written action story. it has a great plot, moves quickly and draws you in to this nightmare like no one else can. the book does start out a bit slowly, but picks up tremendously, ending with one explosive (literally) ending!Don't watch the movie--you know the one with Ahnold! in it, because it was terrible. the adaptation screwed up the story. i wish that someone would do a true movie adaptation of this Stephen King masterpiece."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I don't think it's written in Stephen's normal style, which actually appeals to me because it can get old sometimes. It's a very short, sweet, and to-the-point action thriller, instead of his usually mystery horror type novels. I haven't seen the movie, mainly because I didn't knwo there was one until about ten minutes ago, but I don't think a movie could ever do the book justice. The two twists at the ending kept me reading and had me in suspense until the last page. I'm just dissapointed that it wasn't longer. He could have fit a lot more story in and it still would have been fantastic.A great read, I recommend that any avid reader pick this up. Fantastic writing and a good, solid plot make this a must have."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"The future is much different from the time we live in now.

Strangely, I seem to enjoy the ones written under the pseudonym Bachman more than others. Maybe because they are more to the point and the alternate name allowed King more freedom, phycologically and legally. It is not considered horror, but it is scary. Read it, it's short."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"My husband recommended this book. I love Stephen King. Good recommendation. The recommendation was sparked by us reading and watching Hunger Games."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"It is Stephen King, is there any doubt that this would be a good book. He has yet to disappoint. Nothing like the movie with Arnold."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Early in his career, King, the modern master of suspense and horror and fiction, felt the need for an alter ego through whom he could tell stories of a content and in a style he didn't feel comfortable doing under his own name, and so he created Richard Bachman. When the truth came out, he pretty much abandoned Bachman, but those books are worth reading for their considerable differences from the rest of his work. (This one was also turned into a very bad film with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the plot of which is almost unrecognizable when compared to the book.)Anyway. It's the near future, and a very unpleasant place it is, too. Pollution is rampant, environmental illnesses are covered up by the government, the distance between the wealthy and the impoverished is far greater even than in our real world, and Free-Vee is the opiate of the masses, via the blood sports it broadcasts incessantly. Ben Richards has a wife and a child, the former working as a prostitute out of desperation and the latter seriously ill because medical treatment is nonexistent for people like them. Richards can think of only one option and that's to volunteer for one of the Free-Vee programs, in which he -- or his remaining family -- will earn money for each day he survives. And he manages to qualify as a \\"contestant\\" in the biggest game of all -- but doesn't discover until he's already committed that absolutely no one is allowed to survive..The book follows him through count-down chapters as he goes on the run through the northeastern states, changing cars and disguises, and finding unexpected assistance in avoiding the Killer teams while the nightly audience screams for his death.It's a blood-chilling story, almost a clich&eacute; now (but King invented it), and there are no happy endings. It's also a bit nave in ways that the author would not be guilty of if he were writing (or re-writing) the book now, but that's okay. Read it as an artifact of its time and hang onto your seatbelt."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"My very first thoughts when reading this novel was that Suzanne Collins must have also read it. I found myself constantly comparing The Running Man and The Hunger Games. While King's book is very much geared towards an older audience, there were still the general premise of reality television gone mad that is prevalent in Collins' book also.This novel gives the reader deliciously slow dribs and drabs of the dystopian world it is set in even if we are never really completely aware of the whole back story. The world that the main character lives in is bleak and he must decide to give his own life in the reality games shows designed to entertain the masses on Free-Vee in order to provide enough money for life saving medicine for his sick daughter.I couldn't help but compare the use of Free-Vee as a way to appease and control the general population with the internet usage of today. Also, anyone else remember their parents telling them that television will rot their brains? Yup, this novel is just as relevant today as it was back when it was written.King does a wonderful job of bringing the reader towards a climax that proves the must needed catalyst for revolution amongst the people. The reader comes to understand the fine line that authority holds when it controls its followers by fear. It only takes one small chink in it's armour to make everyone question what they are saying is the truth.As usual, King uses lush descriptives that at times make the reader squirm uncomfortably because of their brutal honesty. My favourite in this book would have to be:Spectators had begun to creep back in spite of Armageddon's shadow. Their eyes were wide and wet and sexual.Such a terrific way to describe the horrible (and curious) notion of having to look at a car wreck even when you don't want to see the accident.There are rarely happy endings with Stephen King. This novel is no exception and I was completely relieved there was no classic Hollywood ending for this book.Overall, I completely enjoyed this book. It had all the hall marks of great dystopia as well as the adult perspective that I find lacking in today's newer novels in this genre.It gets 5 out of 5 stars from me!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This was a nice change from the normal King book. I can see why he decided to write it under the name Richard Bachman because I think some fans would have been disappointed.This is a short book for King and it was very fast paced. The beginning establishes the characters and story. Shortly after that the chase begins and the book doesn't let up. I enjoyed it quite a bit, however, it wasn't my favorite book or my favorite from King. I did desire a change of pace from what I have been reading and thought I would give his Bachman novel a try. I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"good book - it was an easy read - Husband would recommend itit does not need additional words to describe it"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I read this book as it was recommended to me by a friend as it was similar to The Hunger Games. Great read."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Trying to describe this book to my sister whose presently reading a sci-fi & discovered I had never written a review of it (my way of remembering what I've read). Well, here goes (something, anyway). Loved this dark exciting action packed book! Would never have dreamed it would be something I loved...tho I did love the early Stehphen King works. There are so many great story summaries on amazon's review page...read them for a feel for the book. Yes, the movie is crap, the book is great. And the many years ago I read it, there was no spoiler in the beginning...not in the book I read, anyway. Higly recommend."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I don't usually read novels, so when I do it's gotta be good and hold my attention. If you like fast paced action/adventure dystopian novels this is a good bet. This is much different than the movie, better in my opinion, and will hold your attention from start to finish. I really enjoyed it and recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"To be honest i didn't even know &#34;The running man&#34; early 90's film was based off a book until it came on TV the other day and i watched the opening credits. I told myself it was definitely something i needed to check out. The book is fairly short for a Stephen King book but of course it was written as his alter ego Richard Bachman. Don't expect the book to be anything like the movie with the exception of the characters names. Ben Richards is more of an anti-hero in the book but you can't help but find yourself root for him anyways."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"In the history of good books, people have created good movies using the books title (but have nothing really to do with the book). BLADE RUNNER and DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP is a good example of this. RUNNING MAN is another fine example of this. When I was a teenage, I loved the Arnold movie. Now that I am way past a teenager, I decided to read the source material. I was shocked and thrilled that I stepped into almost an entirely different world.The Ben Richards of the novel is not a criminal, fabricated or otherwise. The Ben Richards in the novel is a desperate man trying to find a solution to a nightmare many fathers face. Richards is a character in this book faces a far greater challenge than that of the movie. The game arena is the USA. The foes are the good people of the United States of America. In this Dystopia, Richards finds himself struggle to find commrades and figuring out who to trust.To give too much away would tell major parts of the book. Don't read this book expecting an action adventure film. Read this book expecting a character study of a man who would do anything for those he loves. The writing is not King's best, I thought some of it was a little unbalanced, but the story is captivating."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I was expecting a story similar to the movie staring the governer of california, and it was not! This is very different. It's much better! It is a excellent read, fast paced and detailed with well developed charectars. The low price makes it a must for your Kindle."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I could not put this book down. I had to know how it was going to end. Another well written book by Stephen King/Richard Bachman. It definitely has the Bachman feel to it. It is not a happily ever after ending but the main character gets his justice in the end!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Set after 2020, I think what makes this story scary is the public's obsession with reality television...and the more gruesome and self destroying the better. In the book the participant is manipulated by the media, making him appear how they want him to appear...even that is scarily realistic!King had amazing foresight to see how mercenary society could become. Okay...so we're not quite so sadistic to watch a game show that hunts people down and kills them but it's not THAT far fetched to imagine a world that would.Great to read a book with a likable character who we can root for and an ending that fits the story."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Meet Ben Richards, one of the faceless millions who are supposed to keep their mouths shut, work hard in exploding conditions of filth, disease & pollution and enjoy a brief escape through the government-sponsored game shows, which may give some of those desperate enough a chance for brief fame, before they die chasing the huge payout for their efforts.Richards washed out of a variety of menial jobs and has a wife & sick daughter to support, so he decides to take his chances at becoming a game show contestant. He is selected to be in The Running Man, where the riches are enormous for the winner; but not one person has survived to reap that glory.Author Richard Bachman (Stephen King) takes the reader through the violent chase for survival by Richards and the pursuit by professional hunters, with every citizen a possible game show snitch. In this intense story, Richards may be welcomed into the government machine, if he is willing to sell his soul to those who wanted him dead.The manuscript is not the same as the script of the film by the same name; this Richards is an anti-hero, who was created as much by society as he was through his boiling anger with the monstrous monolith of a government.And the end proves that many people can try to run, but they cannot hide."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I finished this book just today. It was my first Stephen King book that he wrote under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, and I must say, it was very good. The movie is garbage that should be avoided. The plot of the novel was very well done and the detail had style. The ending was great. The reason I give it four stars instead of five is because of a couple disturbing moments in the last 4-5 pages before the ending. Other than that, it was good, and I recommend it to all Stephen King fans.P.S. Until Blaze came out, this was the only one of the Bachman books that was worth reading. I am going to read Blaze and will review it when I get a chance."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This is an interesting short novel set in the not too distant future. Richards is unemployed, poor and has a dieing daughter who he cannot afford drugs for. The only solution for someone in his predicament is to go on television and participate in a game show. Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy and that type of thing are not the rating blockbusters in this era. People with weak a heart run on a treadmill which increases in speed whenever they get a question wrong. If they survive to the end they win money. This is just one example of what to tune into in the future.Richards is not the most pleasant of men and is not too nice to his interviewers, doctors and everyone along the way. There is a special game show for people like him. In it he can potentially make one million new dollars if he wins. If however like all contestants before him he does not win, then he will die. He must outrun and avoid hunters intent on killing him for a number of days. The public can win money by ringing the station and turning in his whereabouts so there is nowhere to run. He can kill those after him but no civilians. He also must constantly mail in tapes of himself talking to the camera every day so even though he is told the postal marks are not shown to the hunters he knows this is untrue and must keep on the move.I saw the movie of this book when I was a little kid so saw no point in reading it until now. Surprisingly, well I guess it shouldn't really be a surprise, the book really is nothing like the Schwarzenegger action movie. It is a pretty good read and a must for fans of action thrillers."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"this was so different from the movie, thank god. it is a story about a society out of control and the tv game shows head the pack. one man gets fed up and takes matters into his own hands. if you think this is the movie, you are misguided. do not assume anything. the end is different(i did not like the ending and thats why i only gave it 4 starts. also i liked the long walk better and i gave that 5 stars) as are many other twists. a good read. took me one week. short, sweet and to the point."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"The running man is the best of Stephen Kings Bachman books in my opinion. It reveals a gloomy and depressive future scenario where poor people take part in bizarre TV-shows to earn a few bucks.The main character decides to enter the worst of them all - the Running Man contest...Now...The movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger is an abysmal attempt to make a movie out of this book. The overall tone of the book is completely lost and the Hollywood way of rewriting everything to fit the &quot;Lowest common denominator&quot; makes me outright sad."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This was the first book I read by Steven King (or Richard Bachman), and I was not disappointed. This story catches you right at the beginning, and until the end, you can't set the book down. I still don't know how anyone could ever even think up such an ending, by appairently they can. If you want to read a good book by Steven King, pick this up, in fact, pick it up no matter what."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I could baley bring myself to put this bok down! I'd read for hours every night trying to get to a good spot to stop, but I couldn't find one, the book made me read! The book has to have gotten a message across, but what? Anyway, King again discribed so good and clear that it's against the laws of nature...READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This was as really fun, fast read. It is not very long so you can read it in about an afternoon or if you are a slower reader, a day or two. Dont be fooled by the movie, this book is very very different. Other than the name Ben Richards and the fact that there is a game show in the book, it is very different. This is the fourth of Stephen King's \\"Bachman Books\\". If you pick this up because of King's name on the front you may be a little let down. I say this because writing as Bachman, his style is much different. This is not a horror story in the least bit, but more of a sci-fi thriller. We follow Ben Richards in this book, as he tries to win money for his family on a gameshow where, you win, or you die. If you can stay a fugitive for more than 30 days, then you win. But this is not easy, and nobody has ever won the game. The game gives you 24 hours to flee from the law to wherever you want to go, then the gameshows \\"henchmen\\" take chase. Every page of this book is a thrill ride, which will keep you turning them until the end. \\"The Running Man\\" along with all the other \\"Bachman Books\\" are a blessing and show King's true talent as the world's best selling author. This book has an ending that will leave you with your mouth wide open, prepare yourself. Great Book. Go Stephen King, err... Richard Bachman."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"King wrote many unpublished works before hitting the big time. Later, when the publishing house was scrabbling madly through his attic, searching for anything to publish, they came across a load of early stuff which they published under the pen name of Richard Bachman. When this didn't work, they re-titled stuff as 'Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman'. This seemed to work better ... shows what a name can do!Running Man, though well written by anybody else's standards, is certainly not up to the usual King benchmark. It lacks the depth of the later King books. Having said all that, the story is entertaining and the characterization of Ben Richards, the protagonist is exceptional. In short, Richards is in a life or death race. He wins - he escapes poverty. He loses - he dies. Trouble is, no one has ever won. The game is televised and (fairly obviously) biased against the contestant.In later years, King claims that there was no ulterior message in Running Man, though to me it seems that he highlights the problems of a generation who are glued to the television screens, how gullible they are to anything they see on the silver screen, and just how far the major networks will go to retain 'customer loyalty'. Also, as I write this, just after the awful attacks on WTC and the Pentagon, it strikes me that it was not only Tom Clancy who foresaw the threat of an aeroplane attack on a building.Running Man is not a long book. It's an easy weekend read that will leave you amused but maybe a little sad about the future."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This book reads amazingly fast. It is very different then the Movie. It took about 2 days reading to finish this book and I will remeber the characters for a long time. This book is not as political as I would like but it still is a good anti-government book.Fun read, very exciting and very nice ending."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Ever see the movie? While books are usually better than the book, this one isn't even a contest, this books is light years ahead of the movie (not that the movie was breaking new boundaries, but as far as action goes, it wasn't bad).A man goes on a game show, and needs to run from a team of hunters for 30 days. He ca go anywhere he wants, he just has to mail back videos to the studio. So what's the catch? The public gets paid in rewards to turn him in so they can watch him get killed on television.With all the reality based tv shows we have nowadays, is it impossible to imagine this happening?"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This book is amazing! I couldn't put it down the first time I read it or the second! The book is much better than the movie, which has nothing in common with the book. If you haven't read it, read it!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I've never read Stephen King, but I like his movie adaptations, other pulp novels, dystopic fiction, and reading in general. I was very excited to receive this book. Even though it is well written, it is fairly vulgar for no particular reason. The plot is simple, boring, and the ending unsatisfying. I wouldn't recommend this book except to Stephen King fans who want to read his entire collection."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This was the first and most likely the last Stephen King novel I'll read. I'd always been curious about King as a writer, but didn't want to read anything gory. I was told \\"The Running Man\\" wasn't, which is true. This novel is a great thriller, well-written, and difficult to put down, but the ending is horribly sad and unsatisfying. What can I say? I like a happy ending, and I don't think King does \\"happy.\\""},{"Title":"The running man","review":"The book is based on the extreme hypothesis that America could become a fascistic country, with three zones and social groups : the rich and happy business downtown area, the poor, famished and under- or unemployed working class derelict area, and the camps for the opponents who are authorized to survive and not be executed. Television is the absolute tool to dominate and control the people by providing them with old circus games like in Roman times. The main game is The Running Man, where a man is supposed to resist some super-duper-monstrous state-fighters who use all kinds of technology against empty-handed men. The book releases the designated fighters (ex-convincts who dream of a chance) directly in the second zone of society where they have to survive. The whole game changes when the cop who refused to kill innocent people in Bakersville is brought into the picture. He will manage to help the resistance, so that the truth will be broadcast on television, and he will capture a plane and destroy the whole television building, including the main master of ceremonies. But there is no hope, because the hero dies in his plane that crashes against the building, and the resistance does not stand one chance against the police and the army of the state. This book is signed Richard Bachman, and it is absolute pessimistic science-fiction. There is no future, there is no hope, there is no anything you want. We are living in a bleak dead alley that has no way out. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This is one of the few books I started but didn't finish. It was incredibly depressing and after a while I simply lost interest. I was hoping for a book that would describe more about the strict society in which this story takes place, but I felt that details were lacking. Overall, I don't recommend this book, although it was my first Stephen King read and it's possible that his books are just not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"At the same time, I found this both to be one of the most enjoyable, and one of the most disturbing, of Stephen King's books. It is definitely Richard Bachman style over King's usual subtle psychological horror. The book is also much better than the movie.The events take place in the future, when the television networks have more or less taken over political power. The economic distinction between classes is much more stark, and the only opportunity for the poor to rise through the socio-economic ranks is to volunteer for life-threatening game shows.The protagonist, a married victim of the old economy who is unable to find suitable employment, is unable to pay for basic medication that would save his infant daughter's life. And so the financial allure of the games tempt him.The story is well-told, but brutal in its telling."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"To this point in the Bachman Books (where I originally read the story), King had been steadily improving as his alter ego. This was definitely a step back. King himself said that he thought that this was probably the strongest piece from the collection, since it didn't bother itself with a message (an outright lie, since there are obvious criticisms of America's voyeuristic society contained within the piece), a statement which really puzzles me.The story here isn't told exceptionally well--I don't see it as being up to King's usual standards. The chaptering is actually a little hokey, and has almost nothing to do with the actual plot of the book (a minor problem, but something which bothered me to no small extent). The story itself is uniformly depressing--there is no catharsis in this work. Just like at some points in the Talisman, the bad just builds and builds until everything comes to a bad conclusion.All things considered, this isn't a really reprehensible work, but it disappointed me, after seeing just what King is capable of. This is a story that most authors probably wouldn't have written, for that matter--it would seem to conform better to the dimensions of a short story. As a read for a short airline flight, it fits the bill, but if you're looking for meat, it's just not there to be had."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I really loved this book, it's fast paced and smart, there's never a dull moment. Stephen King predicts the downfall of society, The story takes place in the ghetto of Co-Op City is 2025. Ben Richards is a 28 year old married man living in a crappy apartment with a wife who has to turn tricks to get food on the table and a daughter dying of the flu. In an effort to save the two people he cares for the most, Richards auditions to play in one of the twisted game shows the Network plays daily on the Free-Vee. He is accepted to play in the game show, The Running Man. The object of the game is to stay alive for thirty days, the catch is that the world is out to kill you. Desperation and paranoia rule, and there's not a soul on earth Richards can trust."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This book reads at an amazing, and I mean amazing pace. I suggest it for anyone that wants something to read on a flight, or long car ride, because you'll be finished in a sitting. You'll have no other choice. It roars right out of the gate at the opening page, and steadily accelerates right up until you get to the last 50 pages or so, when it is suddenly forced into Mach 3, and is tearing you toward what I believe to be the best ending for a King book there is. (The ending of Running man may share that spot with the ending of Thinner, but this is a subject on which I am currently debating with myself, and hope to have a conclusion to soon) The Bachman books always have grim, but strangely satisfying endings, because they generally contain a twist during the last few stretches, or give you a deeply troubling feeling that you will carry for days after you finish, or, more likely than not, have potential for a little bit of both. If you have never read this book, or have never read a Bachman, then my advice to you is to put it on your book-buying shoes, grab 10 bucks from the dresser, and head down to your local bookstore for a copy of this fantastic read.

It is so imaginative, I mean, the game shows that are fatal in a time when tv is called free-vee. I swear, when I finished I went to watch a movie and told my brother to pass the Free-Vee Remote! The main charachter, Ben Richards is the model of a normal guy trying to make a living in a tough society, just not the way you'd expect it done today.

Anyway, I adored the book and didn't want the climactic final scene to end!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"It is once again the future, as seen from the early Reagan Years, and life in the United States stinks. Children of five years old die of lung cancer because of the air pollution. There's enough war to keep things stirred up, but not enough to keep everyone employed. If the government has a plan to solve the nation's problems, we don't hear about it. We only see their plan to keep the people in place: television.Ben Richards, formerly employed by General Atomics, is unemployed and desperate. His daughter is deathly ill and his wife has to sneak out and turn tricks to care for her. Even so, the medicine she can buy is all but useless. It takes serious money to get anything approaching real medical attention, and Ben's unemployment precludes any hope for cash or insurance. Finally convinced that there's no other chance, he tries to get on a game show -- they're a staple of the massive military-industrial-entertainment complex's television agenda. Their pay is decent and the mortality rate isn't too high.For better or for worse, Richards manages to end up on &quot;The Running Man.&quot; It's the network's highest rated show. If Richards can elude capture for thirty days, hiding wherever he can in regulated and totalitarian America, he'll win big. If not, he's dead.The book's mood is bleak. Ben Richards is not a lone hero fighting for change in a corrupt society. He is an angry young man who wants to take care of his family in a world that seems to be conspiring to make that impossible. If there is any hope for this future America, it is not mentioned. At best, there is hope for Richard's daughter, and that seems like an unlikely prospect. Every character in this book is either corrupt or desperate. It is a dark, gritty future, and the reader can easily be pulled in.The name on the cover, &quot;Richard Bachman&quot; is Stephen King's pen name, under which he published a few books in the early eighties. This book, along with his other futuristic Bachman book, &quot;The Long Walk&quot; make me wonder why he abandoned the future has since stuck with the present and the past. The Running Man is short and intense, and is one of the less self-indulgent of King's revenge stories. Given the books's small size and small cost, it's a good read for anyone with a few hours to spare."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This is the weakest of the original four Bachman books (Rage, The Long Walk, Roadwork, and The Running Man), but it is still a good, worthwhile read. The premise: a game show that very few contestants ever win, and the rest pay with their lives. But this time the contestant is very determined to brake what the network has decided is his destiny. In a race for his own survival he finds himself taking things over the edge, and eventually &quot;taking up his complaint&quot; with the very president of the telivision company in a very unfriendly way. An action packed story similar in message and theme as The Long Walk, this story will keep you reading until the end. I certainly give it my recomendation."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"We should be grateful that Bachmann allowed SK to write in another form so much different from what readers boxed him to be - a horror storyteller. I am no big fan of King but after looking at my book collections &amp; reviewing the movies I have seen, I slowly realize that I have read &amp; seen a lot of SK products. &amp; I am proud to admit it. SK is a great storyteller - be it pure gothic horror, a touch of supernatural forces, mystery &amp; drama &amp; now, a futuristic sci-fi thriller. Hail to you SK!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This was the first Stephen King book I have ever read and I think he is a Terrific author because he can get into great detail so it is as if you are part of the book.

It was a none stop, couldn't put it down thriller."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"The Running Man is an interesting glance into the development of a wonderful author. Stephen King's style here is, at times, too direct. Towards the end, the protagonist rambles off an elaborate metaphor - with a gun shot wound - that interprets all of the symbols in the book.Clearly inspired by Fahrenheit 451 (Free Vee, a fear of \\"police dogs,\\" a government disdain for books and more), this novel might earn more stars if Bradbury hadn't told the story with greater maturity.Nevertheless, King contributes his usual vivid writing style and I didn't put the book down until it was finished. If you're looking for a book with this plot, read Fahrenheit first. If you're looking for an introduction to Stephen King at his best, try \\"The Stand.\\" Once you've done both of those, this book will be a light diversion, and not an unpleasant one."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"WARNING: The following review contains spoilers!Stephen King, in the '80s, was at the peak of his writing skill. Fresh out of University but scared that the public wouldn't appriciate his work, he wrote the classics It, Thinner, The Stand, among others, under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman. But ever since he gained status as a 'literary genius' - and changed his pen-name back to his native - he's been fumbling a bit, especially with his most recent works which have been total crap. But there's still his classics to contend with, one being The Running Man, which has been overlooked time and time again despite the fact having been turned into a movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Then again, the movie was garbage, so that's your knackered.The novel takes place in the year 2027, in a Dystopian society where big business is everywhere, the air smells like a chain smoker 24/7, and television has become the leading medium. 'Free-Vees' are in every home, as eager audiences tune in every night to their favourite game show, of which there are many, produced by the evil Games Corporation. One such program is The Running Man, the most popular show for the company to date. Why you ask? The answer is simple: The contestants are middle-class citizens, who have been deemed 'deliquants' by the Games Commission after taking part in several apptitude tests. Once chosen, the contestant is let loose on the world, with one catch: They must survive 30 days without being killed by the Games Commission 'Hunters,' or complete strangers from off the street, who are paid exorbitant amounts of money to do so. If the contestant survives, they win a billion dollars. The record of survival in the six years the show has been on the air has been 8 days.The new contestant on the show, Benjamin Richards, is a hard-case: A man who's been fired from almost every position he's ever held because of his firery attitude. His daughter is dying of peunomia, and signs up to be in one of the Games. His tests are some of the highest the Commission has ever seen, so they sign him up for The Running Man. He doesn't care - he has nothing to lose.Along the way, Richards meets up with some strange personas, who may or may not be trying to help him win like he thinks... Some of them are: the producer of the show, the slimy Dan Killan; a woman he ends up taking hostage, Amelia Williams; and the Chief Hunter, Evan McCoy. So, he runs, and dodges, and runs some more, starting at the Games Building in Los Angeles, until the final confrontation at an airport in Newark, where Richards tries to escape from McCoy and his troupe, and must decide whether or not to sacrifice himself, or see if he can beat the survival record by just a few more minutes.The Running Man is a great read, and a relatively short one too. King blends elements of social commentary, science-fiction, and action, all leading up to a shockingly violent set-piece, and quite an affecting and unexpected ending (A little hint: One of the main characters has his/her guts dragging behind him/her, literally! And one of the characters flies a jumbo jet into a building!). The novel seemed like a cross between George Orwell's 1984, the television show Fear Factor, and Oliver Stone's movie Natural Born Killers. If that's your sort of match-up, then The Running Man might just be your most overlooked novel of the decade."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This book is King's (Bachman's) best next to The Gunslinger"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This story was a great story written about the future. It also was a great action story. I liked how one thing happened and then all of a sudden you were hit with another thing that happened. This had a great ending one that I did not think was going to happen."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Excellent little book , sure its not going to be considered a literary masterpiece but who cares? (do you want to read war and peace?) Its precise and to the point and it doesnt draaag on like some of his other novels. Stop reading these reviews and go buy the damn thing!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I'll have to start out by saying that I really hate Stephen King's writing. The only good book he ever wrote was Carrie (spelling?), and the only reason I get his books is to read the introductions (I find him verrry funny). He babbles on, and on, and on... he could have cut out half of &quot;Misery&quot; and made it a wonderful book. But back to my point. (I think I have one?) I _love_ Richard Bachman. As far as I'm concerned, they're two different people. Stephen King has never even come close to scaring me, but Bachman did so very well. A horror book doesn't have to be about ghosts or mass murerers to be scary... truth is always scarier than fiction, especially when you know it's going to come true in a few years. This book scared me the way Brave New World did. I loved the main character, I fell in love with him. I have a very twisted sense of humor, and laughed out loud in many parts of the book. Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes! It was a grrrreat book. I especially loved the ending. I don't think it was supposed to be unpredictable. You had to know what was going to happen, because that fills you with the same sort of certain dread the main character felt. Or maybe I just have bad taste. Heh, ta's."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"The Running Man may well be the most stunningly prophetic novel Stephen King ever wrote. 50 pages from the end of the novel, I realized he was going to have Ben Richards fly a plane into the side of a New York City skyscraper. The passage is worth quoting:\\"Heeling over slightly, the Lockheed struck the Games Building dead on, three quarters of the way up. Its tanks were still better than a quarter full. Its speed was slightly over five hundred miles an hour. The explosion was tremendous, lighting up the night like the wrath of God, and it rained fire twenty blocks away.\\"The Running Man was published in 1982.Aside from what may have just been a stunning fictional coincidence of what we've all come to know in our own post-9/11 lives, the story of The Running Man itself may well be the most thoroughly entertaining novel of King's career. In the introduction to the collection from which I read, he mentions that he wrote it in a 72-hour period and published it with little or no edits.What The Running Man may lack in polish and grammatical acumen, it makes up for with sheer energy and a torrential pace unlike any other novel I've ever read. It may well be the fastest read you will ever experience. It's like one of those super-high-speed rollercoasters that can do upwards of 150 miles per hour. It's extremely intense, extremely fast, and extremely fun.The book and the movie are different. The book sets up Ben Richards as a family man who has no other choice than to go on this game show called \\"The Running Man,\\" wherein contestants are hunted down and killed for the entertainment pleasure of television audiences. Ben's young daughter is dying of pneumonia, and he and his wife don't have the money to take her to a doctor. If he wins the game show, he saves his daughter; he's a ready-made hero you absolutely want to cheer for!Also, the book allows Ben the entire landscape of New England in which to run, so we see him in New York and Boston and in the skies over Pennsylvania. Similar to the movie, Ben turns out to be more resourceful than executives with the game show had anticipated, and he ends up killing a lot of people.The Running Man is not a novel for everyone, but if you do want to read it, chances are you'll end up loving it. It's a great read, and I highly recommend it. It's one of those early Stephen King novels for which I would love to see a new movie version; I think a new movie could be very effective if it brought in Ben as the desperate family man we see in the book; it could entertain a new generation. I think people would like to see it. I guess I just wish there were more sci-fi novels like this, man. It's really a classic. And, of course, I hope this review is helpful to you!Stacey Cochran, author of The Kiribati Test"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Yes, this book has flaws. The pacing is choppy, there are some pretty improbably events, but this is one of my favorites of all time, and definately my favorite King story. Why? I think in the foreword to the edition I have King says it best himself: \\"It's all story.\\""},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This book took a long time to get moving. So much time was wasted with the main character Ben Richards going through physicals and other inane activities, that it took over 80 pages to get moving. I still gave it 3 stars for one reason though: the ending. I though the ending was pretty good and wasn't one of your typical \\"happily ever after\\" ending (like the one in the film, yeccch!) It had a really dark ending with a bit of victory on the main character's part (not the type of victory you're probably thinking of.)Bottom line: worth a single reading, but the reread value is zero, in my opinion. Rent it from your library if you're going to read it. If you're going to purchase a King book, steer clear of the Richard Bachman books (except for Thinner, that was pretty good.) If you're gonna purchase a King book,buy The Dead Zone, Christine, Thinner, Pet Semetary, The Stand, It, Different Seasons, Everything's Eventual, or Night Shift (my favorite.)"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Excellent book! When I picked up this book, I couldn't place it down until I was at the last page."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Of the Bachman Books, this is by far the worst story. It boggles the mind that this book has a higher rating than Roadwork (which is great, 5 stars, see my review). The Running Man had promise. It's the story of a dreary future world where those who have no other choice due to poverty, illness, etc. are driven to compete on gameshow for the chance to get out of their terrible situation, but where ultimately no one ever wins. And if you don't win, you die. Even though the basic idea has been done many times before it still has the potential to be a great story. But potential is all it has. I had a hard time finishing this book and by the end I really didn't care what happened to anyone. I just wanted it over. Nothing really captured my attention. I felt the story dragged on. I typically love the Bachman Books, but this one was terrible. If you must read this story, buy a copy of the Bachman Books and get 4 novels. Don't buy this one on it's own."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Another well-written book by King. I have one main criticism. DON'T READ the introductory section \\"The Importance of Being Bachman\\" until you finish the novel. King writes the MOTHER of all spoilers there. And it's not just a vague reference to one of many events in the novel. It's SPECIFIC information about THE ENDING. Why King would have done this is completely baffling, but he clearly was giving no thought to his readers."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"At first glance, Ben Richards is not your poster child hero- he's unemployed, his wife resorts to turning tricks just to keep the family's head above water and he is something of a rebel and thought to be the \\"enemy of the state\\" for daring to speak the unspeakable. But that's exactly what makes him a great contestant in yet another of Richard Bachmann's (aka Stephen King) twisted reality game shows. This book was thought to have predicted the reality tv shows we have now where people willing put themselves in risky situations for the promise of instant wealth, but actually, he's just retelling the old tale because we somehow haven't evolved from the times of the gladiators where we enjoy watching people fighting for their lives. This book wouldn't have been as enjoyable to me if Ben Richards was all alone against the world, but he is assisted in his quest to survive by some colorful allies. King left just enough surprises in the final third to keep all but the most cynical from guessing them. As far as the ending, I told it to my teenaged daughter and she said that it's really how it should have ended- and I agree."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"It wasn't until I picked this book up last week at a book sale that I realized I had seen the movie and not actually read the story. I can tell you that although both are worth your time the two are not that much alike.The book THE RUNNING MAN takes us into a time that is not too far away from where we are now. People glorify in what they see as justice being carried lived on tv, and the reward is great not only for those playing the game of the law but those who are bringing it to us as well.With Ben Richards, a man who finds himself accused of crimes he didn't commit, there is a choice to be made: will you just accept the fate layed out for you or will you fight for your innocence and your name being cleared regardless what the cost? Looking at where we are not in society where death is glorified and the gory stories are the more we want to see, King showcases the path of humanity and where we are headed if we don't start rethinking what we see as entertainment and the difference between what is right and right.To say that this book was prophetic of some of the reality shows we see today is an understatement. The great thing about King is that he delivers an entertaining read while allowing us to see that not all endings are happy but they can be just.If you are looking for the storybook ending that was delivered on the big screen then you might be disappointed, but this will still be a book that will make it one of your favorite that King has delivered...and that says alot."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Published in 1982 under the pseudonym, Richard Bachman, the author was strangely prescient, as the novel takes place in the year 2025 in the good old United States of America, only it is not so good anymore. With an economy that sharply divides the haves and the have nots, reality television is the only thing that brings these two disparate halves of the economy together.Twenty something Ben Richards is living with his wife and baby girl in a ramshackle housing development in dire poverty. He is at the end of his rope. His wife is turning tricks to keep them barely alive, and their baby girl is dying from the flu for lack of proper medical care and medication. Theirs is truly miserable existence.The only entertainment for those such as them is Free-Vee, which delivers non-stop reality television shows in which desperate wretches try to win big monetary payoffs. Desperate for money to be able to help his little girl, Ben auditions for a reality television show and is selected for the ultimate life or death reality show, where the truly desperate are hunted down by a group called the \\"Hunters\\", whose only mission is to kill their quarry. The payoff is big, should one succeed in evading death, but no one ever has.Such is the desperation of Ben Richards that he would even consider signing on for such a show. Unfortunately for him, he soon realizes that there is a reason no one has ever succeeded in evading the \\"Hunters\\" and decides that it is time that someone changes the status quo. That someone will be him, as he turns the show on its head.The book is definitely bleak in its outlook and pretty depressing. There is virtually no character development of anyone other than the protagonist, and even there that is somewhat limited. This book was supposedly written in three days by the author, and it shows in the quality of the writing.Still, the story line was intriguing, and certainly the author was onto something, as who knew in 1982 that reality shows would have such a hold on the public, as they do today? It is simply too bad that the story, as written, has little emotional grip on the reader, rendering it somewhat less than satisfying. Nonetheless, fans of the author will find some enjoyment in this somewhat mediocre book. A word to the wise, do not read the author's intro \\"The Importance of Being Bachman\\" until after you have read the book, if you want to avoid knowing how \\"The Running Man\\" ends before you read the book."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"What an idiot I am. I never read this because I've seen the movie. But this is a great thriller action packed short story.This books just reinforces King is the thriller master.(on a side note - also showcases the talent screen writers have to be able to to adapt a short story to a film and not copy the book.)They are not the same story, but have the same premise.Sit back and enjoy."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"If this book isn't one of the features in the book 100 One-Night Reads, it should be. It's a relatively brief novel written near the beginning of King's writing career. King wasn't well known for horror and had even less qualifications for sci fi, yet he does amazingly well at envisioning the sort of \\"Reality TV\\" that could develop in an increasingly jaded and bloodthirsty world. I could not put the book down until I finished it. There aren't many books I can say that about. Contrary to what a few reviewers thought, I enjoyed the movie about as much as the book, and reading the book beforehand didn't seem to dim the excitement for me. A very suspenseful story that grabs and doesn't let go."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"not the best stephen king book i've read but still very cool book. a must read"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"First off, if you have seen the movie prior to reading the book and are expecting a similar story, AVOID THIS BOOK LIKE THE PLAGUE. The character created by King in Ben Richards, is a scrawny, down trodden man, desperate to save his family, even if it means risking his life. HE is no where even close to the muscular, hulkying, action hero architype portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film.It is really a shame, that they screwed the story up so badly, because as a movie the book would be great. It's fast passed, with plenty of action, a simple enough premise, but not one which is trite or boreing, great characters, and message (albiet a unsettling one)of an all too plausible dystopia.Back when it was published, the book had a great story. To todays ready, it is a great story, bolstered by the real shows we see everyday. Sure we don't kill people, but it can't be denied that we enjoying watching the discomfort, even the suffering of others. Shows like \\"the Chamber\\" and \\"Dog eat Dog\\" and \\"fear factor\\" or even \\"the swan\\" are akin to the sick game shows viewed by the society of The Running man.And with the increasing addiction of the young people of our country to TV, and with the increased sense of apathy and an all around lack of reading, it is easy to see how huge mega corparations could monopolize and dominate our society.So in the end, this is an all around excellent book, I highly recommend it to both SciFi fans and non SciFi fans alike. Also while you're at it you should check out the other \\"Bachman books\\". In particular \\"Rage\\" (if you can find it. it's out of print) and \\"The Long Walk\\""},{"Title":"The running man","review":"I found this book well written, and had a thrilling edge to it. It almost felt like I was the one being chased! I would rate it five stars if they would have made the movie better, and shortened the chase a bit. His running from the hunters dragged on, when I would of rathered King write more about his life before."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Don't start this book if you want to do anything for a couple of hours. It is extremely fast paced and dark. For King, it's a little more future-tech scary than it is mystical, and I liked that about it. Super gory, not to be read before bedtime (what Stephen King book is, unless you like nightmares??)."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"The Running Man is perhaps the best story in Stephen King's Bachman collection. It is fast-paced and original, and curiously enough King states in the introduction that he wrote it start to finish in a 72-hour mad-dash flurry of typing and made very few changes to the final draft.Similarly to The Long Walk, it is about a deadly game show, and takes place in a version of the future where all television is regulated by the government, and all that is on are deadly game shows, as humans have come to a point where other people suffering is the only thing they find entertaining. Most of the world lives in extreme poverty, amongst trash- and drug-laden streets where prostitution is a common and necessary occupation for young mothers. Everyone is forced to own a television and everyone is forced to keep it on all the time, never free from the presence of the fatal game shows. People volunteer to appear on the shows often because they have no other choice to make money.One such volunteer is Ben Richards, a young man too poor to buy medicine for his terminally ill daughter. He begrudgingly goes through the rigorous physical and mental screening for the shows, ends up scoring quite high, and is accepted onto the ultimate game, The Running Man, where the risk is the highest but the winnings the greatest. The survival rate on Running Man is zero. The singular contestant is given a twelve-hour headstart to flee as far and fast as he can, using whatever methods necessary, to avoid the ominous Hunters; men who are sent out by the show's producers with the sole purpose of tracking down the contestant and killing him.More is unraveled about the corrupt, Big-Brother-esque government and the condition of the futuristic country that has become a wasteland as the book goes on. Civilians are offered a $100.00 prize for providing accurate information about the contestant's location; $1000.00 if the info leads to a kill. In a way, the entire country is against Ben Richards as he runs, and the masses watch in lusty anticipation of his violent, on-screen death.This story is just wild, and has some pretty cool twists and turns as Richards writhes his way across the country in evasion of the Hunters, a few times escaping some seemingly impossible positions. It is quick and fun and packs a bang, displaying the best of King's ability to keep things thrilling and fresh. The chapters are even marked in reverse order from 100 down to 0 as the clock ticks down for Ben Richards. There are multiple ideas presented in the story that are both original and familiar, perhaps giving a nod to futuristic-utopia novels like 1984 or Brave New World. It ended up being my favorite of the Bachman Books, for it is exciting, unique, and feels very different from any other King work I have read thus far. Plus, the climax is fantastic.There's a movie adaptation loosely based upon King's book with (of all people) Arnold Schwarzenegger, and I cannot yet attest to the quality of that film (and my expectations are sadly low, considering the time-period in which it was made), but the book is definitely worth a read, not only for King fans, but also for frequenters of sci-fi or thrillers, as The Running Man is a pleasant twist of both."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This book was great, I wish I had read it a long time ago, huge defference between book and movie. Both are great."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"A world where we're hooked on reality TV, caring more about the outcome of a game show than an election. Watching people do wretched things to themselves and others (hello Fear Factor, Wipe Out and Cops), while environmental problems start affecting people. Treating the poor as slightly less than human...did Stephen King have a crystal ball in the 1980s when he wrote The Running Man?Granted, this book is much more extreme, but it's a real wake-up call about what society can become.A good read. Recommended. And nothing like the movie!"},{"Title":"The running man","review":"WARNING - don't read King's forward. It contains a horrendous spoiler. (It can't be said often enough.)Running Man is a tightly-written, action-driven look at a future that seems to be getting distressingly closer. Protagonist Ben Richards is a bitter, dark character with a hard knot of decency at his core. I found it easy to cheer for him, which is why I only gave 4 stars instead of 5: The ending was too abrupt. I wanted a denouement, something to indicate whether Richards' actions made a difference."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"The Running Man well written. The action is pacey and, the humour is a bit odd, Nontheless is a hell of a read."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"The Running ManBy Stephen KingWriting as Richard BachmanIn a time where poverty is the norm, Ben Richards is willing to forfeit his life to save his eighteen month old daughter who is dying of influenza. Richards is soon chosen for The Running Man, a reality TV show where everyone is hunting him for a prize. When nowhere is safe and you must survive to earn your prize what would you do to win?I don't remember watching this movie but I know if I were to ask my mother she would swear I have seen it, growing up with a Stephen King buff I probably have, but when I first started this book the first thing I thought was Jebus it's the original Hunger Games, without children killing each other. Ben Richards is an average guy in hard times which makes him highly relatable, well unless you are a spoiled rich kid I guess, and he is just doing his best to support his family which adds into the story a sympathetic dimension. All in all it's an interesting read; if you are a fan of the dystopian genre then you should definitely pick this one up if you haven't read it already."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"This is almost like a science fiction fusion of 24 and The Fugitive. Awesomely paced, nails the dystopian future, (though as it was written in 82 King doesn't foresee us having cell phones which leads to scenes taking place in a phone booth), and has a rather satisfying ending. I'll spare you a synopsis as I am low on time and believe you, my beloved reader, to have the mental aptitude to read the back cover on your own.According to other reviews, DO NOT READ THE FORWARD, IT GIVES AWAY THE ENDING. I read this in The Bachman Book collection, and therefore did not have this problem. King is the king of suspense and horror fiction (pun not intended, just spilled out) and I look forward to reading all of his books in chronological order."},{"Title":"The running man","review":"Picked the book up and could not put it down.

Weak in execution-- which makes sense given the amount of time King gave himself to write this. Four stars instead of three because I found myself wanting to talk about this book with everyone. I'm curious to see how the film version stacks up. There's so much action in such a small amount of space-- I had to reread a couple of sections just to make sure what I thought happened actually happened. Already because of the casting, I sense that the movie takes some different choices with the story than the book. Anyway-- interesting. Thought-provoking. Worth reading. And quick."},{"Title":"A Song Twice over","review":"My favorite of Brenda Jagger's excellent novels of Victorian England. The story follows several characters over some years as their lives weave together: Cara, an Irish sewing girl; Gemma, a millowner's indulged daughter; and Daniel, an Irish idealist and sometime revolutionary. Daniel is a bit thin as a hero, but the women are fascinating, with Gemma struggling to find meaning and fulfillment in her restricted life, and Cara simply hoping to survive in a world that is ruthless towards the helpless. Gemma makes a rich marriage, Cara struggles to establish herself as a fashionable dressmaker, and both will at various points fall in love with Daniel as he tries to bring equal rights to the mill-workers of their sullen Yorkshire town. A strong and compelling read with strong and compelling characters. Cara - a prickly Scarlett O'Hara if she had been born poor - is especially likeable, and another male character who presents initially as a villain will surprise you with unexpected humanity. This book and this author are neither of them as well known as they should be."},{"Title":"A Song Twice over","review":"This is not one of my favorites. While Jagger adequately explores the familiar territory of women struggling to survive and thrive in the rapidly changing culture of the Industrial revolution, I do not find the same romantic connection as I do in the Barforth novels. The two heroines, Cara and Emma are intriguing, but the men in the book are flat and lifeless. I found it hard to fall in love with any of them. The change and growth in the main villain was too little too late and one other died offstage it seems just to make room for the supposed hero. I frankly was more interested in exploring a deepening relationship between Tristan and Emma than between Emma and Daniel."},{"Title":"Dead Heat","review":"Georgia Parish is in Nulgarra, Australia for the funeral of her grandfather.She meets two people who got stuck in a river crossing, while driving to the airport.

Her deadly foes abduct Georgia's mother because they demand to know what she knows or else.DEAD HEAT lives up to its title as fans will feel the torrid tropical climate of Northern Queensland especially when the corpse count rises and the crocodiles dominate the local quagmire population. The picturesque background is so compelling at times the view overwhelms a strong thriller starring a terrific protagonist. Though the villains seem more out of a 1930s Fu Manchu tale, readers will appreciate this powerful sweltering tale of murder and survival in the remote Australian swamps.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Global Positioning System & Inertial Navigation","review":"I purchased this book mostly for its technical content and less for its descriptive narrative about inertial nav and GPS. My goal was to use the book as a basis for some analysis. Unfortunately, I can't recommend the book to someone who can't re-derive the equations in the book.One reviewer from New Mexico wrote: &quot;There are some math errors [in Farrell &amp; Barth's book] that are obvious, but when trying to use a text as a reference I don't think it's my job to double check the author's math!&quot; But, lo! I think one NEEDS to check the math in this book because even the most trivial of computations can and do have errors in them. For example, one thing really irksome about the book is that the matrix representation for the cross product operation in Appendix A has an overall factor of (-1) buried in it -- and it's wrong. Then the authors happily propagate this interesting &quot;sign convention&quot; throughout the book, meaning that you have to do a double take each time the book uses it. It's a horrendous mess.The same NM reviewer also asked: &quot;Can I trust this book as a reference?&quot; I think it's hit or miss. I spent over a week deriving and implementing the equations in Chapter 6. And even though I have some experience with coordinate frames and dynamics in rotating frames, it took a lot of effort to work through everything myself and correct the errors. Luckily most of the final equations are, indeed, correct in Chapter 6 -- save for a sign or two. On the other hand, I'm still trying to find the book's sign errors in the mapping from the quaternions to the Euler angles (Chapter 2). Is there really an error? Or am I doing something stupid? With this book, I'll have to figure it out for myself.This book has the potential to become an excellent reference and resource for inertial nav and/or GPS nav information. But as it stands, it's a sketch of a book that leaves it up to the reader to wonder whether it's him/her that's missed the point, or the authors who mangled yet another equation."},{"Title":"The Global Positioning System & Inertial Navigation","review":"I have struggled throught the first 2 chapters of this book and can't believe how poorly written this is. Mathematical derivations suffer from &quot;logic leaps&quot; that are not at all intuitive. Coordinate frame definitions are adequate, but more figures are needed. The text references figures with Greek symbols. When you go to the figure the symbol is missing or changed to another symbol. There are some math errors that are obvious, but when trying to use a text as a reference I don't think it's my job to double check the author's math! I contacted McGraw Hill about an errata sheet for the text. They don't have one available, but said they would be glad to accept my inputs. Can I trust this book as a reference? I don't know! I'm a complete novice in the field of Inertial Navigation and I don't feel I'm qualified to &quot;edit&quot; their book for them. This is a poorly written book because it assumes the audience is as well versed in Inertial Navigation and GPS as the author. One final gripe is that Mathematical Notation is referenced in Appendix A of the text. When trying to read the body of text, you must constantly refer to this appendix to try and figure out what the author is trying to convey. It's not bad, but it makes reading tiring and slow! The appendix is fine, but the introductory chapters in a well written text normally introduce the reader to the notation gradually, explaining symbols and conventions. Later chapters can then use less and less explanatory text for notation. This book could really be a &quot;home-run&quot; with some good editing and a second printing."},{"Title":"The Global Positioning System & Inertial Navigation","review":"First let me point out that the \\"error\\" mentioned by couple of reviewers are not errors. Perhaps the reviewers misunderstood or missed something.The NY reviewer wrote\\"dot{\\\\bf{R}}_{b2a}(t) = - \\\\Omega \\\\bf{R}_{b2a}(t)whic is fine. but then it is concluded that\\\\bf{R}_{b2a}(t) = exp(-\\\\int_{t0}^t \\\\Omega dt) \\\\bf{R}_{b2a}(t_0)which is wrong because $\\\\Omega$ is a function of time. \\"Actually this last line is in fact correct. I am not sure why reviewer think there is a problem. Perhaps the dummy integration variable t in the integral should have beendenoted by a different letter, but I think this is understood to be the dummy variable and not related to independent variable t. At any rate this equations is perfectly correct.Also the \\"errors\\" pointed out by reviewers with title \\"Mixed Results\\" are not errors.Matrix multiplication representation of the cross product has the right sign per convention that it is representing angular velocity of \\"a\\" frame relative to b frame.Multiplying this by -1, would represent angular velocity of b frame relative to \\"a\\" frame.The mappings from the quaternions to the Euler angles (Chapter 2 equations 2.47 through 2.49) are all correct. Perhaps the reviewer uses a different convention for the signs relative to reference and rotating frame.The book itself is probably one of the better books if one is not afraid of mathematical rigor (of course Mathematical rigor itself is relative).

It is a must for every household!!!"},{"Title":"Springtime in Noisy Village","review":"Astrid Lingren, (perhaps you know her best from Pippi Longstocking), is one of our favorites. Her stories are sweet and lively, with vivid descriptions that transport the reader to another time.I stumbled on the Noisy Village books and we couldn't put them down. They chronicle the lives of a group of children who live on adjacent farms in Sweden, (in the late 1800s-early 1900s?), as told by one child, Lisa. This is really childhood at it's best, back when children were able to explore and grow in freedom and fresh air, without fear. These kids take boats out alone and walk long distances without an adult. They get into scrapes and solve them themselves. They are clever, creative and just naughty enough to make you cringe and laugh. I think childhood will never be so natural again, so it is nice to live vicariously through the children of Noisy Village. I can see my kid is a little shocked by the freedom and boldness of these kids. I think it is good for her to hear these stories.I think these books are every bit classics like the Little House series. I wish there were more of them! The descriptions are so vivid-we were right there with the children during their adventures, as well as the every day moments. The hardest part was stopping after a chapter or two at bedtime. Sometimes we stayed up late to sneak in a couple of extra chapters and I know we were both very disappointed when each book was over!"},{"Title":"Springtime in Noisy Village","review":"This book is wonderful- very real, warm healthy children pictured doing things kids do- enjoying the out of doors and getting into stuff."},{"Title":"The Food of France","review":"Mr Root's overarching theory is that French food can be divided into the three culinary domains of fat, butter and oil. The Food of France reflects this belief and is similarly divided into three main sections, each chapter within a section dealing with the geographical/culinary regions within each domain. Within this structure, each chapter explores the food of a specific culinary region, and highlights the dishes distinct to that region.Underpinning Mr Root's overarching theory is the premise that food and how it is cooked is intimately related to and is influenced by the geography, history, and culture (agri- and otherwise) of its region. As a result, each region develops a food and cooking style unique to itself. He proceeds to illustrate this with erudition, verve, wit and style. Drawing on his knowledge of French geography, history, and culture, as well as what seems to be his vast gastronomic experiences across France, he makes a fine case for how each have been an ingredient in shaping and influencing the development of the food of each region. The Food of France will not only tell you what goes into an omelette provencale, it will tell you why this is different from an omelette a la nomande or an omelette a la nicoise, as well as consider different theories as to how the omelette got its name.The book comes with a general index, as well as an index of food and dishes. Dishes are described with sufficient particularity that a good cook could reproduce the dish. I should note that as the book was written in 1958, some of his information is a little outdated (his recommendations for good years of wine) or a little late (his urgings to visit Provence before it becomes too touristed). Notwithstanding this, The Food of France is an excellent resource and wonderful read: perhaps there can be no better recommendation than to admit that I enjoyed it so much that I have gone to buy The Food of Italy, also written by Root.My Personal Rating Scale:5 stars: Engaging, well-written, highly entertaining or informative, thought provoking, pushes the envelope in one or more ways, a classic.4 stars: Engaging, well-written, highly entertaining or informative. Book that delivers well in terms of its specific genre or type, but does not do more than that.3 stars: Competent. Does what it sets out to do competently, either on its own terms on within the genre, but is nothing special. May be clich&eacute;d but is still entertaining.2 stars: Fails to deliver in various respects. Significantly clich&eacute;d. Writing is poor or pedestrian. Failed to hold my attention.1 star: Abysmal. Fails in all respects."},{"Title":"The Food of France","review":"Now finishing my second reading of this tremendous book, all the while suspecting that Waverly Root was really a well-disguised poseur and not really the erudite man-of-the-world he appears to have been, I have to finally admit that, in addition to being one hell of a fine writer, he must also have been one of the most broadly-informed gourmands ever. True, occassional anecdotes and opinions of his betray the fact that the book was originally published 50 years ago, but the scope and intimacy of his knowledge with pretty much every provincial outpost, grand boulevard, and Basque backwater in France is astounding. I suspect he read and took to heart the 1950s edition of the Larousse Gastronomique, since many of the culinary practices he describes hardly deviate from what the Great Book says, but he provides so many examples of eating experiences that could be nothing but first-hand that I have to conclude that he actually DID spend his 30+ years in France doing little but travelling, eating, and drinking. These culinary expeditions are a treasure now: many of the regions he sampled so amply have been globalized to oblivion. His enthusiastic, almost childlike [but, nonetheless, world-wise] forays into the Haut Pyrenees, for example, record a local tradition of farmhouse cooking that is no more. But he was no mere chronicler of foods: his essays are leavened with witty, insightful, broadly-informed and fascinating anecdotes and contextual notes geographical, historical, literary, and agricultural. In this sense, I believe he was one of the pioneers of the broad, anectdotal form of journalism that remains perhaps the most effective means of presenting the world to an armchair audience. I have to forgive his peculiarities. Even his apparent contempt for Champagne seems inconsequential when I read his descriptions of travelling into darkest Corsica, sampling the wild, unrefined local wines, and immediately perceiving their perfect suitability to the food of the region. I am not aware of any other food and wine writer from that era who so heartily insisted on describing food and wine as a marriage. He wrote 20 years before Richard Olney brought his own sophistications to the table, and, understood in this context, his predilections must have been radical at the time.I urge you to read this book with a willingness to forgive the occassional signs of age. They are few and forgivable. Please savor the writing, with its erudition, lovely sense of timing and flow, gentle humor and enthusiasm. Please also consider it as the eloquent indictment of globalization that it is. To read a book written in the uncritical heyday of postwar American optimism and to find in it laments that the old world was slipping away, a victim of commerce and centralized policymaking, is a poignant experience indeed. This book is an education like few others."},{"Title":"The Food of France","review":"The Food of France, written in 1958, is a wonderfully erudite and relaxed look into French cuisine. Root, who has evidently spent many years in France eating his way through its various provinces, has written a travelogue and a paen to French cuisine.Root divides France into various gastronomic regions, and looks at the foods typical to each of these regions. His theory, that these gastronomic regions can be collated under three different regions - the domains of fat, butter and olive oil - forms the overarching structure of the book. In each region, he describes both its social and cultural history, as well as its geography and agriculture, in order to better explain why the food of that region developed in the way that it has. His riffs move from the origin of the name &quot;Languedoc&quot; (the language where &quot;yes&quot; was &quot;oc&quot; and not &quot;oui&quot;) and &quot;Carcassonne&quot; to the reason for large roofs in the Jura region. While some of this information may undoubtedly be out of date (his urgent plea to visit Provence before it becomes too touristetd is definitely 20 years too late by now as are his recommedations of good years for particular wines), most of the information is still pertinent and interesting.Among all of this, he manages to describe with luscious wit and warmth the food of the region. He will tell you with authority how snails are cooked, which cities have the best type of pastries, and what goes into the preparation of cote de porc a la vosgienne. If you've ever wondered about the difference between an omelette a la savoyarde (and he tells an amusing and fascinating story of how the omelette came to be so named) and an omelette a la lyonnaise, what a pamplemousse is or what goes into a cassoulet (depends on which region the cassoulet is made in), this is the book for you.It comes with an excellent general index, as well as an index of food and dishes. Cooks out there might be interested to know that he frequently describes dishes with sufficient particularity that a good cook could reproduce some of the dishes so described, even though details as to proportions and cooking techiques are not provided.I enjoyed this so much that I went off to buy The Food of Italy also by Root and am anticipating reading that with equal relish. There can really be no better recommendation than that."},{"Title":"The Food of France","review":"Without a doubt one of the very best written journeys through French cuisine via the country and the way it cooks food. Wonderful introduction to the best of French wines, just the right touch of history per region or dish - all vital to the appreciation of the food. It inspires the desire to take a slow 3 or 4 month tour with your appetite and this book as your guide."},{"Title":"The Food of France","review":"This is a classic - I believe it is one of the first books for foodies. An accomplished American journalist in France after WWII provides a thorough discussion of what the three types of French cuisine are, where they are, how the foods and wines are linked to the terrain, and how, in terms of society development, French cuisine arrived at the point it was at the time of publication. I found it fascinating, and every time I go to travel in France, I review the section covering the region I will visit."},{"Title":"The Food of France","review":"The topic, broadly, is the relationship of cuisine to its Terroir. the text is incredibly engrossing and informative. This author's place in history and time -- an American, writing in the 1950's about knowledge acquired between WWI and WWII, combined with his writing talents, make this book indispensable to both the traveler and the chef. What an insight into what makes the French so... well, French. Root famously divides France into three geogra-culinary categories: those who cook with lard, those who cook with oil, and those who cook with butter. Helpful Maps, good index make it an excellent guidebook.I am so proud to have a good used hardcover of this book in my Library."},{"Title":"The Food of France","review":"This is by far the best book I have ever read on France and what makes it such a unique and beautiful country. Yes, it was written a good time ago, but unlike America history is something to cherish and is very present in France. Mr. Root captures the pure essence of France through it's food. I would strongly encourage anyone traveling to France or returning from a trip to read The Food of France. As a food writer from a day when writers told stories Mr. Root takes you into each of the regions of France provides you with tidbits of unknown and known history and the food that was shaped by it. Mr. Root knew his food very well and enjoyed it in a way that many would only hope to, a true pleasure in gastronomic reading."},{"Title":"The Food of France","review":"This book is an irresistible read for anyone with a love of food an an interest in the history, geography and culture of regional France and its food products and cuisine. Root writes beautifully and it's impossible not to become as enthusiastic as the author as he shares his vast knowledge of each region of France and its culinary traditions. A book to return to again and again."},{"Title":"The Food of France","review":"I moved to Europe in the late 70s when Waverly Root still wrote on food, culture and life-in-general for the International Herald Tribune. At that time he was already advanced in age and had in fact invested much of the 20th century learning what makes the French who they are. This book represents a bit of the old way of perceiving France as the leading culinary and viticultural thought-leader of its time (a vision which persisted into the Kennedy years, but not far beyond). A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then, and nouvelle cuisine and nouveau monde wines have changed the way sophisticated people think about food and drink.Nonetheless, the book -- the details, the imagery, the culinary analysis, the richness of the language, the enthusiasm -- remains an extraordinary vital resource on French cuisine. Whether you are an expert on France, or merely curious, Root gives you the lowdown on what grows where, how it is transformed into food, and what local people might drink with it. All within the rich context of French history and geography.Breathtakingly clear, Root divides Gaul into three parts: those that cook with butter, those that cook with olive oil, and those who cook with lard and goose fat. It is a simple and coherent framework which allows the reader to immediately comprehend the inherent differences in regional cuisines.In short, even if you know French food well, you will certainly find something insightful and amusing in this book."},{"Title":"The Food of France","review":"This is one of my favorite books about French cuisine. In fact, it is one of my favorite books period. Root's prose is elegant and charming, and the information is highly interesting. The book has no plot or story (it simply goes from one region of France to the next, explaining the characteristic foods, wines, and preparations of that area), and it has no pictures, and none of the \\"recipes\\" are written as such--they are merely descriptions of how the dish is prepared. But even so the book is incredibly compelling, beautifully written, and very fun to read. For a companion volume (with pictures and recipes), I would recommend Samuel Chamberlain's \\"Bouquet de France: An Epicurean Tour of the French Provinces.\\""},{"Title":"The Food of France","review":"I received this if decent condition but about 30 pages were cut off at the top and connected together.

I don't know who put \\"One-Dog Man\\" into my hands, but it instantly became one of my favorite books of all time. Sadly, I long ago lost the copy I had as a child.The story is the first-person tale of a little boy (we never learn his name, I suspect that's because \\"Ahmad\\" would have jarred Baby Boomer America--the book was first published in 1950) who acquires partial ownership of a feisty little dog, whom he has to share with his best friends, a pair of twins. These boys get into more scrapes and situations with bullies, police, mothers, fathers, siblings, and neighbors than any kids I've ever seen, but the story is completely compelling. The details include those of the times: there are thrashings and a certain kind of violence that kids just live through. And always, the dog is central to everything, but mostly it's a book about childhood, where nothing is sacchrine or sterilized or politically correct. Have I mentioned that it's hilarious? It's HILARIOUS.Refreshingly, there is no moral to the story-only impeccable storytelling.... Ignore the cover--you cannot judge this book by its cover.It is a wonderful story, if you are a realist with a tremendous sense of humor. I love memoirs, and it's rare to find a childhood memoir this charming. The only thing that comes close is the fabulous book by Haven Kimmel, \\"A Girl Named Zippy.\\"..."},{"Title":"One-Dog Man","review":"This book is written for the child (what little there might be left of it) in all adults.

Fr. Bausch writes with honesty, humor and compassion. It is particulaly helpful to Catholics raised in the church before Vatican II, but I have found that younger Catholics also enjoy reading it and benefit from a view of the church that is both accurate and contemporary. This book makes it easier for people to return to an active practice of their faith. I give a copy of this book to anyone who expresses a desire to return to the church, or (as the title says) is thinking about it."},{"Title":"While You Were Gone: A Handbook for Returning Catholics, and Those Thinking about It","review":"Bausch has written a book that invites non-practicing Catholics back to the Church, an admirable reason to write, but it is full of opinion and dissent.Bausch basically steers clear of the &quot;controversial&quot; subjects by merely introducing them as controversial and then leaves for the reader to make up their own mind on the matter. There is no attempt to explain the doctrines (unless it is to explain them away) and while some may view this as a &quot;compassionate&quot; thing to do, allowing someone to live in error is never compassionate when we just put blinders on.Bausch also fails to make proper distinctions. He talks about &quot;women's issues&quot; as if the Church despises women. He calls the Church dysfunctional and says that to come back into the Church you merely need to heal your negative perceptions. Note: there is no discussion on personal repentance.After giving a long explanation about how authority in the Church really doesn't mean much anymore and how it is all continuing to change anyway he writes, &quot;you can dissent and remain a faithful Catholic&quot;. (page 65)Of course his authority for such a statement is himself and he fails to back it up or explain it. He gives reasons why contraception can be used by Catholics (rather statistics why it can be used), he supports female priests, active homosexuality and calls the Church's teachings on the matter &quot;the tradition is ambivalent and often hurtful&quot; (page 91).Steer clear of this book unless you want to try and whitewash the Church's teachings and ignore that we are called to obedience in any sense of the word. Grausch's book isn't for those wishing to return to the Church, it is for those who want to change it into their own image and likeness."},{"Title":"While You Were Gone: A Handbook for Returning Catholics, and Those Thinking about It","review":"I got this book because I was exploring whether or not I was going to come back into the church. I was looking for some guidance around the changes that have occurred. The author continuously makes the assumption that the reader has already decided to come back and is enthusiastically ready to begin. This was frustrating to me as I was not in that category. It is also quite judgemental on a lot of levels, making a lot of assumptions about people that are quite disrespectful and not very catholic (excuse the pun). On the whole, while I learned a bit about some of the changes in the church while I've been gone, mostly this book convinced me that coming back would be the wrong choice for me at this time. So, I guess, in some ways, it was helpful after all."},{"Title":"While You Were Gone: A Handbook for Returning Catholics, and Those Thinking about It","review":"I was given this book by the Benedictine nun in charge of my parish's religious education program.

Like the book says, &quot;Eccesia semper reformanda&quot;: The Church is always in need of reform. We must always strive for perfection. This book does a great job of explaining why certain changes have been and are being made. Contrary to popular belief, many changes are being made not for the sake of modernity, but with an eye to recreating the ancient church as it existed during the time of Christ. Other changes reflect new insights that have been introduced as the Church evolves.

This book seeks to paint the heresy of Modernism in a new light, with statements such as &quot;In the early 20th century, there was a so-called heresy called Modernism which was trying to come to terms with new discoveries (such as we mentioned in the first chapter) and biblical and liturgical insights, but this frightened Rome and so it started a reign of teror by dismissing or suppressing Catholic teachers...&quot; pg. 23,24. The author also includes 'laundry lists', reminiscent of Lorraie Boetners anti-catholic classic 'Roman Catholicism', which list certain traditions or practices as not having been instituted until such and such a date; this is the faith Mr. Bausch seeks to see re-established, a faith without all this 'exterior pomp and ritual', as he might say; a faith centered around 'community' and 'empowerment'.

It was scary. I think Wellington said, \\"The saddest thing in the world is a battle won, except maybe a battle Won\\" I think it applies here to the losers of World War II as well. Germans wreaked havoc on the countries they attacked, and , once they could the attacked people did to the Germans what the Germans did to them. The Allies were unsure of what to do except to break the German people, to make them understand they lost the war so they would not, could not, start another. On the other had, the Russians were trying to create something special and saw a way to bring the German people into their fold willingly, or so this book describes.This book is Capitalist propaganda. The Russians were acquiring some good public relations, while the British, French and Americans were trying to smash the German colossus. This is probably the precursor to the Clod War with all it's propaganda and spin doctors. This created the need for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.The history of this book is factual, but the spin is obviously Capitalist, so I only got so far and quit. It did bring to mind the fears that were being bandied about when the Eastern Block collapsed and East & West Germany were going to be united again. Interesting how this is all working out, eh?"},{"Title":"Gruesome Harvest","review":"Keeling's book is riddled with falsehoods and exaggerations. He makes the absurd claim that the bombing of Hamburg killed \\"hundreds of thousands\\"(it was 40,000)and the still more absurd claim that nearly the entire population of Dresden was killed. He even says that German soldiers in occupied countries behaved correctly,which is unworthy of a rebuttal.Keeling says that four million Germans were deported to the Soviet Union,which is thirteen times the actual number. His figure of three million Germans dying in the postwar expulsions is also inflated,at least if we go with the numbers provided by the German government and the German clergy in the 1980s.Then there is his charge that the Allied occupiers were starving Germans. Germans were certainly going hungry. But according to official statistics,during 1946 the British and American zones were getting over a quarter of a million tons of imported food per month. Keeling denies there was a food shortage in Europe,something that goes against nearly all the data from the period.He quotes a number of people who said there was a famine in Germany. The problem is that the available statistics don't support these extravagant claims(Cf. John Farquharson, The Western Allies and the Politics of Food, and Alice Weintraub, Matters of Taste). Keeling cites Dorothy Thompson as saying that infant mortality in Vienna in the summer of 1945 was nearly 100 percent. The League of Nations said Vienna's infant mortality in that period was 32 percent.While some of Keeling's charges are true, this is not a work that can be taken seriously as a source."},{"Title":"Gruesome Harvest","review":"I bought Gruesome Harvest several years ago, but never read it until this summer. This book is a full-frontal assault on the genocidal Morgenthau Plan and the Potsdam accords. But how accurate is it? Very accurate. My mother was a civilian employee of the United States Armed Forces and a resident of the French Zone of occupation after World War II. The information in this book corresponds directly with her accounts of life there after the war. It's important to note there was a hierarchy of food availability in the U.S. occupied zone - the military naturally got as much food as they needed, then the DP's or Displaced Persons also had access to good nutrition. Finally, the Germans were at the bottom of the food chain, given an \\"official\\" subsistence diet of 1,200 calories a day, usually much less. The author cites studies from The University of Minnesota of the results of feeding people 1,650 calories a day \\"Within six months each man lost a fourth of his weight and experienced fainting spells, dizziness, and a feeling of always being cold. Their hearts shrank and some had to have two blankets even in summer. All lost three-fourths of their energy and work ability.\\" He also cites a similar study of an experiment conducted by Northwestern University Medical School; \\" ... after six weeks, however, they showed a slow, progressive deterioration in physical and mental health, accompanied by loss of endurance, skin lesions, leg pains, and mental slowness.\\" The 1,200 calorie diet was all the more horrific because the majority of the 15 million German expellees were resettled into the bombed out ruins of the Western zones (not Soviet zone) of occupation after having been starved, repeatedly raped, and otherwise abused by the Soviets and their puppets. And who were these 15 million refugees, Nazi war criminals and camp guards? No, they were primarily women, the elderly and children. The men, as this book illustrates, were all in prison camps, consigned to slave labor in Siberia and other parts of the former Soviet Union by the Yalta and Potsdam accords; also used as slave labor under horrific conditions by the British, French and Americans, often in capacities such as clearing mine fields.In hindsight, it can be noted that Harry Truman was inexperienced in world affairs, and he inherited an impossible situation from FDR. The former president apparently was a naive egomaniac who thought his \\"charm\\" would work wonders with Stalin. Judging from the fact that in 1945, Stalin controlled most of Europe, it's frightening to think what the outcome in Europe would have been had he lived 2 years longer or (God forbid), his former VP Henry Wallace had become president. Also, in defense of Harry Truman it should be noted that he inherited from FDR an administration rife with Stalinists and Stalin sympathizers in high places including Hiss and White who were making many decisions relevant to Germany. From accounts I've read, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's intent was to starve to death 30 to 40 million Germans out of psychotic bloodlust revenge, while his aide Harry Dexter White intended to initiate similar things to \\"trigger\\" a situation in Germany in which the Germans would be so horrified they would run to Stalin as a protector, i.o.w. ALL of Germany would go communist. Furthermore, Stalin (according to this book) was dangling a carrot over the German's heads-the return of the lost territories-if the Germans would switch sides and go communist. Alternate maps of Silesia from the Soviets have come out in recent years to prove this.What was the result of Potsdam and the Morgenthau starvation policies? No doubt the death by starvation and disease of several millions of Germans. In some parts of Germany, infant mortality rates after the war were upwards of 100%. There are some of us who don't believe any government (Hitler's nor Roosevelt's) should be in the business of starving people to death. Apparently, Americans don't learn from their mistakes, judging by the reprehensible statement made by Clinton Administration Secretary of State Albright saying \\"We think it's worth it\\" in reply to a question about American sanctions starving Iraqi children to death. Readers and armchair psychologists should ponder this statement made by an American woman politician, ponder the warped thinking behind it and the similarity to Morgenthau.How dire was the situation in occupied Germany? From Page 16; \\"On the train to Berlin, she was pillaged once by Russian troops and twice by Poles...Women who resisted were shot dead, she said, and on one occasion she saw a guard take an infant by the legs and crush its skull against a post because the child cried while the guard was raping its mother.\\" ... \\"An old peasant from Silesia said...victims were robbed of everything they had, even their shoes. Infants were robbed of their swaddling clothes so that they froze to death. All the healthy girls and women, even those 65 years of age were raped in the train and then robbed, the peasant said.\\"On Page 111, the author gives an example of the FDR administration's bizarre take on the basic right of freedom of speech \\"In March 1945, GI's in Germany were actually placed under official orders not to make unflattering remarks about the Reds (Russians). Typical of our un-American efforts to throttle criticism was AMG censorship in April, 1946, of a letter by a Catholic Bishop calling attention to Russian abuses of Germans through forced labor and expulsions. We prohibited the reading of the letter in churches, because it might offend Russia.\\" The author then goes on to state the following; \\"We must realize that there is something seriously wrong with nations, as with people, who cannot stand criticism, who try to place themselves beyond reproach, and that something is equally wrong with people who truckle to them.\\" The reader of this book should think of the USA today in 2006, and how this truth still holds.Finally, here's a bit of wisdom from Page 130; \\" No. If totalitarianism is coming to the United States it will come because the American people can be charmed by insincere, superficial, adroit politicians and fail to demand the leadership of men of character, of courage, of honesty.\\" Just think of (Bill) Clinton & (George) Dubya when you read this.My only major criticism of this book is the author's seemingly negative attitude towards American GI's, especially African-American GI's; the author stresses African-American GI venereal disease rates (as though Caucasian soldiers, Russians and others were not infected as well). In the 1970's I was in Germany and remember a German woman telling me \\"If a German's car breaks down, no German will stop to help, only African-American soldiers stop and help.\\" I remember the overall attitude of Germans as friendly and favorable to African-American GI's, but also remember being told by Germans that they feared and loathed French colonial troops who raped and assaulted German women in the postwar years. I have read German accounts of the immediate post-war years in which it was stated that African-American GI's treated the Germans better than many Caucasian American soldiers who oftentimes acted with snobbery and arrogance. These criticisms aside, this is a very detailed and easy-to-read historical document about the origins of the cold war and the failures of psychotic American policy based on beliefs of an inept president, revenge-based foreign policy and Stalinist sympathies."},{"Title":"Gruesome Harvest","review":"The book Gruesome Harvest, should be on the mandatory highschool and college reading list for history and sociology. It is one of the few books that are available in English that address the murder of millions of non-combatant German civilians and German prisoners of war from 1944 to 1950 as a matter of deliberate allied policy not inefficient logistics as it is most often presented in school text books. It is important because this book was written as it was still happening and includes comments from eye witnesses in the same time period. The book is not politically correct and shocked me because it speaks in a such a predudicial fashion about persons of the black race. That however in this point makes it useful to sociologist and historians because it correctly reflects widely held opinion at the time within U.S. society.As to the correct observation that allied policy was to reduce the German population through, murder in multiple forms, slave labor, and starvation, and destroy the fabric of the society through mass rape of the female population, other authors are critized for saying the same thing but only decades later. Fact is there is a great effort to keep this information from the public because it shows that the victors of WWII incorporated not only military strategy and tactics but also the NAZI ideology of racial hatred and a policy of extermination and discrimination for one people. 4 million persons perished because of the ethnic cleansing carried out by, Russians, Poles, Czechs, and Serbs according to the former German Prime Minister Konrad Adenauer, 5 million Germans starved to death in occupied Germany according to estimates by the Canadian James Bacque, and 2 million German Soldiers died in allied captivity often while performing slave labor in Auschwitz like conditions. General Eisenhower prohibited the German Public from sharing their own meager rations with detained German soldiers on pain of death. Hence from 1944 until 1948 a U.S. and Russian Holocaust for the Germans was on going. For more information on this topic see books by the following authors: James Bacque (Other Losses)(Crimes and Mercies), Alfred M. de Zayas (Die Wehrmacht-Untersuchungstelle)and(The Nemisis of Potsdam), Guido Knopp (Die Gefangenen), Erich Kern and Karl Balzer (Allierte Verbrechen and Deutschen). A similarly important historical document is the book titled (Alliierte Kriegsverbrechen) which translates to \\"Allied War Crimes\\". It is a collection of historical information of eyewitness experiences of hundreds of Allied war crimes. This information was written down in 1946 by German Soldiers held prisoner in Camp 91 in Darmstadt by U.S. forces. Lawyers for the defense hoped to bring some of this information as evidence and perhaps for mitigation to the N&uuml;remberg Tribunal but the it was not permitted. In fact the Commander of Camp 91 attempted to collect and destroy all copies of this book. That is why it is important that as many people read the afore mentioned books as possible. They need to be translated into English and widely read so that the fairy tale of WWII as the last \\"Good War\\" can finally be put to rest."},{"Title":"Gruesome Harvest","review":"For those interested in knowing all of world war 2 history, and not just the rosy view from the perspective of the victor, this book is a must read. My mother's side of the family are ethnic German expellees from Yugoslavia and this book aided in explaining why my family went hungry in the American zone.All too often the rhetoric we hear is the sufferings, both real and alleged, caused by those we defeat in war. We never hear about the atrocities that our side commits. This book exposes the atrocities the Allies committed willfully against civilians, leaving the reader asking why does our country claim the moral high ground?This certainly qualifies to be called a \\"holocaust\\" against the German people, yet in our politically biased atmosphere it is unknown. For those of you interested in the human rights of all peoples, not just those we support in wars, this is a must for you. It will make you wonder what is wrong with your history books."},{"Title":"Gruesome Harvest","review":"Gruesome Harvest was shocking and depressing as it described in shocking detail of the tragic reports and stories about the post war conditions in Germany in 1945 and 1946. The treatment of civilians, women and girls in particular, was horrific. It is dificult to imagine now that the powers of Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States could look the other way when things got so bad in Germany's effort to deal with starvation and a hopeless decline in civil control. Chaos was rampant and it is a miracle that they recovered from a total breakdown of society. It is an historical document which should be more widelydistributed and publicized."},{"Title":"Gruesome Harvest","review":"This book points out things that the average American never knew--how we were starving thousands of Germans and trying to convert their country into an agrarian state, so they would not make war again. Interesting how Russia marched thousands of German citizens from their section of conquered Germany into Russia for slave labor and removed hundreds of industrial plants from Germany to Russia. This points out a time after WWII that Americans should not be proud of. Read this and find out little known facts about post war Germany. Americans did not care what went on there--we wanted to get on with our lives and forget the war and the feeling was that Germany started the war so the German people deserved everything they were getting and then some. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gruesome Harvest","review":"This is a review of GRUESOME HARVEST: THE COSTLY ATTEMPT TO EXTERMINATE THE PEOPLE OF GERMANY by Ralph Franklin Keeling. Mine is the paperback edition which appears to be a 2004 reprint of the 1947 edition which was published by the Institute of American Economics in Chicago. The 2004 reprint is from Liberty Bell Publications in York, South Carolina.The book includes an \\"Introduction\\" by Dr. Austin J. App which dates to 1978 when Liberty Bell Publications, then located in Reedy, West Virginia, reprinted the original 1947 edition. Dr. App was a Professor of English at the University of Scranton and LaSalle Colleges whose activities earned him a chapter in Professor Deborah Lipstadt's DENYING THE HOLOCAUST: THE GROWING ASSAULT ON TRUTH AND MEMORY which was published originally in 1993. Professor Lipstadt describes App on p. 85 as \\"an ardent defender of Germans and Nazi Germany.Being of East Prussian descent, I am sympathetic to the plight of German civilians after Hitler's Third Reich collapsed in 1945 and I've heard anecdotes about the terrible flight of women and children through the snows in 1945 when the Red Army rolled into German territory. The brutal displacement of 12 to 14 million people, mostly women and children, was the largest event of its kind in history insofar as I'm aware.East Prussia disappeared. Even grave markers were pulled up and used for paving stones as a prosperous, historic kingdom of seven centuries was crushed under Stalin's boot. This, however, wasn't the result of the Morgenthau Plan or Western policy despite some harsh rhetoric generated by the revelation of the Nazi concentration camps and other war crimes.Some of that is described in GRUESOME HARVEST. That's remarkable given the fact that this book came out at a time when Nazi war crimes were being revealed and schoolboys like me were warned by worried parents \\"never to speak German in public.\\" Little distinction was made between \\"Germans\\" and \\"Nazis\\" in those days and both were considered evil incarnate.Then came Ralph Franklin Keeling's book showing Germans as victims. I've never found anything about Keeling himself except a couple of references to him as living in Boston. His writing is dated in tone, but easy for a dated reader like me. He includes long quotations for newspapers and sundry official \\"reports\\" generally describing the deplorable conditions which befell Germans, especially those poor women and children who'd survived the Great Flight from the East. Women were raped repeatedly and beaten to death, reduced to prostitution for survival and infant mortality rates were 100% in some areas. Nobody really cared, because they were just a bunch of \\"Krauts\\" and the horrible revelations of what is now called the Holocaust were just entering the public domain.Was Keeling moved by the humanitarian spectacle playing out before him in the post-war years? I don't know, but I'm suspicious because of the paucity of information about him and by the enthusiastic \\"Introduction\\" to his book added in 1978 by Austin J. App. App refers (on p. III) to Keeling as a \\"courageous author\\" whose book was the first to attempt \\"to blast the conspiracy of silence which the victors clamped on the greatest atrocity in European history: the expulsion and total robbery and partial rape and murder of fifteen million Oder-Neisse and Sudeten Germans.\\"And there's where the reader must use caution. Although the Great Flight from the East may have involved as many as fifteen milliion people, they weren't all killed. Most survived, often under deplorable conditions as described in GRUESOME HARVEST, but survived. Furthermore, Allied policy (even the Morgenthau Plan which wasn't implemented) was never \\"to exterminate the people of Germany\\" as Keeling's title suggests.Why is it necessary to hold this humanitarian catastrophe up against Holocaust as \\"the greatest atrocity in European history?\\" It was terrible for those who experienced it but why attempt a comparison with the Holocaust. No matter how bad the Great Flight was, most of the terrifed women and children who participated in that survived it and the Jews, Gypsies, Freemasons and other \\"enemies of the Reich\\" murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust had no connection with the Red Army's offensive.To his credit, Keeling doesn't make the connection in his book that App tries to suggest in his \\"Introduction.\\" The fact of the Great Flight doesn't alter, or mitigate, the fact of the Holocaust. Every historian who's studied this period accepts the Holocaust as a fact of history.I would have given this book a higher rating if it had an introduction from a real historian instead of somebody like Austin App. It would also be reassuring to have a biography of Ralph Franklin Keeling in the book. Who was he and what were his qualifications for writing this book?If this period of history interests you, GRUESOME HARVEST may interest you. Use it with caution though."},{"Title":"Gruesome Harvest","review":"War history is usually first written by the winners so it was very interesting to read this book which shows a different view to what happened after WW2 in Germany. The author courageously wrote this book to show that the military victors were not as wonderful as we may have been taught during our history classes. The mood to punish and re-educate the German people after WW2 was strong. It is a wonder that the country was able to rebuild amidst the starvation and denouncement of its civilian survivors who were left to their own creativity and wits to survive. A study of Post War Germany is not complete unless this short book (140 pages) is read. In planning a trip to Germany, it would give the visitor insight into the culture which is missing from the travel guidebooks."},{"Title":"Gruesome Harvest","review":"This book is truly a mixed bag. On the one hand it is very frank at exposing several important and serious aspects of the terrible revenge against German civilians during and especially after the war. But at the same time the author mixes some historical facts with ideological statements that are nothing but rubbish. It may be partly related to the style of writing back then (the work was initially published in 1947). But still, this way of exploiting the fate of these civilians for ideological purposes is repugnant and disrespectful. Therefore, I recommend rather reading e.g. \\"A terrible revenge\\" by Alfred De Zayas, \\"After the Reich\\" by Giles MacDonogh, or maybe even \\"Crimes and mercies\\" by James Bacque. These releases are more pragmatic and put down the facts, yet do not abuse history for idiotic ideologies."},{"Title":"Gruesome Harvest","review":"What has been done to the German people by the allied powers and our government after WWII is a disgrace.

As she goes about her duties as a professor, Rashawn unfortunately becomes the object of a secret admirer's attention. Because of this person's unknown identity, Rashawn begins to experience feelings of insecurity and fear as she imagines the rapist may still be lurking.Allen Roman is the university's psychiatrist. He attempts to help Rashawn through her issues with the rape and readjusting to campus life. His interest, however, begins to border more on the side of personal rather than medical. Blain Tollome is a campus security guard. He is seen as a tormenter because of his physical stature and intrusive nature. He always seems to be around Rashawn when trouble appears. Chance Davis, a professor at the university also, has a long-standing crush on Rashawn and now that she is back, he plans to act on it. The common thread among the three men is Rashawn. They are all obsessed with having her in their lives, but one of them is playing with a few cards short of a full deck.In the middle of all the attention Rashawn is receiving, crimes are being committed on the campus. Women are being raped and they have no memory of the event, only medical evidence that it happened. People are being brutally beaten and murdered. The connection appears to be the popular \\"get ass\\" drug and a man referred to as \\"Doc\\". As the investigation heats up, the private life of one of Rashawn's admirers comes under close scrutiny.In OBSESSION 101, Michelle McGiff has written a captivating and riveting tale about obsession at its worst. She submerses readers in a plot thick with twists and turns that are guaranteed to keep them flipping the pages. I enjoyed the way she weaves in the subplots of campus life, drug-related activities and mental illness into a main story that inspires one to think about the situations you can find yourself in when trusting people professionally or personally. None of it was predictable, thereby adding to my interest, which reached a high with a shocking conclusion that blew me away. Although this is my first book by Ms. McGriff, I am looking forward to reading some of her other literary escapades.Reviewed by Brenda M.

She is teaching again, trying to raise her son alone, he being the product of the violation. Rashawn is once again surrounded by loving family.This would be the story except that the Author is Michelle McGriff. As usual she adds intricate plots and complicated characters making this thriller a true page turner.In an average mystery somebody dies and the reader wonders \\"who done it\\". But in a Michelle McGriff mystery you are never really sure of what you thought you had figured out. And you won't be sure until the very last page.Wonderful writing, simple, easy to understand language and a great story line makes this Michelle's newest success story.I had a great time reading Obsession 101 and know that you will too. Thanks Michelle! You must keep writing."},{"Title":"Obsession 101","review":"The author does a meticulous work in vividly illustrating humor phobias, insecurities, altered egos and mental struggles through the power of words; although at times I found it difficult to follow the author's lead in the plot, she recovered the story well.The story - suspenseful. Even after the early revealing in the story of the rapist who attacked RaShawn Ams, you'll continue to question the answer because the author used major twists and mayhem heightening the story.The center of the story is based on Professor RaShawn Ams, an English professor at Moorman University, in California. She returned from Georgia to work back again at the University, where she was raped. Now she too(unaware), has fallen victim to the sex drug that has hit the campus from the homeland of Jamaica.Being a creature of habit, the stalker was able to switch her bottled waters with his bottles of drugged water, in which afterwards he would take merciless advantage of the professor. Next, he was able to infiltrate her home and do the same.The results of RaShawn's rape at Moorman University one late night (kept secretive for a while from everyone, family members included), was born a sweet baby boy, Reggie. The rape was the reason for her immediate exodus to Georgia, where her son was born. She accounted to her family that Reggie was born due to her night of fun in the peach state of Georgia.RaShawn attempts, with difficulty, to lead a \\"normal\\" life. Unfortunately, in her path are three men Chance Davis, Allen Roman and Blain Tollome; one of which is possessed with demons and the story unveils...... Yet, it seemed as though there were other characters possessed at times.OUT-OF-CONTROL!!!!!The author was creative with the involvement of college faculty & students, law enforcemment and of course family and friends.The only problem I had was in needed closure to some characaters in the story. The character Leon, a security officer on campus - it's not quite clear how this character was introduced (other than his greed) to his partners, Doc and Red, in the drug circle on campus, in which he also was a drug dealer. Also who was the older man who Allen Roman despised so, what it is father? Who was Wanda, was she the same person as Juanita (Chance Davis' ex-wife)? What became of Juanita's current younger husband, Dennis?Star Rating:****3.5"},{"Title":"Obsession 101","review":"Prior to reading Obsession 101, admittedly mystery often was among my \\"I'm not really into it\\" lists. However, upon reading it, I was astounded by the magnetism of the story that kept me excited, as well as on the edge of my seat. Michelle McGriff definitely fulfilled the four C's: character, crisis, conflict and change.Moorman University professor Rashawn Ams evoked empathy as she dealt secretly with her victimization on campus; a rape that resulted in her pregnancy. Her decision to runaway instead of confiding in her best friend Qiana that she suspected Qiana's boyfriend Russell Thompson, challenged the \\"Ethics\\" she taught. Concocting a lie about an unnamed lover, who supposedly fathered her son Reggie, merely fueled the fire that burned within the psychotic perpetrator. Rashawn's return to Moorman after one and a half years catapulted a spiral of deceit, hatred, jealousy, mystique, apprehension, murder and ambivalence.Blain Tollome was the campus cop whose overtures to Rashawn were unnerving and unwelcome. He's an imposing and intimidating specimen who lured women who had a crush on his muscles, while crushing those who threatened to expose his complicity. Readers definitely root for Rashawn to steer clear of him, although the exact reason is held at bay while she wrestles with demons, past and present.Ms. McGriff invited readers to eavesdrop on sessions between the mystery man and psychotherapist Juanita Davis, as he shared his desires to ravage Rashawn in her own home. Juanita's ex-husband Chance Davis was a colleague of Rashawn's, who desired a normal, intimate relationship with her. The mystery man wickedly exploited the naivet&eacute; of his unsuspecting targets and their interdependence.Ms. McGriff adeptly portrayed Doc as the campus crime boss while cultivating speculation on his identity. It was tantalizing trying to unmask him before his cover was blown. In addition to Blain and Doc, Dr. Allen Roman was another intriguing character. Also a colleague of Rashawn's, he taught abnormal psychology; such irony. Like with Blain, Rashawn had qualms with Dr. Roman. She knew how he felt about himself, yet had no clue the nature of feelings he harbored for her.Ms. McGriff is to be commended for balancing bizarre and twisted declarations of love with comical, soul searching and of course, drama filled romance. She put a spin on \\"baby's daddy drama.\\" What happens when a sperm bank makes a huge mistake? Qiana and Nigel struggled with that very dilemma, along with their closest friends and family.Michelle McGriff truly demonstrated she's honed her craft. She has enticed us in the past with romance, as well as enthralled us with mystery and suspense. Obsession 101 is definitely a must read.Robin R.

Of course the ugly twin is out there running around...but anyway, we can get over that now that the revised version is out. You just have to look for it. I've personally got the hook up soooo, let me tell you all about it.Doc is crazy, Juanita is crazy, Blain is crazy, Allen Roman is crazy, shoot, Carlotta is crazy and so is Trina's husband...what's his name...anyway, they are ALL crazy.I loved this book, it keep me laughing and reading wondering who was gonna jump out the closet next. My thing was just when I thought I knew who was lurking in the shadows I was wrong, just when I was like...oh snap I know it's dude in the closet I was wrong. But I guessed who was doing Juanita and I was right HA! All I can say is, in the end, I was like, girl come here and let me slap you!I do however think the book was a little dark, and different from what we used to see from the sweet little author who made up curse words and stuff, and I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with Ms. McGriff's little NOIR faze but that's cool, I know all authors have to stretch in order to grow and so I'm gonna flow with it as long as I can still turn out the lights when I'm finished reading and not be twitching like a crack head talking about, what was that?"},{"Title":"Obsession 101","review":"In Obsession 101, by Michelle McGriff, Rashawn Ams, a college professor, brutally raped over a year ago and left to give birth to a child from this unwanted union, decides to do it alone, away from family and friends. She chooses not report the rape, preferring to just move on and to try to put it behind her, but she can't. Fast-forward 18 months and she's back and seemingly thriving with a beautiful son, a great job and the belief that the man she suspected of raping her is dead, so all is well with her and her world, or so it seems. Meet the university psychiatrist Allen Roman as he tries to help her through her issues but begins to get personally involved. Enter Blain Tollome the campus security guard who's big, brawny, intimidating and always around when things happen to Rashawn. Then there's Chance Davis who had a thing for Rashawn before she went away and now that she's back, he knows he has to strike while the iron is hot. All three men want her, but one of them is a lunatic, plain and simple. To add to the madness, Rashawn also has a secret admirer of sorts who brings back uneasy feelings about Rashawn's rape because women on campus are systematically being raped and apparently being slipped a date rape drug as none of them can recall the event. One of her three admirers has a past that comes into question as authorities investigate the series of various and sundry crimes that range from beatings and rapes to murder! Add to that the subplots, which are just as compelling as the main thrust of the story since they touch on on-campus drama, drugs, and mental instability.What stands out about Obsession are not just the suspense, the mystery and the feeling of \\"who-in-the-world-done-it\\" throughout the entire novel, but Michelle manages to inject a touch of humor, a dash of poignancy, and a whole lot of compassion as she makes you feel connected to each of the characters. Even the twisted one (you know I can't tell you who he is), but I almost felt like I understood where he was coming from even though he was, well...a lunatic. Whenever I thought I knew who did it, I was pleasantly surprised on virtually every page that I didn't have a clue! Many of the cast of characters each have a hint of obsessive qualities in varying degrees, which makes the story all the more compelling. Michelle has penned a spine-tingling tale that keeps the tension mounting until the very last page. Superb job, Michelle!!!!!"},{"Title":"Obsession 101","review":"Michelle McGriff is a natural storyteller. She creates a world full of passion and intensity that draws you in right from the beginning.

I couldn't put it down, more for fear I would lose my place and not remember who I was suspecting (and why) when I picked it back up.The characters had me so involved. From the \`Psycho' therapist Juanita to the \`Psycho' path Blain, all these crazies seem to have their secrets and you just feel compelled to find out what those secrets are.The dialog was witty and really speaks to the author's dry sense of humor. I laughed out loud often and wow, blushed some too because it got a little hot in there.I won't say this is her best, but I will say it's the best so far, because each book I read of hers gets better and better, but I do feel that this book will be one that is a must for your McGriff collection."},{"Title":"Obsession 101","review":"Ms. McGriff has really out done herself.

Then I my closets.Blain might have been sexy as all get out, but he was missing some screws, and Chance was a loser in my opinion, he was weak, and Allen Roman reminded me of an old leech you meet in a bar and totally regret giving your number too. In For Love's Sake, Rashawn had it together, but in this story she fell apart completely. To me this was very realistic because we can't all be Wonder Woman all the time. Maceba was a real woman too. She had conflicts of the heart that cost her everything.Having read Ms. McGriff's writing before, I have to admit I do enjoy her romances better but she did a good job in holding my attention with this one. The story never dragged in my opinion yet she covered alot of ground and had alot of characters, but then again, that's her style I think, as I read Majestic Secret years ago and had to read it more than one time, however, it's never a chore to read her books more than once and I look forward to the next one."},{"Title":"Obsession 101","review":"Professor Rashawn Ams life seems to be on an upward swing until strange things start happening.

This book was written as part of an Air Force project to study Luftwaffe operations for the benefit of future operations as a tool of learning.The Luftwaffe, despite Stalingrad, did pull off quite a few successful air supply operations before and after the debacle on the Volga. The Germans did some amazing things considering the resources...or lack of at their disposal.This book is mainly a dry read, it is not really a book, it is a study or as the USAF called it a monograph. It was written by a Luftwaffe General involved in air supply operations, not a proper historian/writer. It has been used as the source for many other excellent books on the Luftwaffe, namely those most recently published by the University of Kansas.While this may not help you with your decision, when I first read this book...and the others from the USAF series, I was mesmerized, my mind escaped, free from the notions presented by Time-Life histories or that of the World at War...and of late by the History Channel and Discovery Wings. What may have got me was the fact that this was a real document of history, not a story. I may also add one thing, with the gift of hindsight, I know that this work is slightly tainted by the author's view of a ten to fifteen year respite from the conflict, and also that his views may have been molded by his new &quot;allies&quot;(the US) and their common enemy(USSR), which is a caution that must apply to many books written in the cold war era(also guilty of this Guderian, Manstein, and especially von Mellenthin's &quot;Panzer Battles&quot;)."},{"Title":"German Air Force Airlift Operations","review":"This account gives a thorough run-down on German airlift ops during WW2. It covers prewar planning (of which there was little), and then runs from the first parachute operations in Denmark and Norway through to the final, forlorn airlifts to Budapest and Breslau in the war's final months. Along the way Dr. Morzik give truly exhaustive (and exhausting!) coverage of the Demyansk airlift, which cost the Luftwaffe severely in planes and pilots. Coverage of the Stalingrad airlift is useful but less extensive. All major airlift operations of the war are covered, including little-known episodes like the transfer of 22nd Airlanding Division to guard the Ploesti oil fields during the spring of 1941, and an airlift to German anti-partisan forces evacuating across Yugoslavia in late 1944 and early 1945.The text is generally clear and readable, although this account is extensive to the point of laborious. That is great for researchers, but I do not recommend this for your morning read. It is nonetheless fascinating in places, particularly in its description of Luftwaffe transport aircraft types, ranging from the well-known Ju-52 to the obscure Ar-232, which anticipated the USAF C-130 in a number of ways.The author also puts a heavy emphasis on the less tantalizing - but essential - logistics of airlift ops.Illustrations are interesting, though not always visually clear. Mapping is generally good, but not as comprehensive as I would have liked. Finally, there are a wealth of informative tables, which can answer many statistical needs. This title is only appropriate for the narrow scope of readers who want in-depth knowledge about the arcane but important story of how the Luftwaffe introduced to the world the highly useful and under-appreciated art of military airlift."},{"Title":"Biology (Monarch college outlines)","review":"Mader's &quot;Biology&quot; makes every thing simple with its easy-to-understand language and figures.

Harris & Co. department store in Dallas around 1952 or '53. It was written by Leon A. Harris Jr., son of the store's founder. I was a mere girl, working in a downtown law firm. I loved the poem so much that I memorized it, then forgot about it as my life and career moved in other directions. Somehow, years later, I became aware that the poem had been published in book form. This year I thought of it again as I was shopping for gifts for my sister-in-law, a Texas aficionado stationed in the wilds of Las Vegas. My first stop in my quest was Amazon, of course, and, of course, there it was--and at a decent price.

As you can see, my Chadian knowledge was lacking. Then I picked up \\"Calabash Cat and His Amazing Journey\\". This title had intrigued me for a couple reasons. For one thing, it was visually stunning. I'm a sucker for intricate linework, and \\"Calabash Cat\\" is awash in tiny details and clever little strokes of the pen. Also, I had heard that this tale was written in both English and Arabic. I am currently under the impression that there is a distinct lack of good Arabic books out there for kids in America to read. To my mind, a book like \\"Calabash Cat\\" might well fill a few gaps. So I picked it up for a look-see.In this fable, we meet a calabash cat. One day, the cat decides to see exactly where the world ends. It stops at a desert and decides that this might well be the world's end. That is, until a camel informs the cat that this is not the world's end and that he will take the feline to the REAL end of the world. They travel to a grassland and the cat is just about to declare it the world's end when a horse informs him that he is mistaken. With that, the cat is on the back of the horse going to the REAL end of the world. From there the cat rides the back of a tiger through a jungle, the back of a whale through the ocean, and finally upon the back of an eagle. The eagle, wisest of all the creatures yet, simply says, \\"Climb up on my back and I will show you a world without end\\". Before returning to his home, the cat flies high above the land and we are treated to a magnificent two page spread of animals frolicking on the earth as cat and bird fly silhouetted against a geometric sun.On the final page of this book, author James Rumford explains that he once bought a carved calabash gourd in the shape of a cat. Looking at the creature, Rumford couldn't help but wonder what other calabash animals his cat might meet and where they might go. Thus, the calabash cat's tale was born. The story contains a classic folktale quest, in this case the search for the farthest end of the world. Rumford has a good ear for repetition and tone. I'm not fluent in Chadian Arabic (no surprises there) so I can't vouch that the words in that language flow as well as they do in the English. Needless to say, it nice that they're there at all.The illustrations in this story are modeled on the style of Chad's calabash engravers. The cat, for his part, has a large lizard and fish bedecking his body. In fact, each animal that comes with contact with our intrepid hero is illustrated in a similar manner. Against a brown mottled background, these animals are a beautiful array of black pen and ink, the occasional colored line appears behind them to set the scene. Therefore, the final rainbow infused shot in the book is a real delight, displaying not only the animals we already met in the story but some others that are wholly original. My first thought when I saw this illustrations was their similarity to other fine picture books out there. Books like \\"Rosie's Walk\\" by Pat Hutchins or \\"Drummer Hoff\\" by B. Emberley come to mind. Like \\"Calabash Cat\\", they too are filled with delicate lines and stoic protagonists. A storytime containing all three of these books would be an excellent idea, by the way.If you'd like to introduce an African inspired picture book to your repetoire, but you're just so doggone tired of Anase tales, try your hand with this Chad inspired little number. I can guarantee you've never see anything to quite compare. From the heady illustrations to the classic nature of its tale, this is a book to treasure deeply. West African cats will never look the same again."},{"Title":"Calabash Cat","review":"Calabash Cat, a West African cat, sets out one day to find where the world ends. His adventures take him across a desert, grasslands, a jungle, and the ocean, until he finds what he is looking for.James Rumford was a Peace Corps volunteer living in Chad with his wife when she bought a wonderful cat, cut from a giant gourd and decorated with the wood-burning designs of the Kotoko people. That cat inspired this book, which is illustrated in the charming style of the calabash engravers of Chad. His original tale will keep you thinking long after you have closed the covers of this book -- about our one world, and about seeking knowledge and finding wisdom.An extra bonus is the bilingual format of the book, with every two-page spread having one page in English and one page in Arabic. The author modeled the Arabic calligraphy after the handwriting of his Chadian friend Brahim Adoum. Chadian Arabic is spoken by certain tribes in Chad and, in its simplest form, is used as a market language in a country where many languages are spoken. Chadian Arabic is a spoken language and rarely written, so the beautiful calligraphy is an unusual treat.Teachers/Librarians: Elementary level bilingual English/Arabic"},{"Title":"Calabash Cat","review":"I was drawn to the illustrations of this book and was delighted when I discovered a story told in the form of a traditional folk tale.

The bold lines and beautiful patterns within the animals are unique for children's books and very interesting to look at.Next, the story is very good. Like many good children's stories, this adventure of a cat can be both interesting and meaningful on the surface, for a young audience, as well as providing a deeper message for us adults most likely reading the story to children. Grown ups, I ask you after reading this book, \\"What boundaries have you set to make the perimeter of your world?\\"Last but certainly not least, without being preachy or disgustingly PC, this book introduces a vital multicultural element.

Thinking maybe it ended at the start of the desert, he sits down. A camel happens by and notes how silly the cat is and says, \\"Climb up on my back, and I will show you where the world ends,\\" and they walk across the desert. At the end of the desert and beginning of the grasslands, the camel says authoritatively, \\"Here, my friend, is where the world ends.\\" However a horse happens by to let the cat know that the camel was small-minded to think it ended at the desert. And thus goes several iterations with the horse across the grasslands, the tiger through the jungle, the whale across the sea. The eagle teaches the final moral that the world is without end.

I look forward to each new addition to this wonderful series and this one did not disappoint! In it we see Hamish at his most exasperating and endearing best. When a young recovered(?) drug addict is found dead in his rented chalet, Hamish feels that something doesn't add up. Although Strathbane writes it off as another dead junkie, Hamish thinks the young fellow was murdered. While trying to pursue this theory on his own, he is thrown into the drug buying and selling scene in Scotland. One thing leads to another and it turns out that Hamish is put undercover with a rather fetching Detective Inspector to expose a big drug ring in Strathbane. Hamish finds himself in hot water, and is exposed to all manner of nefarious people, but you can bet he triumphs in the end. He also determines just what happened to young Tommy Jarret. Lots of fun."},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"I read this series largely for the amusement of reading about Hamish's eccentricities and exploits.

For full enjoyment, you might want to start with the first book: Death of a Gossip, in which the village and characters are introduced.For those of you who have met Hamish only through the TV series, I don't think that the books are at all like the show.

The police say it was an overdose. Hamish does not think so. He sets out to prove it. Then for most of the book, this murder is not even thought about. Hamish gets involved with drug dealers and gets to act the part of a drug lord. His supposed to be wife is another detective, of course they end up in bed together. Hamish even wanders into a shop and a girl they takes him home with her and they end up in bed. Wish Beaton would write like she did in the earlier books.

So when he dies from an overdose, police officer Hamish Macbeth is a bit shocked, especially when the autopsy revealed the lad had a sleeping drug in his system. When Tommy's parents ask Hamish to investigate, he jumps on the case.Hamish offers a plan to the chief superintendent in which he would infiltrate the mob of drug boss Jimmy White. However, his superiors modify Hamish's plan. Another cop, Glasgow detective inspector Olivia Chater will pose as his wife. Even as the duo fight and fall in love with each other, they unite in an attempt to bring down the White gang. However, neither Hamish nor Olivia is prepared for the betrayal that may result with both of them dead.The Hamish series remains one of the freshest fictional police procedurals on the market today even though DEATH OF AN ADDICT is his fifteenth appearance. The story line is entertaining as Hamish goes undercover, changing from farm clothing to Armani suits. Olivia lives up to her reputation as the \\"Concrete Knickers\\" until she and Hamish soften one another's edges. Though the story line seems to be a bit confusing at times, fans of police procedurals have another entertaining tale to read.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"The stories that Marion Chesney write -- the romances under this name and the mysteries penned under the name M.C. Beaton -- are always at their best when they bust out of their prefab genres or confound our expectations of her characters. At times, her books are almost subversive. Her Poor Relations series, set in the Regency era, casts a glance at convention by telling a love story, but it's clear that she's interested in her secondary characters as well, and the result is a charming, entertaining series of books that stand out from the herd.She has a similar success with this mystery series starring Hamish Macbeth, the constable of a small Scottish seaside town. Depending upon the book, this series, now numbering 15 books, is a cross-fertilization of police procedural, village cozy and romance, all held together by the amiable Macbeth, the good copper too unambitious to want to move from Lochdubh, no matter how irritating the cantankerous residents could be at times.But &quot;Death of an Addict&quot; sends Macbeth away from Lochdubh as he investigates the suspicious drug overdose of a young man who had kicked heroin and was writing a book about his experiences. The trail leads to an evangelical church of dubious faith and to drug smuggling in Amsterdam, where Macbeth falls into some very unofficer-like behavior as he goes undercover as a smuggler alongside a hard-nosed detective inspector who poses as his wife.While I've generally found the Macbeth stories a treat, &quot;Death of an Addict&quot; is a cut above Beaton's usual excellence. With its fast pace, a plot that takes unexpected turns and Macbeth pushed into some unexpected roles, &quot;Addict&quot; is the best book of the series, and it brings joy to this reader's heart to know that there are more books to come."},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"The &quot;Death of a ...&quot; series is superb.

Felicity seems a bit hippy and Tommy has had contact with the police before over a drugs offence. Then there's a report of a green eyed monster having been seen in the Loch at Drim.When Tommy is found dead of an apparent drugs overdose Hamish is far from convinced that it is suicide and why is Felicity so aggressive towards him when he asks simple straightforward questions?What follows in a fast paced international story which involves Hamish pretending to be a drugs baron in an undercover operation. He is provided with a pretend wife in the form of Chief Inspector Olivia Chater from Glasgow.I found this story both exciting and poignant with some interesting things to say about the trade in illegal drugs. Hamish is at his best with his acute observation skills and his - not always perfect - knowledge of human nature. One of the best books in this series in my opinion."},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"This is the fifteenth book in a most enjoyable series of cozy mysteries. Featuring lovable Highlander, Hamish Macbeth, a constable in the remote village of Lochdubh in Scotland, it is a series to which its fans are devoted. With its engaging depiction of village life with all the quirky and wonderful characters who live their, it is certainly a series well worth reading if one is a fan of the cozy mystery genre.In this book, however, the author decides to transform Hamish into an undercover drug dealer. What could be more laughable? It just does not fit with the portrait of Hamish Macbeth that has already been so skillfully painted by the author. Consequently, this ill conceived idea does not ring true, and the book falls flat.To make matters worse, the local villagers are not an integral part of this book, losing yet another element that propels this series into readers' hearts. To further add insult to injury, the murder of a local drug addict takes a back seat to the hoopla of Hamish portraying a drug dealer and is almost forgotten, until the thread of his murder is picked up again late in the book as an afterthought.While this book was certainly a disappointment, fans that are addicted to this series will read it anyway and derive a modicum of enjoyment from it. One can only hope that the author will get back on track with the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"I'm not reading the Hamish Macbeth series in order, but, I did read 'Death of a Scriptwriter' before this one. It's been returned to the library so I can't check, but, I believe Lugs and Sonsie, Hamish's dog and cat, are written about in the book. If I am wrong, please, correct me. I read 'Death of an Addict' wondering the whole time where Hamish's pets were. That took away from my enjoyment of this series. This one was off to me in other ways, too. Hamish looking for a wife and willing to settle for the cold police woman or even the Dutch girl? He barely knows either of them. The book just touched on characters, the girl renting the chalet, or plotlines, the religious cult and the husband and wife running it.I see this one was written in 1999 so I won't worry the author became like Lilian Jackson Braun and 'The Cat Who...\\" series and just phoned it in or had it ghostwritten to terrible results later in that series."},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"This was a disappointing title for M.C.

I am such a Beaton fan and never thought I'd come across one that I'd give away. But this one is not a keeper."},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"This is the second Hamish McBeth book I have read, and it is a disappointment. It lacks the folksy charm of the first. The plotting is weak, and the situations absurd. I suppost if you want a simple, easy weekend read this would do. If I had a cottage, that is where I would put this lightweight piece of nonesense."},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"M.C. Beaton's \\"Death of an Addict\\" presents us with her 15th Hamish Macbeth mystery.For those familiar with both Beaton and Macbeth, naturally, the plot, the circumstances, the characters, the resolution--they are all the same. The Macbeth series is a Formula One ride--little will surprise the devout. However, that said, Beaton treats us once again to what we have come to expect from her and Macbeth, the local constable from the Scottish Highlands village of Lochdubh. (It is in this book that we learn that it is pronounced \\"Lock doo\\"!)Basically, we find Macbeth once again tending his hens and sheep and lazing about; a newcomer is introduced to us and shortly thereafter is found dead, with \\"all the usual suspects\\"! Of course, \\"red herrings\\" is Beaton's middle name and the reader has to contend with them for the most part. But no matter, once again we are reminded of \\"the formula\\" and tolerate these additives.While certainly a fan myself, this edition, however, I found, showed us that Ms Beaton was a bit out of her element. In \\"Addict,\\" she and Macbeth undertake the world of the drug barons and lords and street dealers. Ms Beaton seems out of her element here, as her solutions are way too simplistic and she would have us think that this world is not any more wicked or problematic than her own local community murders (usually committed out of jealousy over some petty quarrel). The drug world is different, more complicated, and quite likely far more evil than any of the other crime settings. The usual Beaton solution is not convincing.Hamish, of course, solves the situation, meets another woman he falls in love with (it never takes him long), and by the end of the book is once more alone. His long time love, Priscilla Smythe-Burton, keeps hanging about in all the books (Ms Beaton should \\"fish or cut bait\\" with her, however. How long does she think we--or Hamish--will hang on!For the devotees, don't miss this one, of course, but a good sip of Highland malt will be needed to dull the pain of the book!"},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"Although our PBS station has not yet aired the Hamish MacBeth TV series, I know it has quite a following in Great Britain. I have begun to wonder whether its success has marred the books. As other reviewers have pointed out, the idea of Macbeth fooling a drugpin into believing he, Macbeth, is a big-time drug dealer is ludicrous-- all the more so since apparently it is Macbeth's sneer that causes this oh-so-convincing transformation. The plot contrivance seems to this reader to be an excuse for a &quot;Macbeth Goes To Amsterdam&quot; TV episode. All the more annoying is the way the initial crime victim becomes virtually forgotten for 2/3 of the book. Why rate it as high as 3 stars ? Well, there is just enough Scottish atmosphere and visits with recurring Lochdubh characters to merit a read for MC Beaton's fans."},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"Mamalinda must confess to being seriously addicted to Hamish MacBeth. The author writes with crisp clarity and sketches very believable characters, harshly beautiful settings, as well as cleverly solving the crime with plenty of stops for tea and scones. In this story the delightfully under-ambitious and unlucky in love Hamish goes undercover as a drug lord - with his superior Chief Inspector as his wife. The outlandish interchanges and fiascos are occasionally hysterical. Davinia Porter reads the unabridged version, and does a wonderful job on changing voice, is mostly pleasant but does get suddenly shrill and is uneven enough in volume that it is difficult to listen to her with traffic noise."},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"Having read all of the Hamish McBeth series, I was eagerly looking forward to the latest installment. I have deep suspicions it was written by someone other than M. C. Beaton, as the charm of Scottish village life was almost completely absent from the book. The way I picture Hamish, I could never mistake him for the head of an international drug cartel even disguised in an Armani suit. Ms. Beaton's work started to change, for me, a couple of books ago when she killed off Towser, Hamish's dog. He was an imaginary dog - he could have lived forever. She needs to return to the formula that got her here. As they always told us in English class, write based on what you know."},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"If you want a tight plot with a hard edge, you shouldn't be reading these. I've read reviews of some of those gritty, \\"realistic\\" series, and they do get complicated. They carry a \\"sophistication\\" not found entertaining to readers who have gone to the \\"cozy\\" genre to avoid all of that. And, there are going to be improbables in the plots of the glintier series as well. It's fiction. I'm not willing to denigrate this author due to intermittent variations throughout her prolific series. She has introduced and maintained fundamental consistency in her solid and interesting characters.Yes, Ms. Beaton dares to extend the venue and action in this one away from the village and into a much more tangled web than is usually woven for Hamish and company. While the drug crime world is entirely more complex and dangerous than most, actually Hamish is a much more gifted detective than most, including some of his superiors. Let's not forget that the reason he is a mere police constable in a \\"backwater\\" is not the measure of his ability, but a matter of his personal choice. He is quite gifted at detection and perception, and the fact that he is not influenced by ambition makes him a much steadier head and hand.What stirs Hamish up to exert himself to unravel the conundrums about him comes from an innate sense of justice being done. He is made a lone ranger in the pursuit more from an absence of that ideal being shared than anything else. His unorthodoxy is something very different from bureaucratic and political machinations. If he were willing to make the corrupting compromises (definitely including lifestyle) necessary for promotion, even in a police department, he wouldn't be Hamish MacBeth.What is, to me, the wildest element in this edition, and not much mentioned here, is the progress of Blair's jealous obsession. Good grief, he has become a criminal himself -- deliberately betraying the police sting through a snitch only to scuttle the potential of further recognition for Hamish. It is shades of the mad police superior Dreyfus in the Pink Panther series!"},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"Actually I did not enjoy this book as much as the rest of the Hamis MacBeth I have read. It seemed out of his baliwick to go undercover as a drug dealer, adopt foul language, get tricked into going with a prostitute, no matter how young and seemingly innocent she was, and hang with the really rotten underground type. None of those things are the Hamish MacBeth I have become accustomed to. But then I have never enjoyed books or movies involving drug use.I like the kindly but firm, look the other way when it isn't harmful, PC MacBeth, who loves the people under his watch, and does everything he can to help them all. I wish he was real."},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"Life looks simple enough as the book opens. Lochdubh's finest, Police Constable Hamish Macbeth, checks out a former heroin addict, Tommy Jarret, and is quickly convinced the young man has kicked the habit and wants to stay clean. Imagine Hamish's shock when Jarret dies of a heroin overdose soon thereafter. Detective Chief Inspector Blair and Detective Jimmy Anderson of Strathbane are quickly convinced it's an accidental overdose and the case is closed. Hamish isn't convinced. Jarret had been writing a book about his drug-using days and all but the first chapter has disappeared. Also, Jarret also had a sedative in his bloodstream. Jarret's parents are also skeptical and persuade Hamish to keep an investigation going.Hamish takes his vacation so he can investigate on the quiet. His searches begin with a sex-obsessed church that seems to be a cover for something else. Confronting Jarret's former roommates, Hamish decides on the spot to pretend to be a drug dealer who wants to buy a big quantity of heroin. Hamish calls for help, and soon a large police operation is mounted with the inexperienced and uncomfortable Hamish at the middle.To make matters complicated, the operation is headed by the very attractive Detective Chief Inspector Olivia Chater of Glasgow who will play the role of Hamish's \\"wife.\\" DI Chater wants no messing around and she plans to wear the pants. The role playing develops into all kinds of giggling situations as they find themselves sharing bedrooms, beds, and needing to put on a good show for the drug dealers' minions who trail them.Naturally, Hamish cannot control his need to wander around and soon gets himself into an embarrassing situation in Amsterdam.Despite missteps, Hamish and Chater delve deeper and deeper into the heart of the Highlands' most dangerous drug ring. Along the way, they also solve the mystery of a monster that's haunting Loch Drim.Blair finds out about Hamish's success and is beside himself with envy. What will Blair do?After many interesting complications, Hamish still cannot see who killed Tommy Jarret. Taking what's left of his vacation, Hamish is once again on the track of those who are responsible for Jarret's death.The story has a bittersweet ending that helps Death of an Addict rise above most of the stories in the series. The aura of danger throughout much of the book and the sadness of drug addiction make this story far darker than the usual Highland tales Ms. Beaton has written before about how obnoxious people get what's coming to them from another visitor to the Highlands. I enjoyed the difference.But don't expect this story to have the gritty realism of all those New-York based movies about drug cartels. Look elsewhere if that's your bag."},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"As the fifteenth entry into the popular Hamish MacBeth series opens is enjoying the beautiful early autumn weather in his beloved Lochdaubh and rejoicing that he is finally over his long term on again off again romance with Priscilla. His peace is shattered though when a tenant of a tourist cottage is found dead. Once it is revealed that the young man had died of a drug overdose it was assumed that he had relapsed and begun using again. Hamish was not so certain, and despite being told to drop the matter, began his own investigations. The trail let him away from Lochdugh, first to an even more remote village, then to the mean streets of Strathbane and finally to Amsterdam - Hamish's first trip abroad.As with any long running series Beaton has had to come up with various ways to keep the series fresh without losing the very things that made it popular in the first place. Taking Hamish out of the Highlands where he is most comfortable to unfamiliar territory puts a new slant on the series. Beaton has managed to let Hamish grow in a realistic manner without losing his appeal.For fans of the series this is a treat, Hamish gets to spread his wings a bit but we still get to catch up on a bit of the latest Lochdubh news. Those new to the series would probably enjoy beginning with one of the earlier books although it is not absolutely necessary to read this series strictly in order."},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"Although Hamish is brighter than he appears, the idea of him posing as a drug kingpin just doesn't work. And the dialogue is weak in the extreme. It is extremely rare when a television series is better than the books but the BBC series of Hamish Macbeth is. This is a very light series anyway, but this story was one of the weakest."},{"Title":"Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)","review":"I've seen an episode or two of the television version, starring the ever charming Robert Carlyle, and when BBC America pulled it from their lineup I decided to give the books a try. I think, perhaps, I picked the wrong one to start with, because if they're all this trite I'm flabbergasted as to why people read them.Hamish is his usual do-goody, city-loathing self and that's about all I can tell you because the plot is a completely scattershot affair. What starts as a murder mystery becomes what could have been an interesting cult-infiltration if the author didn't seem to have ADD and instead arbitrarily abandons both plot threads in favor of one about drug smuggling. Soon the murder is nothing more then an afterthought as Undercover Hamish jets off for a random trip to Amsterdam, with requisite Snow Queen Superior Officer in tow. Thrill to Hamish hanging around a hotel room, Hamish eating at a restaurant and...Hamish going home with a prostitute?Of course, Snow Queen's icy heart is inevitably melted to reveal a weak, angry girl who, of course, jumps into bed with our hero to prove her gratitude. Just once I'd like to read a mystery novel where the two leads of the opposite sex don't hop in the sack with each other, it happens in real life all the time I'm told. Simply because a man has a pretty smile and a charming brogue doesn't mean a woman has to immediately fall hoplessly in love with him (alright, well *I* would, but that's neither here nor there).This book is hampered by the fact that there is no real villain. It starts out being the murderer, then flips to the cult leader, then the drug czar, none of whom are the leaste bit threatening or interesting. And Hamish's longtime rival has little to do except get drunk and plot out schemes so vile and unreal I half expected him to start twirling a big black moustache and talking like Edward G. Robinson.A more accurate title would have been: Death of a Potential Fan"},{"Title":"The Gospel Time Bomb","review":"Despite the fact that this book was written back in 1984, &quot;The Gospel Time Bomb&quot; retains its relevance to American Christianity today.

I highly recommend this book to skeptics and true believers alike. Christian-friendly, thoughtful, and politically incorrect, &quot;The Gospel Time Bomb&quot; deserves a place next to &quot;The Faith-Healers&quot; by James Randi, &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot; by Carl Sagan, and &quot;Why People Believe Weird Things&quot; by Michael Shermer."},{"Title":"The Art of Cookery in the Middle Ages","review":"&quot;The Art of Cookery&quot; is a substantive book.

While they aren't perfect, they will prepare you for the test. I doubt if this book will. It reads like a college text requiring instructor amplification. I could live with the monotonous writing style but soon tired of correcting errors (I couldn't find an errata on the net). For me, the content was inconsistent. At times like a quick review to get everybody on the same page and elsewhere very, very terse. Example, subnetting gets 10 pages here (and not covered very well). The Cram (a summary!) gives it 16 and does a fair job. This book has only 376 pages while the Cram has 426!! No answers to chapter questions. Too much detail in places and none where we'll be tested. Take your wife to dinner with the money you save, she's tired of your studying all the time anyway."},{"Title":"MCSE Guide to TCP/IP on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0","review":"A &quot;Terrible&quot; book.

It tells you how to use NT Help, the desktop, and Find Files (absolute filler - no relevance), but little if any description on &quot;Subnetting&quot; (and everything else). How embarrassing. Save your time and don't get tennis elbow from launching it across the room."},{"Title":"MCSE Guide to TCP/IP on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0","review":"I was forced to buy this book for a class. As a newbie to TCP/IP networks it seemed a little sparse and did not really teach me to much about TCP/IP networking. I was very disapointed in the fact that after this class, I was still no farther along in my understanding of subneting. Thankfully the price of hardware bottomed out, and I was able to get a copy of Win NT to practice with, or I might not know how to subnet to this day. It would be an &quot;OK&quot; book for someone just starting out, if they could get it at a reasonable price.

Horatio's two brothers, Bart, and Bernie are jealous of Horatio's fortune. They know that if they could wipe out his family, and his butler, Bently, the fortune would be theirs. Bart and Bernie come to the mansion for their monthly dinner with a birthday cake. Everyone except Sandy, and Bently eat some of the cake. The next day, Sandy wakes up to find that everyone, including his pet chicken, was in a coma. Sandy and Bently do some research, and discover that the cake Bart and Bernie brought was poisoned. The only problem is, Bently disposed of the cake before they could get evidence to the police. Now Sandy and Bently will have to find proof that his uncles poisoned his parents, and try to survive their other attempts to kill them too.This is a hilarious book dealing with family rivalries. I recommend this book to readers from 9-14. This book is well written and has a good plot!"},{"Title":"Love Among the Walnuts: or, How I Saved My Family from Being Poisoned","review":"I love the book Love Among the Walnuts by Jean Ferris because it is written so well. Ferris uses such detail and description to describe these characters and their surroundings. She puts a lot of humor into her stories and uses very descriptive words and phrases.Sandy Huntington-Ackerman was living life on Easy Street. His parents were both multi-millionaires. He lived in a huge mansion about 40 miles outside of the town called Jupiter. The mansion is called Eclipse. One day, Sandy's uncles, Bart and Bernie, try to poison the entire family so they can get all of the money that belongs to Sandy's father, Horatio. Luckily they miscalculate and it only sends Sandy's parents, the cook, and their pet chicken Attila, into comas. Sandy doesn't want his parents to leave the house but the doctor says they have to go to a hospital.Sandy finds out that the house that neighbors the Eclipse is called Walnut Manor and is a loony-bin. Sandy decides to send his parents, the cook, and Attila there but also hires an extra nurse named Sunnie. Bart and Bernie are furious when they find out that Horatio is still alive, even though incapacitated at the moment, and Sandy is still alive and kicking. They try to make another attempt on Sandy's life but with the help of his loyal butler, the nurse Sunnie, and the inmates from Walnut Manor, Sandy will try his best to send those creeps to jail."},{"Title":"Love Among the Walnuts: or, How I Saved My Family from Being Poisoned","review":"Wow, Jean Ferris must have some imagination!

Because of his great amounts of money, his two brothers bond in mutual envy. They bring a poisonous cake to dinner one night, and Horatio and his wife Mousey fall into comas. (So does their pet chicken, the subject of many experiments.) Lucky for Mousey and Horatio, their son is there to save the day. If he only knew what to do next. Mousey and Horatio are forced to recieve medicial care, so they are transfered to Walnut Manor, the \\"loony bin\\" next door. With the help of his crazy butler, and the not-quite-right residents of Walnut Manor, Sandy eventually saves the day.The book was hilarious and very compelling.

I can't wait to read another book by this obviously fantastic author!"},{"Title":"Love Among the Walnuts: or, How I Saved My Family from Being Poisoned","review":"Love Among the Walnuts was a book I was assigned to read for the summer. It didn't sound very appealing at first, seeing as how there was a chicken on the cover and the main character was a boy named Sandy. But after I started reading it, you'd need to pry the book from my hands with a wrench to get me to stop. The story was hilarious! It's about a boy named Sandy whose parents and pet chicken have fallen into comas. He sends them to a \\"loony bin\\" called Walnut Manor. There, he meets a whole bunch of wacky patients including the \\"cat molester\\", and Everet, who only speaks in other people's quotes. He also meets Sunnie, the nurse, who he is very attracted to.I think that both girls and boys will laugh out loud at this book. Boys will find the wacky patients to be downright hilarious. Girls will think so, too, but they might also laugh at the love that Sandy has for Sunnie. I, being a girl, thought of Sandy as the guy I loved to hate. He would never admit that he liked Sunnie and his approach was all wrong. Most girls will love that.I'd give this book ten stars if I could. It was amazingly written and very funny. Everyone will like this story in one way or another."},{"Title":"Love Among the Walnuts: or, How I Saved My Family from Being Poisoned","review":"This book came to me by a friend who said it was very good.

I evan read it again wich is something I almost never do. The Walnuts helped me to relize what a great life I had, but made it fun to do.

The book is a wonderful mix of surprises and predictability and certainly doesn't follow any formulas. There are many lessons to be learned in this book- some small, others weightier but to me the most important one was that everyone is worthy of a little time and attention. A wonderful choice for book discussions and certainly one moms will want to read after their children are through!

It is a book I will read again and force it all my friends."},{"Title":"Love Among the Walnuts: or, How I Saved My Family from Being Poisoned","review":"This book ought to be a movie, it's so much fun to read. It's got rich folks, poor folks, kids who don't do drugs, true love, lunatics in the asylum next door who are saner than most of the folks in Washington DC. It's got intrigue, bad guys (who are after the money), funny lines and touching characters. If it were a movie, it would be Awakenings Meets Groucho Marx. Great for kids ten to thirteen.

A very warm-hearted story with humor, adventure, and suspense all in one cover. Great imagination!"},{"Title":"Love Among the Walnuts: or, How I Saved My Family from Being Poisoned","review":"This was another one of my recent reads that had me underwhelmed. I wasn't a fan of the writing to begin with--I felt that it was trying much too hard to be whimsical and this was overly obvious. It gets better as the plot progresses, but the plot is pretty weak, predictable, and boring. I felt like it was in great need of plot twists and funny situations, instead of just ironically \\"funny\\" narration. Now, don't get me wrong, some of the whimsy was hilarious. The character's names were clever and really fun to track. I just don't know, though. If you're in the mood for whimsy, I would strongly recommend Ferris's other books, Once Upon A Marigold and Twice Upon a Marigold. This was more morbid, darker humor, reminding me a times of Pushing Daisies (but really not as funny). I just kept trying to look past the plot, theorizing that there'd be a twist in relation to the characters, the location, the mystery, whatever, and nothing really surfaced. I did enjoy watching the relationship between Sandy and Sunnie progress, but even that felt drastically drawn out (but maybe that's what made it so cute!). All in all, not the greatest book, but there are definitely worse.Rating: 3/5"},{"Title":"Love Among the Walnuts: or, How I Saved My Family from Being Poisoned","review":"It was a great plot, lots of great, lovable characters, and amazing writing. I won't go into the plot (as others already have) but I will say that it was a great book and I will definatly be reading more Jean Ferris from here on!"},{"Title":"Love Among the Walnuts: or, How I Saved My Family from Being Poisoned","review":"Love among the walnuts by Jean Ferris is a book that starts out with the main characters father Horatio who is a multi-millionaire who meats a lady named mousey and they go off and build a big and beautiful house for themselves. But nothing can be as perfect as it seams for them because Horatio has two brothers, Bart and Bernie who all there lives have been greedy and jealous of Horatio's huge fortune. Eventually Horatio and Mousey have a boy. His name is Sandie. He is very smart and creative much like his father. But when Bart and Bernie start Scheming the fortune could end up in the wrong hands.I would advise you to get this book because there is always different and exiting plot twists.I liked it because in all the summaries I read before getting it just talked about the main character Sandie and when I started reading about a guy named Horatio I really wanted to find out when on earth is the main character I have been reading about is going to come in and I think any book that can keep someone reading especially in the beginning has to be a fantastic read."},{"Title":"Love Among the Walnuts: or, How I Saved My Family from Being Poisoned","review":"This book was a double-edged sword for me. The characters and their situations were so very interesting. The writing was wonderful too. I loved so much about it but the plot left me wanting something more.Sandy is the son of one of the richest men in the world. His parents moved to a large estate in the country before he was born and Sandy's never known much about the outside world. But then his uncles try to kill his parents but only succeed in sending them and the butler's wife into a coma.Sandy with the help of his newfound love interest, the nurse Sunnie, has to move his parents into the asylum next door. That is when the fun really begins. As Sunnie spreads her sunshine to every patient at Walnut Manor, Sandy learns about the world through this interesting band of misfits. Here I have to repeat, the characters and the dialog were great. Each and every character was endearing in their own way. It's just that with the exception of some elements, the story itself was predictable with love conquering all in the end.I think this book would appeal more to grownups than kids. The editorial review that compares this book to Holes is not accurate, in my opinion. This is a character-centric book like Holes but this story is more about the family and love relationships of each character than the solving of an intricate mystery with many intertwining plots.I recommend this book to older teens and even grownups looking for a quirky story with a bit of romance. There are lots of wonderful life lessons in this one. Kids looking for a mystery (as the subtitle -\\" or, How I Saved My Family from Being Poisoned\\" almost promises) should steer clear."},{"Title":"Love Among the Walnuts: or, How I Saved My Family from Being Poisoned","review":"Wow!

The theme ofthis book starts out in the city with a man named Horatio Alger Huntington-Ackerman. Then thebook ends up in the country where Horatio had married a women named Mousey Malone. Thelived in a huge house they built 40 miles away from Jupiter city. So you think this is a happystory well your in for a treat this happy story turns into a suspense drama about twenty yearsafter Horatio and Mousey moved to their house. Yes the word Walnuts is for the mental hospitalcalled the Walnut Manor that is 1 mile away from the eclipse (that's what Horatio and Mouseycalled it).The first thing I would like to say that this was a enjoying book. My reason is that I likedhow the author gave each character such character. In the book she put so much description andenthusiasm in her characters. I find that each character has a huge part in this book.The genre of this adventure/ romance/ and Drama. What I liked about books writing styleis how the author kept you up and ready for the next part that's what I enjoyed mostly about thebook. Her writing also gives you clues and in the end gives the answers part by part. Theauthor's voice is calm and surprising and I mean that by how she writes this story. Some quotes Iwould like to share with you are \\"It's rather toughing\\" and \\" Isn't that sweet\\". I chose thesequotes for the reason to show how the author portrays her characters andshows the love between the characters them selves.Well how I felt about this book is that it was a very calm, easy and soothing book with alittle excitement.

It provides the necessary detailed visual steps from start to finish of how to draw an animal, instead of the usual 2 step process we were finding in other drawing books. I came to the internet, to this site to try and find additional books because my daughter loves this book so much.

Her model makes such sense and takes the cue from nature where all colors originate. I use this model now with clients (stylebymichele.com) and find they grasp the concept easier when creating their wardrobes and personal space.

I didn't find it here."},{"Title":"More Alive With Color: Personal Colors - Personal Style (Capital Lifestyles)","review":"This latest entry in the color for people books written over the years is without a doubt the easiest and most sensible to date. The author divides colors into sunrise, sunset and sunlight groups with an additional group of neutral colors including black, gray, navy, true red, sunny yellow, khaki and several more that go with all three color families. The advantage of this method is that there are both warm and cool shades in all three of her divisions - instead of a regimented cool only for certain complexions and warm only for other complexions as was the case with the seasons method of color management. She is also much more supportive of using colors that are \\"outside\\" your color family and explains how to make a color choice from outside your color family work with your complexion and correct color family.In the book she extensively covers everything from clothes to accessories to makeup to hair color choices for women and as well - includes a very helpful section for men in which she makes recommendations that are realistic for the average non-metrosexual guy as well as being useful for a very fashion concious and elegant gentleman.Included in the book are tear-out pages for each color group and for the neutral family making it extremely easy to choose flattering colors that coordinate with your complexion and existing wardrobe.The best thing about this book is it not only beautifully takes into consideration coloring to choose correct colors - it also takes into consideration personality - and allows one to choose colors that both look beautiful on and make you feel wonderful! No more choosing colors you don't like because they are the correct warm or cool shade! Anyone can wear pink, blue, green, purple, red, brown, - or whatever color you choose - as every color group has shades of every color in it! No longer are you told you cannot wear black as if it isn't your season!

The book is easy to understand and the layout is very pleasing and attractive. The suggested color combinations and photographs included are very effective-what I've always expected in a book dealing with such a visual topic but have rarely found.The only reason I rate the book a \\"4\\" instead of a \\"5\\" is because some of the sections, the men's section for example, are too brief and really just touch on the concept outlined.A worthwhile investment for up-to-date information regarding color and preparing a pleasing wardrobe."},{"Title":"More Alive With Color: Personal Colors - Personal Style (Capital Lifestyles)","review":"I purchased this book because I \\"love\\" color. I devoured the old Color Me Beautiful books years ago and hoped this would be an updated look at colors.I was disappointed in every way. There is no \\"meat\\" to this book at all. The criteria for choosing your colors are pedestrian at best. The first three questions are: Which colors do you like best - stated in three different ways. There are no examples of people in your color family and by their criteria I could easily fit into two of the groups and with very little stretch...the third.It's a very short book and the ideas are never fully supported. It could have been expanded and made much better. Save your money on this one. I'm keeping it...so I guess that says something, but there's better stuff available.The only plus is they reference Pantone colors for each of the swatches so that you can get an actual, correct color (IF you own a color fan, which I do &lt;grin> BUT unless you are in a job that utilizes it, the average person would not have access to nor choose to purchase this pricey piece of goods.)If you are buying this to help you with a new wardrobe, save your money and go for the old CMB."},{"Title":"More Alive With Color: Personal Colors - Personal Style (Capital Lifestyles)","review":"This is an updated version of the author's previous book called \\"Alive with Color\\" and it was helpful for me.I was born a sunrise with white skin and dark hair but had my hair colored with blonde streaks on lighter brown hair recently.

My signature color scheme would be a beige and brown jacket to go with my streaked hair and a teal shirt to go with my hazel eyes and something as an accent in rose (or even rose blush and lipstick) to pick up my rosy light skin.I have really enjoyed the tips in the book for looking your best but I only rated it a 4 because it was based on the author's previous book."},{"Title":"More Alive With Color: Personal Colors - Personal Style (Capital Lifestyles)","review":"I rate this book high, because I found it to be a refreshing change from the cookie-cutter \\"Color Me Beautiful\\" formula.

Of course it's easy: Eiseman's basic advice is, \\"If you're not a Sunrise or a Sunset, you're a Sunlight.\\" This slap-dash, half-baked method makes sure you can categorize yourself, as long as you don't mind wearing colors that look hideous on you. Eiseman's method is just as limited as that of her primary target, Carole Jackson, the author of the original, \\"seasonal\\" color system, \\"Color Me Beautiful\\".While some of us may look gorgeous in some warm and some cool colors, that is not true for all of us. When I wear the \\"fruit\\" colors (with the correspondingly toned makeup) that Eiseman claims will look so great on me, people (usually men) ask me if I'm feeling ill. Follow the advice in this book, and you may make some costly fashion blunders.Many reviewers have mentioned the gorgeous photos in this book, and they're absolutely right; the book itself is stunning. But, if you want more than pretty pictures, look elsewhere. For the best advice on color, I'd suggest \\"Color Me Beautiful's Looking Your Best\\" by Mary Spillane and Christine Sherlock. The pictures may be outdated, the swatches unhelpful. But as long as you have the name of your expanded season, you can do an Internet search, and find places to buy fabric swatches from the expanded CMB system.Leave \\"More Alive With Color\\" on the coffee table!"},{"Title":"More Alive With Color: Personal Colors - Personal Style (Capital Lifestyles)","review":"Leatrice Eiseman is a color consultant who has developed her own original 'color clock', explored in depth here in MORE ALIVE WITH COLOR: PERSONAL COLORS-PERSONAL STYLE.

I was thrilled to even find it since it was printed in 1950. It is exactly as described by the seller's meticulous detail. It came quickly. It was .wrapped carefully. the peanut butter cookie recipe is a favorite."},{"Title":"Paul Envoy Extraordinary","review":"I ordered this book when two bits of interest came together. 1. Reading the book of Acts in the New Testament interested me in the journeys of St. Paul; 2., Muggeridge is one of my favorite authors and I was looking for more to read by him. As with many Mugg books, various editions appeared on both sides of the Atlantic. The hardback is filled with photos from the BBC television show this book came from. However, I read the pocket mass market paperback UK edition put out by Fount Books, which is limited to a few black and white maps.The premise of the book is rather unique. Muggeridge and his friend, Alec Vidler, an Anglican (Church of England) clergyman, spent two months following the three missionary journeys of St. Paul as recorded in the book of Acts. The book is a dialogue between them as they reach and ruminate at various historic locations in the holy land.If that sounds tedious, it is somewhat. But both of them have done their homework, and banter back and forth a bit in Mugg's lovable style and with insights from Vidler. Having no sense of the area at all, I found the entire thing illuminating. The book doesn't sparkle with Mugg's inimitable prose, as the brief back and forth format gives him no chance to get going as he does in his essays and autobiography. That said, they make what seems like an impossible task doable.Mugg opens the book with a sixteen page introduction in the form of a letter to Vidler, a sort of vulnerable writing style that most authors wouldn't choose for a book like that. Vidler writes the epilogue, and talks a bit about St. Paul's ideas about justification by faith (\\"for by grace you have been saved through faith\\" as he puts it in Ephesians. He also touches on the difference between his and Mugg's personalities: Vidler tentative at best, as he himself admits, Mugg rushing in where angels fear to tread. Yet the two of them fast friends and, one would say, ideal traveling companions in the footsteps of St. Paul.The book is very British, one of the things we like about reading Mugg. Footnotes citing verses from Acts, Galatians, Corinthians and elsewhere in the New Testament make nice jumping off points to read a bit more. Like many tentative Brit scholars, Vidler won't come right out and say St. Luke wrote Acts, although most of us read it simply as the Gospel of Luke, Part Two. In the epilogue, he also says that Galatians gives a better account of St. Paul's travels (penned by Paul) than does Acts, despite the fact that Acts forms a guidebook for much of their travels. That said, Vidler is quite evangelical for a British clergyman, as opposed to the self-proclaimed skeptics that generate so much press in the states.Fans of the dear departed Mugg may want to read this book as we can't get enough of him. I find myself rereading the old articles from Esquire collected in The Most of Malcolm MuggeridgeThe Most of Malcolm Muggeridgeand just got a used copy of Things PastThings past. His autobiography, Chronicles of Wasted Time, I think, remains his stunning success, as he maintains throughout the light tone promised in the title (this was originally two volumes, here combined into one)Chronicles of Wasted Time. Anyone who wonders about the places of the New Testament may prefer the illustrated hardback, as might people who like mapsPaul: Envoy ExtraordinarySome scenes of the area also appear as locales in another European Mugg TV show,MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE."},{"Title":"Dear Big, Mean, Ugly Monster","review":"First off, I should mention that I was contacted many months ago by the publisher to endorse this book. Having said that, I never endorse anything that I don't honestly feel is worth it. But this is a very charming and smart book that tackles a specific concept without talking down to children or using text that will make their parents gag. Before making books of my own, I worked for 7 years for a children's bookstore, so I've seen the good, the bad and everything inbetween. This book sits high on the list.Since Amazon doesn't have a proper description of the book, I'll provide my own. Joe is hesitant to go to bed every night, because he is convinced that there is a monster under his bed. He's developed an entire ritual for bedtime based on his going to bed safely. One day, however, empowered by a message he's learned from \\"The Billy Goats Gruff,\\" he's decided to confront the situation head on and begins writing letters to the monster. To his surprise, he's finding letters written back to him FROM the monster upon waking. It is this daily correspondence between the two that I think makes this book a unique way to tell a story with both realism and humor.Child and Family Press used a small portion of my endorsement (which, by the way, is unpaid) on the inside front flap of the book. Here it is in it's entirety. Buy this book. It's a very nice Halloween treat as well.\\"Reminiscent of Emberly's \\"Go Away, Big Green Monster,\\" Parish and Simonts \\"No More Monsters for Me!' and - dare I say it - Sendak's \\"Where the Wild Things Are,\\" Berglin and Dirocco's \\"Dear Big, Mean, Ugly Monster\\" offers us a tale of bravery in the dark that has a charm, innocence, and humor that remains uniquely their own. Good stuff!\\""},{"Title":"Dear Big, Mean, Ugly Monster","review":"Illustrated by Carl DiRocco, Dear Big, Mean, Ugly Monster is a lighthearted story by Ruth Marie Berglin especially for young readers who feel nervous about what might be lurking under their bed. An ordinary young boy is terribly frightened of the monster under his bed; he hears its claws and fangs scraping long into the night. Even the Monster Spray his mother made or his new flashlight can't drive it away. But when he decides he's tired of being afraid, he writes a letter to the monster telling it exactly how he feels. Then amazingly, he gets a reply - from SAM, the Sorta Average Monster living under his bed! A timeless tale about the importance of not being ruled by one's fears, with the moral that friendships can turn up in the most unlikely places."},{"Title":"Dear Big, Mean, Ugly Monster","review":"This is a great children's book which can be a tool for relationship development - as well, of course, a great story to relieve nighttime worries of who is living under the bed! I've given this book to several grandma teachers and they love what can be developed."},{"Title":"Dear Big, Mean, Ugly Monster","review":"So many things make this a fantastic book. The author's choice of words --risky, bloodthirsty, shaking with fear, hesitantly -- is perfect for my children's expanding vocabulary. Also wonderful is her reference to \\"The Three Billy Goats Gruff\\" as a source of inspiration for Joe. Joe and the monster both love reading. Joe uses exclamation points in his letters because he wants his words to be shouted. The pictures are expressive and colorful too.My two year old son loves this book. He hated to return it to the library! We finally bought him his own copy."},{"Title":"Dear Big, Mean, Ugly Monster","review":"Both of my daughters and I loved this book. What a wonderful, original way of dealing with the problem of monsters under the bed. As a parent, I too tried giving my children \\"monster spray\\" to get rid of monsters but just like the boy in this book, my children felt that since I first said there was no such thing as monster and then gave them spray to get rid of the monsters - how could they be sure the spray would actually work.The idea of the letters was excellent and I loved when the monster accuses the little boy of being mean because he ate monster cookies - well every letter was just hilarous and the end was great too.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The origin of continents and oceans","review":"I was looking through my little library of geology books and happened upon a 1966 paperback Dover Edition of a translation of Alfred Wegener's \\"The Origin of Continents and Oceans.\\" I bought it new. How long ago? Well, let's put it this way, the price on it is $2.25. It's now a classic book. I was wondering if a new printing might be still available, and I found that the same book is still sold on Amazon and I'm amazed at the asking prices.As scientific literature, this book is so outdated as to be almost worthless. However, it's an astonishing expression of ideas regarding continental drift (and, indirectly, plate tectonics) that was at least 40 years ahead of the acceptance of this monumental scientific revolution in thought and, as such, is a classic in the development of scientific thinking. Alfred Wegener was a giant in the Earth Sciences! The ideas expressed are stunningly modern, and totally out of date at the same time. But, it's an absolutely fascinating book to look over and I'm delighted to have it as a part of my library. Perhaps I might add that I'm a geology professor and I teach about plate tectonics and continental drift in all my classes. I always pay homage to Alfred Wegener's early 20th century work.Gary Peterson"},{"Title":"The origin of continents and oceans","review":"I bought this for my husband & he has raved about it. It is something I am looking forward to reading after he is done."},{"Title":"The origin of continents and oceans","review":"Alfred Wegener (1880-1930) was a German scientist, geophysicist, and meteorologist, most known for his theory of continental drift.He states in the Historical Introduction, that \\"The first concept of continental drift first came to me as far back as 1910, when considering the map of the world, under the direct impression produced by the congruence of the coastlines on either side of the Atlantic. At first I did not pay attention to the idea because I regarded it as improbable. In the fall of 1911 ... I undertook a cursory examination of relevant research in the fields of geology and paleontology, and this provided immediately such weighty corroboration in my mind.\\"He writes, \\"Paleontologists ... have come again and again to the conclusion that the majority of those continents which are now separated by broad stretches of ocean must have had land bridges in prehistoric times and that across these bridges undisturbed interchange of terrestrial fauna and flora took place. The paleontologist deduces this from the occurrence of numerous identical species that are known to have lived in many different places, while it appears inconceivable that they should have originated simultaneously in these areas.\\"He rejects the idea of \\"sunken continents\\" such as Atlantis and Lemuria: \\"Where the ocean basins are involved, it is not a question whether drift theory or the theory of sunken continents is to be preferred, because the latter idea just does not come into the picture.\\"He states, \\"I must confess, however, that it is difficult to see how anyone can seriously assume today that the equatorial bulge could have kept its position unchanged, as though the earth were absolutely solid.\\" He summarizes, \\"The forces which displace continents are the same as those which produce great fold-mountain ranges. Continental drift, faults and compressions, earthquakes, volcanicity, transgression cycles and polar wandering are undoubtedly connected on a grand scale. Their common intensification in certain periods of the earth's history shows this to be true.\\""},{"Title":"The origin of continents and oceans","review":"Used amazon cause couldnt get what i wanted, arrived as said, and just spent $500 on more stuff for studying where it would have cost over twice as much, Could this be the biggest on-line selling site?

If you are a mathematics major, you might also want to consider this book. That being said, the theories expressed in this book are truely phenomenal. Anyone with an interest or background in transactions cost economic theory will be both at an advantage, and will have a deep appreciation for the contents of this book.This book comes in two halves. The first deals with situations where an individual has limited information, and derives some generalised theories about how individuals choose actions to obtain a probability density function of alternatives (since outcomes are not fully known). The second half of this book deals with situations where an agent can partake in information gathering activities to reduce the risk involved in the action-consequence connection.This is a tough book, not for the faint of heart. But it is an incredibly worthwhile book. And as I said earlier, a background in economics (or *possibly* mathematics) is essential.

I had a brand new car, a little money, and a lot of time. I found this book while browsing and bought it to take it on my vacation. Each night, I selected a different trip for the next day, highlighted the route, and studied the points of interest I'd be most interested in taking. This small amount of planning gave me great confidence to strike out alone on my vacation.One year ago, I took a similar vacation, this time with a very special friend. We repeated some of my favorite trips of the previous year and we planned a few new ones. Again, we would spend the evening marking maps and studying points of interest.&quot;Roaming the Backroads&quot; was so useful on these two trips because the author gave maps, historical information and points of interest along the way. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to explore Northern California and who wants to get off the major highways to do it. Now the book lives on my coffee table and we still pick it up to plan a day trip or to remind ourselves of the pleasures of past trips."},{"Title":"Day Trips: Roaming the Backroads of Northern California","review":"This is a pretty good book for finding interesting off-the-beaten-path places, but the title is very misleading. To me, \\"Northern California\\" means San Francisco to the Oregon state line. In fact, all of the tours are clustered around San Francisco or Sacramento. There's nothing north of Stewart's Point, which leaves a gap of almost two hundred miles to the Oregon state line. If the title had been more accurate, I probably would not have bought the book, since I was most interested in areas north of San Francisco."},{"Title":"Day Trips: Roaming the Backroads of Northern California","review":"This book is so old it's more like a history book than a guide book. I don't think the Bay Area looks like this anymore. Fortunately, I'm a historical buff and a big fan of old photographs, so I enjoy looking it over."},{"Title":"Gay men & women who enriched the world","review":"I have found this book to be very enjoyable, but it should in no way be considered light reading. There are many famous and infamous women and men portrayed, the most notable of whom include Plato, Alexander the Great, Da Vinci, Byron, Tchaikovsky, Gertrude Stein, Bessie Smith, Tennessee Williams, Andy Warhol, Rudolf Nureyev and 36 others. Tom Cowan does a wonderful job of removing these characters from their history books and humanizing them. In many instances these are people my friends and I learned about in school and often the exclamation \\"S/He was gay? You're kidding me! I never knew that!\\" is heard from them in reference to this book. It can also be a wonderful tool in the right cases, (i.e. providing a different perspective perfect for a paper or a hero for a child) often shedding new insight into the lives of these truly great people. As Cowan states in the introduction, \\"Confronting and accepting the value of one's gay identity, in spite of the efforts of society to deny the worth of gay people, can provide the basis for the strength and self-confidence needed to leave one's personal mark on the world.\\" I consider myself to be a person who has great plans to leave a mark of my own before I go and as such I find this book to be a most wonderful collection of role models in whose footsteps I may one day follow."},{"Title":"Gay men & women who enriched the world","review":"It's a very interesting book not only for the gay people but also bisexual/heterosexual inclined people.But, ther're at least three weak points.1. The author didn't write each story's sources at all.2. The title is not suitable for the contents or substance. It should be changed to \\" Gay Men and Women who enriched the Western World \\", because except Mishima Yukio all personalities belong to so-called \\" the westerners \\".3. So many absences of important people such as Socrates, Anacreon, Julius Caesar, Vergilius, Hadrianus, etc."},{"Title":"Gay men & women who enriched the world","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it is well-written, and I certainly enjoyed Cowan's earlier book on shamanism. However, I am a student of the life of Desiderius Erasmus and I bought the book to examine Cowan's evidence on Erasmus' purported homosexuality. I was deeply disappointed to discover that Cowan's research on this matter was skimpy. It appears to be little more than a recitation of some earlier, equally poorly researched works. Cowan does not include some important material from the readily available Collected Works of Erasmus. Either he never bothered to do this small bit of primary research, or he deliberately suppressed some of the information to be found there. I suspect the former, because there is also some supporting information in CWE Volume 1 that he never cited.I suppose I could recommend this book to a gay man with serious self-esteem problems, but for most people, the factual errors in this book deter me from recommending it."},{"Title":"The Hemmings Motor News Book of Mustangs","review":"Contrary to the online &quot;Book Description&quot;, this book has virtually no reference to 71' to 73' Mustangs. In fact, I could only find two meager references to 71' to 73's - one sentence near the back of the book about the design change from 1970, and a few lines stating total production figures. Anyone looking for a book on 71' to 73' Mustangs will be very disappionted with this book."},{"Title":"Explosives and bomb disposal guide,","review":"This book, in the 70's, was probably a restricted text.

This book was used in many classes on Bomb Disposal Training and is written in a manner that lends itself to a clear and quick understanding of the subject. While it is certainly dated (1965), and things have greatly advanced, the weapons and methods described are still applicable today. Anyone who needs to become proficient in this subject already knows that such books are just one of the tools to development of ability. Like any other skill it requires repetitive training under watchful and experienced eyes. This classic should be read by anyone who must confront this terror. You cannot learn too much and this voice from the past is invaluable. In conjunction with other useful texts such as Explosives and Homemade Bombs by Stoffel, Explosives Engineering by Cooper and Bombs and Bombing by Brodie this book has a valuable place. The training classes will of course have their own particular materials.Review continues:One of the best.

He had a career in aviation as a pilot and owner of a flight school. He trained World War II pilots. Blackburn's real interest, however, was exploring consciousness.Blackburn was a member of the Theosophical Society from 1934 to 1944 and immersed himself in the study of auras, spiritual evolution, reincarnation, karma, kundalini. However, a conversation with Jiddhu Krishnamurti led to the falling apart of Blackburn's psychological world and his entrance into the world of nonduality or Now-Consciousness. The conversation is recounted early in the book, the turning point being Krishnamurti's questioning of whether Blackburn's beliefs were true.The rest of the book develops the teaching of Now-Consciousness, about which Blackburn writes, \\"[Now-Consciousness] is a nondualistic state in which the idea of the I and not-I does not exist.\\" He says it is the process of the mind coming to know itself.The book consists of five essays written between 1944 and 1982. Each essay addresses Now-Consciousness from its own angle: from initiation into Now-Consciousness, from the psychology of Now-Consciousness, from a practical approach involving attention to thoughts, and through bold confessions.Besides Now-Consciousness, here are the other major themes, each treated in different ways throughout the book:Intelligence. Also known as awareness, consciousness, the Tao, or truth. Blackburn says, \\"Because intelligence is real, it can only be found through the negative approach. In discovering what is not, truth is perceived.\\"Not-knowing. He writes, \\"Be in the moment of questioning, so awake, so aware that you realize you don't know.\\"Time. \\"This idea of time gives rise to the false ideas of postponement, spiritual growth, progress, a Savior, Gurus, the Path, and reincarnation as the ultimate postponement. These are given as excuses for our own inadequacy, in not being able to follow one thing directly to the end.\\"The I-process. The I is the ego, the world we've created about ourselves that causes us suffering. It's that way we are that we know isn't our true self. Blackburn identifies several steps in this process of generating and sustaining the false self and shows how we cut ourselves off from intelligence or truth.The Cycle of Perception. In watching the I-process we find that there is a magic moment before associating a perception with habits, memories, and conditioning. The ability to access this magic moment is now-consciousness and it unfolds in stages that Blackburn calls the Cycle of Perception.Blackburn says, \\"The first thing is to become aware of what the mind is occupied with, its patterned thoughts, habits, and reactions. ... Slowly you come into the cycle of perception or Now-Consciousness. And the oftener this state is experienced, the more you realize it is true life.\\"Blackburn fits right into the current world of nonduality. He stood alone and encouraged others to do so. Although he acknowledges his teacher Jiddhu Krishnamurti, Blackburn claimed that his teachings were his own. As his own authority in these teachings, he was straightforward and eschewed the guru role and even the teacher role. He went where he was invited and held dialogues. He didn't give talks, as such. These travels took him and his wife through the U.S., Canada, and Europe.Blackburn is also the author of Worlds Beyond Thought: Conversations on Now-Consciousness, which is also available as a series audio cassette tapes. Though his books and audios are not widely distributed or known in the Internet era of the last 15 years, they are still in print and distributed by his wife Gabriele through IdylWildBooks at reasonable cost.The Table of Contents is spare, however the topic and themes of each section and chapter are stated clearly. There is no index which would have been very useful in a book such as this where each main theme is scattered throughout the book. A proper index would gather and make sense of all those appearances.I highly recommend this book for anyone exploring nondual spirituality or nondual psychotherapy. It is clear, simple, and straightforward enough to enhance your understanding of how we get lost in our beliefs, memories, thoughts, our words, and conditionings. He points to the \\"magic moment\\" when, instead of getting lost in imaginings of how we think things are, we turn instead to Now-Consciousness and get directly to the point and through to the end of whatever we are considering. That is, we learn to deal directly and fully with stressful situations and move on."},{"Title":"Now Consciousness: Exploring the World Beyond Thought","review":"I have known the guy personally and have had first hand experience of what he really wanted to convey to people. I have read this book many times and have found new stuff to think about and digest each time. The book is full of plain information on what the author calls &quot;now consciousness&quot;. It is about living in the present moment. If you're into mystical rituals, acrobatics and such this book is not for you. It looks to simple to be true, yet it is profound."},{"Title":"Galileo Lessons","review":"In this 32 page booklet available for $3 from the Real View Books website, Dr. Jaki discusses the legends and lessons surrounding the fate of Galileo. The fundamental lesson lies in rendering what is due to quantities and what is due to everything else (p. 25). Indeed some in the church realised this long before Galileo's trial:\`It is my misfortune to have to answer for all the stupidities which some of the thirty or forty thousand of my brethren in religion may and actually do commit' (p.11) Such was the apology given by the Master General of the Dominicans in 1615 to Galileo for the accusations of Fr. Tommaso Caccini that the \\"Galileans\\" had subverted the meaning of the bible.However, Galileo's case is a lesson not just for churchmen but for scientists and philosophers also. Jaki notes that the mathematical formalism of the heliocentric system did not form an absolutely demonstrative proof, since the connection between calculation and reality is provided by something called philosophy and not physics. (p. 23)The difficulty for science consists in its profound need for ontology in order to tie quantitative correlations to real things. The difficulty for the Church, whose message is essentially ontological about a natural reality with a supernatural destiny, is the inability of ontology to say anything quantatitive about things physical. This holds true even of the bible. Overstepping these boundaries lies at the root of all real and imagined opposition between science and theology (p. 24).On the whole, the Catholic Church has learned its lesson and wisely kept silent on the controversy of Darwinism. Galileo's witness should remind those advocating new attempts of concordism - particularly The Anthropic Principle and Intelligent Design theory -- that they create more harm than good.Jaki concludes that a more worrying Galileo case looms large; this time for scientists who claim that projects that are \`technically sweet' should proceed unfettered by \`old fashioned' moral precepts.

The Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle, and Dangerous Fortune stand out as by far his best. Triple is interesting, but not nearly the suspense, drama or richly developed characters of Follett's best... not worth a read in my opinion."},{"Title":"The works of Alexandre Dumas","review":"This Delphi, Kindle ebook edition provides great content (familiar favorites, difficult-to-locate titles, and some items new to me) all well-formatted and at a great price. Of course, as is true with most large Delphi sets, this eats up a WHOLE LOT of Kindle memory, but I don't mind it quite so much in this instance because this one isn't padded with as much \\"supplementary\\" materials as some other Delphi collections; MOST of what you get here is by Dumas, and it's all in English (unlike the Delphi Jules Verne set). Of course the translations are mid-19th century (and public domain). While newer ones would be nice (but would render the set unaffordable), these older ones impart a quaint charm and are the ones most of us have read and enjoyed in the past. Dumas wrote so very much, there's virtually no way a set like this could ever truly be complete--and it is not. In addition to those few titles not yet translated into English, there are other, significant Dumas novels that appear (in English) in old, multi-volume print sets which I suppose have not yet been properly transcribed from printed book to ebook format. (I say \\"properly\\"because other Dumas titles ARE available via at least one major university's free ebook site but in horrible, atrociously scanned, uncorrected versions that are not a pleasure to decipher.) For example, I would like to have ebook versions of \\"The Two Dianas,\\" \\"The Page of the Duke of Savoy,\\" \\"Andre de Taverney,\\" \\"The Son of Porthos,\\" \\"The Countess of Monte Cristo,\\" \\"The Women's War,\\" \\"The Whites and the Blues,\\" and the full-verson \\"La Dame de Monsoreau\\" (rather than its abridged form, \\"Chicot the Jester\\" which is in this set). And rather than a revision of this already huge and quite well-done volume to include these and others, why not issue a 2nd volume of Dumas. His tremendous output certainly warrants it. Nevertheless, this is still a very generous assortment and the largest ebook collection of Dumas available at the moment. And the inclusion of the complete, 2-volume \\"Joseph Balsamo, Memoirs of a Physician\\" alone makes this set worthwhile as far as I'm concerned, let alone the equally wonderful \\"Chevalier de Maison-Rouge\\" and so very many others. This Delphi Kindle set is just about perfect, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants to read the best in historical fiction by a master of the genre."},{"Title":"The works of Alexandre Dumas","review":"I love reading Alexander Dumas. Many people seen Three Musketeers and Count of Monte Cristo. But I have yet to find someone who read the skillfull writings of Master writer Alexander Dumas.

You can believe the things that happen to his characters can happen to you. The Count of Monte Christo is one of my favorite stories."},{"Title":"The works of Alexandre Dumas","review":"Dumas is a very interesting author. Most of these books I'd not known about, but am glad that they are available on Kindle.You must realize that this man lived in a totally different world, and many references are obscure and not available in either dictionary. Also, that at this time extensive verbiage was used. However, the stories are by and large, extremely interesting in themselves and also shed light on the politics of that time. In many ways that has not changed and you will find many parallels in our own time.I have certainly enjoyed re-reading my favorites, such as the 3 Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo. However, this is certainly an extensive book and will take many days to finish the entire volume.There are a couple of problems in the Count: continuity is not very reliable in certain parts - missing or misplaced pages, and misspellings (not as intrusive and the former). I have not read the entire volume but look forward to doing so."},{"Title":"Postmodernism and the Enlightenment: New Perspectives in Eighteenth-Century French Intellectual History","review":"The debate over the postmodern, in an excess of false controversy, has put the legacy of the Enlightement at satirical risk, and subjected it to a misleading series of ahistorical slanders. The final verdict should be to find the two eras to be one and the same era, by a concordance of rational skepticisms. This collection of essays, perchance the philosophes to strike back, shows the inevitable reaction to the postmodern turn, with a return to renewed consideration of the original culprit history. We find there the birth of the modern and the postmodern together, witness the scrutiny of rationality in the period condemned for this trait. One should think Rousseau has outsmarted the lot, as he was pre-modern and the first postmodern, and the very one to ignite the modern, as a principal suspect. The problem was never the Enlightenment as much as the mechanized version of its significance. And the irony is that the postmodern gesture will force the question to the surface."},{"Title":"American Catholicism (The Chicago History of American Civilization)","review":"That young Americans know so little history is frequently bemoaned, as if history were a sort of medicine that people should be convinced to take. Perhaps the reason history is not exactly popular is that it brings you right into the difficult complexities of life. Unlike the movies there are not easy good guys and bad guys to identify. This book, by a former professor of mine, counts as history well done. I attended John Tracy Ellis' course on American Catholicism at Catholic University in the eighties. It was a fascinating tour through a complicated subject. I admired greatly, for instance, how Ellis did not hesitate to elucidate on a theme in his book, one of the oddest elements in American Catholic history: the support of many bishops for the institution of slavery. I recall in particular his glosses on sermons given by the then bishop of Charleston, whose support for that execrable institution seemed to pain Ellis in particular because of the knowledge of the influence this man had not only in the Catholic Church of his day but in the wider Southern society of his day. In this Ellis differed somewhat from the general thrust of his book written years before. Perhaps more research had caused a slight modification of his view in the book that Southern Catholics werea minority that assimilated into the wider culture and thus were in a sense victims of it. A perusal of the later literature on the subject confirms that the change that I saw in his glosses in class are in synch with the changing view of historians on the matter. The view now seems to be that Southern Catholics participated actively in what one historian calls \\"white supremacist\\" influencing of the larger Southern culture. This is seen as a change from what is now called the \\"Ellisonian\\" paradigm of American Catholicism. It is now much easierto get information on such topics. But John Tracy Ellis' scholarship still seems impressive in terms of the history of ideas. Unfortunately when I was at Catholic University the library was in such a deplorable state that it had been de-accredited by the accreditation agency for Graduate Studies. Thus making it nearly impossible to do further research when one was stimulated to do it by such an interesting scholar as Ellis."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith, ProPlus Edition","review":"This new &quot;pro&quot; edition of The Complete Metalsmith is everything you would expect it to be. Detailed, accurate, and filled with many useful diagrams. It is a significant improvement over the regular edition in terms of topic depth and scope.The CD includes the full text (searchable pdf) of the pro edition which is very nice to have. It also includes the entire first edition of the Complete Metalsmith AND Practical Jewelry Rendering as scanned pages. The original version is interesting from a historical perspective -- it's amazing to see a handwritten tome of that length.The application &quot;suite&quot; is delivered as an executable Jar file for Macs and PCs or as a standalone executable for PocketPC or Palm. I've only tried it on my desktop PC so far. The tools include various converters, calculators, and lookup tables that automate some of the calculations included in the book. I would think if you carry a palm/pocketpc it might be a nice add-on -- as a desktop tool, the suite is kind of &quot;useless&quot; since you can find most of this stuff on the web already.I wholeheartedly recommend the pro edition of the Complete Metalsmith. Is the CD worth the $15 price difference -- I'd have to say &quot;maybe&quot; which is why I gave *this* edition only 4-stars. The searchable pdf of the pro edition will definitely come in handy. I also will make use of the book on jewelry rendering. I don't expect I'll be able to effectively make use of the toolsuite since I don't have a palm/pocketpc OR a desktop computer anywhere near my jewelry studio."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith, ProPlus Edition","review":"This is a great book, well written & easy to understand, Tim writes in plain, conversational English. A book for people with a good solid basic knowledge on metal manipulation/brazing/construction these people will get the most from it & be inspired by the ideas. If you are new to metals then this book will have Big gaps of assumed knowledge (but it is the Pro Plus Edition!)The spiral binding is not a godsend, it is awkward to use, even harder to close & is leading to burring where the holes in the page for the spiral are.I have not yet checked out the CD, as mine arrived sans CD, however Amazon have been great about it, so it should be in my post box.Why did I pay extra for the CD? Because (and this goes for the book too) what I have learnt MOST in the last few years of metalsmithing is that Everything is more useful than first appearance... the more you do & learn, the more you will find to do & learn from your refference book collection; and the more you will find in books you thought you knew from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith, ProPlus Edition","review":"Fabulous book, I take it everywhere with me and refer to it constantly.I do wish the CD video's were better quality, they are tiny and difficult to see being somewhat pixilated.

So I may have purchased the CD after just for that convenience!So the value of the CD depends whether you really are someone who uses all the features of your PC or not. There is also a design process book on the CD and the original version of the Metalsmith, however both versions are so similar I really don't see why the previous version was included. I feel the extra space would have been put to better use by upgrading the quality of the videos as I really am disappointed in the poor quality videos :-(I do highly recommend the book - purchase the CD only if you think it will be of value to you."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith, ProPlus Edition","review":"12/16/10: Just about 6 months late in reviewing.

I really enjoyed the MANY clear and descriptive pictures showing you the exact form of what is being described.It is more thorough than any other book I've read. They take you step by step, year by year, all the way from the time your child is one day old up until their sixth birthday. They teach you how to help you baby swim under water, dive, blow bubbles, climb out of the pool, float on their back, and more, while thoroughly enjoying every minute of it. By the time they are six they will be able to swim in numerous yards using a perfect crawl stroke. It is anything BUT stressful but rather fun and productive.Just hearing of even one child who has drowned or nearly drowned (and is now brain damaged for the rest of his life) is reason enough for every parent to be serious about teaching their young child to swim. The gift is yours to give. This book will show you how to do so in a fun, easy, beneficial, and productive way.I would enthusiastically recommend it to any parent who has a child under six and would like to give them the beautiful, priceless gift of water safety, enjoyment, increased brain growth and function, and superb physical fitness."},{"Title":"How To Teach Your Baby to Swim: From Birth to Age Six (The Gentle Revolution)","review":"Before my son was born I spent a lot of time researching and reading anything and everything I could get my hands on. I was a life guard and a swimming instructor for all ages and all levels of swimming and this is the best book I found. I read it throughout my pregnancy and began using the techniques with my son after his belly button was fully healed. They worked. The techniques would also work with an older child, though (as my niece would demonstrate).I respectfully disagree with reviews here that say you have to have specific types of tubs to use this book. The techniques can be practiced in any regular tub, which is what I have. A very good video to complement this book is Learn to Swim with Ms. Bea. Many of the techniques described/advocated in this book can be watched in the video.Finally, if you're looking to help your child survive a possible water emergency (as any parent knows, supervision is not perfect no matter how conscientious we are) there is one program that can teach an infant/child how to survive if they fell in the water with no-one around. It is ISR [Infant Swimming Resource [w doubleu w dot infantswim dot com]]. Regular/traditional swim techniques/lessons in and of themselves can't help an infant/toddler with self-rescue because there is a lot to learn and practice before children can learn to rescue themselves at this age. Enrolling my 13 month old in ISR was the best thing I could've done [I didn't find out about ISR until he was almost a year]. My son is now (July 2010) 19 months and with ISR he learned to propel himself under the water, roll onto his back and float when he needs to take a breath/rest, and roll back to swim under water until he reaches me, the shore, the stairs, or the wall. ISR works with children as young as 6 months to 6 years. I'm thankful he can do this even though I always watch him like a hawk in and around the water. It is a gentle program (in spite of some reviews you might read). Sure, he protest-cried during his 10 minute lessons every time, but he also cries to be taken out of the car seat and when he has to get a shot. Now he's less than 2 years old and is a little fish in the water. He has so much fun and I can tell he's so proud of his skills. The ISR lessons were worth every penny.My son still pages through the now wrinkled pages of this book often (he picks it out from his shelf himself!) and watches Ms. Bea's video just for fun (he asks for it!).

It documents human rights violations worldwide, each illustration an uncompromising reality of powermongering getting out of hand. To prove once and for all no place on earth exists without unequity among sex, race, that also conflicts with personal identity under any circumstance, each country tells its own story. The book is 700+ pages in length, perfectly capturing the gruesome conditions of refugee camps(azerbaijan, colombia, palestine, ivory coast,afghanistan,etc.), prison confinement(death row, illegal executions, caged beds in psychiatric institutions, etc.), military occupations and life affected by war damage(kosovo, palestine,rwanda, etc.), scrutinizes relgious and social laws (iran, india, saudi arabia,), political freedom(iraq, korea, usa, kuwait,etc), womyns rights(family, identity, reproductive rights, enfranchisement,etc), child protection and services like healthcare and access to education(italy, czech republic, mali, etc.)- these are only a few areas out of the many that are brought to the attention of the reader. You have to prepare yourself for the terror unleashed within these pages: the painful expressions some carry do not adequately describe the brutalities(in the sense that even though you see it, you can't fathom it), and puts \\"security\\" and our own privacy into question. The vivide photography of the book also demonstrates what individual people can do/have done to counteract these abuses. Very informative and mind boggling- children who look no older than 8 but have the aging lines of a 40 year old manipulated into armed combat or committing war crimes and then getting imprisoned. Women still being treated as property and not recognized as citizens, or much less human beings because of their husband's identity or socio-economic status.

A book not for the faint of heart for the images inside this hardback will no doubt make you realize what kind of a world we live in. For me, this book presents the truth in all of its color and light. Like I said, this book is not for everyone given some of the images shown, but for the human being in all of us, this book is top of my list."},{"Title":"The Face of Human Rights","review":"Bought this for my sister as a birthday present and she loves it! Wouldn't put it down for a few days straight and refers back to it often."},{"Title":"Never Done: A History of American Housework","review":"This book is a history of American housework, covering common household tasks, related equipment, and the people called on to do the work. The main topics of the book include food production and processing, food preparation and the evolution of cookstoves, home heating and lighting, the spread of domestic gas and electricity services, water supplies and plumbing, laundry, weaving and sewing, taking in paying boarders, maids, the scientific housekeeping movement and the birth of home economics, childcare, and consumption as an avocation. The book is amply illustrated with black and white reproductions of period paintings, drawings, and advertisements. In addition to a bibliographic note for further study, there is a section of source notes at the end of the book citing original materials, as well as an index.In reading the acknowledgements of Ruth Schwartz Cowan's book \\"More Work for Mother,\\" I had noted that Strasser was listed there as an undergraduate research assistant of Cowan's. With that in mind, I expected the thesis of this book to be similar to that of Cowan's, especially given the similar titles. However, whereas Cowan's book claimed in an almost contradictory fashion that American women have had to shoulder more and more housework over the last century due to industrialization, Strasser takes the viewpoint that industrialization gradually wore away at the value of the contribution women could add to their households by doing work around house, leading eventually to the necessity of their taking paid work outside the home. Strasser points out that in the pre-industrial period, both men and women worked the land with the goal of being as self-sufficient as possible, but that both men and women engaged in some activities to bring in outside resources or income. For example, some women earned extra income for their families or supported themselves entirely by sewing or doing laundry for others. With the advent of industrialization, these tasks were taken over by machines or factories, and while women were freed from the tasks of having to do their own sewing and laundry by hand, they could also no longer earn an income from sewing or washing clothes for others. At the same time, women became more isolated, since they had been in the habit of doing much of their work, from sewing to laundry, in the company of other women.Whereas Cowan claimed virtually all middle class American households in the late Nineteenth Century had domestic help and that a family's housework was so heavy that it could not be undertaken by one woman working alone, Strasser points out that by studying census records, we find that the vast majority of families did not have live-in maids. In fact, enormous numbers of households included people unrelated to the family- -boarders, making the mistress of the household a kind of professional housekeeper, who undertook the cooking, cleaning and laundry not only for her family, but also for the boarders. In general, Strasser comes across as relying heavily on her research materials for her claims, while Cowan seems more driven by her political agenda.Strasser notes that industrialization simplified many household tasks, from cooking to heating, from dress making to laundry. This enabled women to accomplish more in less time, but rather than reap the benefits of having spare time, she cites time use studies that show that following industrialization, women devoted the same amount of time to their housework, but were able and consequently expected to work towards much higher standards. As if this weren't enough, manufacturers also pushed women to fill their spare housework time by increasing their consumption activities, to take on consumption as a new household task alongside cooking, cleaning and childcare. But since virtually every source of income from women's work in the home had dried up by this point, in order to go along with the drive to consume, women needed to take jobs outside the home to supplement the family income. And that's why their work is never done.A particularly fascinating topic was that of prepared food and its easing of the household task of cooking. Back at the turn of the Twentieth Century, several cooperative housework ventures had been proposed that sought to make the task of food preparation more efficient by having meals cooked in a central kitchen and then delivered rather than each housewife preparing food for her own family. These ventures had generally been started in academic middle and upper class communities, and most, if they got off the ground at all, failed in a year or two. But Strasser points out that the idea of making such household tasks public rather than domestic has actually come to pass, although this fact has not been generally recognized because it has taken an alternative form. Paradoxically, instead of central kitchens catching on as a cooperative housekeeping venture, the success of such kitchens has been in the capitalist world, where mothers and fathers, tired from their long work days at their cash employment, purchase their food ready to eat from fast food establishments, some of which even deliver meals to the front door, just as the early idealists had proposed.Overall, Strasser's book is quite fascinating. Her arguments are very well supported by her extensive research. While I found certain chapters, such as those describing the history of specific household technology more engaging than others, in general the book is very well written and quite comprehensive."},{"Title":"Never Done: A History of American Housework","review":"A dry but thorough history of American housework from the Herculean tasks of colonial days to the consumerist present which ties in broader factors of social trends, economics, and technological advances. Through substantial research and appropriate illustrations, the book documents well the massive, though little noted revolution in the management of the American home over the last 200 years.The author's interest in the history of American housework traces back to a 1968 undergraduate thesis later expanded to a Ph.D. thesis. She has used as sources old cookbooks, etiquette books, woman's magazines, household manuals, catalogs, and studies by government bureaus, etc. An example of her source material is the series of comprehensive 19th century manuals published over four decades, beginning in 1841, by Catharine Beecher, Harriet Beecher Stowe's sister, which reveal in each subsequent edition essential changes in technique and expectations. Strasser noted that although it was clear that until recently woman's role was 'in the home', it was not clear what that entailed and how it meshed with broader societal and economic trends such as technology, urban growth, new work opportunities outside the home, etc.The book's 16 chapters each address a major housework category: food availability and obtention; cooking; providing light and heat; the gradual advent of gas and electricity; water and sanitation; washing; making and mending clothing; home income opportunities like boarding, seamstressing, laundering; use of servants; growth of systemization and the home economics movement; child care; informed consumerism; proliferating appliances; fast food; and the environment of today's working mother.She notes the colonial household WAS colonial society, serving the functions of home, factory, school, and welfare institution, albeit via Herculean labor and hazardous living conditions, institutions that little by little were usurped by private industry and government. Women spun and wove cloth; made clothing; grew and prepared food for storage and eating; cut wood; hauled water; tended wood fires; made soap, candles, etc.; laboriously laundered clothing ('blue Monday': the worst task by far); and cared for children in their 'spare' moments. Close living and dirt producing heat sources required massive annual spring cleanings. Socially though, families were close, sitting together before the fire (only warm/light part of the house), and neighborly, assisting in chores, sewing circles, laundry day, etc.The first big break-through product to affect housekeeping was the cast iron stove. Appearing mid-19th century, it was an enormous improvement over the open hearth. Then in the 1890-1929 period, things really began to change as labor saving appliances appeared (especially plumbing, and gas and electric heat and lighting) and households began to consume the products of American industry like prepared foods, ready-made clothes, purchased and delivered energy/fuel, commercial laundries, and finally labor-saving appliances including electric refrigerators, washers and dryers. And with these changes came massive changes in the American economy. Industries consolidated. Advertising became pervasive. Consumption and the consumer mentality ballooned. The bygone social intimacy and value was lost to 'organized' work and 'organized' leisure at an untold societal price in lost civility, family dissolution, etc. But Strasser notes that these losses must be weighed against the better nutrition, health, and female emancipation that have also resulted.The book is an excellent if scholarly study of a massive though little considered revolution that has affected us all."},{"Title":"Never Done: A History of American Housework","review":"I first heard about this book when I attended Evergreen State College. The topic of housework came up as we read &quot;Roll, Jordan Roll&quot; by Eugene Genovese. Some of my classmates wanted to know about housework in its relationship to slavery. And the teacher, Nancy Allen, mentioned that a great book on the subject of housework was &quot;Never Done&quot;, by Susan Strasser. Nancy also used the book as a good example of source notes that we might want to learn from in our own course work/research.Fast forward my life ten or so years. I'm in an English class and reading &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; by Willa Cather. I remember Ms. Strasser's book! So I read it to broaden my understanding of Ms. Cather's novel and of pioneer and womens domestic lives at that time.I had a romanticised view of life in America; times were simpler and therefore better. Susan's book assisted in effectively yet politely dismissing those flowery notions from my thoughts.The research required for such a book as this--- clearly labor-intensive, but Ms. Strasser effortlessly writes in a reader-friendly style which doesn't undermine the scholarly nature of this work and its value to Womens Studies."},{"Title":"Never Done: A History of American Housework","review":"Great book. Very interesting and intriguing.I also dreamt life 100 years ago was so much better than today.

Of the hundreds of books that I had to read for my Masters degree in U.S. history, this work stood out not only as one of the very best (it was a real eye-opener!), but one of the most enjoyable to read. An excellent work of social history and women's history, with a sense of humor to boot! Let's see it back in print soon"},{"Title":"Never Done: A History of American Housework","review":"I first read Never Done in 1988 as a college student studying women's history. I enjoyed it then, and I enjoyed it again this time as a re-read.Strasser has the most rare and excellent quality of being able to condense academic research into a genuinely engaging and readable book. I find that she treats the material in an open and balanced way. She looks at the past without nostalgia, but is honest about the price that was paid for advancement. I also like that rather than focusing on the appliances themselves, she tends to focus more on the infrastructure that allowed them to be adopted as agents of change (i.e., electricity, plumbing).I am not a historian, so I cannot say that I would recommend it for that purpose. However, I would recommend it for the student or for the general armchair type of historian who may want to supplement period reading."},{"Title":"Never Done: A History of American Housework","review":"If you've ever wondered, \\"how things were done before the invention of such and such common household item?\\" this book has the answers for you. This is a fascinating volume on several levels. It provides a detailed history of basic items most people take for granted, such as the iron, the washing machine, or the stove. For anybody trying to lighten their participation in consumer society, it helps to know how people did common tasks like getting and cooking food, making and cleaning clothes, and so forth in the past.It also is an enlightening social history about the constructs of the family and its larger place in society. The theme that comes up again in again is the move from a producer-based economy, (i.e. home production) to a consumer-based economy, which focuses on consumption in the home. The most obvious ramifications, particularly in a book about house work, are for women. Especially for modern women sometimes confused about their place in the world, or what they want it to be, the details of what women used to do can inspire some informed deep thinking.The delightful surprise of the book, however, is that the transition from producer to consumer effects men as well. The family as a whole, both sexes, and kids, used to make things at home and not buy much. In the full realization of the consumer economy at the end of the 20th century, we reached a point of the opposite: men, women and children buying almost all things, and making nearly none at home. This is something we all need to think about. The revelation that separate spheres or the issues of housework apply to everyone, and is not just a \\"women's issue,\\" is perhaps what takes Strasser's work up to the level of genius."},{"Title":"Never Done: A History of American Housework","review":"The contemporary reader will have a new appreciation of modern appliances after reading Susan Strasser's Never Done: A History of American Housework. While history texts often focus on political and economic movements, Never Done looks directly into the American household. Strasser's close inspection of domestic life gives the reader a more intimate view into the American family throughout history, particularly women's roles at home and emerging into the workplace.From child care to sewing, the illustrated exploration of housework is framed in complete, well rounded chapters. The writing may be heavy but it is not necessarily dry. In her introduction, Strasser comments on the under appreciated value of housework. \\"In a society where most people distinguish between \`life' and \`work', women who supervise their own work at home do not seem to be \`working.'\\" The weight of the incorporated facts demands a respect for previous generations of women. The book details how simple tasks today, such as washing laundry or making dinner, formerly required a great deal of strength and time. Imagine, for example, hauling gallons for water to your home from a public pump down the street.The author carried out a remarkable amount of research, referring to advertisements, literature, etiquette books, scientific studies, and magazines. Some sources include old ads from the Ladies' Home Journal, photographs from the Farm Security Administration and excerpts from Miss Beecher's Housekeeper and Healthkeeper. On a local note, there are regular references to the Manchester textile mills and New England farms.Never Done is the perfect book for those interested in family heritage, history, gender and/or women's studies. Those seeking an entertaining beach read probably should turn pages elsewhere. However, Strasser's book is a great conversation piece and source of relief when looking toward a pile of dirty dishes.Review written by Manchester, NH's Literature Examiner:[...]"},{"Title":"The Pet Show Mystery (Trixie Belden)","review":"For those of you who loved the first 34 Trixie Belden books, you may be somewhat disappointed by the writing style of this one. Attempts by the author to modernize and update elements of the story seem blatant and out-of-place in these here-to-fore timeless classics. Although the BWGs are once again working for a good cause - an environmental one at that - the spirit of the book does not ring as true as in previous volumes. Even Trixie's language and thoughts seem out of character. I'm guessing they brought in a different ghostwriter than that was utilized in the Kathryn Kenny books prior to volume 35 (I've yet to read 35, 36, 38, and 39; they're on their way to me right now). Although I love Trixie Belden, I was somewhat disappointed in this book - especially as I had paid so so much for it in an auction in order to complete my collection. Of note, however, those who enjoy the modernized &quot;fanfics&quot; on the various Trixie web-sites may indeed like this volume. I, myself, prefer the older style - without the illustrations."},{"Title":"The Pet Show Mystery (Trixie Belden)","review":"I read this series back in the 70's.

If you have dined at Le Grand Vefour and enjoyed the experience, this book of recipies is for you! The only drawback is that you must read French, or have a good dictionary handy.A very easy recipie is the &quot;Oreiller de veau au jus de poivrons doux piment&eacute;&quot; - (pillows of veal (paupiettes) with the juice of 2 peppers). The simple ingredients blend together to make a perfect sensation in your mouth. You may need to substitute for the caul fat if your butcher does not have it, but toothpicks will work. The flavor is exotic, yet basic.Your mind believes the dish has tomatoes as a base, but the taste screams something quite different. Your eyes, nose, and mouth are sending different signals to your brain and the resulting confusion is a delicious rhapsody your taste buds enjoy with each mouthful.Some of the quantities need to be checked, as typos do seem to be present, but an experienced cook will notice the irregularities very quickly.I have made a complete meal (cold entree, hot entree, main course with vegetable, and dessert) from this book, and recommend it with no reservation.The results do make me yearn to be back in Paris at Le Grand Vefour."},{"Title":"Coptic Egypt","review":"Coptic Egypt is little known and less understood.

I appreciate her effort to not subsume the Coptic church under an indistinct universal \\"Christianity\\", but sometimes her examples seem strained.

I read it when it was first published, a condensation of SEX, ECOLOGY, SPIRITUALITY. For an even briefer summary of Wilber's system, see THE MARRIAGE OF SENSE AND SOUL.What I want to address, though, is Brother Ken's apparent need to develop his compassion, which seems stunted by comparison to his intellect. I just found a statement of Ken's on the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq, which he posted to his website in 2003 (it can be found on the Shambhala Publications site), and which he apparently thinks highly enough of to have left there until now. In it, Ken lashes out at the peace movement in a way betraying a lack of elementary decency and respect. His proposal, which is supposed to reflect his superior \\"second-tier\\" insight, is a world government, which is something I've seen the need for since I was about 13. I don't think it took \\"second-tier\\" consciousness to figure it out. Does Ken think most peace activists haven't also thought of that? But what do we do without one when imperialist powers like the U.S. invade and occupy countries? He places the peace movement and the neocon advocates of war on the same primitive moral plane, far beneath his lofty position, but based on his tirade I think it's clear who needs some intensive ethical development. Certainly developing \\"compassion for all sentient beings\\" would be a prerequisite to Brother Ken becoming any sort of philosopher-king with policy-making authority. For a truly enlightened and compassionate perspective, I recommend LIVING BUDDHA, LIVING CHRIST by Thich Nhat Hanh, the Vietnamese Zen teacher and peace activist.See my BHUDDA-DHARMA list and my WHO WOULD JESUS BOMB? lists for more, including books by Brother Ken."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"I'm not a philosopher or a scientist.

Did the author mean to state the Pythagorean Theorem: the square of the hypotenuse in a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides? This is a completely different idea, but we must assume this is what he was trying to say. But it gets worse! Mr. Wilber wants us to believe that the results and conclusions of the meditative traditions( &quot;you are face to face with the Divine . . .&quot;) are exactly the same kind of knowledge as the Pythagorean Theorem!!!!!

Wilbur's model integrates earlier work done in the fields of science, philosophy, psychology, theology, and sociology. Building upon that foundation, he crafts a very workable and important way of viewing the nature of being.By presenting the material in a question and answer format, Wilbur provides a valuable entry point for those interested in his point of view, but who don't want to take on a formidable academic work. The speculative nature of the book is completely appropriate and beautifully done. The result is a provocative, albeit brief, pathway that's relatively easy to negotiate while simultaneously stimulating for the mind. Superb.

It isn't light reading, but it is amazingly intellectual. I was a Liberal Studies major in college. I had a pulse on the essence, the truth of what he proposes, and explains. I am delighted to discover his works and ideas. They really speak truths that resonate with me. This was the first Ken Wilber book I have read. At the advice of a friend who turned me on to Ken I had listened to two of his books before reading this. It was excellent advice. Wade in the the pool before attempting to learn to swim. I listened to The Marriage of Sense and Soul and The One, Two Three of God before reading this. Now I am onto reading A Simple feeling of Being and listening to Kosmic Contagiousness. I must say 3 months ago I never read his stuff, but now if you ask me &#34;who is the one person dead or alive you would like to meet and spend a day with? I would say make it a week and it is Ken Wilber!&#34; A day just wouldn't be enough."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Don't expect all of Wilber's subtlety to be captured in this witty effort to popularize the main body of his work. DO read Sex, Ecology, and Spirituality, the book that this one summarizes. In particular, track down some of the references and buttressing arguments in his footnotes. You have to take him seriously, even if you want to argue with him. This book has been enormously useful to me in my clinical work (as a psychologist, a profession that Wilber, rightly, rakes over a few coals), in my role as an administrator of health care, and in my own spiritual search. I have found no better integrator among 20th century thinkers."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"It bothers me not in the least that Mr. Wilber has failed to tie together every thread of every promise made or that he has misstated a Theorem. Why would this matter?Look at the enormity of what he has delivered in this work and ask - who else in this community of 6 odd billion is currently illuminating so many important fragments of human existence and blending them into a compelling and united vision of meaning? This one solitary man is single-handedly and valiantly doing more than anyone alive to show us how it all fits! If it doesn't all fit and it isn't supposed to all fit - then Heaven help us.The act of reading Ken Wilber is not the direct experience of that at which he points. However, his finger is true and fair and he challenges us to participate personally in living a life that encompasses awareness of unity. Mr. Wilber's work is not necessarily &quot;true&quot; - it is, however, more helpful in weaving a vision of the relationship among pieces (&quot;everything&quot;) than anything else being done at this stage in our collective dialogue. For this he must be applauded and this book should be read and re-read."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"This is the first Ken Wilber book I have read. I got halfway through A Theory of Everything and realized I should have read this first. So I did.Wilber is a prolific and uniquely American philosopher who has written extensively on his developing Theory of Everything. Unlike other all-encompassing scientific theories (systems theory, string theory, m-theory, etc), Wilber's philosophy encompasses thought and spirituality as well. In fact, Wilber's central point is that our modern mode of thinking unfortunately focuses solely on provable, measurable science, ignoring the spiritual and emotional internal aspects of individuals and of society. We are living in a state of what he calls \\"flatland.\\" This book is basically a call to global well-roundedness in thought.This is probably the most challenging book I've read in a long time. I have never read anything like it. Wilber's theory fascinating. It joins many of the great philosophies, sciences, and spiritual beliefs and shows how they can live in accord rather than at odds with one another. It traces our development as humans using aspects of developmental psychology, and examines the evolution of our thought from a historical perspective.As an attempt to incorporate all modes of thought-psychological, scientific, philosophical, religious, etc.-this is a fantastic book. Several of the reviews I've read criticize Wilber for his inability to scientifically prove his theory. But that criticism is missing one of the main points of his theory-namely that science is only one aspect of thought, only one facet of our world. Not everything can be proven through science. Love, sorrow, joy, humor-these things are not measurable with instruments. There is definite moral right and wrong (e.g. Nazis wrong) that can't be proven with science. And Wilber's point is that science can't be used to prove things of a spiritual nature any more than prayer could be used to calculate the boiling point of water. For an individual and a world to be healthy, it must operate and evolve in all quadrants, not just one. It must break out of this \\"flatland\\" approach.My biggest criticisms of A Brief History of Everything are of style more than content. The book is set up as a dialogue between a questioner and answerer. Why this was done is beyond me, and it actually became very annoying. It's a technique a writer might use to help flush out his thoughts, but there's no need for the questions to be included in the final draft.My other criticism is that, although Wilber's philosophy is not New Age, the terms he uses to describe his concepts have that flavor. He often makes up several words which mean the same thing and unnecessarily uses them interchangeably. It gets a tad confusing at times. And Wilbur has a tendency to end his chapters with a flurry of this language in an overly dramatic way that seems more like bad New Age poetry than anything else. It detracts from his otherwise brilliant theory."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"The title of this book aptly summarizes messages the author had the intent of conveying. Since online reviews shouldn't ( IMO ) be places of unbridled confessions &amp; ecstatical yes or no self-congratulatory sermons, I'll try to enumerate ( as impersonally as I'm capable of doing this ) the strengths and weaknesses of the book.Strengths1.The author's audacity in pursuing of what he calls &quot;integral studies&quot;. In our fragmented world of clashing Weltanschauungen Wilber tirelessly searches for a unitary vision, the &quot;marriage of East and West&quot;. More-he tries to accomplish the task fathering an entirely new linguistic coordinate system, dispensing with ( and, simultaneously, assimilating ) older, culturally/religiously conditioned vocabulary in an attempt of the comparativist synthesis. A laudable endeavor. 2.His critique of Jungian/Depth psychology and its central tenets, with archetypes being frequently misinterpreted as Platonic ideas/forms and the Collective Unconscious mixed up with Supramental states of, say, Sri Aurobindo's description of Reality. Washburn's criticism of Wilber's supposed misreading of the role of archetypes, in my opinion, doesn't hold water. 3.Wilber's penetrating and frequently funny dissection of contemporary pop-spirituality &amp; other New Age fads ( pathetic Gaia cults which are nothing more than Rousseau in feminist clothing rehashed for the late 20.th century spiritual cosmetics, irrational &amp; dogmatic idolizing of the imagined paradisiacal life in foraging cultures,..)Weaknesses1.With all due respect, Wilber is quite innocent re science, especially physics. His references ( for instance, on Pythagoras' theorem, but also his musings on Quantum Mechanics in other books ) could only put off a professional physicist or a mathematician as an amateurish dabblings of a presumptuous ignoramus ( the contempt Gauss had harbored for Hegel's philosophizing of mathematics springs to mind immediately ). 2.Wilber's central worldview is the non-dualist vision of Reality ( essentially, it is Ch'an/Zen, Tibetan Mahamudra or Trika Shaivism refurbished ), combined with Hegel's evolving Spirit. Yet, the two are hardly reconcilable. You either got: a) the manifest Reality as Illusion ( Advaita Vedanta, Zen,..) which doesn't warrant &quot;perfection&quot; or &quot;evolution&quot;. The world just *is*, without any mythological, let alone rational, explanation or answer to the Leibniz's ultimate question &quot; Why is there anything, instead of nothing ?&quot; b) the manifest Reality as actualization of potential, &quot;hidden&quot; state of the Absolute, radiating/emanating into evolving &amp; ever perfecting forms ( a tad optimistic view on evolution ). In sum, the manifest ( in various levels of manifestation ) Kosmos serves the purpose of enriching &amp; &quot;glorifying&quot; the omnipresent Spirit ( Erigena, Hegel, also Meher Baba in his wilder speculations ). An important subvariant ( Rumi, Neotheosophy ) claims that not only Spirit evolves, but essential human souls ( ruh, pneuma, jivatman ) who are the chief protagonists of &quot;evolutionary enterprise&quot;.) Therefore, I would say that marriage of Shankara's Advaita and Hegel's objective idealism is doomed from the outset. 3.All this inflated verbal jazz is not the substitute for genuine originality. I haven't found true creative spirit &amp; seminal ideas, just the old wine in new ( bells and whistles ) bottles. 4.The last verdict: Wilber's predisposition for non-dual visions of Reality in the vein of Advaita Vedanta or Zen blinds him to the richness and profundity of, also &quot;spiritual&quot;, but more nuanced and &quot;diversified&quot; doctrines a la Hermetic, Rosicrucian, Lurianic Kabbalistic or more &quot;digestable&quot; contemporary revelations like Seth or truly radical &amp; practical, but lucid and all-encompassing transpersonal psychologies like Assagioli's psychosynthesis. Marriage of East &amp; West turned out to be no more than a dissemination of distilled &amp; modernized corpus of intelectually elitist, but esentially marginal non-dual spiritual doctrines of East and Southeast Asia."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"I wouldn't have written a review--there are already so many--but no one was giving my take on the book.The first thing you should know is that it's very difficult reading. Even if you're used to reading scientific and philosophical works, this one is difficult. The question/answer format helps, but nothing can make it a quick read.That said, I found that Wilber was forcing reality to fit his system, ignoring or misinterpreting things to meet his needs. This is a man who really loves systems. Since it's a history of everything, everything has to be included in his system. Several people have already pointed out errors. I could point out others, because my background is in a different field, but it seems to me that all the errors spring from a disregard of detail, and an emphasis on the overall system.If you love systems, you could love this book. It really does bring together stuff from a lot of different disciplines. But as the misstatements piled up, I found myself dissatisfied."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Let me acknowledge that I personally struggle to outgrow the \\"formal-reflexive\\" stage of consciousness and to feel comfortable in the \\"vision-logic\\" stage, and perhaps for that reason I stopped reading A Brief History of Everything after chapter 11. For me, Wilber's effort is a fine account and synthesis of many contemporary philosophical, psychological, cultural ideas, written in a clear, informal style, which often succeeds brilliantly in simplifying without oversimplifying. I finally truly understand post-modernism, and deconstuctionism. By relating and organizing the contributions of many thinkers, Wilber attempts to create new truths as well as express old ones, and I suspect he has accomplished this with his account of the different psychiatric approaches. At the same time, well before chapter 12, there were sections I did not get much out of. Also, Wilber makes two important errors in the first chapter of the book: evolutionists have several competing ideas for the origin of life which do not rely on impossibly random events (cf. Stuart Kauffman: At Home In the Universe: the Search for Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity ), as well as explanations of the functions of pre-flight wing-like appendages. They have begun to identify in the fossil record some of the intermediate stages, and it would be surprising if life is not created in the test tube by the end of the century by \\"fair\\" means, and in fact there is not the great divide between non-life and life that Wilber posits."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"I've read a lot of Ken Wilber and I think this is the best first book for someone who is hasn't read Wilber before. It summarizes his thought in an easy to understand Q&A; format. It is thought provoking and packed with good information.What Ken Wilber has done is take the world's wisdom traditions and philosophies and look for the common core. At the same time, he introduces how this fits in with the discoveries of science and modern psychological thought.Ken Wilber presents a very compelling view of the world that includes and honors both the interior (subjective) and exterior (objective) domains and posits that the interior domains are not reducible to the exterior ones. He also talks about how different validity criteria must be used to measure the merit of ideas in these different domains. For example, everyone would probably agree that love exists, but we wouldn't necessary use a microscope and mathematics to validate this particular claim.While Wilber isn't perfect, he presents a plausible synthesis of past and present thought in a form that is very palatable to modern educated people. At times, he is repetitious, but overall the book is readable and if you are new to Wilber, the repetition can even help the ideas to sink in. Some of his other books are also repetitious and I must admit at times this could get very tiresome. This is a lot of why I gave the book a four rating.Overall, Ken Wilber is brilliant and while he has his shortcomings, he is introducing a lot of people to alternative ways of looking at the world that are more life-enhancing and congruent with modern science. He is also holding out a plausible synthesis between the objective and subjective, material and spiritual, modern and ancient. He does a great job in this moderate length book to cover a tremendous territory in the evolution of man.Although I think Ken Wilber's works can improve in the editing department, this is still a very worthwhile and accessible read. If you want something even more brief, then a \\"Theory of Everything\\" is another book to consider. However, it is not written as well in my opinion. If you are looking for more depth or a more psychological spin, then \\"Integral Psychology\\" is another possibility. Other books are referenced in other reviews as well."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Recently, a former English professor of mine who is familiar with Wilber's work commented, \\"I can't decide if he's absolutely brilliant or a horse's ass. Probably some of both.\\"That about sums up the majority of popular opinion on Wilber.I have fervently studied psychology, philosophy, and religion ever since my freshman year of highschool, when an existential crisis left me confused and hopeless. For the first several years my relentless search for meaning uncovered nothing more than the dreadful seriousness of existential philosophers like Sartre and Camus. They offered validation but no hope. Religious texts didn't seem to address my problem, and traditional psychology was inclined to treat it as pathology. On occassion someone would speculatively declare that I was on the brink of a great spiritual transformation, but then would halt abrubtly, perhaps unclear about exactly how this transformation could be brought about. Blind faith? It went against the grain of my very being. I was slowly becoming acclimated to the idea that there truly was No Exit. Just grit your teeth and bear it.Personally, reading A Brief History of Everything was an epiphany. 173 pages into the book Wilber describes a stage of consciousness which he terms Fulcrum-6. Almost immediately I realized that he was talking about the existential crisis. Excitement welled up from the very depth of my being as I continued to read the most sensible treatment of this condition I had ever encountered. Wilber had placed it in a broad context - orienting this stage in the evolution of consciousness - in a way that made perfect sense to me. What I had always suspected and cautiously hoped for - that my condition was not permanent and that there is a way to transcend it - was now made eminently obvious. I had seen the path that brought me to this point, and now, for the first time in my life, I could see the path ahead. For that insight alone I owe Ken Wilber my utmost gratitude.If you suspect you are suffering from a Fulcrum-6 existential crisis, or know someone who is, please read this book. Shoot, read the book anyway. Wilber has encompassed a tremendous amount of information from a diversity of fields and presented it all in a coherent model of the evolution of everything. It will change the way you think, forever.If you are feeling particularly bold, read Wilber's Sex, Ecology, Spirituality which presents the same model but at roughly three times the length."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Those who denounce Wilber's ideas in this forum themselves prove some of his most essential points. Many practice self-contradiction (&quot;I hate people who hate!&quot;), magic and mythic worldviews (&quot;My religion right or wrong!&quot;), and sling ideas about without proof while accusing him of illogic (I challenge anyone to find an illogical conclusion or construction anywhere in Wilber's many works. Near twenty published works all still in print!)and dogmatism (I challenge anyone to point out dogma in Wilber's work. He is essentially anti-dogmatic and always, always intellectually responsible.) Wilber's book is a synthesis and begs to be read as an introduction to post-modern world philosophy as well as to his own works, although it does stand on its own. His is a voice of reason in a world (theology, philosophy, psychology, teleology, ontology, etc.) caught in all sorts of retro-romantic and dogmatic &quot;unthought.&quot; This book has much to offer those with an open heart and a probing mind. He nowhere expects ready acceptance of any of his ideas but everywhere goes back again and again to reason. The main thing he avoids in the present book is following, as he has in past books, often in the copious endnotes which have been characteristic of his other works, the gnarled roots of argument off into all their tangents, leaving no counterargument or supporting stone unturned. He keeps it right on the target and explains that that is intentional and not an error or omission. &quot;You want all my research,&quot; he seems to suggest, &quot;go to my other works. You want a synthesis of my present thinking, here it is!&quot; The book simplifies, then, without being in any way simplistic. In other words, the work tries to be more accessable and direct and less complex and comprehensive than his other books. The bottom line is that Wilber, nowhere more than in this book, holds himself to no lesser a standard of argument (truth, beauty, and goodness!)than he does his many detractors (who mostly have particular worldviews or agendas to support and, I think, are often not themselves ready to live up to that standard.) Wilber's only agenda in this book is to aim our thinking and his own in the direction of ongoing integration. The bottom line is that Wilber offers an access to new thinking that goes way beyond the New Age. He here offers this to people who are not, perhaps, used to the more esoteric and ethereal planes of post-modern thought or who have wrestled with his thought elsewhere and who might then benefit from a fresh and clarified version of that thought. His is a generous, humorous, clear, and careful style backed with yards and yards of bibliography and years and years of hard work. His thought will be welcome to those who seek to clarify their own thinking but will be hardly welcome among those with hard-etched agendas and romantic or mythic worldviews to defend. Agree or disagree with Wilber's thought but beware, this is a sharp mind well primed with research that is often better armed with the literature of a field than those who would denounce him from that field! Literalists, fundamentalists, retro-romantics, and true believers need not apply. (Well, they do need to apply but the message, and it is too bad, will probably be lost to them.) Wilber's thought could, given half a chance, get us past our differences and into integration. Read him. Read him carefully and with an open heart and a probing mind. The book is a gem."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"No, this is not philosophy as it is understood by the grown-ups, although it surely is a dumbed down strand of Hegelianism (what else could it be with such a cute title?). This is a kind of New Age chirping for people who prefer not to strain their brains excessively and to feel well with the least mental expense. How does one earn a reputation in these circles? Easy: by preaching ignorance to the ignorant.Here are a few examples that should serve as a caution to everyone who might otherwise be taken for a ride, as I surely was. If you are a Hegelian, at some point you must introduce the &#65533;Spirit&#65533;. Wilber does it pretty early by discussing evolution. The wing, according to him, is useful only when fully developed &#65533; a half-wing is no good. Such a sophisticated instrument could only have evolved with the help of a supreme agency. This is an argument from a Jehovah Witnesses tract: the real science points out that even a quarter-wing (as well as a quarter-eye) is usually better than none if it gives the animal the slightest edge over the wingless. And it does: somebody should have shown Wilber a flying squirrel.Introducing his theory of &#65533;holons&#65533; Wilber states that matter is infinitely divisible (and compounded). The real science, of course, has discovered otherwise: the string is the smallest element of matter.The discussion of the Big Bang and of what could have &#65533;preceded&#65533; it is altogether laughable. What is missing throughout the book is an awareness that every proposition is worthless unless provable.When mentioning the Axial Age with its saints and prophets, Wilber studiously omits every name connected with the Judeo-Christian tradition. One feels an agenda, but it is never stated explicitly. Sneaky.Last but not least: the whole book is written in the form of a dialog, but the only purpose of the questioner is to suck up to the answerer; he never advances any intelligent objection, never mentions any contrarian authority with the exception of some feminists. This must be the easiest way of philosophical discourse.I must confess that I picked up this book because its main thesis, the poverty of the reductionism, is close to my heart. But I would rather stay with the reductionists as long as they respect my intelligence."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"My first exposure to Ken Wilber was his Brief History of Everything, a book of incredible depth and scope, so I was disappointed when reading History of Everything to come across to glaring errors the first time I sat down with it. The first was his claim that only living things reproduce themselves. This is simply wrong; crystals, for instance, reproduce under the right conditions, and a proper mineral solution may be &quot;seeded&quot; with the crystal that one intends to grow. The second incorrect claim he made was that natural selection is not a strong enough force to explain the evolution of life on earth, in particular that is insufficient to explain the jump from Earth's early &quot;primordial soup&quot; to the earliest forms of life. For those who insist that Wilber is correct in this claim, I reccomend the works of Richard Dawson, a brilliant evolutionary biologist."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Geez, this is a nice start, but being able to conceive, carry, birth, raise and release healthy happy kids requires much more than the basics, trust me!

Just look at the man! Those glasses! He must know SOMETHING of importance."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"very simple and thorough explanation of a broad range of complex topics - enjoyed the writing and certainly has already helped me to communicate more effectively concerning and better understand a number of different topics, particularly concerning spirituality and consciousness"},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Just as the late, brilliant guru Adi Da attempted to \\"privatize\\" God-realization (\\"I am the first, last, and only fully en-lightened 7th stage master\\"), Ken Wilber, who derives much of his spiritual material from Da, attempts, in his writings, to annex \\"integral life,\\" declaring in effect that his four-quadrant framework and the various matrices and hierarchical schemas he has identified/concocted, or subscribes to, represent the true vision and maps of \\"integral life,\\" I would argue to the contrary. In my opinion, they merely, for the most part, represent the subjective vision and maps of his hyperintellectual mind.In A Brief History of Everything, Wilber uses cosmic and human history to support his integral vision of life, and one should at least applaud his effort, if not his success. A Brief History of Everything is actually my favorite Wilber text and the one I recommend to my students and those new to Wilber. In this book, unlike some of his others, he does not overdo the charts and mapping, and the result is an easy, amenable read. Despite his faults, I consider Wilber worth reading. He is an avant-garde thinker who unearths fertile new ground; however, he doesn't dig very deep into the soil, and in this sense he embodies the very \\"flatness\\" he criticizes.Just as those familiar with modern evolutionary theory have reamed Wilber for his superficiality in that area, being an expert in both mystical and sociopolitical philosophy, I'll take a couple of \\"brief\\" potshots, from my fields, at the \\"Pandit.\\" First, mysticism. It is ridiculous to conflate emptiness with spirit as Wilber does.(The Great Spiritual Traditions don't do it. Point me to a Hindu yoga teaching that does.) Spirit is the dynamic Energy of timeless Awareness. Emptiness is simply the non-presence of objects (or content) within a \\"container\\" (or context). Wilber is clueless regarding the Buddhist Trikaya (Triple Body). He says the \\"Dharmakaya of Spirit gives rise to the Sambhogakaya of mind which gives rise to the Nirmanakaya of body and form and nature.\\" The fact is, the Dharmakaya of timeless Awareness gives rise to the Sambhogakaya of uncreated Spirit (Blissing, or Blessing, Light-energy) which gives rise to the Nirmankaya of created existence. Regarding politics, Wilber is a \\"Progressivist,\\" a euphemistic term for a liberal-fascist, a Big Government globalist. His left-wing leanings are made clear in his statement: \\"Spirit as great Freedom is one thing; spirit actually manifested as political democracies is another.\\" Anybody who has studied Rand or Rothbard knows that \\"democracy\\" is a synonym for \\"mob rule\\" (unlimited majority control), and should not be conflated with the term \\"freedom.\\" If you're interested in real freedom, you stomp for a constitutional republic (which guarantees inviolable individual rights), not for a Wilber-type global \\"integral democracy.\\"In sum, this book merits a read, but if you're a sharp tool rather than a dull Wilber acolyte, my guess is that you'll realize Ken for what he is--an overrated but interesting philosopher. Three stars for bald ambition and mixed results."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Wilber's big picture is bigger than any other I know. I first read &#34;Brief History&#34; at a time when I was drawn to two spiritual communities with opposite values: one New Thought and the other Fundamentalist with great music (as detailed in my book, &#34;The Bishop and the Seeker). Wilber showed me that I was not backsliding but integrating, and my life has been juicier ever since."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as it built upon an influential essay I once read by Richard Tarnas entitled \\"The Great Initiation,\\" who has written on similar topics. I find Wilber's ability to stream together an integral vision fascinating. His research, understanding, and interpretation of historical figures, epochs, and philosophical thought is quite intriguing ... especially having taken several Religious Studies courses as an undergraduate. Overall, Wilber's ability to frame seemingly opposing ideas into a coherent and conceivable format is very convincing. While at first I was put off by the Q&A format, I quickly adjusted to the style as the book flowed well. While the book may be a thick read for some, this level of depth is the type of reading I most enjoy. Furthermore, I felt there were many takeaways from the book despite whether or not you agreed with the central message based on the lovely language coupled with the book's level of complexity. Wilber is undoubtedly one of the more brilliant minds in existence today, and highly worth the read. I look forward to reading more books from him in the future."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"My son told me to buy this.At 83 I still want to lern things. but I ned to go slower reading everything!"},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"A book that is a combination of biology, psychology, social studies and more. A new and bold way to look at human and world evolution. The book describes inner and outer evolution, in one brief look that goes from atoms through laws of the cosmos, to developments of the planet and up to human beings and society. It is realy a new and amazing look at ourselves, our future and past."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"This book is frusterating. In many, many instances, statements are made, but never supported. These statements beg for certian questions to be asked, but they never are. Instead of challenging the weak points of Wilbur's arguement, the softball questions serve only to keep the book moving (&quot;Nothing to see here folks, just keep moving. That's it, keep it moving&quot;) The language, while at times poetic, is overwhelmingly pretentous. The central portion of the book, dealing with the evolution of conciousness, is worth reading. Unfortuantely, for the most part is is merely a restating of other people perpsectives. Rarely do i have problems with these conclusions, but Wilbur's attempts to draw universal conclusion based on these more speciallized conclusions, are laughable. I don't doubt that some higher synthesis can be made, I just doubt that Wilbur has done it. His conclusions ARE possible, but so are a plethora of other silly conclusions. The bottom line is that the opinions expressed in the book are simply that: opinions. They are not adequetly supported. The arguments, when made, are weak. Maybe Wilbur's view of everything IS correct, but this book is a very poor way to go about convincing someone of that."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"This book has been described as the 'popular' version of Wilber's \\"Sex, Ecology and Spirituality\\". Ken introduces his 'Four Quadrants' and the first third of the book describes the different types of society and their respective worldviews. The real value of this book for me lies in the second part where he describes development from the existential level through the higher transpersonal relams of subtle and causal and non-dual. His descriptions of these realms are as good as I've read."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"I just couldn't get through this book. By trying to claim this was about everything, it covered nothing, save perhaps new age woo.I knew it was going to be bad when he made up a new word for a meaningless concept. He claims that everything is both a whole, onto itself, and a part of something larger, called a \\"holon\\". I admit I have a pet peeve against authors that make up new words because they are not aware that other people have perfect good words that mean the same thing.He completely lost me, and I am certain many intelligent people who know anything at all about Biology, when he said that very few theorist believe in Darwin's theory about chance mutation and natural selection. (Page 20, he really said that!) Yes, yes, we do. And if he wants to propose an alternative hypothesis (in science it doesn't get to be called a theory until after you prove it) then he better have some extraordinary new evidence, because natural selection IS the generally accepted theory.Just like the Heliocentric theory (that the Earth goes around the Sun, not vice versa) is currently the generally accepted theory. Yes, I am sure it is a theory, not a fact or a law.This book has a preview. I strongly suggest that you use it, before you spend any money."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Noted for his vast and brilliant synthesis of many disciplines, however, no one familiar with the topics he refers to can agree. It is the work of a Male-Western Science-Christian-Freudian who still believes the Truth of all that but also is aware that they aren't the whole Truth. He yearns for the subjective, but can not trust it beyond reports by those (like Freudians) who can clean the subjective of its unconscious 'deceits' and other limits. Einstein wrote of mystery as the heart of great science and art. This is the personal (subjective) experience of creative scientists, artists, religious types and everyone else who isn't limited solely to what they read in the library. This insightful group doesn't include Ken Wilber. Wilber cites many authors and theories, though those familiar with those works will not recognize them from Wilber's remarks. His fundamental overview of all systems is based in the simple double dichotomy of Cartesian axes, though he is totally unaware of the circumscribed circle of the horizon which is always implicit in such a format. Even within his four-fold model of the subjective/objective individual and social, he doesn't notice that really he is only speaking of the physical sciences, psychology and the social sciences. They study his four realms, but of course they are all academic objective sciences. The emotional angst he unleashes against &quot;flatland&quot; views of science only can only be his own subjective pain trying to break through his defenses. His is a totally flatland synthesis, confusing flat circles for spheres and higher dimensions. It is tough to revere Freud as truth and hope to find any sense of wholeness or subjective integrity."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"A Review from BLACK PEARL: The Journal of the College of Thelema (Vol. I, No. 5, March, 1999). Copyright 1999, College of Thelema (permission by editor granted Amazon Books to use). This is a flawed but thought-provoking synthesis of various scientific and \\"wisdom\\" traditions, both ancient and modern. Essentially a condensation of Wilber's Sex, Ecology, Spirituality, this book attempts to weave together the threads of Eastern and Western spiritual traditions including Buddhism and Kab-balah, with scientific findings in fields as diverse as psychology, anthropology, and biology. The book is written in a conversational, question/answer format well suited to the broad, intertwined topics being covered. The main problem with this approach is that the book is devoid of references, and there is a sense that the material has been watered down somewhat for mass consumption. Wilber is up front about this, however, and directs the reader to consult Sex, Ecology, Spirituality for elaboration. Some occasional redundancy further detracts from the book's impact, but not so much as to negate its value. In general, Wilber's treatment of the topic areas suggests he has a broad and balanced understanding of his material. This is, in fact, one of the primary reasons I can recommend this book to students of the Mysteries. It provides a convenient refresher course in various philosophies and their implications for modern scientific and spiritual thought. Wilber's \\"four-quadrant\\" model is the framework for this approach, and accounts for internal-external, and individual-collective polarities of the human condition. Remarkably, Wilber manages to communicate all this in a very readable and accessible manner, and his discussion of the material is quite insightful. Despite its flaws, this book would be a good addition to any student's library. - DAVID G. SHOEMAKER"},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"This is my first Ken Wilber book and I loved it! Reading Ken's work IS work - defintely not for the lesser intellect - but the effort is worth it. This book brought me insight after insight, tracing the evolution of (human) consciousness from primitive hunter-gatherer thru the non-dual, ascended self of post-post-modern practitioners. Although I didn't agree with everything I read, &quot;A Brief History ...&quot; made me question a lot of long held beliefs and filled in some amazing gaps."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"This is the second book I have read of the many that Ken Wilber has produced. I admit to struggling with the concept he is presenting, but that has nothing to do with his writing which is clear and concise. I suppose it speaks to where I am, presently, in evolving my own consciousness.Wilber employed a question and answer format with this volume and it worked well for me. The \\"interviewer\\" posed questions and Wilber answered them. This comfortably leads the reader through the maze of human consciousness development as Wilber sees it. Beginning with his concept of the \\"Kosmic Pattern\\" of the twenty connectors, Wilber winds his way to higher levels of consciousness using the concept of holons.I have no difficulty following the holon metaphor in the \\"material world\\" view. It's very straight forward - particles combined to make atom holons. Atoms combined to make molecule holons. Molecules make cell holons, etc. If we destroy a holon, then we destroy all holons \\"above\\" it. Without molecules, we and much of the physical world as we know it simply goes away. This is not a difficult concept.Applying this concept to human consciousness (not the physical body which of course we can understand comprises cell holons of many different types) is where I struggle. Wilber states that \\"So even a person born into a grand and glorious and global vision-logic culture nevertheless begins development at the physiocentric, then biocentric, then egocentric levels, then moves to the sociocentric levels, then moves to the postconventional and woldcentric levels. There is no way to avoid or circumvent that general process.\\" This then leads to the concept that therefore, we cannot, as we achieve higher level of consciousness, denigrate or \\"kill off\\" the earlier stages of consciousness. Wilber posits that each stage of development becomes the basis for the next holon level. To destroy a holon at one level would presumably destroy all \\"higher\\" holons.In terms of a discussion of religion or other human institutions, this implies that we will forever be subject to fellow beings who remain \\"stuck at one level or another\\" and all that that implies for the human condition. We cannot short-circuit the development. Of course there is hope that as long as we understand the process, we can ease people through it by perhaps inculcating keeping an open mind, as much as possible, at each stage. The drive to understand that \\"there is something beyond my present view\\" may keep us skeptical or agnostic enough to allow progress to higher consciousness.I am still trying to wrap my mind around all that Wilber's model means to humanity. There is a part of me that feels as though we are doomed to lower levels of awareness and consciousness because we all \\"have to start at square one.\\" On the other hand, I have much hope that if we can only embrace this model, we will recognize that wherever we are on the path, we have more consciousness to achieve. We can't begin this hard work unless we at least seriously consider what Wilber has to say. Must read for any sentient being who aspires to higher levels of consciousness and understanding."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Regarding Ken Wilber's A Theory of Everything, and A Brief History of Everything. Wilber's books are very interesting, in his synthesis of latest thinking from all over the spectrum of knowledge--evolutionary biology, economics, psychology, history, physics, etc., to name a few--and his building a unified framework or world view that is profoundly inclusive of ideas from all of these fields. He is a &quot;mapmaker&quot; of sorts, an abstractionist and pattern-finder, plotting out how things relate in the various spheres of knowledge, and hanging them together in a single richly-textured fabric--of categories, structures, hierarchies and relationships. Everything from religion to evolution to particle physics are fit within the framework. I have some questions about the validity of some of the premises on which he hangs some of his notions, but the quadrant system he presents--and the common patterns he observes in all of these various spheres of knowledge--is quite amazing. It is interesting and thought provoking reading, if you are interested in a synthesis of the latest ideas on how &quot;everything&quot; hangs together (the &quot;theory&quot;) and how it has come to be this way (the &quot;history&quot;)."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"wilber is worth all the hype:he is a true pioneer ofthe emerging phase of planetary evolution.this book is a great primer.here he masterfully weaves multiple threadsfrom hugely diverse sources;from science to mysticism,from history to philosophy.the result is stunningly precise thoughtsyet infused with moments of poetical flares,and a myriad of insights!at every page i found myselfamazed at his abilityto turn the dense lucid.his writings lure usinto the sway of the mystic-but this is a mysticism that is very earthyyet always transcending our grasp."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"I postponed reading Wilber for a long time, because I felt that time had yet to come for me to be exposed to such a mindblow, like I knew this would turn to be. Sometimes you don't want to set your mind in a certain direction yet.When I decided on reading Wilber I decided on reading this particular book after reviewing most of his books and finding this to be probably the most complete introduction to his thinking.I certainly didn't regret that decision. \\"A Brief History of Everything\\" turned out to be a very readable enlightening experience. Wilber proposes a very impressive integral view of reality: personal and collective; personal and transpersonal; inner and outer.His worldview is naturally not totally foolproof. For example, I am not sure if a rational person is necessarily in all cases in a more \\"developed\\" position than a mythic person (I mean 'Mythic' and 'Rational, in the sense discussed inside the book). For example if you put a great mythic sage against a standard rational person from our society. That and some other ideas need to be explored some more. However, those question marks that still stand are natural in a book which is so adventurous and bold.Overall, this book is so full with brilliant enlightening observations, and it can change or deepen your view about a lot of different issues from minority politics to ecology, from sex to psychoanalysis, from personal development to world politics.There are not a lot of books where you get so much information and wisdom in such a short read.Wilber seems to be one of the leading thinkers of our time, and I would certainly recommend this book as an introduction to his philosophy."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"This book has been touted as a &quot;brilliant synthesis of scientific and spiritual understanding&quot;, but I didn't find it to be so. Wilbur's sloppy treatment of science put me off. His claims with regard to science are mostly unsupported over-simplifications of what really goes on in the various areas that make up modern science. Wilbur's grasp of the philosophical and spiritual is impressive, but he fails to go that extra mile to bring science into the picture. As a result the book is unbalanced, with too much emphasis being placed on philosophical/spiritual matters, and too little on the scientific. The introduction makes promises that are not kept in the body of the book. Wilbur asks &quot;What currents are afoot in this extraordinary game of evolution&quot;, but when the time comes to address this tantalizing question, he shuts down the whole debate by stating that the process of evolution is nothing more than a &quot;mystery&quot;. One is led to wonder how an integration of the scientific with the spiritual can ever come to pass if the entire investigation into evolution since Darwin is dismissed with a single word. Only the starry-eyed and the hopelessly naive will be sucked in by this kind of arrogance. Throughout, Wilbur invokes the spirit of the Zen masters to fuel his argument. Why is it,then,that Wilbur's approach is so obviously unZenlike? Where is the equanimity, the acceptance, the simple contemplation of existence that we find in Zen? Zen is unique in that it offers no answers other than those that offer themselves. This is most certainly not the Wilbur method."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Ken Wilber's, A Brief History of Everything, is not about everything. For example it does not include Al Gianfriddo robbing Joe Dimaggio of a home run in the 1947 World Series. Wilber, however, might argue that it does. The book is an attempt to integrate all knowledge. For Wilber there is no such thing as a single truth. Instead knowledge is divided into four quadrants. Two are exterior (Individual) and exterior (collective--social). Wilber puts these on the upper and lower right sides of his scheme. On the left side he puts interior truths, which again he divides into individual and collective--cultural. Thus regarding the above example Wilber might argue that one aspect of truth is the exterior individual--what we can see--Gianfriddo catching a ball hit by Dimaggio. This event, however, does not take place in isolation, thus there is a social aspect to it--baseball and the physical environment of the World Series. Turning to the left side of the quadrant we have those aspects of truth that have to do with mental processes. First there are the internal thoughts of indivduals. These will differ according to the views held by such individuals. Those who supported the Dodgers will feel happy, while Yankee fans will be despondent. Those who do not care about baseball will be indifferent. Finally, there are those internal collective views, namely the attitudes and beliefs of the society toward baseball in general. In sum what Wilber is saying is that all the world's cultures have important, but partial truths.Wilber traces the development of truth over time starting from the earliest recorded history. Initially the interior forms dominated with religion, magic and other spiritual considerations forming the basis of what is regarded as true. But with the enlightenment and the development of science, truth became reduced, to use his term, and everything collapsed into the right side of the paradigm. Truth became only that which could be seen and measured and the left, or inner, interpretive side became ignored. Thus what Wilber is trying to do is to integrate the innner and exterior aspects of truth, both for individuals and the larger society.Much of the book is quite esoteric and difficult to understand. Wilber makes reference to numerous ideas and philosophers that the average person has little knowledge of. Thus to try to understand the book in minute detail would be time-consuming and difficult. Rather it is more useful to realize his basic points and see how they relate to present-day thinking.Wilber also provides insights into how ideas developed. For example he shows how women's rights are connected to the development of agriculture. He also provides summaries of his main points so that the reader can get a better grasp of his ideas.All in all this is an interesting and thought provoking book."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Ken Wilber is, in my opinion, one of the most over-rated popular writers of this time. The recent publication of his 'collected works' is only further evidence that his ego is about as large as his photo on the cover of this book.It may be fashionable in some circles to stand in awe of someone who throws around names of researchers in specific fields of study like Santa does with candy. However, this is not enough to show that he has adequately mastered any of these fields. When stripped of these and other ornaments, there is actually very little substance left.My one major objection to his theories is that he is apparently unaware how his own cultural bias shapes his thoughts. The division of everything into four quadrants (one/many and subjective/objective) is a Western division. It is by no means universal. These quadrants are so fundamental to his reasoning that what he claims to be a universal theory of everything is little more than the millionth Western view of reality. To the extent that he integrates diverse worldviews, he all makes them fit within his own biased scheme.Secondly, he talks about 'higher' forms of consciousness as if he knows them like his back pocket. He sees the 'non-dualistic' as the highest form of consciousness. This is clearly speculative and not based on any facts. One would think that in this day and age, transcending the 'us vs. them' duality would be the next step. This duality lies at the core of almost every conflict we see today. If Wilber was right, peace would be a very long way off.I have heard some people say in an admiring tone how they 'were trying to understand Wilber' as if he was the greatest genius that ever lived. Genius shows itself in simplicity. Sometimes, when someone is hard to understand, it is simply because they aren't making much sense. Ken Wilber is a perfect example."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Why did I ever pick this book up with any potential credence to its author? The title expresses all the ignorance of arrogant intellect known to us Western thinkers: to give a history of everything, back the Big Bang, or creation, or whatever else marks to you that point of genesis. The man purports to be an expert on anything he reads or thinks, and he is clearly gullible to this own ideas. Others laud him as as a synthetic thinker, who fuses Western ideas with each other and with Eastern ideas. Something will seem true to him, and then he tries to universalize it to humans, atoms, quarks, or anything else he can think of. I am forced to conclude that there are indeed thoughts in this man's head, but that does not concede that he is actually thinking.To give you an example, I recently saw a video clip of him doing a Q&A; session in which he was asked something about politics. To this he began a long discourse that started with the supposition that the Buddha was at once a staunch Republican and a staunch Democrat. Democrats locate the blame for poverty in society, and Republicans blame the individuals who are impoverished. Wilber asserts that if someone were hit by a car, the Buddha would say that it is the individual's fault because of their karma. At this I pressed 'stop' as I couldn't take it anymore. Three foolish assumptions: 1)that USA politics have such a deep spiritual quality that you can philosophically connect it with the heart of the Buddha's teachings. 2) that Buddhism has any use in politics. Wilber would be advised that Buddhism has more to do with enlightenment and disconnecting from the life cycle (known as parinirvana), whereas politics typically bind us to temporal concerns. 3) while the Buddha may have said karma is why a person gets hit by a car, I am hard pressed to believe that he would have advocated for the government to use this as a reason to let the driver off. Can you imagine the city writing to the family saying, \\"Sorry folks. Karma was at play.\\"One final point I would like to make is that Wilber also foolishly assumes that our scientific data of the past dating back to the Big Bang is complete. As a history major, I will tell you that quality history is based on the use of evidence. If there is little or no evidence, there simply isn't much we can say. That's in dealing with humans. Yet Wilber's line of inquiry is preposterous unless he has access to enormous amounts of scientific information from today to the Bang. Where was I when this explosion of breakthroughs occured?"},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"When he talks about stuff I know he is so far off, misconstruing and mistating, that it makes me doubt his discussion of areas I know less about.

Although I would like to have heard more about a God who would and can project a creation in the first place (A God with a more personal as well as impersonal(which Wilber seems to dwell on) flavor, I am still extremely grateful for his cogent and grand synthesis and can give it no less than a 5 star review...

The glaring obviousness of enlightenment gently taunts the mind that slogs through complexity in order to achieve the same ends. This is like a rich man driving his BMW through the ghetto. When I fall asleep on my arm and wake up with that cold, immobile limb, I suffer the pins and needles of rejuvenation, for they help me increase my potential as a being, rather than diminish it. How do we distinguish which pains are growing (integration) pains and which are disintegration pains? And Heidiggers question: what is a thing? Wilbur's &quot;thing&quot; is central to this philosophy. He takes Koestler's seminal idea of the &quot;holon&quot; (loosely defined as &quot;whole/part&quot;: a conceptually challenging concept like &quot;space/time&quot;) and builds his theory, as fairly as possible, around it. Important concept: the mere ability to form a cohesive conception that transcends (which means it also includes) yourself is evidence to evolution. Religion would be impossible without it. Thus, religion is not discounted at all, but certainly it is filtered through these eyes.I must be cocky in my conclusion: just as books on sex may be inappropriate for children, this book is not appropriate for those not seeking a higher conceptual balance; personally not seeking a higher conceptual balance. If you are not emotionally AND intellectually AND spiritually ready, you will surely find this book discouraging.

His ability to synthesize vast amounts of material is impressive, as is his literary output. However, his fundamental world view is philosophically inconistent and denies things sane people take to be true. His philosophy of nondualism (or monism) logically entails the elimination of the duality of good and evil. In some places Wilber admits this; in others he assumes the ontologically reality of good and evil. This is contradictory, and therefore, false. There is a thick contradiction at the heart of his worldview. No amount of meditation can dissolve that.Wilber speaks of enlightenment as beyond words and language, but then uses words and language to describe it. This, too, is contradictory, and, therefore, false. And on it goes. He takes the Ultimate or Absolute to be impersonal, thus leaving no philosophical explanation for ourselves as personal beings.

He sees the scientific method as reductionism, and has a quarrel with the concept that logic (or philosophy) can explain everything. All this while he makes extensive use of logic and science where it fits his argument.His theory of everything boils down to a somewhat unique blend of mysticism, or spirituality, and reasoning, through which he attempts to convey his holistic and all-encompassing view of God, Creation, and how Man fits in that picture. He rejects the Christian belief of a one-and-only God, consisting of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Instead, he is happy to include all of the above, as well as Buddha, Dharma &amp; Shranga, and who else you want to include as part of the same holistic view, culminating in the eastern belief that Man is part of the Kosmos, which is part of God. (Emptiness = Creation &amp; One = All.)In particular he finds fault with the &quot;flatland&quot; view of the new science, or Systems Theory, based on the recent discoveries regarding chaos and complexity, and how interrelated systems behave in an unpredictable environment. In his mind, these web-of-life theories differs from his interpretation in that it does not account for the concepts of absolute meaning, beauty, virtue and value. But, perhaps because they could be perceived as are rather closely related to his holistic view, they draw considerable criticism from him ( page 129).In total, he expects (a-la Lobsang Rampa, &quot;The Third Eye&quot;) the reader to throw out his preconceived ideas about the relevance of science and religion, without absolute proof, and without supernatural revelation, in exchange for another mother-of-all theory.The well trained scientist will classify Wilber's ideas in kind with perpetual motion. The sincere Christian will consider him dangerous, in his ability to distort the truth. The average individual might have a harder time to separate fact from fiction.On a positive note - Wilber does attempt to address some serious deficiencies in our view of reality. In some of his attempts he can even be described as brilliant, though his ability to synthesize meaning from cutting edge issues.The problem is - its just another theory. And by diverting his considerable talent into the realms of mysticism, without the tools of science and logic he forgoes the opportunity to use his talents in furthering real understanding. He might have done better if he had finished his studies at university."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"I think we are lucky to have ken wilber alived, because he writes a kind of books that bridge the gap between east and wester philosofy.

But that is only half of the problem. Are we to also conversely and in turn deny the truths disclosed to us by science and rational human knowledge?This is the problem; how to bridge these two aspects of reality if we KNOW that they are BOTH real? For these are no longer simple times that we live in. There is simply too much legitimate \\"smarts\\" out there in science, philosophy, psychology, anthropology, physics, etc., etc. to simply deny them and still be honest with yourself. Yet again, to the contrary of that, what to do if you KNOW there is more?Tortured with this problem and trying to wrestle out even some sliver of a solution myself, I finally came to the conclusion that the world of the 21st century needed something very unique and special; not just another scientist and not just another mystic. It needed an absolute, super high IQ brainiac genius with a super-compute mind who ALSO had legitimate spiritual experiences. Only such a person could ever solve the problem.And then I remembered Ken Wilber.I happened upon this book some ten years ago and the result was nothing less than sheer joy.

This refreshed my memory of that exercise. You have to really dig down and spend some time thinking about this stuff to have a chance at grasping it. The question becomes whether it is worth it? Is there a benefit from spending a great deal of time reading this guy's works? I do not have simple answer. I know very little about the man himself. I guess the first question would be whether he himself has risen to some higher level of conciousness as a result of his deep thinking here? I do see some applications of thinking about various social, societal, inter-personal interactions. I just am not sure yet whether i buy into this framework of thought."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Allow me to address the review from &quot;A reader&quot; from Tennessee. With all due respect, I believe he/she has misunderstood the entire message of Mr. Wilber's integral-transformative theory. Wilber's idea is to assemble all of the orienting conclusions from each field, which have incredibly important truths to tell us. For the moment we assume that these are, indeed, true. These truths are then assembled into chains and networks of interlocking conclusions into a coherent vision. He is open in his praise and admiration of these truths, but stresses that they are only partial, and often incredibly narrow perspectives.It is true that he often seems closest to a Zen Buddhist ideology, however his praise of organized religion in general, Freud, behaviorism and any number of schools of thought are stricly qualified.Wilber, as an example, is brutally critical of behaviorism's narrow interpretation of observable human behavior. He gives it credit for it's narrow scientific truth, while citing it's laughable culpability as a &quot;world view.&quot; He believes this type of reductionism is ultimately destructive.Does Wilber just &quot;take what he wants&quot; from these ideologies? No. He honors the truths that come from one &quot;quadrant&quot; or another in his model and attemts meld this deep fragmentation into a more wholistic vision. It becomes fairly obvious which fields, theories and schools of thought fall into which quadrants, if you grasp the concept.If you demand that Wilber conform to any kind of &quot;universal&quot; dogma you will be dissapointed and miss the message of perhaps the greatest modern philosopher of our time. This is a book of startling clarity and depth of understanding. He won't placate or coddle you, he gives it to you straight, and then it's up to you to try your own experiment. You must do the WORK."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Ken Wilber is an important thinker who is waiting for an audience to rise to the right level of consciousness to fully appreciate what he is saying. In this introductory and relatively easy-to-read book, Mr. Wilber outlines many of his mind-opening ideas. Although it may be easy to get lost in his \\"holon\\" concept, some DNA-like idea that holds the code to the full slice of spiritual and physical existence, other concepts are worth studying and understanding, because they have to be true. Chief among these is Wilber's presentation on states and stages of human development. In a nutshell, consciousness flowers in slow-motion; it first cares only about base existence, eating, sleeping, and sex, and then gradually moves on to appreciating the family, the community, the village, the nation, the world, the unverse, the unity of all things and beyond. (While this sounds like Hegel, that is a good thing, because Hegel was on the right track.) Importantly, Wilber emphasizes that once someone reaches a stage of consciousness, once you see that your soul is connected to the world at large, you cannot go back. You've climbed that rung of the ladder. States of consciousness, in contrast, are more like temporary \\"highs,\\" rushes of expanding awareness driven by mediation, exertion, concentration, or drugs. But these states often give only a glimpse of a higher stage -- like a sneak look at the answer book -- but the glimpse may make the transition to the higher stage come faster.So why is this book important? Because higher stages of consciousness are good. They make us see farther forward and backward. They make a person appreciate what they they already have and see a deeper connection to the power and beauty of the world. Books like this one are the product of an advanced stage, and are easier to understand as one climbs their own ladder."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"How does a Seeker of knowledge download 2,000 plus years of human history in a few days of reading?

He speaks out fervently against the concretization of thought in the form of dogma of any type as, in essence, the lazy way out. His work challenges us all to use these wonderful minds in an ever expanding search for higher truth rather than relying on the trite, sound-bite phraseology of the tiny mind. He is very understandable in his descriptions of the growth processes and makes his key points both releveant and clear, however I suggest a basic comprehension of evolving systems theory, some knowledge of Buddhist philosophy and an understanding of history in addition to an open, questioning mind to assist in the absorption of this material.

Wilber has found it."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"An interesting, well written, and occasionally poetic, philosophical monologue about the spiritual limitations of modern science and an explanation of Ken's holistic flavor of the \\"correct\\" way to interpret reality.Critique: Wilber sounds more like a preacher or a sage than a fellow seeker of the truth. He sees the scientific method as reductionism, and has a quarrel with the concept that logic (or philosophy) can explain everything. At the same time, he makes extensive use of logic and science where it fits his argument.His \\"Theory of Everything\\" boils down to a somewhat unique blend of mysticism, or spirituality, and reasoning. Through it he attempts to convey his holistic and all-encompassing view of God, Creation, and how Man fits in that picture. He rejects the Christian belief of a one-and-only God, consisting of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Instead, he is happy to include all of the above, as well as Buddha, Dharma &amp; Shranga, and who else you want to add as part of the same holistic view, culminating in the eastern belief that Man is part of the Kosmos, which is part of God. (Emptiness = Creation &amp; One = All.)In particular he finds fault with the &quot;flatland&quot; view of the new science (Systems Theory) - which is based on the recent discoveries regarding chaos and complexity, and how interrelated systems behave in an unpredictable environment. In his mind, these \\"web-of-life theories\\" differs from his interpretation, in that it does not account for the concepts of absolute meaning, beauty, virtue and value. But, perhaps because they could be perceived as rather closely related to his holistic view, they draw considerable criticism from him (page 129).In total, he expects (a-la Lobsang Rampa, &quot;The Third Eye&quot;) the reader to throw out his preconceived ideas about the relevance of science and religion, without absolute proof, and without supernatural revelation, in exchange for another mother-of-all theory.The well trained scientist will classify Wilber's ideas in kind with perpetual motion. The sincere Christian will consider him dangerous, in his ability to distort the truth. The average individual might have a harder time to separate fact from fiction.On a positive note - Wilber does attempt to address some serious deficiencies in our view of reality. In some of his attempts he can even be described as brilliant, though his ability to synthesize meaning from cutting edge issues.The problem is - its just another theory. By diverting his considerable talent into the realms of mysticism, and without the tools of science and logic, he forgoes the opportunity to use his talents in furthering real understanding. He might have done better if he had finished his studies at university."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"This is a thrilling, sometimes repetitious, but ultimately rewarding book. And while this is the first one I have read by Ken Wilber, it will certainly not be the last.\\"A Brief History of Everything\\" is structured dialogically, a series of interviews in which Wilber plays both himself and his interlocutor. The structure is both accommodating and sophisticated: one the one hand, the dialogues create a conversational tone, and this makes Wilber's ideas more readily accessible to a general audience than a more formal, academic style might; on the other hand, since intersubjective communication is so essential to Wilber's theory of integration, form follows function as well.I think it is only natural to make comparisons, and while I was reading this I kept thinking of Sartre's \\"Being and Nothingness.\\" Like that text, this one takes a bit of getting used to, but once you are immersed in the language things come together. Wilber is much more accessible than Sartre, and certainly more inspiring. Indeed, reading Wilber is a bit like reading Sartre or Heidegger, but without the dread.Don't get me wrong: his message is urgent; the philosophical foundation he is trying to build in justification of what he calls integration is as imperative as it is challenging. But there is also a certain reassuring optimism in this book--nowhere explicit, but everywhere implicit. In this sense, he reminds me of the British existentialist, Colin Wilson.Colin Wilson is more inclined to draw from literature and mysticism, whereas Wilber tends to stick more to philosophy and comparative religion (and his breadth of knowledge is intimidating). Moreover, whereas Wilson at times risks sounding New Age, Wilber expressly rejects any facile, feel-good solutions to existential problems.I enjoyed this introduction to Integral Theory, and highly recommend it to anyone interested in existential philosophy (which it is not), environmental studies, the evolution debate, gender studies, the history of ideas, et cetera. Not all of these topics are developed in depth, but they are all pertinent to Wilber's attempt at a systemic philosophy, and even when he perhaps fails to convince, he nonetheless succeeds in provoking thought and challenging conventional beliefs.This is philosophy, not self-help. But it may be the most helpful philosophy book you read."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"I purchased this revised edition through Amazon, and like it as much or more than I did the original version.

But the book was very interesting and I admit I was challenged in my own thinking about spirituality and having respect for different traditions."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Ken Wilbur is so brilliant that it is frustrating to read this book. By using complex multi-level models and charts, he is basically saying that we need to bring left brain and right brain, science and theology, creativity and logic, etc. together for a new paradigm. Having advanced through periods where religion dominated our culture followed by science dominating our culture, history suggests we are now ready to face the Millenium by bringing together these formerly unreconcilable areas. I believe this is Wilbur's central message and, indeed, good news for humanity."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"\\"A brief history of everything\\" is a good introduction to the thinking of Ken Wilber. I haven't read his magnum opus \\"Sex, Ecology, Spirituality\\", but this book seems to be a condensed version of it.Wilber's message or project is known as Integral Theory. It's a bold attempt at a grand synthesis of science, metaphysics and spirituality. The sources of inspiration are varied. With some difficulty, I could make out humanistic psychology, Hegel, Tibetan Buddhism and Plotinus. Admirer Michael Zimmerman has called Wilber neo-Hegelian, but Wilber is more appreciative of Hegel's rival Schelling. Apparently, Sri Aurobindo (whose works I never read) is another important source of inspiration. Critics have accused Wilber of interpreting these and others thinkers in somewhat idiosyncratic fashion, but that may be inevitable since the author attempts to integrate their perspectives. Poor Charles Darwin has been decisively left out of the new synthesis, however.In a very broad sense, I suppose Wilber could be called \\"New Age\\". However, there seem to be important differences between Integral Theory and what usually passes for New Age. One is Wilber's positive view of modernity and sharp criticism of eco-spirituality, Gaia theory, and the like. In his view, this is pre-personal rather than transpersonal spirituality. Wilber attacks political correctness and criticizes multi-culturalism, which in the context of American politics is usually considered conservative. His call for a World Federation sounds more new agey, however, but will rub the more conspiracist subcultures within the New Age milieu the wrong way. Wilber never mentions channelling, angels, demons or space aliens, which presumably mean that he doesn't believe in such.Another difference with more standard New Age thinking is the strong attempt to sound rational and scientific. New Age flakes also use \\"science\\" as a cover, but their incompetence is obvious. Wilber apparently wants his Theory of Everything to be seriously discussed in scholarly circles (a few scholars have taken the bait, such as Zimmerman). An obvious weakness at this point is Wilber's pseudo-creationist arguments against standard Neo-Darwinism, a rather strange move for somebody who has a evolutionary perspective on the cosmos. May I suggest Paul Davies or Simon Conway Morris instead?Personally, I found Integral Theory extremely curious. Wilber's real perspective is a nondual form of mysticism, similar to the most advanced levels of Buddhism and Hinduism (\\"maya is Brahman\\"). But if that is the goal, what on earth is the point of the grand synthesis of science, philosophy and spirituality, the scholarly ambitions, all the quadrants, levels, and what not? Why not simply concentrate on the mystical experiences? What need is there to know how postmodernity should be integrated with systems theory or intelligent design, if the goal is to become one with Maya-Brahman?Somehow, Ken Wilber's Brief History of Everything seems redundant."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"This book is a great book to start with if you are interested in Wilber's work and have some background knowledge in philosophy and the social sciences. It is easy to get into since it is in a conversational format and gives you are general picture of his theory without going into much technical detail. If you like a discussion of this material at a slightly more \\"micro\\" level such as \\"how does this apply directly to your everyday life\\", I'd highly recommend Toru Sato's \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" as another book along those lines.

I recommend it as the best first Wilber book, as a relatively accessible introduction to his thought. That said, this is not a popular market &quot;spirituality&quot; book. There is a lot of meat here.I am among those who think Ken Wilber is one of the great thinkers of our time. His great contribution to world thought is as an integrator of a staggering breadth of philosophical thought, psychological research and accounts of mystical experience. He maintains that each of the wisdom traditions and methods of inquiry into human experience has at least some valid contribution to make. He then sets about the daunting task of finding the ground upon which they all can be said to agree and integrating them into a theoretical structure that can be used to understand how, though no single discipline can present the whole truth, all can deliver a piece of it. For example, it is not that neuroscience is right and mysticism is wrong or vice versa. They are both right but incomplete. There really are neurons that can be observed to behave in certain ways. But that is not, and cannot be, all there is to say about human experience. Wilber succeeds establishing an integral theory of consciousness that draws from the wisdom of all the traditions of inquiry to a greater extent than any other thinker I have read.I have read nine of Wilber's books so far, and I think this is the best one to start with, if you are interested in looking into his work. For those who have read some of his other work, this is a good, succinct overview of his system that can be a useful look at the forest when you get immersed into some of the more detailed material about the trees."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"[For full review, see forthcoming, Torosyan, R. (2001). A system for everything: Book review of K. Wilber's Brief History of Everything. New Ideas in Psychology, 19 (3).]Wilber manages to create a sweeping system for everything in life. He describes our spiritual evolution, and our dominant conceptual concerns: East and West, ancient and modern, individual and collective, physical and metaphysical. Wilber writes in an accessible common-sense style. He deliberately avoids a typical scholarly tone. While not free of some pretense at a monolithic voice, his work promotes rich conceptions of self-reflexiveness, interconnection, spirituality and empathy.Wilber shows how the major theories of biological, psychological, cognitive and spiritual development describe different versions of how to find &quot;the truth.&quot; At the outset, Wilber refers to Douglas Adams's best-selling cult novel Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. We desire final conclusions, just as Adams facetiously proposed the &quot;answer that would completely explain 'God, life, the universe, and everything'&quot; (p. xv). In the novel, that answer was &quot;42,&quot; highlighting the absurdity of seeking such a final answer.Wilber's &quot;answer,&quot; instead, is a framework for connecting evolutionary currents. At first, he uses a Socratic dialogue, beginning with &quot;KW&quot; for Wilber and &quot;Q&quot; for the questioner, be s/he reader, fan, or friend. Initially, this appears somewhat contrived. The text pretends to be an interview, when it is clearly the author's own highly controlled construction. Upon further reading, however, the stylistic device helps Wilber engage the reader in a dialogue.To Wilber, traditions of thought have usually been either &quot;ascending&quot; toward transcendental spirituality, or &quot;descending&quot; to the body, the senses, and sexuality (p. 11). The author suggests that humans must integrate dualities to survive as a species. In fact, we must not merely synthesize but accept the &quot;nonduality&quot; of ascending and descending, mind and body (p. 12).Wilber's first chapter presents a brief summary of the entire book in the voice of the questioner:Q: So we'll start with the story of the Big Bang itself, and then trace out the course of evolution from matter to life to mind. And then, with the emergence of mind, or human consciousness, we'll look at the five or six major epochs of human evolution itself. And all of this is set in the context of spirituality-of what spirituality means, of the various forms that it has historically taken, and the forms that it might take tomorrow. Sound right?KW: Yes, it's sort of a brief history of everything...based on what I call 'orienting generalizations' (p. 17)&quot;Q&quot; is obviously more highly informed than a first-time reader. Wilber uses Q less to ask questions than to help simplify points [the book summarizes the more complex content of Wilber's massive Sex, Ecology, Spirituality (1995)]. The &quot;generalizations&quot; he notes are Kohlberg's and Gilligan's moral stages. &quot;Human moral development goes through at least three broad stages&quot; (p. 17). In brief: before the child is socialized, it is &quot;preconventional,&quot; as it learns the values of society it becomes &quot;conventional,&quot; and eventually it may reflect on its own values critically, becoming increasingly &quot;postconventional.&quot;Wilber goes on to show a number of &quot;tenets&quot; or &quot;patterns that connect.&quot; The first of these is that &quot;reality is composed of whole/parts, or 'holons'&quot; (p. 20). A holon is something that is itself &quot;a whole and simultaneously a part of some other whole&quot; (ibid.). Borrowing from Arthur Koestler, Wilber argues that the world is full of &quot;holarchies,&quot; as opposed to hierarchies. Where a hierarchy typically separates distinct parts, a holarchy consists of both wholes that are parts, and parts that are wholes. For example, an atom is a whole of its own, but also a part of a whole molecule. A whole molecule is a part of a whole cell, and a whole cell is part of a whole organism. As Wilber says, &quot;Time goes on, and today's wholes are tomorrow's parts&quot; (ibid.).Wilber uses the ideas of &quot;depth&quot; and &quot;span&quot; to say that whenever we map a territory, something always gets left out. For instance, as we narrow focus with a microscope, &quot;There are fewer organisms than cells; there are fewer cells than molecules; there are fewer molecules than atoms; there are fewer atoms than quarks. Each has a greater depth, but less span&quot; (p. 34). Similarly, if we move from mysticism and psychology, into biology and physics, the progression gives greater depth of specific detail but less span, embrace, or inclusion of levels of reality (pp. 36-38). These dimensions are neither dependent nor independent, but interdependent.Great shifts in &quot;reality&quot; paradigms were brought by what Wilber calls &quot;the watershed separating the modern and postmodern approaches to knowledge&quot; (p. 58). Postmodernists criticize old paradigms such as &quot;the Enlightenment,... the Newtonian, the Cartesian, the mechanistic, the mirror of nature, the reflection paradigm&quot; (ibid.). In opposition, many postmodernists propose that &quot;all truth is relative and merely culture-bound, there are no universal truths&quot; (pp. 62-63). But as Wilber notes, even Derrida now concedes the elemental point that worldviews are not &quot;'merely constructed' in the sense of totally relative and arbitrary&quot; (p. 62). In Wilber's diagnosis, assertions that &quot;there is no truth in the Kosmos, only those notions that men force on others,&quot; are nihilistic, replacing truth with &quot;the ego of the theorist&quot; (p. 63).As a tool to place different worldviews, Wilber uses &quot;four quadrants of development&quot; (pp. 71-75). The exterior form of development is measured objectively and empirically. The interior dimension is subjective and interpretive, and hence depends on consciousness and introspection. And both interior and exterior occur not just separately but in social or cultural context.Wilber describes how Foucault summarized the &quot;monological madness&quot; that dominated the eighteenth century and Enlightenment notions of the subject: &quot;the subjective and intersubjective domains were thus reduced to empirical studies-I and we were reduced to its- and thus humans became 'objects of information, never subjects in communication'&quot; (p. 269). Treated as objects, people were expected to meet norms of mental health, for instance, while their subjective position in the world was ignored.Wilber says the whole of his morality aims to &quot;protect and promote the greatest depth for the greatest span&quot; (p. 335). He argues we must use these criteria when we make judgments. Although the spirituality risks opacity, the overall effort suggests deeply researched and grounded ways to structure reality. If we as a society need human empathy for multiple perspectives, then the patterns of thought laid out by Wilber provide a system for integrating such perspectives. Distilling messages of vast ranges of thought, Wilber presents highly differentiated worldviews and multiple points of intervention through which we can, if contingently, take action."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"This is a disappointing book. I had read a couple of Wilber's earlier books and liked them, especially the superb \\"Grace and Grit.\\" At his best, he can be very good at explaining a nondualistic Eastern style philosophy.As the title suggests, this book is meant to introduce people to an all encompassing metaphysical system. No one could attempt such an enterprise without a little hubris. But why stop at a little? Wilber is fond of dropping the names of long lists of famous intellectuals whose work he finds consistent with, but subservient to, his system. Reality is sliced and diced in an endless taxonomy of levels, holons, stages, paradigm shifts, quadrants, centers, spheres and fulcrums before being reassembled into a nondualistic whole. Anyone satisfied with scientific explainations is dismissed as a \\"reductionist\\" holding what he calls \\"an insane world view.\\" The science based world view is not so much argued against as it is insulted, dismissed and misrepresented.The most remarkable thing in this book is it's bizzare description of neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory. He makes the astonishing claim that very few theorists believe in Darwinian evolution and that, \\"There is no evidence whatsoever for intermediate (fossil) forms.\\" Wilber maintains it would take at least a hundred simultaneous beneficial mutations for something like a wing to evolve. He claims this would have to occur separately in both a male and a female who would then have to mate successfully. This is a grotesque caricature of Darwinan theory. Anyone who thinks it is adequate should buy this book. Others should read Richard Dawkins \\"Climbing Mount Improbable.\\" Wilber never names any scientists who advocate this version of evolution for the very good reason that there aren't any.What accounts for this straw man caricature of the most foundational scientific theory in modern biology? Well, Darwinian theory predicts that two species competing for the same niche will compete very fiercely. Wilber's Hegelian style spirit based pantheism competes with a science based pantheism in the tradition of Spinoza, Darwin and Einstein.This book is written in a question and answer format. I bought it on audio cassette. The questions were read by a young woman. Her tone indicates she is struggling to understand. She is always co-operative and eager to receive the wisdom from on high. The answers are read by a man. His tone is authoritative and patiently condescending. This is perfect for the text.Here is a one sentence sample, from the book, of Wilber's writing at it's worst: \\"So we have some very popular theorists who, tired of the burdens of postconventional and world-centric rational perspectivism, recommend a regressive slide into egocentric vital impulsive polymorphous phantasmic emotional revival.\\" Like Hegel, Wilber has attracted legions of readers who assume that his most incomprehensible writing must be his most brilliant. If you are willing to make that assumption, this book will delight you."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"To me as a scientific minded person approaching spirituality but having a hard time integrating the two, this book was a landmark.Not only does the book give an excellent structure where all sorts of wisdom and knowledge may live side by side in a friendly manner, but on the personal level it helped me at least intellectually to unify various aspects of myself and my life.Lately I have read large amounts of buddhist texts, new as well as traditional. This book takes a wider perspective and helps me relate my spiritual understanding and experiences in framework where it can co-exist with everything else I know about biology, physics, psychology, etc.I recommend this book to everyone with an open mind that has the capacity to understand and grasp the subject and has any interest in science, psychology, philosophy, religion, history, feminism, biology.I have already one other book by Wilber in my book stack, and I'm sure I will at least buy and read a few more before I move on."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Ken Wilber shows us that although we all take different roads in life, we share a common direction in our development and evolution. He brings together a vast number of theories and observations and organizes them into one theory. It is quite amazing!

If you'd like a shorter, more simplified but extremely well-organized / well-articulated book that covers this material, I strongly suggest &quot;The Ever-transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. It also discusses practical implications of these ideas that make you feel like you could have saved a lot of hassle and confusion if you read it eariler in your life. Both Wilber and Sato are clearly two of the most advanced thinkers of our time."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Ken Wilber has written many many books discussing his beef against what he calls \\"flatland\\", which is characteristic of the western civilization as well as the modern world in general.

Although \\"Sex Ecology and Sprituality\\" is a scholarly masterpiece, this book is the easier to understand for the lay reader. If you are new to Wilber's \\"Comprehensive Everything\\" type books, I would suggest reading this book before reading his other ones. I think although many of us Wilber lovers struggle to fully understand and appreciate his vision, his books are a true joy to read. If you are interested in these topics, another book that is easy and enjoyable to read is \\"Rhythm, Relationships, and Transcendence\\" by Toru Sato. It is also a wonderful book on the subject-object differentiation (dual vs nondual)! Both books help remind us that although our world of objects is useful, the world of subjects is what makes it beautiful! Happy reading!"},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Through an unfortunate clicking error, I accidentally purchased a copy of Ken Wilber's opus \\"A Brief History of Everything.\\" I had read snippets of other Wilber books in the past and was saddened by my purchasing error when the box arrived from Amazon.I reminded myself, however, that in the past I had made other purchasing mistakes and had then been ultimately pleased by the book when I finally got down to reading it. That was not the case with \\"A Brief History\\".Armed with two undergraduate degrees, a doctorate, and a lifetime love of general reading on a broad host of subjects, I dove in. I felt that my education and experiences were both broad and narrow enough to decipher Wilber. I soon re-discovered that reading Wilber is like having your brain pushed through the extra-gooey sludge layer of popular intellectualism. His convoluted syntax is surpassed only by his wholly imaginary vocabulary. This kind of psycho-babble, new-age charlatanism should be reserved exclusively for the conversion of Silicon Valley CEOs to Wilber's zen-narcissism. The book should carry a safety warning for the general public. I am dumber having read it.Reluctantly, I gave the book two stars, for three reasons. First, the cover photo on the book is the largest head shot of any author ever. It would have never fit on the back jacket flap. Second, Wilber's child-like belief in a universal unitarianism refreshes my own desire to believe in the transcendence of human nature. (Unless you think he's just saying all this stuff to sell books and lectures to Silicon Valley CEOs . . .?!). Finally, I'm amazed that he could string so many imaginary words together and make them sound like sentences.Well, at least I got bubble-wrap."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"For any thinking person who's struggling with the schism between science, psychology and faith, this book has the answer. Mr. Wilber has an amazing mind, and in this book he simplifies his theoretical framework to make his brilliant thought easier to grasp. I disagree with the reader who complained about lack of references -- all the footnotes are available in his other works. This is the synthesis of his thought for those who want to understand, not those who want to nit-pick.For me, it's a life-changing book, showing the way to order my own thoughts and experiences. Wilber is the only writer I've come across, other than James Hillman, who helps me reconcile all my disparate reading and experience.In this book, he perfectly and succinctly outlines the growth process I see in my clients who are struggling to overcome dysfunction, find meaning in life and transcend their pasts.I am grateful for this book's influence in my thought, and in my work as a therapist."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"This is going to sound petty to most, but it hit me really hard.I saw this book in a store and, having heard a lot about Ken Wilber, I picked it up. Of course, I turned right away to the \\"Note to the Reader\\" in front. Within seconds I was gasping in disbelief. Here's why.Wilber begins with one of my favorite books, Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Great, I thought, a fellow Hitchhiker's fan! But, he immediately gets it wrong, seriously wrong, several times. I quote:\\"In Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a massive supercomputer is designed to give the ultimate answer, the absolute answer, the answer that would completely explain 'God, life, the universe, and everything.'\\"Wrong. It's \\"Life, the Universe, and Everything\\". No mention of God. Wilber continues:\\"But the computer takes seven and a half million years to do this, and by the time the computer delivers the answer, everybody has forgotten the question.\\"Also wrong. They never knew the question in the first place, and never realized they would have to know the question in order to understand the answer. Wilber goes on:\\"Nobody remembers the ultimate question, but the ultimate answer the computer comes up with is: 42. This is amazing! Finally, the ultimate answer. So wonderful is the answer that a contest is held to see if anybody can come up with the question.\\"Utterly, utterly wrong. There was no \\"contest\\"; a second computer was built to find the Ultimate Question. This computer was so large it was frequently mistaken for a planet, and was called the Earth by its inhabitants. Onward:\\"Many profound questions are offered, but the final winner is: How many roads must a man walk down?\\"Again, wrong. The Earth was destroyed five minutes before it was due to complete its program, and those who had built it decided to come up with a fake question rather than go through the whole thing again. \\"How many roads must a man walk down?\\" was what they settled on.So, that's four major mistakes in the first two paragraphs, about a book that's known and loved by many, many readers. If Wilber can't be bothered to get this right, then (I asked myself) how trustworthy could he be on a more serious subject such as \\"a brief history of everything\\"?I put the book down and walked away."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"For those who don't know (it seems likely based on these reviews that many don't), this is the same Ken Wilber who, not so long ago, was zealously promoting the works of the meglomaniacal cult leader Da Free John, a man who makes the usual claims for his type: to be the greatest avatar of all time, in possession of miraculous powers, and so on. Many of Wilber's ideas, here in Brief History of Everything and all of his later works, are lifted directly from \\"Master\\" Da, right down to the terminology, but he hardly stops there: he simultaneously manages to believe in literal Hindu-style reincarnation, Freudianism, Zen Buddhism, behaviourism, and any number of other things, dodging their inherent contradictions by taking only what he wants of each.His system is little more than a lot of decoration disguising a stitching-together of Freud and Piaget with Da and Aurobindo; correspondences to what he here and in later works calls \\"other quadrants\\" are always suggested but never specified. Similarly, his supposedly \\"inclusive\\" model simply ignores vast areas of the world religious traditions that contradict his theory, such as all of Western esotericism and the nearly universal idea that the proper number of levels of consciousness (his primary theme) is seven.That the seams in this crazy quilt are seemingly invisible to so many is due in part to the overspecialized (mis)education we are provided with; most of Wilber's readers probably aren't familiar enough with the vast territories he covers to realize that he subtly distorts all he touches to shoehorn it into his model. He comes across here and elsewhere as a self-assured filing cabinet stuffed full of data; but he never provides us with a single testable hypothesis, only a belief system consisting of a vague doctrine of inevitable progress. It is this in particular that makes his system so appealing to the academics, corporate CEOs and limosine new-agers that endorse it; it reinforces all their most cherished illusions. This is not to say that his books are without merit; his observations are spot-on when he isn't defending his precious system, and he builds a sort of holistic verbal bridge to places the intellectually or spiritually lazy will find new, but for those serious about transformation it is a bridge to nowhere."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Yes, this book is interesting. Wilber introduces some interesting concepts and ideas, and does a good job at explaining and describing them.However, it's also clear that despite his confident writing style, despite his broad knowledge about anything that may be related to personality and spirituality, he hasn't experienced all of these. So he writes as someone that read a book on skiing and he athletic enough to get an idea of how it must feel and what joy it must bring. But he doesn't know how it actually feels. And so, he writes in this manner about topics that I actually have experience with, and the way he writes shows clearly that it's not a difference of opinion that we are talking about here, but simply that he hasn't experienced it and as such, does not get it fully. The danger here is that he speaks as if he is an expert. Expert comes from experience, and that I can tell you he does not have on all the topics he writes.So a good book to introduce many different concepts and show all the levels of complexity that makes the human mind. But no, Ken is not a genius. He is just a guy, very educated on many topics."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"In this book Ken Wilber covers the topics of Sex, Ecology and Spirituality, in a conversational and very readable manner. If you have been trying to read through some of the heavier Wilber material and would rather have a down to earth conversation with the author, read this book. I also recommend his audio program, Kosmic Consciousness, for the same purpose.Gudjon Bergmann, author of Living in the Spirit of Yoga (2010) and The Seven Human Needs (2006)"},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"My first exposure to Ken Wilber was his Brief History of Everything, a book of incredible depth and scope, so I was disappointed when reading History of Everything to come across to glaring errors the first time I sat down with it. The first was his claim that only living things reproduce themselves. This is simply wrong; crystals, for instance, reproduce under the right conditions, and a proper mineral solution may be &quot;seeded&quot; with the crystal that one intends to grow. The second incorrect claim he made was that natural selection is not a strong enough force to explain the evolution of life on earth, in particular that is insufficient to explain the jump from Earth's early &quot;primordial soup&quot; to the earliest forms of life. For those who insist that Wilber is correct in this claim, I reccomend the works of Richard Dawson, a brilliant evolutionary biologist."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Look beneath the buzzwords and you find a patriarchal and repressive philosophy of life.Wilber claims our major problems are simply the growing pains of evolution.His answer is become like a Zen monk and transcend the world to live in pure spirit.He ignores the class nature of society and deliberate exploitation and alienation of people by others in the pursuit of power and profit.He criticises feminists and ecologists for not having complete answers, but at least they are concerned about the state of the world.He has nothing new to say.For example,Qabalah and hermetic thought(&quot;As it is above, so it is below&quot;) go a lot deeper into things than he does.We need individual and social action to create a better world, not the old hat Eastern navel gazing which he offers in this book.I recommend that Ken read &quot;Voices of the First Day&quot; by Robert Lawlor for some real insights into the state of things."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"This book is nothing short of incredible.

It awakened me to the true spirit of 'Common Sense', and sent me scrambling for other works by the same author. Ken Wilber is as enlightened as a Westerner can ever be, and his gift is the ability to share his wisdom - in a friendly and non-condescending way - with anyone who is prepared to receive it. If you're one of those seeking universal truths, don't miss this book!"},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Lyrical and pedantic and sweeping and groovy, these are the adventures of a brilliant analytical mind still clinging to the sloppy throes of New Age spiritualism before acknowledging Ultimate Truth of the Santiago Theory of Consciousness. Wilber is one of those quirky thinkers of the Millenium that navigates the murky waters of the science of the mind like a light bulb in search of a cord. Senseless sense, and all that. Amen?"},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"As a doctoral student in psychology, I can say in a clarion voice that Wilber is perhaps the most original thinker of the day. The book reveals a profound grasp of the broad sweep of philosophy - both East and West. The author also has and impressive, in-depth grasp of science and history as well. Aside from that, the book is engaging and highly entertaining. Having never heard of Ken Wilber prior to first reading his work in the last six months, I can say that he ranks among the foremost thinkers in the world today. I say this with more than a passing knowledge of philosophy. Rarely, since my first reading of Carl Jung, have I ever been so excited about someone's work. Read and find yourself on the ceiling!"},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"I am glad I read this book. It starts out as a brave attempt at a theory of emergence, which I think is badly needed. The four quadrant graph is a genuine contribution. The 20 tenets are nice. However, this book does not deliver its promise. To me, the rest is a confusing tale about consciousness, with many logical flaws and questionable conclusions. Disappointing is the lacking connection with Spiral Dynamics, coming up with different levels which deny the alternating \\"I\\" and \\"We\\" orientation. I hope someone will be/has been able to use the good parts of this work and integrate it into something better."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Through the ideas presented in this book, and their morecomplete treatment in &quot;Sex, Ecology, and Sprituality&quot;, KenWilber synthesizes the best attributes of the &quot;objective&quot;scientific paradigm with the wisdom gained through milleniaof contemplative and meditative traditions. Using an easilyreadable question and answer format, and an equally rare senseof humour, Wilber presents a strikingly lucid and convincingargument for the adoption of a more balanced world view whichrecognizes and honors the importance of subjective experience.Somehow, Wilber has produced a piece of work which isscholarly without being dry, and infused with a spiritualperspective without losing its focus and sense of balancewithin the dizzying heights. It is easily the best book ofits kind I have read."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Stuck in an airport and needing something to read, I bought this book on impluse. The beginning explanation of Wilber's comparative and synthetic approach was fascinating. I was fully engaged. I believe this line of thinking is very unique and potentially very productive.Very early on however -- page 31 to be exact -- Wilbur unfortunately demonstrates a clear and complete misunderstanding of biological evolution. There are not \\"discontinuities\\" in biological evolution as Wilbur claims and, therefore, we have no evidence for \\"self transcendence.\\" As this is number two of the twenty tenets that make up the \\"patterns that connect,\\" we have a foundational problem.I strongly recommend Daniel Dennett's \\"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\\" as a source of more insight. Dennett calls the theory of evolution a \\"universal acid.\\" For me, that acid quickly and thoroughly dissolved my interest in this book.Given both the promise of Wilbur's \\"meta-analysis\\" and his glaring mis-read of biology, I'm profoundly disappointed."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"The \`&Egrave;instein of the New Age\`holds forth in his unique and brilliant style on the history of world views and how to put spirit back in our life. If you have the patience to learn his jargon and read slowly there is alot of serious brainfood here.I read this and his Sex, Ecology and Spirituality(1995)with Hofstadter's famous Godel, Escher, Bach(GEB) written in 1980(both of which I have reviewed here). Wilber's work has many parallels with GEB, both of them massive works attempting to tie together disparate fields and different views of life. Unlike Hofstadter, who was mainly interested in the nature of intelligence, Wilber does not treat math, music or DNA, and he concentrates on world views that have a spiritual relevance. He spent a vast amount of time working out the relationships between ideas and how they relate to individual and society, spirit and science. Though he cites GEB(and almost every book of relevance in last 100 years!) he does not specifically use the GEB concepts of recursiveness, incompleteness, and tangled hierarchies. However, Wilber's holons nested in holons, criticism of incomplete ideas that either lack sense(eg, science) or soul(eg, spirit) and his diagrams and descriptions of the hierarchical nature of all holons are much in the spirit of GEB. Hofstadter spent little time on spirit(though Zen pops up now and then) and had little to say about the meaning of it all and has written little on the subject since.This is a much shorter and more accessible version of his famous SES(see my review). Unlike the former book which has hundreds of pages of notes and hundreds of references, there is not even an index here(though there is a 2001 edition which may remedy this). If you don't have the time or patience for the whole book, read Superconsciousness Parts 1 and 2 which are an xlnt summary. His shortest book, \`The Marriage of Self and Soul\`(see my review) is a much easier read that gives you a good idea of his style and purpose.He details alot of intellectual history(philosophy, psychology, religion, ecology, feminism, sociology, etc) and shows where nearly everyone went too far in the direction of Ascent(to the spirit) or Descent(to science,materialism, reductionism or Flatland). He trys to show how to heal the rifts by combining sense and soul(spiritual and material life, science and religion, internal and external, individual and social). Everything is related to everything else(holons in holarchies).The Age of Enlightenment denied the the spirit, the individual and the interior life but developed art, morals and science and led to democracy, feminism, equality and ecology, but this reductionism compressed the intellect and the spirit into the Flatland of science, rationality and materialism. He sees the loss of the spiritual point of view with the Age of Enlightenment as the major factor responsible for the malaise of modern times, but real spirituality or \`intelligent religion\`(ie., the quest for enlightenment) as opposed to \`primitive religion\`(everything else-see my review of Boyer's \`Religion Explained) was always rare. It is intelligent religion he sees as the panacea, but it is primitive religion that the masses understand, and it too has only materialistic goals.In this book, he never makes it clear that Jesus was a mystic in the same sense as Buddha etc, but what was to become the Catholic church largely destroyed his mystical aspects(personal search for enlightenment, no mind etc) in favor of primitive religion, priests, tithes and a structure seemingly modeled on the Roman army(but see his SES p 363). But for the early Christian church, the cognitive templates(see Boyer) were servants of the genes and enlightenment was not on the menu. Jesus was not a Christian, he had no bible and he did not believe in a god any more than did Buddha. We have Christianity without the real intelligence of Jesus and this, as he explains indetail in SES is a major cause of the West's extended stay in Flatland(reductionism).Wilber is a bookworm and he has spent an incredible amount of time analyzing classic and modern texts. He is extremely bright has clearly had his own awakening, and also knows the minutiae of Eastern religion as well as anyone. I doubt there are more than a handful in the world who could write his type of book.A major shortcoming is that most of the material he analyzes is of questionable relevance today. They use terminology and concepts that were already dated when he was researching and writing 15 years ago. One has to slog thru endless pages of jargon laden discussion of Habermas, Kant, Emerson, Jung etc to get to the pearls. He immerses himself in Freud and the psychoanalytic interpretation of dreams(eg, p92) , though most intellectuals now regard these as merely quaint artifacts of intellectual history.If one is up on philosophy and cognitive and evolutionary psychology, most of this seems archaic. Like nearly everyone(scholars and public alike) he seems not to understand that the basics of religion, ethics, society, in fact all human behavior, are programmed into our genes. A revolution in understanding ourselves was taking place while he was writing these books and it mostly passed him by(and most of society). The evidence(for those who need it) is accumulating rapidly that most of what we do and who we are is resident in universal programs evolved at least 100,000 years ago. Those who doubt this should start with Pinker's brilliant book \`The Blank Slate:the modern denial of human nature\`, Boyer's \`Religion Explained\`, and a couple recent texts with 'evolutionary psychology\` in the titles.Like everyone up til quite recently, the hundreds of authors he discusses lacked any real explanation for human behavior. Why do we even have such ideas and behavior? What are the methods we can use to find out? Everything happens below the surface. Possibly a few Zen and Hindu mystics got some insight into the mechanical churning of the cognitive templates but their explanations are invariably opaque to the rest of us. He seems unaware that his holarchy of the mind(except for top 3 levels) operates in everyone all the time due to its presence in our cognitive templates(and of course our genes).Though he has read some of John Searle's superb philosophy,and has passing references to research in cognitive psychology, it is amazing that he could extensively research philosophy without studying Wittgenstein, religion without reading Osho and psychology without Tooby, Cosmides et al. Much of evolutionary psychology was only published in journals at the time he was writing and Wilber has almost no references to journals among the hundreds in SES. But Wittgenstein is the most famous philosopher of modern times and Osho the most famous spiritual teacher. It is remarkable that although he spends so much time in his books discussing the intellectual aspects of therapy(Freud. Beck, Maslow etc) and clearly understands that the spiritual path is the ultimate therapy, he totally ignores Osho, who had the most advanced therapeutic community in history functioning worldwide for the last 30 years.A major problem is that Wilber is lost is the airy realms of intellectual debate. Basic biology gets the short straw. As in SES, probably the worst mistakes he makes(along with most of the planet) are ignoring and misunderstanding basic biology. On pg 22-3 he states that the eye and the wing have to evolve all at once and this has to happen in both sexes at the same time. On page 26 he says the chances of an enzyme originating by chance is essentially zero(true but irrelevant!). Elsewhere he says Darwin really does not explain evolution! Any intelligent high school biology student can refute this! Of course Darwin did not know genetics nor plate tectonics, but it is nevertheless inexcusable to make such statements without careful qualification.The brute fact is there are 6 billion sets of selfish genes carrying out their programs to destroy the earth. They are an acid that will eat through any intellectual conclusions, egalitarian fanatasies and spiritual rebirths. Selfishness, dishonesty, tribalism and shortsightedness are not due to accidents of intellectual or spiritual history. He says that the lack of spirit is destroying the earth, and though there is of course this aspect to things, it is much more to the point to say that it is selfish genes that are responsible. Likewise he says \`Biology is no longer Destiny\`, but it is an easily defensible point of view that the reverse is far more likely. The attempt to understand history in terms of ideas ignores biology and in particular denies human nature. Selfish genes always live in Flatland(his term for reductionism) and, as he noted elsewhere, less than 1000 people in all of human history have escaped the tyranny of the monkey mind into enlightenement.Another major problem(admittedly not unique to him) is that this is very elitist stuff. The aim is to rejuvenate humankind and maybe save the world, but I doubt most readers will persist to the end of these books and that they will come away a changed person. How is the realization that we can meld sense and soul going to change the world? It is Wilber's hope we can somehow be enlightened(figuratively or literally).Though he severly criticizes the excesses of the two movements, one could regard this as a deconstructive or postmodern interpretation of religion, philosophy and the behavioral sciences from a very liberal, spiritual point of view--ie, without the worst of the horrific jargon, rabid egalitarianism and antiscientific antiintellectualism. This is not a criticism of Wilber, but only to suggest that it might be useful to regard some of his books as belonging to this general movement.Wilber embraces a simple utilitarianism(greatest good for greatest number)--ie, the greatest depth for the greatest span(p334) but of course this has serious problems. Which people should we make happy and how happy and when(ie, now or in the future)? On what basis do we distribute resources now and how much do we save for the future population? He calls upon our Basic Moral Intuition(BMI) but it is not really to help others but to help ourselves, and the few thousand(or let's be very optomistic and say few million) who are spritually advanced do not run the world and probably never will.Instead of the intellectual or spiritual approach Wilber takes to history, others take ecological, genetic or technogical approaches(eg, Jared Diamonds book Guns, Germs and Steel). In the long run it appears that only biology really matters and we see daily how overpopulation is overwhelming all attempts to organize and educate the world. The democracy and equality which Wilber values so highly are just means created by selfish genes to facilitate their destruction of the planet. In spite of the hope of Wilber and many others that a new age is dawning and we will see the biological and physical evolution of a new human, the fact is that we are the most degenerate species there ever was and the planet is nearing collapse. The billions of years of eugenics(natural selection) that thrust life up out of the slime and gave us the amazing ability to write and read books like this is now over. There is no selection for the healthier and more intelligent and in fact they produce a smaller percentage of the children every year. Nature does not tolerate physical and mental aberrations but society encourages them. Our peak was probably CroMagnon man or maybe even Neanderthals(whohad larger brains) about 100,000 years ago. It seems plausible that only genetic engineering and an enlightened oligarchy can save us.In the USA, fundamentalist Christians and the Republican party are now the most powerful single force for planetary destruction. They are against population control and for environmental devastation in order to maximize the size and resource use of the human genome. This was a rational strategy when it was fixed in the genes about 100,000 years ago but it is suicidal now. The spiritual rebirth he talks about is not that of born again Christians nor of Islamic converts.If Wilber want to get his messages to the masses he will have to dumb down his writing and forget about trying to incorporate the worlds intellectual history. One if his primary messages is that spirituality(higher consciousness--ie the pursuit of enlightenment) is a scientific pursuit and so there is no conflict between it and science(though he only explains why in other books such as SES and Marriage of Sense and Soul). I fully agree, but the problem is that most of religion involves the mechanical churning of the primitive cognitive templates(see Boyer) and has very little connection with spirituality in the sense Wilber has in mind. He describes how Schelling and Hegel united nature and spirit but this seems quite irrelevant to society and even to Wilber, who presumably woke up with meditation and not by reading. Finally,(p307)he mentions that the West mostly lacks the techniques for uniting the two, which Zen has found long ago.He sayss(p329) that it is the poor and ignorant who are the major environmental problem and that this is somehow due to our Flatland approach, so if we just wake up, get spritual and help them out this will solve it. However, its clear that everyone is part of the problem and if one does the math(vanishing resources dividied by increasing population) it's clear that a drastic reduction in population is necessary. At the very end he tells us that one of the basic ethical principles is to do no harm, but to live( and above all, to reproduce), is to do harm and if reproduction remains a right then it's hard to see any hope for the future. Like so many, he emphasizes rights and says less about responsibilities. It is a reasonable and necessary view that if society is totreat us as human, we must accept responsibility for the world and that this concern must take precedence over our personal needs. Of course, it is unlikely that any government will ever implement this, and equally unlikely that the world will continue to be a place any civilized person will wish to live in."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Ken Wilber's book is separated into three parts, with the last chapter of the third part being an epilogue of sorts. I was riveted in the first two parts, partly bored in the third, and enjoyed the ending.The book is written in Q & A style, which I thought worked quite well with the subject matter. Although the questions were, of course, leading the reader to a certain path, it did help me think through the points the author was trying to make.The first part (\\"Spirit in Action\\") I thought of as \\"world evolution\\". This section lays the foundation of Wilber's thinking, how systems evolve, and proposes a four-quadrant approach for thinking about that evolution in a holistic fashion. The four quadrants encompass the inside and outside of the self (\\"I\\" and \\"it\\", the conscious and the physical) and the inside and outside of groups, or cultures (\\"we\\" and \\"its\\"). This leads to an discussion about world evolution, describing how the world has evolved from archaic to magic to mythic to rational and on.The second part (\\"The Further Reaches of Spirit-in-Action\\") I thought of as personal evolution. Using the same framework and providing background from psychology and philosophy studies, Wilber shows a personal evolution through \\"fulcrums\\" or steps (eureka moments?) as a person moves up the spiritual/thought evolution. Parallels are drawn between the world evolution and personal evolution, and it is reinforced constantly that this must be an integral approach, i.e., it cannot just be logical (\\"it\\") and it cannot just be consicousness (\\"I\\") but must be a non-dualistic approach.The third part (\\"Beyond Flatland\\") was a much too-long treatise on Wilber's opinion on why and how we have gotten off of the path of these two evolutions, personal and world. He makes quite a good argument, but goes to great lengths to categorize previous philosphers and thinkers into different buckets to prove his main point (which is that we have gone into many different dis-integrated directions, lead by the \\"Ego\\" set (logical thinkers without spirituality) and the \\"Eco\\" set (back to nature, everything is feeling) when we should be heading for a non-dualistic integrated approach). There is much too much academic argument in this section than there were in the previous two parts, and, while I am certain it serves the purpose of making Wilber's point, I found it slowed the book down tremendously, ala a textbook.The last chapter of the third part is a summary of where Wilber thinks we are now in our evolution and where we should go. This was a excellent ending to the book, pulling together his thinking of an \\"Integral Vision\\".This was my first Ken Wilber book. Although the Q&A; turned me off at first, the first two parts were quite readable and accessible. I reccommend those two sections for any and all. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Wilber's works."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Focusing on the book's successes rather than its failures, I would strongly recommend it, even to those people with a brain in their head who aren't just looking to get suckered in by some new-age schiester.Most of the negative reviews listed below make some very good points, but still strike me as a bit harsh overall. To take an illustrative example: Wilber's comments on Darwinian evolution are rightly criticized, but this criticim distracts from the reality that any problems with Darwinian theory are quickly exploited by religious fundamentalists promoting a god that fulfills all their \\"egoic inclinations.\\" Wilber is quick to point out that this is a non-sequiter: if there is a \\"creative force at work in the Kosmos\\", there is no reason to personify it or identify it with any particular cultural tradition's creation myth. To me, that point of analysis much more valuable than his using a sloppy example of \\"half a wing.\\" Point of fact: Wilber didn't come up with the notion of \\"punctuated evolution\\"; S.J. Gould did, in response to the nature of the fossil record. Futhermore, even assuming that all of evolution is fully explained by Darwinian natural selection (which I believe it is) the trends towards complexity and inegration that Wilber asserts are at work are still sufficient to support his statement that \\"creativity builds to Kosmos\\", although admittedly the structure of that phrase does imply a semi-personified actor called \\"creativity.\\"But a couple more critical points, just to be fair: Wiber's comments on \\"co-created\\" gender relations across culture types fails to recognize (as feminists have) the unfortunate critical role that physical violence played and still plays in defining gender roles. Also, his notion of a completely non-relational, undifferentiated \\"autistic\\" self in infancy was rejected by infant researchers and eventually by M. Mahler, whose theory of development Wilber seems to be relying upon.Despite plenty of foibles like these, Wilber's overall vision is impressive."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"I have just finished reading reader's comments and I find it interesting that Ken's biggest detractors on this page have spelled his last name wrong. Not only that, but their spelling in general leaves something to be desired. To be sure what is presented here is no great revelation for any serious student of philosophy- it has been written a thousand times before. But he must be commended on his unique and entertaining way of getting the point across. There is definitely something to be said about his fluency and the clarity of his thoughts. Here is a true scholar. I feel sorry for the readers not able to appreciate the truth and the beauty contained here."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"One of the best and most useful maps of the Kosmos ever conceived. A clear introduction to Wilber's seminal Integral Theory. Meant for the general reader, it is much less cumbersome than Wilber's more detailed and scholarly works. Wilber's effort is essentially an attempt to map together all known models of development from every field of knowledge, East and West. He discovers an elegant means of fitting them all together, which is brilliant in its simplicity and potent in its explanatory power. Basically, any given thing in the universe exhibits the essential aspects of the interior, exterior, individual, and collective, beyond which it cannot be reduced without damage. These aspects are mapped out in terms of the 4 \\"quadrants\\". There is an interior individual and an interior collective aspect to any phenomenon; likewise an exterior individual and exterior collective to the same. The dualisms of mind/body, self/other, spirit/world, etc are seen as different perspectives-- views from different quadrants-- of the same phenomena. Neither can be reduced to the other. In addition, phenomena can't be understood without reference to their levels or stages of development. Wilber discovers a \\"holarchy\\" (as opposed to hierarchy) of the evolutionary development in which individual phenomena, or \\"holons\\", tend towards both increased complexity and greater depth. This is essentially a process of the expansion of the contexts of identity from self, to community, to world, to universe, and beyond. This is the basic framework of Wilber's AQAL model (all quadrants, all levels). Sounds abstract, but Wilber breaks it down into the simplest and most relevant terms. You will view the world and yourself differently after reading this book."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"This book brings transcendentalism into its proper perspective. Ken's creation of the 4 Quandrants brings enlightenment to the very concept of enlightenment, making way for a clear mind to identify the all-inclusive reality of transceding the ego and returning back into the oneness of Spirit WHILE living healthily, honestly, and with understanding in this world of form. ALL who have seen the light of their true being, even if only a glimpse, MUST read this book. It not only serves as the proverbial \\"finger pointing to the moon,\\" but it also points to the science behind the moon and the steps that must occur before one can get to the moon, plus what the moon is NOT. Spirit is not merely consciousness, but it also manifests as birds, rocks, water, hair, teeth, and hands: spirit is the source of all, seen and unseen. Ken brings this to light in a most enlightening way, and gives you a few chuckles in the process. He also demonstrates the dichotemy of truth and fallacy that many Eco-based transcendentalists' and Ego-based transcendentalists' philosophies and beliefs hold.Buddhists, Taoist, Unitarians, Gnostic Christians, Spiritualists, Hindus, Sufis, Kabbalahists (more so you guys with the K than the Q) and a whole host of others will greatly appreciate Ken's years of research and practice that have culminated in this work. In short, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"Wilber, in essence, explains they way \\"things just are\\" in our world today.

Wilber devotes several pages to &quot;talking you into&quot; the One Taste ... and it works!Further, Wilber describes in detail the steps or &quot;rungs of the ladder&quot; a person can expect to transverse in the climb from the awareness of a newborn to ultimate vision. He describes problems one might meet in this aspiration to enlightment as well as his suggestions for eliminating deep, unconscious knots.A careful reading of this book could provide any aspirant with key tools and new understanding of both self and Self.

The book will be attractive to a large number of readers who are looking for an &quot;integrative&quot; approach to knowledge. As one with a philosophical bent, I appreciated the inclusion of Whitehead's Process Reality and Bergson's Creative Evolution, which have largely been abandoned by collegiate, philosophical departments. Einstein and Darwin are also included. Science, philosophy, wisdom, psychology, and spiritualism are all integrated into a nice coherent system.My only reservations are linguistic, which often is hokey, and tone, which is often authoratative rather than heuristic."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"I think the hardest critics of Wilber are the ones who do not consider someone as an author unless he/she is a hands-on scientist, artist or an academic title holder. Well, the purpose of this book is to present a theory covering many things that are already part of mankind's common heritage. Very few scientists -unfortunately- have time and/or stimuli to go through such grand amount of information and come up with a theory. As a non-academic in classical sense, Wilber does much more than many of the academics. I am an M.D. dealing with spiritual and psychological issues of patients and due to the nature of my work I am always in need of a deeper understanding of many aspects of life. Wilber's book is one of the resources that I use to achive that. Good work Mr. Wilber!"},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"I'd like to see Mr. Wilbur wrap his brilliant mind around more current information instead of western centric notions displayed in Cartesian format with an overlay of Buddhist meditation without the essence of spirituality.There is simply too much misinformation about societal developments, particularly in the Americas to take this work too much to heart.In the end, it was just more of the same dribble just presented with a little more clarity.'I was keenly disappointed."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Everything","review":"...I must confess to be a bit biased. That being said, the book is great. I recently loaned it to my next door neighbour who asked: \\"So, what is the book about?\\". I should've answered, instead of \\"Everything\\", with: \\"What is the book not about?\\".Indeed, charting the evolution of the cosmos (or Kosmos, as Wilber is prone to use the word, going back to its Pythagorean roots with the implication of one, seamless whole) in its four major perspectives (called the Quadrants, in Wilberese) and all of its levels is a gigantic task. Wilber pulls it off quite nicely, I think, especially as regards our post/postmodern age finally starting to develop (again) the healthy and invigorating need for a Grand Story. The story Wilber tells here can become enthralling to the point of religiosity (bad thing) or intriguing so as to let us stop in our tracks to behold the awe, the wonder and the ever-present mystery of being (good thing, friends and neighbours).The Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor has said that we currently live in a universe instead of a meaningful, orderly and intrinsically harmonious cosmos. Another thinker, A.O. Lovejoy suggested that the \\"great chain of being\\" from matter to life to - at least in Wilber - God has been the official philosophy of the Western world for the last, say 2500, years. Only in our age it has ceased to be so. Wilber's contribution is to try to help us return to kosmos: back to the philosophy that, indeed, should be - if not official - at least taught the basics of in our academia."},{"Title":"A short history of England","review":"Gilbert Keith Chesterton is certainly one of the most entertaining, and important, authors in the English language. This particular volume covers quickly, yet completely, the history of England from early Roman times to the time of the Great War, World War I. Chesterton is a man, I suspect, who would have been very hard to dislike. Though brilliant, he always approached his many opponents with a keen sense of fun and empathy. But he is certainly a writer who, though sometimes challenging, is always enjoyable.This wonderful, short, and thoroughly readable book can really be seen as a layman's philosophical representation of the great arc of English history. To grasp Chesterton's wit and wisdom entirely, it is probably important to have at least a nodding familiarity with English history before reading the book. But, so armed, the reader will be delighted with G.K.'s retelling of the great events of England, together with his insightful commentary relative to their import.Particularly poignant is Chesterton's rendering of the martydom of Saint Joan of Arc. He avers that, at one time or another, perhaps all British soldiers would have traded places with the common British infantryman who broke his spear to make a cross for the dying Saint. This section alone is worth the price of the entire book."},{"Title":"A short history of England","review":"If you love Chesterton, this work is full of the kind of cutting humor and cultural insight that is his best.

In this book, the normally witty Chesterton comes across as a cynical old man who longs for the good old days of medieval England when we had popes and kings and queens and guilds and common lands. He is quite snobbish in his rant against contemporary snobs, and he is anti-Protestant and anti-modern to the point of being tiresome.Chesterton actually viewed the English Reformation as nothing more than a power grab by the wealthy. He conveniently downplays the corruption and tyranny of the Roman Catholic Church throughout these centuries. He seems to think that the history of England is a downward slide since the days of the Middle Ages. Indeed, Chesterton was a Catholic medievalist who is still worshiped by Catholic medievalists today.Despite some nice sections, particularly on the Puritans, this book is tiresome and delusional."},{"Title":"A short history of England","review":"YOU'VE HEARD THE TERM \`HOT AIR'.

There were queues and queues of eager fans lining up to get their newly purchased books autographed by the fashionable duo. It was all very civilised, even though security guards were holding back the frenzied mob, while Boman and Blahnik relentlessly signed with tireless good humour and charm.Blahnik has been the ultimate cobbler to the stars since the Seventies, and Boman is a veteran, top photographer who's been photographing beautiful women for years (his most recent book, \\"Dames\\" show-cases his portrait-photogaphy). It's fortunate for Manolo that Eric came up with the novel idea of photographing his old friend's shoes. It was also conducive for the book that he supplied the witty 'photographic conversation,' for although Manolo's shoes are the most exquisite in the world, a book would have been pretty one dimensional with pedestrian sole snap-shots of his pumps without Eric's creative input.Boman has not only managed to produce imaginative photographs of the beautiful shoes, but has elevated Manolo's footwear to museum status. Thanks to his original and highly imaginative photographic compositions, the elegant pumps have been transformed into classical portraits.Boman and Blahnik's old friend Paloma Picasso has supplied the foreword, helping make this beautifully produced book a must have gift, especially for people with tasteful shoe fetishes and aficionados of superior glossy art books, the kind which are too exquisite to grace coffee tables."},{"Title":"Blahnik By Boman: Shoes, Photographs, Conversation","review":"The write-up about the book said it was brand new and the back of the book had a 1&#34; dent in it.

He also felt strongly that most churches spent too much time on the forms of religion and fail to play a positive role in man's everyday life.

But it soon became clear, a few pages into the first story, that this book is not so much about the joy of returning to Christ's family as it is about how awful those \\"other people\\" are--those other people being feminists and liberals. In other words, it is a book of polemic, not spirituality. I was sorely disappointed. Though there are some uplifting stories, overall it reminds me more of a rather snarky right-wing blog than anything else. I quit reading it, frankly, because it failed my basic test for spiritual reading: Does this increase my faith? Or does it make me feel like an outsider? I am not particularly liberal or conservative, but polemic from either side just irritates me rather than making me feel closer to God.

Unfortunately, this book consists of only 'conversion' stories. Although some of the women featured have grappled with gender issues, these women simply go back 'home'...but there is no clue as to how they manage thrive in a spiritual environment defined by, imaged by and controlled by men. It appears either they never really understood the issue, or it simply disappears from their horizons. Gender issues and feelings of exclusion need to be addressed by the Church in a much more compassionate and honest manner than has been the case so far (papal letters notwithstanding).

It provides the stories of 17 women who for various reasons left the faith of their youth only to later return to the Catholic Church. Their stories are compelling, honest, and inspirational.All of the women featured in the book were born during or shortly after the Baby Boom era. While the women themselves, and their stories, are quite diverse, they share a common pattern - their disillusionment with the Church, a replacement for the Church, and their eventual return to the Church.Leila Habra Miller describes her sadness at being robbed of her faith. \`How easily I could have lost it all! How easily my friends and contemporaries have lost or could lose a faith they have never really understood. Inoffensive, doctrine-free catechesis doesn't provide even a minimal foundation of faith, and faith built on so flimsy a foundation cannot withstand even the smallest challenge, (p. 263).' Miller writes. As interesting as their reasons for leaving the Church are the personal reasons for each of their returns.The book is written as much for faithful Catholics as it is for those who have fallen away.Reading such personal accounts, we are allowed to share in the pain and disillusionment of these women and learn from their mistakes. In their stories we are humbled and reminded of our own sinfulness. Like the story of the prodigal son, upon their return home, these women too, discover the loving embrace of a forgiving Father."},{"Title":"Prodigal Daughters: Catholic Women Come Home to the Church","review":"Cast in the mold of Patrick Madrid's collection of conversions to Catholicism, Surprised by Truth (ISBN 0964261081), Mrs. Steichen collects the honest, detailed, inspirational accounts of seventeen Catholic women who describe their journey back from the arid exile of feminism, libertarianism, and other spiritual wastelands, to full communion with the Church. A highly recommended tonic for those who cannot see how the Holy Spirit will ever reach the heart of someone in a situation like those portrayed here, and a source of guidance for those who might be in such a state themselves. And thank you, too, to each of the women who have opened their grace-filled stories to us!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Daughters: Catholic Women Come Home to the Church","review":"My great hope for this book was that it might help me to see more distinctly the problems behind the lukewarmness and, often, apostasy of my cradle Catholic loved ones. In fact, I have received these realizations and much more besides. Baby Boomers and Gen X-ers have come of age in a world focused on the rights of the individual above all, and in this important new work we witness that within the ensuing wildfire of protest there have been deeply personal struggles to find the meaning and purpose of life; burning desires (often well-concealed by stubbornness) to encounter something greater than ourselves.Prodigal Daughters is a collection of true windows into the souls of seventeen women who questioned the Faith of their youth. We find that they were, ironically, unwilling to accept that the Church is indeed that &quot;something greater&quot; they had so longed for. How glorious it is to share in their journeys home! My own eyes were opened in ways that surprised me, a convert to the Faith -- opened wide to reveal the real failings within myself which had, for so many years, obstructed my own search for God's truth. I had certainly not expected such an experience in introversion and I wholeheartedly welcomed it.Powerfully hopeful in its forthright display of these inner journeys, Prodigal Daughters is an invaluable resource for those willing to face honest testimony regarding the terrible impact culture-worship, self-worship and complacency have on our faith in God and His Church."},{"Title":"Prodigal Daughters: Catholic Women Come Home to the Church","review":"A riveting collection of true stories from 17 women of the Baby Boom generation who have completed their search for meaning.

A must read for everyone: priests and pastors who are observing a 'graying of the Church' and don't seem to know why the young are leaving; those who are worried about loved ones who have turned to drugs to give meaning to their lives; those who are searching for love by involving themselves in a series of sexual relationships; indeed, everyone can benefit by getting into the thoughts and minds of those who have been there."},{"Title":"Prodigal Daughters: Catholic Women Come Home to the Church","review":"As a woman who has returned to the Catholic Church after having left and experimented with other forms of worship, including New Age beliefs, I found myself identifying strongly with the 17 women who have related their stories here. For a woman struggling with secular issues that have been misapplied to matters of faith, this is a particularly helpful read; it puts you in touch with matters of faith, rather than matters of political correctness, delivering an over-riding message that we only transcend the world by looking at things through sacramental, &quot;godly&quot; eyes, not worldly ones. I thought the first essay was rather weak, and the writer a bit full of herself, but after that each essay was more and more compelling.

Don't you just love it when reviewers here slam a book without seeming to have read it? Like the reviewer who called it a &quot;shallow treatment&quot; and then proceeded to bring up the standard Liberal (NON-Catholic) criticisms of the Catholic Church. Catholicism is a clearly defined system of beliefs. Those who CHOOSE to believe it do not have to worry about &quot;Gender issues&quot; because the Catholic faith lies at a much deeper level of belief than modern politics does. Catholicism teaches that truth comes from God's revelation of HIS self rather than from some kind of left-wing political consensus. This book does a good job of displaying this truth in lives of real women."},{"Title":"Prodigal Daughters: Catholic Women Come Home to the Church","review":"Prodigal Daughters: Catholic Women Come Home to the Churchis collection of coming home stories that is open, honest, well-written, and hope-filled. These seventeen women with a variety of cultural and ethnic backgrounds, life experiences, and levels of faith formation discuss in detail how and when they strayed from the Catholic faith, and how God eventually guided them back to the Church.Some of these women came from very devout Catholic families and drifted from the faith, as so many do, once they were out on their own at college or in the world without anyone checking to see if they were going to Mass, participating in the Sacraments, making time for personal prayer, and thereby growing in holiness and closeness to the Lord.Many were disillusioned by the watered-down version of the Catholic faith they received growing up after Vatican II at a time when women's rights and sexual freedom were being heavily promoted. In most cases, God worked through a friend, spouse, child, family member, and/or a clergyman to guide these prodigal daughters back to the loving Father, the Blessed Mother, and the True Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.The most prevalent reasons for these women to abandon their faith for a time were that they got caught up in sensual pleasures espoused by the sexual revolution and feminist movement, became focused on winning worldly success, embraced New Age thought and practices, and/or were disillusioned by religious men and women who made the mistake of adopting ideas from popular culture and passing them off as Church doctrine, though they were and are clearly against the Magisterium.This book gives me hope for the many Catholics who have fallen away from the faith and may even condemn the Church and its teachings. These stories prove, yet again, that God doesn't abandon His Children, not even when we turn our backs on Him. He remains faithful to us always. He is the loving, enthusiastic, warm father who welcomes us with open arms however and whenever we finally hear His call to return home.One of the most poignant observations made by Archbishop Fulton Sheen which sums up this book so very well is that there are millions who hate what they think the Catholic Church is, but not a handful who hate the real thing.Lord, thank You for loving us so much that You never give up on us.

The women in the book share a wide range of life experiences, from having had abortions to having been involved in the New Age movement, these women all eventually, through the grace of God, came home to the Church founded by Jesus Christ himself. A common theme in the book is the damage caused by misinterpretations, etc.. of the Second Vatican Council. Many of the women describe how the \\"watered down\\" faith being taught by abusers of Vatican II, caused them to fall away from the true Church. Thanks be to God, Pope Benedict is calling the Church back to tradition! :) I recommend this book to mothers and fathers especially, since they are called to be the primary educators of their children. These stories may open the eyes of many lukewarm or complacent Catholic parents, hopefully giving them a good wake up call to put their Catholic faith first, for the sake of their children. I know it really made me think as a parent of 6!"},{"Title":"Prodigal Daughters: Catholic Women Come Home to the Church","review":"A previous reviewer was angry that this book did not show the way to go home.

Fr. Neuhaus famously said that when orthodoxy is not prescribed, it is proscribed. But proscribed by whom? By the official authorities of the Church. Certainly not the Popes, but sometimes bishops and often priests or religious.Many of these women came from very religious families. And this was the mistake they made: they trusted authority. Is this not a horrible commentary in a Church which (properly) regards authority as a legitimate principle (when exercised legitimately)? But when the parents went to a certain parish, school, or college, it was just fine; and they couldn't believe that the bishops, priests, and religious would, or even could, be so heartless and traitorous as to fail to teach the fullness of the Catholic faith.And nothing was done. Generally, the bishop did not directly teach error, but he seldom took action regarding those who did...as though immortal human souls were not at stake. And the terrible price these poor women paid, until they returned to the sanity of the Church--and rejected the madness of a falling culture. It is a price that many of us men paid as well.This is their story of how they made it back.

For decades a Hull House sojourn, or at least a visit, was virtually a pilgrimage for all kinds of progressive reformers. Jane Addams came from a conventional Middle American milieu, but was radicalized by seeing the ravages of the Industrial Revolution both in Britain and Chicago. This timeless memoir of the years 1889-1909 documents her wide-ranging concerns, embracing public health, pacifism and feminism as well as philanthropy, working-class education and poverty alleviation. Nationalist hysteria damaged Addams's reputation as a result of her antiwar stance during World War I, but it recovered enough for her to win the 1931 Nobel Peace Prize. Students had mixed views of book and author. To some she is a revelation, but others see her as rather sanctimonious (a fair criticism to some extent). Her prose is accessible but a little archaic now, sometimes appearing flowery or pompous, which deters some readers. While I respect and admire Addams, I waited in vain for the epiphany felt by thousands inspired by her life's work. People who find their own way to \\"Hull-House\\" will probably appreciate her more than those required to read her book---but such unsought exposure lies at the heart of liberal education, and brings many rewards."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull House with autobiographical notes.","review":"This is an inspiring book!

It was heart breaking in many ways to see how some people might live, and for sure it woke me up to reality. I am glad I read this book. If you want to read another book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull House with autobiographical notes.","review":"You have to be insane to like this book... wait... You have to be insane to even READ this book."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull House with autobiographical notes.","review":"Most of the people who reviewed this book were forced to read it in college, admittedly. A couple of them openly confessed to having given up part-way through. My question: Why are you reviewing the book you haven't even read? Granted, it's not a Hollywood film, but it is perhaps one of the greatest works of the 20th century, written by an author who stands on par with Gandhi or Mother Teresa in her committment to social justice. Think about it this way: Addams' settlement house (or Hull House, as it was called) was like an ashram built in the middle of Chicago's dirtiest late 19th century slum. She was doing social work of a kind that had never been done before - working with immigrants, single mothers, orphins, troubled youth and the unemployed. The scope of her sociological experience has never been matched. Politically, Addams was an advocate for the abolition of war, and these views not only secured her the Nobel Prize, but also a black-listing with the House of Un-American Activities. I don't see what is not to like about this book. It is autobiographical in the strict sense of the term, but Addams was larger than life. If you are even vaguely interested in ethics, social work, sociology, social justice, or democracy, Addams' story will inspire and amaze you. Her life was a paradigmn of exellence. It was a life that will inspire you to achieve greatness yourself. I cannot over-recommend familiarizing yourself with this figure, and 20 Years at Hull House is the best place to start."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull House with autobiographical notes.","review":"Like many of her fellow &quot;Progressives,&quot; Jane Addams was born in the midwest and received an exceptional scholastic and religious education. She was strongly devoted to her father and shared with him a reverence for Abraham Lincoln not just as a man, but as a living ideal against which all men should measure their ideas and actions. Typical of many reformers of her era, Addams was not attracted to evangelical duty. Missionary work left her with a sense of futile detachment from the wretched social conditions she witnessed in East London. After visiting Toynbee Hall, Addams decided to establish a similar settlement house in the rapidly-growing city of Chicago, where &quot;the evil and vices of American life seemed to be exaggerated.&quot; Her experiences at this settlement house are the subject of this book.Although, on the one hand, Addams seemed the typical Progressive; on the other hand she did not follow many of the ideas of the more radical reformers. She was very practical and refused to be swayed by the claims of certain social movements and untried panaceas. she did not become a socialist. Although she greatly admired Tolstoy, she found his message &quot;confused and contradictory&quot; and doubted its suitability to the situation in Chicago. She deplored any violent tactics associated with socialist and anarchist groups despite their &quot;noble motives.&quot; Addams demostrated an understanding of the ways in which strikes had a detrimental effect on people outside the labor movement (her dying sister was unable to see her family because the transportation system was blocked due to the Pullman strike. Unlike most reformers, she also had respect for the immigrant cultures represented at Hull House. A labor museum put native sewing machines and other instruments and crafts on display for all to enjoy.One observation made by this reader was the animosity on the part of European reformers toward the work of the settlement residents. Tolstoy offered petty criticisms and one English visitor concluded that reformers in America were indifferent to the plight of the poor because they could not recite the &quot;cubic feet of air required for each occupant of a tenement bedroom.&quot; Such remarks smack of a &quot;caring competition.&quot; Addams, however, was well aware that the settlement house experiment was far from complete. Jane Addams' honest and humble account--albeit long and sometimes rambling (don't let the skinny paperback fool you)--demonstrated her unwavering commitment to achieving the improvement and unity of humanity."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull House with autobiographical notes.","review":"Though Addams' prose often gets mired in the florid and highly mannered style of her era, this is a surprisingly compelling book. Free of the ethnic racism and stereotyping that blight many similar works of the era, Addams' account of her groundbreaking community center in one of the worst parts of late 19th-century Chicago fairly overflows with compassion and almost unbelievable fairness. Addams's intelligence is evident, and many of her ideas and attitudes seem decades ahead of their time. It's not light reading by any stretch of the imagination, but &quot;Twenty Years at Hull House&quot; contains many gripping portraits of the desperation of immigrant life and the simple power of human decency."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull House with autobiographical notes.","review":"Twenty Years at Hull House is an outstanding example of the humanitarianism movement in America at the turn of the century. Jane Addams, the author and narrator of the book, was born in Illinois. Early in her life she began to see the effects of poverty on people. She recalls one incident early in her life of seeing a homeless man on the street. She asked her father why that was, and he replied that that was just the way things were. Her father was a Quaker and the most prominate role model in Jane's life. As a child she grew up wanting to be just like him. For a while, she aspired to be a mill owner just like him. Her mother is not mentioned in the book at all. Jane went to Rockford College and soon toured London. It was there that she came up with the idea of the Hull House. Hull House was a settlement house in Chicago. It offered day care and college level classes for women. Spawning from her work at the house, Jane joined many causes that she passionately fought for. These causes included working hours for women, child labor laws, and juivenile court. She could be considered an early feminist. Also from her work at Hull House, Jane started studing the causes of poverty and the effects it had on society. She was not satisfied with just the success of her house; she wanted to know why there was a need for it at all. Later in her life she joined the womens sufferage movement. Jane Addams was a wonderful reformist and feminist that sought to better the country. Twenty Years at Hull House offer insight into one of America' most interesting time periods."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull House with autobiographical notes.","review":"I am doing a History Fair project on the Hull House.

She was also a leader in women's suffrage and pacifist movements. In 1915 she helped found the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She received the 1931 Nobel Peace Prize (shared with American educator Nicholas Murray Butler).The Hull House could boast a group of about 2,000 people a week. It had facilities including: a night school for adults, kindergarten classes, clubs for older children, a public kitchen, an art gallery, a coffeehouse, a gymnasium, a girls club, a swimming pool, a book bindery, a music school, a drama group, a library, and labor related divisions.The Hull House also served as a women's institution of sociology and Addams was a friend and colleague to the early men of the Chicago School of Sociology influencing their social thought of the time through her work in applied sociology, which became defined as social work by academic sociologists of the time. Addams did not, however, consider herself a social worker. She co-authored the Hull-House Maps and Papers in 1893 that came to define the interests and methodologies of Chicago Sociology. She worked with George H. Mead on social reform issues including women's rights and the 1910 Garment Workers' Strike. Addams combined the central concepts of symbolic interactionism with the theories of cultural feminism and pragmatism to form her sociological ideas."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull House with autobiographical notes.","review":"I enjoy reading about strong women with great vision.

What I enjoyed especially is Wood's charming illustrations of how the descendants of Irish immigrants in the U.S., many generations removed, still cling to the notion that they're as Irish as a penny whistle. I guess it just goes to prove that Americans secretly long to belong to something older and deeper with meaning than the disposable pop culture they find themselves in.All around a terrific read with a great protagonist.

The main character, Eppy, is part MacGuyver, part Fox Mulder, and part Mr. Mxyzptlk. He is a draconologist who comes to the Windy City to investigate robberies at art museums, and has a theory his family and the police don't particularly fancy. He embarks on a journey that is fast-paced and fascinating, providing an overall enjoyable read dragon lovers don't want to miss.

Clearly Huss had very good connections with many leading Nazis. William Shirer has said in one of his books that of all the correspondences in Berlin during this time Huss had the best relations with high ranking Nazis. Some people thought that Huss was pro-Nazi but it is clear reading his book that he despised them. Regardless, he was still able to get information that few others were able to obtain. He writes in detail about all the major figures including some that I'd never heard of, that got bumped off the Nazi train along the way. He even had a one on one interview with Hitler in November 1941 that is riveting in its analysis of Hitler. The details of Hitler's visit to Napoeon's tomb, personal meetings with Goering and Bormann, the treatment of Jews and Catholics, the runup to the invasion of Russia are all fascinating.This is an important book of that period and it is too bad it is out of print.

Much of what I read was very pertinent to my life as Christian today. It actually changed my life. I'll just say this...I don't want to get spit out."},{"Title":"The Book of Revelation","review":"First of all, it's important to understand that the author penned this reference book in 1919. Quite a lot has changed in the world in the last 90 years. As even he notes, the meaning of the book of Revelation was to be sealed until the time that it would become pertinent. Which is to say, nobody would quite get it until the events start to unfold and it all suddenly makes sense. I highly doubt a book that was written before commercial airplanes existed would present the best explanation for events happening in a world dominated by smartphones, the internet, debit cards, and did I mention commercial airlines?Be that as it may, it still explains the basics of eschatology fairly well, altho in a very culturally quaint way. In spite of its lack of modern sophistication it gets the main historical points right. But if you want to REALLY understand the end times prophecies, you'll need to dig a lot deeper than this book. And this is essentially the same as 90% of all eschatological reference materials, which mostly explain (wrongly) that the Antichrist will be a jew and will be accepted and outwardly benevolent by jews for a time. Or conversely, that he will be a pope and the allegedly revived Roman Empire will be the one world religion and government that will persecute the jews and christians.The problem with this author, having written his book so long ago, is that his world wasn't aware of the huge upsurge of Islamic antagonism that would become prevalent in the future. If you read this book, I don't think you'll notice a single reference to Islam. But if you study Islamic prophecy, you'll see a huge parallel with the book of Revelation. However, the good guys and the bad guys are on completely different sides depending on which religion you're studying. While there are always \\"two sides to any story\\", there will be only one right side in this epic. Christianity claims Jesus is the son of God. Islam claims Jesus is a prophet (of lower importance than Muhammed) and that he (Jesus) will return in the End Times to proclaim Christianity to be false. Islam says that Jesus is a muslim who was never crucified.In reality, Islam is the Beast. The Islamic Madhi to come is the Antichrist (probably from Fatima, Italy). A muslim 'jesus', as predicted in Islamic prophecy, is the False Prophet. None of that is mentioned in this book. But then, it's rarely mentioned in any book written more than 5 years ago.

While stalking a dangerous outlaw, he saw the barrel of a shotgun and fired first. Unfortunately, it was held by a young girl who was left alone by her parents and told to protect their house. She was killed and while Guild was found not guilty by the jury, it is something that hangs heavy over him. He has now taken up bounty hunting and the story opens with him bringing in a man named Maloney.His goal is the town of Danton, and when he arrives, both he and his prisoner are hot and tired. Being of an agreeable sort, Guild buys both of them a bucket of beer and they drink it together before he takes Maloney to the Sheriff and collects his bounty. The Sheriff turns out to be a man named Baines, they know each other, but Guild soon learns that Baines has become soft in his job and influenced by the Cord family. While essentially honest, the Cord family holds sway over the region and the power structure in the town generally answers to their call.Annie is a young girl who is beautiful, but with a tragic past. She was sold to a brothel when she was approximately ten years old and was rescued by Earle Hammond, a circus magician. Annie became his assistant in the magic acts and now they are also in Danton. When Hammond is falsely implicated in the killing of a bank clerk, Guild becomes involved in his case, largely because he finds Annie so attractive.This leads to a winding tale of multiple love stories that end tragically. Just as people are either finding or rediscovering love, their partners are tragically killed. This is the second Gorman novel in the Evans series that I have read and this is the way they both ended. His characters also exhibit great nobility, the Sheriff and the judge of the town both eventually demonstrate an independence of character that helps Guild.While Gorman's heroes are truly that in the traditional sense, the story ends in a very negative way. Just when people seem to be overcoming their terrible past, events lead to their deaths. If you demand happy endings, then this book is not for you. However, if sad endings are acceptable as long as the journey is well written, then this book will please you."},{"Title":"Guild (Novel of the West Ser.)","review":"GUILD is Ed Gorman's first Western. It was published in 1987, and reissued by Leisure Books this past April. The protagonist is a former lawman turned bounty hunter with a past--one terrible incident--that haunts him. He shot and killed a young girl and can't forgive himself. He now resides on society's fringes and survives by his wit and strength.The novel opens with Guild dragging a bounty into the town of Danton. The man's name is Maloney and he is friendly and likable. He is so likable he convinces Guild to purchase a bucket of beer to share before they hit the Sheriff's office and jail. Once Maloney has been safely turned over and Guild has the chit in his pocket he decides to find a place to stay. He chooses a boarding house in town where he meets an angry young man that has a much larger affect on Guild's life than expected.Shortly thereafter, the young man is charged with a bank heist and his partner--a beautiful young woman that Guild becomes very protective of--drags Guild into the fray. It turns out Danton isn't the town it seems to be on the surface. The law is crooked, and the town's founding family will do anything to keep their power and wealth. And Guild quickly finds the center of everything.The Leo Guild novels are my favorite Ed Gorman Westerns--the protagonist is a dark and melancholy figure who is equal parts brawn and brain. He is a tough and violent man, but he is also self-aware. He understands human nature and while his view of the world is dark, his cynicism is never quite proven out and the blackness is never allowed to overtake him. He always finds something to admire about humanity, whether it is the beauty of a sincere woman or the hard fought integrity of a man taking the correct action no matter the consequences.GUILD, like all of Mr Gorman's Westerns, is a hybrid--it is as much hardboiled noir as it is Western. The mystery is the centerpiece of the story, and the setting--the old West atmosphere and its dusty and wild towns--are the playground where it takes place. The true power of this novel is the sturdy portrait Mr Gorman paints of the past. He creates believable characters that behave very much as our own generation--they are tired, scared, lonely, nave, brutal, horny, indifferent, kind and courageous; sometimes all at once. Which is most likely exactly how our ancestors behaved.-Gravetapping"},{"Title":"Guild (Novel of the West Ser.)","review":"After reading this I was disappointed. This was not really a western. Just one of Ed Gorman\`s mysteries wrapped up to pass it\`s self off as a western. Time to saddle up and find real westerns by Charles West, Ralph Cotton or Elmore Leonard.

After reading it, I'm now an expert on kissing (LOL). I was surprised to learn how controversial a simple kiss can be. For example, kissing in public was illegal years ago. Later, Hollywood censors set strict limits on the length of screen limits. I bought this book for my girlfriend but, I confess, was so intrigued by it that I ended up reading and keeping it. Yes, I bought her another one. She loves it too. She thanked me with a big, fat kiss!"},{"Title":"Kiss and Tell","review":"On, how we love to kiss and tell! Who ever knew sucking face could be the fodder for such a nifty teeny tome?

Stay in the pink. And pucker."},{"Title":"DK Read & Listen: Robin Hood","review":"Like most people, I've heard the Robin Hood story many times. No real surprise there! What makes this rendition unique is Mr. Gruffudd's wonderful voice, the book that doubles as a resource, and, of course, the wonderful story of a man more determined to do what was &quot;right&quot; over what was &quot;legal&quot;.Mr. Gruffudd just has a way with British accents. Robin's band of men apparently come from all over the UK - Cornwall, Irish, King's English accents (plus more that I couldn't easily identify) were used. And of course, Mr. Gruffudd's natural Welsh accent told the story.The book was great. Lots of pictures, lot of sidebars of information. From obsolete jargon to modern pictures of people in costume, these pages in the book help to explain a lot.The story, of course, is a classic. I would caution parents of sensitive children to consider editing the last chapter or so. Instead of ending the story with the &quot;happily ever after&quot; once Robin and Marian are married, this book follows Robin until his death at the hand of his cousin, who betrays him.All in all, it was highly enjoyable. A definite recommend!"},{"Title":"DK Read & Listen: Robin Hood","review":"As a former elementary school librarian, I heartily recommend this audio book. It's beautifully read by Ioan Gruffudd (TV's Horatio Hornblower - more great audio books he's narrated!) and should be enjoyed by a wide range of listeners, even through high school-age students.The book is a Dorling Kindersley publication, so it's chock-full of visual information and provides outstanding explanations of medieval culture, terms, and expressions. The subject matter ties in with several topics, including folk tales, British culture, adventure, and history. The tape and book should encourage lively classroom discussions.I can visualize playing this audio book during classroom art time or as a reward. It could also be the inspiration for a classroom play. And, of course, it's a wonderful purchase for children or grandchildren for home enjoyment. Best of all, the price is quite reasonable and delivery couldn't be easier."},{"Title":"DK Read & Listen: Robin Hood","review":"My daughter and I have been reading (and re-reading!) the DK Classics (of which &quot;Robin Hood&quot; is part of) for several years, since she was 5. These books are very colorful, with lots of illustrations and photos of genuine artifacts, maps, and people from the era in which the story is set. Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These &quot;additions&quot; (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context. It is like getting both a classic and a pictorial history book rolled into one! The text is easy to read. My daughter is now 9, and reading the books on her own. Not only has she developed an appreciation for classic literature, but for history as well. These are great books for parents to read with their children. I highly recommend them!"},{"Title":"DK Read & Listen: Robin Hood","review":"I found this book tape an excellent work, the reader IoanGruffudd makes a great job with the change of voices, it makes you enjoy the reading.

I don't know what happened when they produced this book, but it just isn't what I have come to expect from DK."},{"Title":"DK Read & Listen: Robin Hood","review":"The book I'm going to review is Robin Hood by Neil Philip. The setting of the story is Nottingham, England. The characters are Robin Hood, Marian, Little John, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet, Lord Fitzwalter and King Richard. Robin wants freedom, Marian and his title and lands back. His first big problem is the sheriff wants to kill him. So he harasses the sheriff. Robin gets 30 comrades to help him and lives in Sherwood Forest. The king comes back and gives Robin's title, lands and Marian back to him.The new problem is King Richard is dead and Robin is now an outlaw. Robin kills Sir Guy in self-defense and tricks the sheriff and scares them away. The next problem is that Robin gets captured in St. Mary's Church and thrown in a dungeon. The solution is that Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet and Little John frees him. The last problem is Robin's cousin tricks Robin and lets his blood and never closes the cut. The resolution is he dies with peace in his heart because Robin begs Little John not to harm the nuns.I would recommend this book to certain kinds of kids who can handle the happiness and the suffering in this book. The maps were helpful to me because they had information about where things were happening. The diagrams were helpful to me because they told about the cycle of families in the Middle Ages and what kind of jobs the kids did when they grew up."},{"Title":"DK Read & Listen: Robin Hood","review":"My children- 3 & 5 years- love this- they can actually listen to it multiple times a day and have started acting out and reciting bits from it- so cute! We actually use the cd alone- as it's on lone from their cousin who still has the book. The reader does have an accent ( which makes it a bit more authentic) but you may have to help them identify some of the words that sound different. The language is quite sophisticated but the story keeps them enthralled. Great for rainy afternoons, or tired ones- and great for a tv alternative. We also bring our stories on cd in the car for trips or just to make the errands less painful!

Being an outlaw let Robin Hood flout society's customs and do as he liked.This book does what all DK books do -- add gorgeous photographs and illustrations to an interesting and memorable text, to make a book that is both entertaining and educational. Side captions and blurbs add context and historical relevance to the story. YOur child gets SMARTER as he or she reads the book.The reading level for this book is harder -- 4th or 5th grade, maybe. The book is well written. No index. No glossary.For younger ages, try \\"Robin Hood\\" by Angela Bull."},{"Title":"DK Read & Listen: Robin Hood","review":"The setting and characters of Robin Hood are unforgettable. The setting of the story takes place in northern and central England. The story mostly takes place in Sherwood Forest. Robin Hood is the main character in the story. He is a nice man who cares about the poor and gives them money when he sees them. Maid Marian is Robin Hood's fianc&eacute;e. Little John is a big strong man who helps Robin Hood on his journeys. Friar Tuck is one of Robin's friends. King Richard is the king of England. Sir Guy of Gisborne is one of Robin's enemies who does the sheriff's dirty work. The Sheriff of Nottingham is a cruel person who doesn't like Robin and tries to kill him when Robin turns to an outlaw.The problem is that Robin is declared an outlaw. Worman is Robin's treacherous steward who then lies about Robin setting a plot to kill the king. At Robin's wedding the sheriff of Nottingham says that the prince has declared him an outlaw. Now Robin loses his land and title and he's living in the greenwood and can't marry Maid Marian. There are four things that Robin wants. First, he wants to marry Maid Marian. Second, he wants his title and his land back. Third, he doesn't want to be an outlaw. Finally, he wants all of the people to stop treating the peasants badly.The solution ends up being really complex. Robin runs into the forest and puts together a group of merry men. Then he writes a letter to the sheriff to threaten him in his own castle. Then the king returns and restores everything that Robin had lost when he became an outlaw. Maid Marian and Robin get married. When King Richard dies, King John takes his place and Robin becomes an outlaw again. When Robin goes back to the greenwood he starts to fight Sir Guy and kills him. After, Robin threatens the sheriff, saying that if he will not leave the woods, he will kill him. Later, he goes to St. Mary's to confess his sins but he is betrayed and captured. When the merry men hear the news they go to the prison and free Robin.Robin goes to the Kirklees Priory because he knows that Maid Marian and his cousin are there. His cousin lets Robin's blood and she never seals the wound because she is in the pay of the sheriff. There he dies in Maid Marian's arms.I recommend this book for several reasons. The first reason is the pictures and the notes that Neil Phillip put in there. I also liked it because of all of the action in the book. Some other features are the diagrams of the castles and people and the CD to read along. Finally, when you listen to the CD, you can hear the sound effects of swords and the birds singing and how the voices of different people sound. This is why I recommend this book to other kids."},{"Title":"DK Read & Listen: Robin Hood","review":"Having found the King Arthur and Dracula's in this series good, this Robin Hood showcases mideival life very well. I liked it."},{"Title":"Steenie O'Shea","review":"I've read all three of Mali's books, each one more delightful than the last. Perhaps by virtue of being her first novel, Steenie O'Shea is the most intriguing. It operates on at least three levels- the first, a well-spun tale that leads the reader across continents and worlds, through mysteries and surprises and revelations. The story is also a light breaking through gloomy clouds, a vision of the world that could be, the hope and the promise of the Blue children. (I find myself gazing into people's eyes, looking for the tell-tale signs.) And for me, personally, the story wrought a transformation. Opening up a dark corner of my psyche, exposing in a gentle way my wishes for vengeance, hidden and denied but so powerful in my responses-bringing them into a light of healing. I thank Mali for guiding me to love for all the children. Looking to curl up with a simple good read or on a spiritual journey, Steenie O'Shea is a book to reach for."},{"Title":"Steenie O'Shea","review":"If you like a mystery with a twist, Steenie O'Shea is worth a serious look.Part old-fashioned romance, part New Age plot, the novel traces the intriguing synchronicities in the lives of two women, apparent strangers who find themselves living parallel storylines. I like the provocative way such matters as interplanetary travel, historical tours of the Irish countryside, and exploration of the unleashing of human potential were interwoven to create a truly satisfying and compelling story.The book is constructed with alternating past and present scenes giving a feel for what the heroines' experience is over a period of some 30 years, as their lives are totally transformed by a wildly disparate but fascinating variety of events and circumstances. The story develops around another main character's participation in Ireland's continuing struggle for autonomy, as well as his role as mentor and leader of a group of advanced and spiritually gifted youngsters.Author Mali Berger has obviously done enormously detailed research and it really shows. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants not only to be entertained, but also inspired and informed. I hope a sequel is in the works and in the stores soon!"},{"Title":"Steenie O'Shea","review":"After reading Steenie O'Shea, I was amazed how the setting, thoughts, and characters all interacted to spin the story you can't put down. Berger, leads the reader on a fun journey into fantasy, mystery, family secrets and romance. Not only does the author take you from Arizona to Ireland, but she ventures into unknown worlds with exciting results. This novel is full of immensely likeable characters who are at times hilarious and quirky. This is not your run of the mill book, it has some punch to it. I highly recommend reading this delightful novel."},{"Title":"Steenie O'Shea","review":"To a great extent &quot;Steenie O'Shea&quot; is told in dialog, which makes the story seem immediate, mobile, very alive. This is not a traditional Irish story, but the geography, and perhaps the fey, off-center character of the people of Ireland, seem a good fit for the events. Ms. Berger has used a fine touch with the dialect, not too heavy, exactly how I remember the Irish people speaking when I was there.And her imagination is something else again! I love the mysteriousness, the movement back and forth from everyday reality to magical weirdness. It floats like water colors shading and blending on the surface of a cup of Easter egg dye. Lovely, gentle, tricky.The story is part science fiction, part mysticism, part revelation, part self-discovery, part travelogue. None of these is my favorite reading choice, but I found Mali Berger's ideas interesting and enjoyable. I'm reminded a lot of &quot;Childhood's End&quot; by Arthur Clarke, in which specially chosen children are transported to a different world where the sun is blue, the clouds ruby-colored... But I found that story depressing; the children are planted in the ground there. Ms. Berger's children - and adults as well - are full of life, direction, accomplishment, hope. I thank her for that.I believe that currents do exist between the minds of many of us. They seem mostly unorganized, with only an occasional serendipitous recognizable connection. I also believe that this phenomenon is capable of being organized and utilized, and that it will be, someday. Mali Berger has taken this idea of energy-producing connectedness and given it meaningful construction. Nice going!"},{"Title":"Steenie O'Shea","review":"On February 2, 2002, the Seanachais (storyteller) Steenie O'Shea of Galway, Ireland, discloses to her young niece, Aine, the mysterious family secret that occurred in 1977. The narrator describes Steenie's amnesia and its effect on the author, Maeve McCourt, in Fountain Hills, Arizona.What is the source of identical books created by the two storytellers, an ocean apart, the same year? Maeve travels to Galway, meets the O'Shea bookshop clan and enters into the strange, evolutionary transformation of the Blues. Travel with the O'Shea's from the Sligo of W.B.Yeats down the coast of Galway Bay to The Burren as the venture becomes more and more convoluted, entangled with a 350,000 year-old, historic mystery.Maurice Meehan, Steenie's fiance, a poet of the sea, disappears in 1974, shortly before their wedding day.

The author's descriptions made the them come alive and the O'Shea family and their friends almost made me wish I was Irish. The story is told in dialog and her use of the subtle dialect makes it very much alive. I especially liked the way the author treated environmental issues.

However, it doesn't follow thateveryone needs to write their own linked lists or hash tables fromscratch, when Java already supplies so much of that. I have looked fora textbook that balances explanation of the basics with exploration ofthe Java Collections Interface, and this is by far the best book to date.(The similarly-named book by Zukowski has too many errors of factin it for my taste.)Another reviewer said that this book does not cover the Java CollectionsAPI. This is incorrect. The authors develop the ideas behind each datastructure as a suitably abstract data type, and then go on with &quot;...andhere's how the Java Collections API does it.&quot; I think the previousreviewer simply didn't read far enough to get to those parts.For a tutorial on just the Java Collections API, Sun's online &quot;Trail&quot; isthe best single source, and has the advantage that it is not intermixedwith implementation details. If that were enough, no data structurestextbook would be necessary. However, in real problems, anypredefined generic data structure is likely to be inadequate and willneed to be extended; this is why a good programmer needs to knowthe Collections API (so as to avoid reinventing the wheel), but inaddition a good computer scientist needs to know how these datastructures are implemented, so that he/she can go beyond them whennecessary.The book is somewhat weak on algorithms and would not serve as areference on this topic; however, there is plenty of meat here for a firstcourse on data structures and algorithms."},{"Title":"Java Collections: An Introduction to Abstract Data Types, Data Structures and Algorithms","review":"I've been reading through a copy of this book, and comparing it to another notable book on the same subject, mainly \\"Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java\\" (DSAAJ) by Mark Allen Weiss. Something very noticeable is that Java Collections is a much simpler book to tackle, though I feel that this detracts slightly from its use as a textbook. As a PhD student in Computer Science, I prefer the mathematical detail I found in DSAAJ than the lesser amount of math that Watt and Brown provide in Java Collections. Yet, at the same time, the case studies in Java Collections are a tremendous help in understanding what a given ADT is useful for, which DSAAJ doesn't go into at all. And the detail on what a specific ADT is supposed to do is much better detailed in Java Collections than in DSAAJ. As a TA, I taught a course in Data Structures and Algorithms for Computer Engineering students. The textbook we used for that was Weiss' DSAA book directed towards C++ instead of Java, but for those who know both versions of the book, the two are very similar. If instead of C++ the course was oriented towards Java, I would have chosen this book as a textbook for that course; these students weren't needing the math focus, and they (and I) would have preferred the practical programming knowledge in here.For the programmer out of college, or the college student that wants an alternate view on ADTs than what DSAAJ provides, this is an excellent book.Member of the Columbia Java User Group (www.colajug.org)"},{"Title":"Java Collections: An Introduction to Abstract Data Types, Data Structures and Algorithms","review":"This book is one of the best books out there for Java Algorithms and Data-Structures.

It is beautiful and interesting, offering the origin of various roses, detailed descriptions, growing tips, and pruning instructions. I have found it to be a very helpful reference tool for my growing rose garden. In the winter, it is a pleasure place on a coffee table and browse the gorgeous pictures."},{"Title":"Climbing Roses","review":"This book goes beyond the standard fare of horticulture writing. Its very informative but at the same time it had very readable prose and some refreshing ideas, especially on zones, blooming characters, etc, for the east coast of the US, which doesn't seem to be very habitable for roses in general."},{"Title":"Climbing Roses","review":"Scaniello organizes climbing roses in roughly chronological order and writes two pages of text for each entry. This kind of treatment gives one an excellent understanding of the way climbing roses developed through the ages. The photos are full-page which is necessary for representing the scale and garden effect of climbing roses effectively. It is an approach we hope to see used more in books about roses.The text is informative, giving historical links between roses and for each rose, suggesting a group of roses that are similar. The book is a strong entry, but it has a significant number of flaws.The focus seems to be too much on roses bred in America. There's a huge number of climbers in David Austin's Shrub Roses and Climbing Roses that deserve mention here. It was almost as if the authors had made a conscious decision to avoid the roses chosen by Austin. If so, that was a big mistake because their treatment was more thorough, usually, than Austin's. My suspicion is that the book is about Climbing Roses of the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, since that is where Scaniello practices his art. And it would have been more honest to subtitle it that way.It is true that roses do pink, white and red best. And it is true that one must be judicious in using yellow in a garden: place them badly and you get a color trainwreck. But yellows - whether they are apricot, primrose, gold, or just plain yellow - really draw the eye in a garden. Yellow roses can be the glory of the garden. And my impression is that yellow roses are not well represented here.I also get the impression that ramblers are not well represented here. A remarkably tiny portion of the roses in this volume manage to scramble up tall structures. Conversely, there are a lot of leggy large-flowered roses.Most of the photographs are stunning. But a significant portion show flaws. In some cases it appears to be color balance - it is frequently too cool. Some whites show the (almost unavoidable) blown highlights and flares. In a book with thousands of photos these would be quibbles. But there are not even hundreds of roses in this book, so each flaw becomes a noticable problem.Finally, there is the writing. One gets the impression that the writer is skilled at the craft, but generally uninformed about roses. The language is clear, but the meanings are frequently muddy. If I had to choose between a person with a deep knowledge of roses but quirky writing skills and a person with no knowledge and great writing skills, I'd choose the former every time. Voice matters.For Americans living in zones 5, 6, and 7 who wish to learn a little more about climbing roses of the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, this is an indispensible volume. It is difficult, however, to recommend this as a first or only book on the subject of climbing roses. And if one wants to learn about ramblers, one should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Climbing Roses","review":"Stephen Scanniello is a good ole New Yorker, and his reviews of these climbing roses are based on northern climates. I am located in CA. While some of the information was equally as relevant, the general focus is for Northern gardeners."},{"Title":"Climbing Roses","review":"This book has become my referrence guide to roses.

Dip into it by subject or time period. And you'll love it. Of course it was written by a believing man with a great generous soul. But it's thoroughly documented, and has immense and timeless insight to offer on many subjects. For some, it might be a rich corrective to the mini-series, and movies about Jesus which portray his surroundings as so meager and primitive, with no sense of the grandeur of the Holy City, and the complexity and variety of the village life that Jesus might have known. Jesus didn't live in the Stone Age as motion pictures and documentaries would have one believe. He lived in the busy world of Augustus and Tiberius Caesar. And this book embraces that period with vast wisdom and knowledge. It is outdated, yes. But the period in which it was written (late 1800's) is no doubt partly responsible for it's profound simplicty and overwhelming charm. Happy reading."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This classic work is a goldmine of information about the context of the Gospels. Many of the events and sayings in Jesus's become even clearer when we understand the widespread Rabbinic teachings of His day. Edersheim's insight into the famous \\"Thou art Peter\\" is most interesting -- yes, Jesus was speaking Hebrew but he DID mean to distinguish petros and petra, because these names had also been incorporated into Hebrew and Aramaic. It's also very important to see how Jewish writers interpreted Messianic prophecies to see that the NT writers were following accepted procedure.For something more modern, I recommend Dr Arnold Fruchtenbaum's books, especially Messianic Christology."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"While somewhat outdated, The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah remains a magnificent reference to the historical and cultural setting to the days of Jesus of Nazareth. Although written some 70 years prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Edersheim's great work still offers highly valuable information and insight on the Gospels and related events. One of the more striking features of the book is the appendix list of 400+ Old Testament passages which were tagged by the ancient rabbis as being messianically applied. An absolute must for anyone who wish to study the Jewish expectations of the Messiah surrounding the days when the Nazarene Carpentar walked the Earth. Place this vintage masterpiece in your library, and you will find yourself going back to it time and time again."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"I was given a copy of the above referenced book as a birthday gift in 1990. I began reading it in 1992 and completed it within 3 months. I picked up the book again in 1998 and have read it, in its entirety, at least once a year since then. I truly consider myself more then a casual reader of this magnificent work! That being said, my review...For the believing Christian, this is a must read. For the skeptic, consider yourself remiss to overlook this book and for the Non-believer, this work will renovate your thinking. Edersheim has put together a true masterpiece herein. His depth of research on the subject matter is totally comprehensive. A commitment of 7 years, in almost complete solitude, was made to the writing of this book by he and his daughter.Literally thousands of footnotes, drawn from nearly every major Jewish writing of the time, are listed on the pages of this book indicating the intense discipline and scholarly effort enforced by the writer. An impression of truth and trustworthiness almost overwhelms readers as they have literally noted in conversation with me as I have passed this book along to many friends and acquaintances.This book is a bon-a-fide \\"best effort\\" to set before it's readers the daily foot steps of Jesus of Nazareth so that His words and works may bring us to an understanding of Jesus The Messiah that will blaze with a brightness that will light every other understanding.Finally, to put oneself to the task of completing this book is an undertaking. However, as noted by Edersheim himself, we are called to look upon Jesus with intent and resolve before we will see him as the \\"God-Man\\". ( St. John 6:40)"},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"Alfred Edersheim's heritage as a Messianic Jew gives the description of Jewish culture in &quot;The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah&quot; an authenticity that a non-Jew would be hard-pressed to duplicate. The culture of Israel during the Roman occupation comes alive in Edersheim's writing in a way that goes beyond scholastic study by blending his own Jewish heritage, archeological fact, and keen spiritual insight. Any serious student of the Gospels or the Epistles would benefit from the insight of Mr. Edersheim because so much of the imagery in the account of Jesus is steeped in the culture of Israel as it progressed from Abraham to Herod. Used as a reference, &quot;The Life and Times&quot; is indexed according to verses and events and gives Bible studies the context for the illustrations of Jesus. Read as a book, Edersheim is ponderous, however, a contiguous reading would give a person a consistent Hebrew framework which the New Testament fit into 2000 years ago. &quot;The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah&quot; has become a fixture in my library which, second to the Bible, is now a standard starting point in my study of Jesus, the Messiah."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"In Bible school I had to use this book as a resource in writing several papers.

Lots of information on early Judaism, carefully footnoted from primary sources. In the footnotes, lots of arguments with other scholars, chiefly German (as was typical in the late nineteenth century). Some of author's weighing of evidence will have been challenged in the 100+ years since this book was first published, and new sources will have been discovered; new archaeological sites too. But this is still a good starting-point, if only for the quantity of early sources that are collected in one place.2. Florid prose.3. This reprint edition has more than the usual number of typographical errors. Most of these are harmless, but sometimes they change the sense. E.g., on p. 304: \\"We are _not_ in some measure prepared to follow the worship on that Sabbath in Nazareth\\" should read \\"We are _now_ in some measure prepared...\\""},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"The book itself is very intriguing, written by an amazing scholar.This edition handles the umlaut better than the other versions; however, struggles with Greek letters.

This new edition is so full of typographical errors that sometimes the reader will have to intuit what the author really wrote. It is clear that the proofreaders of this edition were not actually reading; they were simply following the little red lines under the \\"misspelled\\" words. This has resulted in some truly bizarre apparent statements by the author, unreproducible here due to copyright laws. Disclaimer-- I have not purchased this book, merely checked it out of the library."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"The author's preface is dated 1886. Biblical scholarship has changed a lot since then, most notably with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi library. Many of Rev. Edersheim's conclusions will have been refuted in the 130+ years since this book's original publication.For me, the author was at his best when he was dealing with _facts_, such as the details of Jewish life and society in Palestine during the time of Jesus. Unfortunately, being an Anglican priest, he cannot resist the temptation to preach - so he spends pages upon pages telling us what the story MEANS instead of just telling the story. I enjoyed his exposition on the parables in Book V, but most of his preaching was tedious and overburdened with Victorian-era sentiment.Edersheim also argues incessantly (with other Bible scholars whom he often names in the text or the footnotes) in favor of the authenticity, earliness, and \\"Jewish origin\\" of the gospel of John - a position which to me seems indefensible. He also insists on \\"harmonizing\\" the gospels into a single continuous narrative while also insisting that all four are literally, factually, and unerringly TRUE. This approach does not hold water, and watching this otherwise talented scholar & historian flounder through a mire of faulty logic and circular reasoning has only strengthened my conviction that the Victorian dream of a \\"Gospel Harmony\\" is an unreachable goal. Edersheim must undergo strange intellectual contortions to hold to his belief that the gospel writers 1) never made mistakes, and 2) never made stuff up. In one passage he points out Luke's specificity of historic detail as \\"evidence\\" of the truthfulness of his tale, and a few pages later points out Matthew's vagueness & lack of detail as proof of his veracity. You can't have it both ways!! Edersheim never gives the Classical/Antique era's writers any credit for imagination & inventiveness. Furthermore, he seems to have no understanding of Non-Christian myth nor how good stories are told.The book is huge: 1,491 pages, not counting the index and the Roman-numbered pages in the introduction to both volumes (bound together in this one enormous edition but retaining their two separate paginations). As other reviewers mentioned, there are lots of typos, and the old-fashioned prose often bogs down. I felt every one of those 1,491 pages. This book took way too long to read ... but ultimately I'm glad I read it. It's a treasure-trove of information as well as misbegotten opinions. It is probably something that should be experienced by anyone who's got the interest in the subject matter, and the patience to turn that many pages - but its flaws are too numerous for me to award it more than 3."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"This book was recommended by my pastor and because I wanted to know more about Jesus I ordered it and will order another to give as a gift.

He lived from 1825 to 1889.His best known work is The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah. As he said, he took seven years to complete this project. He isolated himself and devoted full time to his writing with only his daughter Ella as his researcher, proofreader and inspiration. This is indeed a tribute to a devoted daughter and skilled researcher in her own right.The volume of 1100 pages is not a devotional book. It has many devotional thoughts, but this is a scholarly work with historical details filling every chapter. You can tell by reading the extensive research and writing ability which into this tome.If you want to know about the times in which Jesus lived and glimpses into His life, then this book will be a good one for you. For example:The Gospels present a great deal of tension between Jesus and the religious leaders over rituals and the Sabbath. Edersheim explains this controversy where Jesus rejected the numerous ritual rules for everyday life and especially for the proper observation of the Sabbath. By the time of Jesus the religious authorities had created a burdensome system of do's and don'ts that even the devout hard a difficult time following. The Jerusalem priesthood was corrupt and the cleansing of the temple by Jesus was more than just a simple act.In addition, you are presented with graphic descriptions of the Herod Dynasty. King Herod and family left a bloody mark on Judaea before and after Jesus. It was a bloodline conceived in the worst possible elements of human nature. The Herods sought to build a second Rome in Judaea.If you have a serious interest in this subject, then I recommend this book to you.

I find it exciting to sense Jesus being brought to life in beautiful English. It is a little daunting to bounce back and forth between the author's references and the text but it is well worth it.

It has some good insights into the life of Jesus, and it will help pastors and teachers of the Word in their search for information that will preach.The book has some weaknesses that keeps it from being the top contemporary resource on the life of Jesus. Number one: The book is not easy to read. It is technical and tedious, and demands alot from the reader.Number two: Edersheim operates under the assumption that everything he knows about Talmudic tradition was also true in the first century, and we simply do not know if this was the case.Number three: The scholarship in this book is more than a hundred years old. I think the best features of the book are the preaching tidbits sprinkled throughout the volume.Having said all that,I think that if you are looking for the best Jesus biography, you'd be better served with Jesus and the Gospels by Craig Blomberg. The scholarship is recent, the prose is engaging, and the volume compresses an amazing amount of information in its 450 pages. Buy that book, along with Darrell Bock's Jesus According to Scripture and Ben Witherington's The Christology of Jesus, and you should have everything you need."},{"Title":"The life and times of Jesus the Messiah","review":"Alfred Edersheim is a scholar of unique perspective. He was born and raised a Jew but converted to Christianity as a young man. He provides insight into Jewish history and background to the gospel narratives like no one else I've read. A couple of problems with this work though, it can be very hard to reference. When searching for a particular parable or passage you have to search through the chapter headings one by one to see if you recognize the content. Furthermore, Mr. Edersheim is so unbelievably wordy it can be frustrating waiting for him to get to the point, but this is typical of late 19th and early 20th century biblical expositors.

It was the 50th Anniversary edition and now the 75th Anniversary issue is out. I guess it's time to get a new edition but this one was a very useful guide to what movies to look at on the Late Show. I took for granted back then that a movie that won a major Academy Award was a movie worth watching. It generally was a good indicator and still is to a certain extent. The Academy Award is a generally a prize for \\"middle of the road\\" movies. There are many exceptions such as \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" winning the Best Picture Oscar in 1969. As a matter of fact, the Best Foreign Language Film Award Oscar is probably the best place to find that outstanding movie that you want to \\"discover\\". Still, there are many great movies that won Best Movie Oscars, many great actors that won Best Actor Oscar and many great actresses that won Best Actress Oscars. That's because there are a lot of \\"general audience\\" movies that are Great Movies. Thank goodness for that. Why not make great movies the whole family can enjoy. Still, knowing that \\"Mary Poppins\\" beat out \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" in 1964 indicates the reluctance of the Academy to stick its' neck out too often.I have to admit that the 1970's were a great decade for great movies and the Academy Awards reflect that. What I found most helpful was using this book as a guide to \\"discover\\" those movie of the 1920's, 1930's and the 1940's. There is a page with all of the winners for each year followed by 6-8 pages of pictures from the winning pictures. There is also a page describing the different movies and players.

Using Sappho's poetry as a touchstone, Carson explores Sappho's term &quot;glukupikron&quot;(literally, &quot;sweetbitter&quot;). She touches upon a myriad of ancient texts; the second half of the book draws largely from Plato's Phaedrus. Most exciting for me was her explanation of the similarities between the edges of erotic desire and the edges of the alphabet. This culminates in a wonderful series of chapters in which she relates erotic desire with the desire for knowledge. It was exhilarating!! What's more, I found the book extremely accessible. A must read!"},{"Title":"Eros the Bittersweet","review":"Carson is an inspired guide through the tangled and fragmentary corpus of Greek lyric love poetry. She has a whirlwind mind and a gift for pithy expression, though once in a while she slips into a kind of gauzy equivocating that weakens her arguments. Still, this idiosyncratic take on ancient eros has moments of great insight and deserves the attention of classical scholars and non-specialists who are interested in the topic."},{"Title":"Eros the Bittersweet","review":"The Greeks did not cover everything but they made a pretty good start.

(I hate and I love/ Why do I, you ask ?/ I don't know, but it's happening/ and it hurts.)A splendid place to mine for obscure quotes: \`We aren't shutting you out of the revel, but we aren't inviting you either/ For you're a pain when you're present, and beloved when you are away'- Theognis"},{"Title":"Eros the Bittersweet","review":"Anna Carson is brilliant, the arguments set forth in her book are incredibly valid and reinforced with brilliant examples from ancient Greek poets one of which is Sappho. Very enlightening read, will change the way you view love, desire and want, it will change the way you view Eros forever. If you havent read it yet i suggest you do NOW."},{"Title":"Eros the Bittersweet","review":"This is a delightful book that analyzes love [desire] through classical literature. It is an academic treatise, poetical prose, and philosophy all at the same time. Carson's close reading and her wit make Eros the Bittersweet a must read."},{"Title":"Eros the Bittersweet","review":"This book applied to life. No only did the book put into words what can only be thought but it speaks to you. It starts out over most heads but then comes down to relate to all those in love."},{"Title":"Eros the Bittersweet","review":"From [...].Anne Carson is a Canadian poet, essayist, translator, and a professor of Classics and Comparative Literature at the University of Michigan. While reading Eros the Bittersweet, her background in classical literature and ancient philosophy was clear and heavy: most of her argument centers on ancient writers. And, indeed, it is her goal to make a connection between eros, language, and the first poets to ever put words to the page.She begins by drawing out a geometrical configuration that exemplifies the properties of eros: a triangle. The eros exists between two lovers who are then suspended by a third point-- an obstruction. She writes:\\"For, where eros is lack, its activation calls for three structural components- lover, beloved and that which comes between them. They are three points of transformation on a circuit of possible relationship, electrified by desire so that they touch not touching. Conjoined they are held apart. The third component plays a paradoxical role for it both connects and separates, marking that two are not one, irradiating the absence whose presence is demanded by eros. When the circuit-points connect, perception leaps. And something becomes visible, on the triangular path where volts are moving, that would not be visible without the three-part structure. The difference between what is and what could be is visible. The ideal is projected on a screen of the actual, in a kind of stereoscopy. The man sits like a god, the poet almost dies: two poles of response within the same desiring mind. Triangulation makes both present at once by a shift of distance, replacing erotic action with a ruse of heart and language. For in this dance the people do not move. Desire moves. Eros is a verb.\\"The lovers, then, are suspended by this third point, without which they would threaten to collapse into each other, dissolving into a single point. The triangulation both separates them and binds them together, as if caught in the erotic buoyancy of each other's presence, performing a gravitational orbit. The obstruction can take many forms: time (waiting for one's lover), space (being physically separated from one's lover through both short and long distances), or other obstacles, such as a marriage, or a lack of confidence to even approach the beloved, or any other possible factor that separates us from the one we desire. This obstruction is defined by that which creates a space between the lover and the beloved and prevents them from possessing each other completely. Carson continues, \\"Not all look triangular in action, yet they share a common concern: to represent eros as deferred, defied, obstructed, hungry, organized around a radiant absence-- to represent eros as lack.\\"Because of this obstruction, the lovers are inspired to reach for each other across this boundary. The separation between lovers inspires the eros, but also the reach: the two lovers ache for one another, they try to cross the space that divides them. Carson writes that the reach of desire \\"is defined in action: beautiful (in its objects), foiled (in its attempt), endless (in time).\\" Even if this space is crossed, it is reconstituted the moment they separate, or else by the mere boundaries of flesh and through painful, vain attempts at complete unity. Considering this, I look back upon my own instances of eros, the distance which was necessary to cross in order to kiss my lover, and how time seemed to slow in that drawn-out pause between reach and grasp.\\"Eros is an issue of boundaries. He exists because certain boundaries do. In the interval between reach and grasp, between glance and counter glance, between 'I love you' and 'I love you too,' the absent presence of desire comes alive. But the boundaries of time and glance and I love you are only aftershocks of the main, inevitable boundary that creates Eros: the boundary of flesh and self between you and me. And it is only, suddenly, at the moment when I would dissolve that boundary, I realize I never can.\\"Eros, then, defined in boundaries and edges, Carson begins to draw a connection between eros and language, specifically in written language, where edges are more clearly visible. She writes, \\"Is it a matter of coincidence that the poets who invented Eros, making of him a divinity and a literary obsession, were also the first authors in our tradition to leave us their poems in written form? To put the question more pungently, what is erotic about alphabetization? This may seem not so much an unanswerable as a foolish question, at first, but let us look closer into the selves of the first writers. Selves are crucial to writers.\\"In both desire and words, one must perceive the edge between one entity and another, between self and other, in order for either to occur. In perceiving the beloved, we discover a specific lack that, until this point, the lover was unaware existed at all. This \\"lack\\" does not imply a lack of wholeness of personality or being, necessarily, but simply a desire for something that the lover does not currently possess. Since complete possession of this lack can never occur, we imagine it and give it shape. Eros spark's the lover's imagination. Carson writes that \\"imagination is the core of desire. It acts at the core of metaphor,\\" quoting Rilke when he says, \\"space reaches out from us and translates the world.\\" Our lover transform under a necessary imaginative perception that both allows us to simultaneously discover some comprehension of this lack and reach out for it, within the lover, in the phenomenal world.As I continue to academically research desire, love and eros, I keep coming back to the same principle: imagination. The process of imagining the beloved, but also the process of the two lovers imagining the world and re-creating reality, bound only to the limits of their fantasy and passion."},{"Title":"Eros the Bittersweet","review":"This brief account of eros is beautifully poetic distillation of the multiple instantiations of the logic of eros in ancient Greek philosophy and myth. Carson is a first rate classicist and her powers as an interpreter of ancient Greek texts is abundant here. More importantly, her poetic sensibility illuminates the lightness and complexity of the movement of eros; through readings of Plato, Sappho, and others, a vibrant picture of eros and its place within Greek thought emerges. I was particularly struck with her writing on the temporality of eros, which does so much to encapsulate its paradoxical essence. A supremely beautiful and enlightening text."},{"Title":"Eros the Bittersweet","review":"this is perhaps my favorite of carson's works. it is a thoughtful, endlessly critical look at the greek idea of eros. carson, ancient goddess that she is, blends just the perfect amount mysticism and a serious academic's curiosity in this book. it's a foundational piece to understanding her other more poetic projects and a great introduction to carson."},{"Title":"Meditations from Iraq: A Chaplain's Ministry in the Middle East 2003-2004","review":"Due to the bully pulpit our press gives Hollywood movie \\"stars\\", such as Jake Gyllenhaal, every American should read this true account of life in Iraq from the perspective of the American soldier/chaplain. Making a movie on the Middle-East conflict such as Gyllenhaal did with the flick, \\"Jarhead\\" does not give any man proper insight into what these brave young men and women are doing on a daily basis. Kittleson, an Army Chaplain, paints a compelling picture of the hardships these heroes endure. Religious or not, political or not, please read this beautifully crafted book, particularly before speaking out as Gyllenhaal did."},{"Title":"Meditations from Iraq: A Chaplain's Ministry in the Middle East 2003-2004","review":"Kittleson brings a wealth of personal military experience to this work. Not only was he raised in the home of an American war hero, he has personally devoted himself to serving our country and its soldiers his entire adult life. He brings the perspective and experience of the unassuming soldier---a modest level 5 leader. It is a blend of a little cynicism about the Army its practices and procedures, personal glimpses of war that you will not see in any movie, and a deep sense of honor and devotion. Kittleson is a keen observer and gifted writer. His images combine stark and jarring reality with beautifully crafted language and simple but profound wisdom.This is not just a work for soldiers who have been there, or guys who wished they had been, though both will find this an engaging book. It is also for anyone who values real stories about real people, struggling and sometimes failing, sometimes triumphing over what they face.This is not a blood and guts saga, despite the fact that Chaplains probably have to deal with that horror more than the average soldier. This is the taste, the smell, the feel of war in a foreign and hot and hostile place. An example: \\"Here's a recipe that everyone can easily follow at home. Take a hair dryer outside on the hottest and driest day of the summer. Plug it in and be sure the setting is for \`high heat.' Before pointing it at your face, add a large fan behind it and turn it on the highest setting. Next, add another ingredient: a winter heater turned on to the max. Now, bask your entire body in the stifling heat for a good twelve to fourteen hours, occasionally shifting from front to back and cheek to cheek to get an even roast. Just for added effect, turn on a bright light in your face as you bask. Before starting the broiling, take a six to eight-pound flower pot, turn it upside down and place it on your head fastened by a chinstrap. Be sure to leave enough room in the headband for sweat to trickle out and down your eyelids. Put on a heavy shirt and pants with boots geared to allow the minimum of air movement and then add a heavy winter coat or vest. Better yet, just for effect, put on a heavy corset and tighten. Throw in front of the large fan, turned on high, at periodic intervals, a good handful of powered sugar or flour so that it sticks to your body and clothes and on occasion throw a particularly large handful of powdery stuff so that it gets in your lungs and you can taste the grit between your teeth. If you aren't coughing up chunks of the stuff, you haven't thrown enough in front of the fan. After basking, broiling, roasting your body, and wearing holes in your gluteus maximus for the prescribed length of time, stop in an area covered in dirt with the churned up consistency of talcum power. Flop down on a cot under the full moon in the open and sleep the night away while trucks and Humvees hum around you all night long, throwing more and more talcum power in the air while some sort of bug bites your weary, roasted flesh.\\"Kittleson puts you there. You are not a hero, you are a grunt. But just as you are at the breaking point he helps you see a greater or deeper reality. In the mundane grind of war he unveils truth, wisdom, and sometimes even beauty. The honeywagon becomes a strangely jarring image of the Holy Spirit carrying away your sin. And Jesus like a saper opens a way through spiritual razor wire. You sense the hand of God even in this horrid circumstance of war and come to realize the same hand of God extends into the horrid places in your own life. Kittleson's gift is the ability to show us the magic of grace in the midst of foreign war and so make it possible for us to see it in the midst of our stateside lives."},{"Title":"Meditations from Iraq: A Chaplain's Ministry in the Middle East 2003-2004","review":"Well done, I am a Chaplain for 3 organizations here in Sacramento, California. I found his book full of insight and excellant description of his surroundindings and experiences. I have read 5 books on Chaplains in the Civil War in America and have recently given a presentation of such to one of my organizations....my books are all journals a lot like Pastor Kittlesons. I was also a Reserve Officer in the California State Military Reserve which is an Augment of the National Guard so I have a military background. With my background I can basically understand his background but obviously cannot relate to his time in the Desert. I think his writing style was great and easy to follow and his bible verses were great as they fit into what he was saying into his letters perfectly.....If he did not live so far away I would attend one of his services and would like to meet him.

I would highly encourage both military and non-military read this book.

Like in all Christian fiction, you've got some idea of what is going to happen (a main character who thinks about becoming a Christian isn't going to suddenly change his mind in these books, for example), but Hill's story-telling is unexpectedly fresh and vibrant. Her evil people are evil. Her good people are squeaky clean. Her struggling believers really struggle. It's easy to see why these books have passed the test of time and are still known and read today after much of what was published alongside them is forgotten.Paul Courtland is a young college man who has discarded the vague Christianity of his youth for the \\"realities, laws, and science\\" popular among his college friends and professors. When a Christian classmate, Stephen, dies bravely in the aftermath of a college prank (which, yes, briefly blinds Paul), he feels a \\"presence\\" and resolves to better know \\"Stephen's Christ.\\" Note: if you're a Stephen in a Christian novel and there is an unbeliever named Paul around, you're gonna die. But on the bright side, you're going to inspire him ... so it all balances out The main obstacle to Paul's quest for spiritual improvement is Gila Dare, a young woman who is about as evil as evil can be (\\"Had she not tossed so many a hapless soul that had come like a moth to singe his wings in her candle-flame, then laughed at him gaily as he lay writhing in his pain; and toss after him, torn and trampled, his own ideals of womanhood, too; so that all other women might henceforth be blighted in his eyes.\\"). Will Paul fall for Gila's seductive schemes? Also in the mix: Bonnie, a poor (but beautiful and good) woman and Stephen's parents, Mother and Father Marshall, total paragons of corn-fed downhome goodness (\\"'Now, wouldn't it be just beautiful if we had telephones to heaven! Think, if we could get word from Stephen to-day, how happy we'd be!' 'Why, we have!' said Father. 'Wait!' and he reached over to the little stand by the window and grasped the worn old Bible. 'Here! Listen to this!'\\"). Hill's descriptions are amazingly vivid and really bolster the story.Groundbreaking? Absolutely not. But as a completely enjoyable example of early 20th-century Christian fiction, you can't do better and I dare you to try.One element of this novel that I did find unexpected was the author's strong call for social justice, not something that is a frequent player in Christian fiction nowadays. Paul sees his duty not just to preach to the poor, but to seek positive changes in their material lives as well -- things like eight-hour days, workplace safety, etc. Christians are presented as lobbying for changes to the economic order and are tied to the Progressive movement. For example, after an unsafe factory burns to the ground, Hill tells us: \\"The model factory was gone! But the money that had built it, the money that it had made, was still in existence to build it over again, a perpetual blind to the lawmakers who might have otherwise put a stop to its abuses! It would undoubtedly be built again, more whited, more sepulchral than before.\\" How unexpected would this be in today's Christian fiction?Overall, this was a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Witness","review":"For a fast read, of good Christian fiction, you can't beat Grace Livingston Hill, and on Kindle $1.99 great price.As a follower of Christ it is so great to have fiction to read that inspires you. Romance is hard to come by sometimes, and she always delivers, OK so it's 1920, girls are girls, boys are boys, and love is love.It's just simple, clean and good, and in these hard times we are experiencing, it's a nice reminder that we are not the first generation to experience hard times. Enjoy, and be inspired."},{"Title":"The Witness","review":"This was my second Grace Livingston Hill book and I must admit now I'm a fan.

Seeing that it was a work of Christian fiction, I figured it would be free of bad language and other \\"stuff\\" that make me delete so many of today's \\"novels.\\"I do not know when this was written, although the archaic language makes me think it was quite long ago. In any event, the old-fashioned language does not detract from the story in the least.The story centers on a young man who is attending college. He and his chums pick on one boy in particular, Stephen, because he doesn't rabblerouse with the rest of them.One evening, like Saul, the main character holds the jackets of his buddies who decide to torment Stephen until he swears. Finding it impossible to break his resolve, the mob then carries Stephen away to view a show that will offend his sensibilities. While at the theater, a tragedy ensues that marks the main character forever. He comes face-to-face with Stephen's Jesus, and from then on is a changed man.The story then goes on to tell how the main character explores his newfound faith in Jesus, and how this affects his life and the choices he makes in the future.Although at times the story is a bit \\"campy\\", I think it is more a product of the age in which it was written than any downfall on the part of the writer.I did find myself touched at many times while reading this story.If you are looking for a nice, wholesome story that is without the obscene language prevalent in today's offerings, then definitely read this one.I am glad I read it and will probably re-read it at some point."},{"Title":"The Witness","review":"Too slow and boring though the plot was a good one.

From what I can tell that really wasn't the world view of this guy. What he does predict most is off, some he gets right. Some of the really wacky stuff is that China nor India would never be a world economic power and Israel would join a union with other Arab nations. Some of what he gets right is the creation of something like the EU and that governments would push the mixing and intermarrying of different races. The biggest thing that he missed was that the big plan is that soveriegn nations would be a thing of the past and all these countries that at least on the surface were at each others throats are now interlocked and interdependent on each other at the high levels. Its the new world order."},{"Title":"What Duck Done","review":"This book contains transcription of Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn's bass lines for almost three dozen classic Stax and Atlantic R&B; recordings. This music is the cornerstone of 60's R&B; and Soul and as such the bass lines are fundamental to anyone playing modern R&B;, pop, funk, and even country, gospel, and contemporary Christian.The book is 70 pages long. About a dozen pages are text and pictures. The rest are easy-to-read, carefully written transcriptions in standard musical notation on the bass staff.The book includes two 60 minute CDs of instrumental covers by the author (Tim Tindall) on bass (left channel) and accompaniment on the right channel. The tracks are well made and fairly true to the originals in terms of tempos and instrumentation. (Though clearly more care has been taken to keep the bass lines \\"exact\\" than the other instruments.) The tracks were clearly mixed to maximize their value as teaching tools. Each of the instruments stands out distinctly, even on the \\"mixed\\" right channel. Very few effects are used in the mix.This book does what it does very well, but it has limitations. There is no tab or fingering suggestions. There are no transcriptions for instruments other than bass. The commentary is very terse. (One should really think of this as a sheet music book with CDs.)The level of these bass lines ranges from early to advanced intermediate. Many passages are suitable for beginners with a good rhythmic feel. (Duck was never about playing a lot of notes.) For those who read standard music notation or work with a teacher who does this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"What Duck Done","review":"I highly recommend this as an excellent reference -- a fine set of transcriptions of Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn's classic bass lines. Many of these lines have become fundamentals for anyone playing modern Bass.The book is exactly as advertised -- nothing fancy. Only a few pages are used for pictures or comments. The rest is straight-forward transcriptions in standard musical notation (Bass clef, no Tab). This book is not intended for the casual fan of 60's R&amp;B. It's a musicians reference, complete with 2 CD's for learning/practice/play-along.Tim Tindall has done a nice job pulling this together. But, the real spotlight is on the music itself. Most of these classic Bass lines are not technically difficult. So, beginning and intermediate players will probably get maximum benefit from the book. And, the transcriptions offer an excellent chance to develop rhythmic feel &amp; reading ability."},{"Title":"What Duck Done","review":"I kind of hesitate to give it 5 stars, but the transcriptions seem really good to me--though I heard a few of the Pickett's a little differently--and most of the tunes should be familiar to just about anyone who grew up hearing soul music now and then. I like the variety too. Some of the Sam & Dave, Pickett, Otis Redding and Eddie Floyd lines were \\"must-know\\" basslines but it was cool to see how Duck handled Albert and Freddie King's songs and some Muddy Waters as well.It's pretty much just the 33 songs and 2 CDs. There are a few pictures and some notes about style in the back that I wish were embellished on both accounts, but nothing you'd really need. Duck's stuff was typically a little easier to play than Jamerson's so I'd recommend this BEFORE \\"Standing the Shadows of Motown\\" if you're still progressing as a player. I didn't do it that way, but as a result I found I could pretty much sight read this stuff with only a few errors here and there. The editing for fingerings is pretty minimal too, whereas the Jamerson has a lot more on that. But the transcriptions were in a much bigger font and that helps a ton. The sound quality of the CD could've been a little better too. Still, a fantastic book, especially for someone who plays guitar and wants to actually sound like a bassist and not a guitar player playing bass. You can't help but understand groove, how to work changes, what notes to accent etc."},{"Title":"What Duck Done","review":"A good compilation of the playing style of Duck Dunn. Good selection of songs, decent recording. The separation of the bass to the left channel makes it easy to hear the bass parts. The lack of Tab might be considered a drawback, but I found it good exercise reading music. Muscians not being able to read, or at least know the notes on the bass staff is the real drawback. If someone has an interest in the Stax sound then this is a good way to find out."},{"Title":"What Duck Done","review":"If you love Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, Booker T. & MG's and other Stax artists, this is the book to get. Accurate transcriptions. One of the most fun bass books I've ever used because the music just pops out. As an added bonus, it also helped my sight reading. The CD is extremely helpful and is actually enjoyable to listen to all by itself. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"What Duck Done","review":"This book is a must for any Duck fan and a great collection of tasty lines that are fun, accessible and bound to improve one's playing. The arrangements are sparse, giving you the main bits of the songs but are NOT full transcriptions!

However, big points to the editors for getting that some players prefer tabbed music. These tabs are the real deal - I've listened closely to each of the songs with the book in front of me, and have found no issues with the book's accuracy. Five stars, both for content and for the choice of reading either tabs or sheet music."},{"Title":"What Duck Done","review":"This is really well done... all the songs are written out in entirety, (in standard notation, not tab), and the accompanying CDs are really well done. If you want to learn the soulful Memphis grooves of the Stax sound, then this book is your mainline source."},{"Title":"What Duck Done","review":"The transcriptions in this book provide a good start to learning the material. They are not completely accurate, so if you want to play it the way Duck did, you still have to listen carefully and make some modifications to what's in this book. The inaccuracy exists in both note choice and in the sense of time written into the notation. Duck syncopates a lot, and the notation doesn't really reflect what he's actually doing. The book and CDs are a good start, but you still have to listen carefully to the original recordings."},{"Title":"What Duck Done","review":"-no tab is a little disappointing - considering these days its pretty standard to have both.-the book is a plastic spiral bound - so its not very durable - another reason it should be about $10 if not $15 less.-i've found a few mistakes in the transcriptions.-the discs are okay, but the bass is not all that prominent - and is somewhat drowned out by the other instruments (with that said, i am fully aware that this is the burden a bassist usually faces when trying to figure out basslines - but this book is supposed to be to about bass - i dont need the accompanying drums, guitar etc.- i just want to concentrate on the bass).-i have bought/studied from a lot of playalong bass guides - this one is nothing special.-the reason its worth getting is simply that there are no other books (that i'm aware of) transcribing the works of Duck Dunn.to sum up:-overpriced-not tabbed-not very durable-no other book like it (hopefully not for long)"},{"Title":"Professors as Writers: A Self-Help Guide to Productive Writing","review":"I am impressed about the examples detailling basic writing principles and other tricks which really helpful and get a new writer ready"},{"Title":"Professors as Writers: A Self-Help Guide to Productive Writing","review":"For years, I wanted to write but hid behind the excuses that separate writers from those who simply want to write.

He goes on and on about all the excuses people have for not writing, like the supposed 'negative self-talk.'For example, p121: \\"So far as I can see, successful writers who remain physically and emotionally healthy rarely relapse.\\" This is an unfalsifiable claim; the author includes no data to back up this reasoning, only anecdotal evidence. Much of this book is written in this fashion.What most annoyed me about Professors as Writers was the pretense of research. The author repeatedly 'cites' data which would never be publishable in a scientific journal - in other words, it's unreliable and unfalsifiable.

It makes sense and it works. He even talks about reasons that people want to resist this truth, and how to trick yourself out of your writer's block.

I tried the brief, timed daily sessions and found they freed me up rather than made me feel restricted, because over time I saw more pages produced, and had more raw material to work with; didn't have to wait for the long blocks of time.Things that most helped me:* Free writing to start, including not even about the material at first* Only 15-30 minutes/day b/c so difficult to find the big chunks of time* Keep a log of time put in and check-in weekly w scheduled callHaving reached the end, I'm for the first time more open to sharing rough drafts of ideas before they're ready. \\"Begin before you're ready\\" was his point, but I didn't get that, feeling it was too personal to share something so raw. Now I'm not going to think of it as quite as personal--it's not me, those words, because they're not final. Not the only thing I meant to say or have to say. So no criticism of them can really assail me. In fact it's just a work in progress that gets really helped by the mutual conversations. Over time, I'm struck by how memorable Boice's points are, like that one about \\"externality\\"-- --the importance of getting writing outside your mind and into other hands.

This assumption would only be partially accurate at best. Accurate in that Chesterton spares few words expressing his frustration and borderline disgust with the Protestant denominations of his time. Disappointingly inaccurate in that, unlike Lewis'Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life, there is very little information surrounding the circumstances of his conversion. Nonetheless, Chesterton makes it apparent enough why he made, and why he felt that he had to make, the decision that he did. As for the evolution of the thought process leading to his conversion, there are enough indications in most of his earlier works, such asHeretics,Orthodoxy, andThe Everlasting Man(to name some of his most popular titles), to put the pieces together. Unfortunately, or fortunately, for the reader Chesterton wrote a lot of books and so there are a lot of pieces.The Thing, at first blush, appears to be a collection of loosely related essays that read as such, as opposed to one solidly cohesive work attributed to a clearly defined conclusion. If approached on a chapter by chapter or essay by essay basis; that is, each in the context of itself, The Thing seems empty and cold. However, as Chesterton seemingly always manages, once reflected upon in its entirety, The Thing powerfully reveals that which Chesterton needed so many words and examples to describe that he could only refer to it as Thing when time or space were limited. The fact that it could not be explained succinctly adds to its legitimacy, especially considering the author's gifted ability to translate the abstract. This fact also, in this case, necessitates circular arguments and seemingly unrelated references which one might feel bogs it down at times.It is atypical that Chesterton's work would seem labored. In The Thing Chesterton, on more than one occasion, takes multiple swings at his point; sometimes missing. This is the primary difference between The Thing and this genius of an author's most popular masterpieces. It is in his attempts to put thought to paper, however, that Chesterton makes his point clear enough to call it completed and, what may have been unintentionally, expresses some of life's most difficult to express truths. It might be comparable (with regard to theology) to what Pascal did for modern statistics in writingPensees. Brains of their caliber are great even with regard to the derivatives of a point that many will never have the ability to perceive as they have. In other words The Thing is worth reading if one is able to resist the temptation to force what one expects it to be out of it."},{"Title":"The thing: Why I am a Catholic","review":"highly recommended to fans of &#34;the Thing&#34; gave a lot of creedence to the movie and as character names were the same as movie (Copper , MacReady) it was rather enjoyable and easy to picture in one's &#34;minds eye&#34; what was happening , although there were very subtle differences which made it a little different , but not to the point of annoyance."},{"Title":"Tennesseans in the Civil War, Part I: A Military History of the Confederate and Union Units With Available Rosters of Personnel","review":"This is an awsome account of the Military Histories of the Union and Confederate Armies in Tennessee and also includes information on other State's Armies,both USA ans CSA, as they were combined for different encounters..

Archived material of all description is crammed into the book in a way that favors exhaustiveness over any practical flow. Newspaper clippings, vehicle specifications, route maps, operating stats, and even salvage manifests-- it's all there. The greatest value, however, are the many vintage photographs of streetcars in operation in the Nation's Capital. The author leveraged the efforts of an earlier generation of buffs who found the time to photograph almost every imaginable aspect of Capital Transit assets and operations.The scope of this book purposely focuses on the years 1933 through 1962. These are the years of Capital Transit as a consolidated corporate entity (1933-56), succeeded by D.C. Transit until the final abandonment of streetcar operations in 1962. These years also coincide very closely with the operation of that highwater-mark of streetcar designs, i.e., the PCC or Presidents' Car Commission design.The book's layout and editing really force the reader to work at the material. Fortunately, the information is segmented into \\"bite-size\\" pieces that often provide intriguing reading. Segments about the flamboyant owners-- Louis Wolfson then O. Roy Chalk-- are arguably the the best parts of the book.Recalling the challenges of mid-20th century streetcar operations amounts to a treatise on post-war urban politics in general. During World War II, Capital Transit's operations reflected the workings of a city that was bursting at the seams with newly-settled bureaucrats. A post-war change in company ownership highlighted the backroom politics of utility deregulation and the purposeful destruction of streetcars for the benefit of oil, tire, and bus manufacturers. There's also a candid discussion of the old-boy club of streetcar operators who were effectively shutting out negro operators from their ranks as late as 1955.This fascinating text is occasionally marred by cynical reflections on the \\"loss\\" of Washington D.C. as it existed prior to the last day of streetcar opertions in 1962.... Note on page 182 the suggestion that streetcars expired \\"at the right time,\\" coinciding more or less with the demise of the very elements that defined Washington as segregated, parochial southern \\"town.\\" That complaint aside, it's a fun book."},{"Title":"Capital Transit: Washington's Street Cars, the Final Era 1933-1962","review":"Capital Transit is a comprehensive account of the last 30 years of Washington, DC's cable car system.

Shaklee, Sr","review":"In reading &quot;When Nature Speaks&quot;, one realizes just how remarkable Dr. Shaklee truly was. His philosophy of &quot;In Harmony With Nature&quot; comes from his own personal trials and tribulations. In overcoming TB at birth, being a weakling while growing up, and being forced to become one with nature in order to survive, he realized the importance nature plays in everyone's life, and how we, as a human race, have forgotten a most basic lesson. Which is, that what nature has to offer is everything we need to survive, and live healthy lives. Dr. Shaklee took his philosophy, and being the ingenious person he was, realized a way for everyone to apply it to their own life. He was a man who believed in the healing of people through nutrition (non-drug) and chiropractic methods. Our Creator saw to it that everything we need to maintain life and health was right here on this earth, we have just forgotten that fact, with today's lifestyles.

It calls to mind shorelines lined with tamarisks and cottonwoods, bays mottled with preening mergansers and watchful egrets, water caves full of reflected light, and sunsets mirrored by a shining, landlocked ocean.For others, the name alone is enough to make them start shaking in anger and sadness. For those, Lake Powell is not a lake at all. It's a misbegotten reservoir. It's a crime. It's all that lies between them and the legendary, long lost Glen Canyon-a stretch of the Colorado River so inviting, so overwhelming, and so full of secrets, it's often been called the Grand Canyon's lovelier sibling.Unlike Cataract Canyon upstream, and the Grand Canyon downstream, Glen Canyon was a tranquil place with currents friendly enough for even the most boyish of Boy Scouts and the oldest of old ladies. Edward Abbey considered it the heart of the canyon lands. The residents of White Canyon, Utah--a town since submerged by Lake Powell--considered it home. The Bureau of Reclamation just considered it a good place to build a dam.That dam, Glen Canyon Dam, was built in the early-1960s, to create a reservoir in which to store the water of the Colorado River for the states that needed it, to use the river's water to turn turbines and generate lucrative electricity, to control the Colorado River's seasonal flooding, to bring visiting boaters and their money in from all around the world, and to stop water-borne silt and sediment from clogging Lake Mead, an even larger reservoir downstream. The 710-foot-tall Glen Canyon Dam blocked the path of the Colorado River, the trapped river backed up behind the dam, and everywhere the water could go, it did. It covered multiple rivers, created bays, filled Glen Canyon and side canyons and coves, drowned beavers and snakes and trees, and turned buttes and spires into islands. It changed an almost two hundred-mile-long stretch of the Colorado River into Lake Powell, into a deep, manmade lake with about 1,960 miles of ragged, convoluted shoreline-a shoreline longer than America's West Coast.And then, then there was Gary Ladd.Gary Ladd knew Glen Canyon, and initially hated Lake Powell for inundating it. But then over time, he realized Lake Powell had a very real beauty, a beauty all its own, regardless of its origins, and he started to take pictures of it.And his pictures were gorgeous.And here they are.Right here in this book.Buy this book, and dive into the colors and textures that Gary Ladd manages to capture on film: the blues and the reds, the sugar cookie textures of sandstone, and the shocks of color-filled flowers that burst like life itself up from acres of barren rock.Buy it, set it on your coffee table, and watch the discussions begin."},{"Title":"Lake Powell: A Photographic Essay Of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area","review":"Somehow I didn't buy one of the picture books available locally when I visited this fabulous area so I've been trying to find a memento for several years.

I am an avid movie buff;I am also a staunch sci-fi fan, and enjoy books involving astronomy and beautifully-painted imaginary landscapes of faraway worlds in some other galaxy. I am ALSO a \\"Planet of the Apes\\"(1968) FAN and this is the angle from where my profound interest of this book comes in. This sci-fi classic film was partially shot HERE!! From the very beginning where Charlton Heston & Co. \\"crashland\\" (right SMACK on Lake Powell itself) on this \\"unknown world\\" until suddenly arriving at a nirvana-like location complete with enticing waterfalls and soothing fauna--it just overwhelms my curiosity. I said to myself: I AM DEFINITELY PURCHASING THIS WORK!! Gotta' have it :-)!!! The photography is awesome and really arouses your imagination, providing Lake Powell with a curiously other-worldly ambiance and dimension, most likely the reason why director Frank Shaeffner & producer Arthur P Jacobs chose this area to shoot their movie. It sure footed the bill wholesale (they must have been both satisfied and impressed with it because a year later they shot the equally-excellent sequel \\" Beneath the Palnet of the Apes\\" at the SAME locations). KUDOS!! Once I receive this masterpiece, I will place it on my library alongside all my POTA books. It certainly deserves the honor! lol Highly recommended for anyone who wishes to visit this amazing and breath-taking site. Heaven knows one day my wife and I will certainly visit. P.S. Here is a piece of trivia--word has it that one of the three full-scale plywood (ANSA U.S.S. Icarus) spacecraft used to shoot the \\"sinking scene\\" at the beginning of the movie was NEVER RECOVERED and still rests at the bottom of Lake Powell!

It is fun and easy to read and it has a great message. This book teaches children to share their gifts and talents with others, and that material possessions are not everything in life. This book taught me that in general, people put too much emphasis on material possessions, when we really should be focusing most of our energy on relationships and more important issues that really matter in the world. This book teaches the importance of friendship and overall happiness in life. If children can understand these concepts it will only help them in life. This book shows a fish who starts out being selfish and is very unhappy because he does not have any friends. Eventually, after discussing his lonliness with someone wiser, he shares his rainbow scales with the other fish, who, in return, invite him to join their circle of friends. This simple plot line is easy for children to understand, yet so very important in life. The layout is also simple; there is one paragraph on every other page and it is written with simple language and simple dialogue. Even though this book typically attracts young readers, the message is universal and appropriate for all ages. This is a fantastic book!

So, the fish alienated him.He grew concerned that no one would talk to him, so he sought the advice of an octopus, a creature in this book that I would equate with any modern US democratic party politician.The octopus says if you give each other fish each a shiny scale of yours, they'll like you and you'll be happy and have friends again (wealth redistribution).

Every advertisement tells us that we are not good enough without this or that product. Politicians sell their messages based on the public's acceptance that things are bad and getting worse. And now, here comes Marcus Pfister to jump start that insecurity in our children.Summarizing the plot, the Rainbow Fish is beautiful, but no one's favorite friend until he gives away all his pretty scales. So what does this teach our children? That in order to be accepted, we must lower ourselves to the level of the lowest common denominator? That talent and beauty belong to everyone and those endowed with them must give them away? Or most perversely, the only way one's self-doubt and inner conflict can be overcome and a sense of real value can be instilled is by buying friends through self sacrifice. Does your child really need another element of his or her environment confirming that self worth is measured in the regard of others and that those others must be bought off?? All this book does is instill insecurity into those born with certain advantages.Pfister is widely known for his pedantic moralizing, but this attack on the self image of children is dangerous, harmful and ugly."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Children like this book.

Apparently there are some parents these days who just don't want to teach their children any values."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Rainbow Fish in concept doesn't actually start out badly right off...it could have been a nice little \\"morality play\\" about vanity and pride and how to be considerate of others while celebrating what makes you glitter, literally or figuratively. But that's not where Marcus Pfister chooses to go with it at all. True, at the beginning the little fish is not a very nice or sympathetic character, and does nothing to mitigate the envy of other fish towards his glittery scales. But the lesson he is taught by the octopus is just wrong in so, so many ways! I don't know what is more of a problem for me. Is it...1) The idea that having something unique and special about you in and of itself makes you deserving of scorn and hatred (as opposed to how you choose to act because of or in spite of that uniqueness).2) That you should \\"buy\\" yourself friends3) That the only way to make friends if you are unique or different is to shed what is unique to fit in and stop inviting envy4) That you should give into whatever peers and friends want from you and demand of you, just to get them to like you5) That you should be ashamed or apologetic about your natural talents and inner or outer beautyTo those who say that it's just about \\"sharing\\" and those of us who don't like the book are reading too much into it, I respond that there are some children who process learning very deeply from books... I know because my 5 year old is one of them. I rely greatly on books (good ones..not like this one) when she is facing a crisis like friend trouble, a developmental block like potty learning, a struggle like a death in the family, a fear like her first haircut. I ask for recommendations and read books until I find one that is supportive, but subtle so that she can draw from it what she needs. I shutter to think what messages about peer pressure and self-deprication she would draw from this. She is VERY much perceptive enough, as has been for many years, to draw these negative messages from this book, and I would never want that to color her relationships with other kids or adults.There are incredibly good books out there about sharing.. one of my favorites is \\"How Kind\\" by Mary Murphy.Please, please don't read Rainbow Fish to your kids or anyone else's."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The gimmick of this book -- making the scales out of a shiny material -- is a good one, and my 17-month-old daughter loves it for this reason. I don't find any other reasons to like this book, either.

Maybe I'm expecting too much from a kid's book, but first the fish asks a starfish for advice, then an octopus -- why not go straight to the octopus? The fish goes from vowing never to give away his scales on one page to handing them out like mad on the next, and we don't know why he changes his mind. Why are the other fish suddenly his &quot;friends&quot; when all he's done is given them his scales? There are no reasons given for the fish's behavior, either for keeping his scales or giving them away, why the other fish like him or why he likes the other fish.

Our religions foster sacrifice and guilt.

One day the other fish came to him and asked him to share his scales with them. They said they would not play with him if he did not. The beautiful and shinny fish said No I don't think so. I can not give you my scales for if I did I would die but instead come with me. They followed him to a beam of sunlight penetrating the deep blue/green water. Upon swimming into the sunbeam the shinny scales split the sun light into a prism of wonder creating a dazzling light show. All the fish swam in and around the marvelous sight until all were exhausted and happy. Later that night the wise octopus came up to shinny fish and said that was a wonderful thing you did.

The threat can be in the form of manipulation instead of intimidation or physical harm: Guilt (you will/have caused me to suffer), the removal of love (no one will like you), or salvation (the promise of reward or love).

Sure, it's not perfect and it didn't exactly spread the greatest message, but I can assure you that when asking a grown person who had read the book as a kid what they remembered about it, they probably wouldn't speculate endlessly on how it shaped their morals later on in life.

They seem to be gimmicky efforts to evoke feelings in order to enhance a weak story. The children who read the Pfister book are meant to become envious over the glitter of the gold foil as were the other fishes. Furthermore, the book is also quite steeped in the dreaded didactics. The octopus directly instructs the Rainbow Fish in \\"correct\\" behavior. Why should the Rainbow fish give up pieces of his body that protect him, to these other fish just so they will leave him alone? Some might be inclined to call this a Marxist philosophy incorrectly, but for the fact that the other little fish had no \\"need\\" for the Rainbow Fish's body parts. They simply wanted them.

Children should certainly not be encouraged to model conformity, greed, and buying friendship."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This is the kind of gimmicky book that I usually avoid, a technological tour de force (the pages have mylar stuck onto them!) without substance. But when the book was foisted upon me and my 8-year-old yesterday, I had no choice but to read the story. By the time I got to the last page, I was angry.My first thought was that this book would never have made it past the McCarthy-era censors. Then I wondered what message it was trying to convey. Being different is bad? You should try to buy your friends? You should ignore your own feelings and go along with the crowd? You should mutilate yourself in order to be popular? I have to say that I was hard pressed to find anything in this book to like.Afterward, I discussed the book with my son. First, you shouldn't give away part of yourself to share. If rainbow fish's gifts were that unusual, perhaps it could have become a fish model or starred in an underwater epic adventure and donated the profits to underprivileged fishies. Point being, you can use your assets to help others if that's your goal.I read some reviews that noted that this was a book geared for toddlers and that we shouldn't try to read too much into the text.

The message of this book would be nice if it was truly about sharing but it is not. The fish has to give up his scales to have friends- If he does not he will not have friends.It makes me think of a bully (little fish) saying to a child (rainbow fish)- 'I will not be your friend unless you give me your lunch money'. And this book takes the side of the bully.Here is a quote:\\"Give a glittering scale to each of the other fish. You will no longer be the most beautiful fish in the sea but you will discover how to be happy\\" (---so one cannot be happy unless they sacrifice what is important to them?!?).Also the little fish says to rainbow fish that he just 'wants one little scale' implying that that is the only way to win his friendship.This story would be great if Rainbow fish decided to share his scales WITHOUT the pressure that it is the ONLY way to win friendships.

It is replete with destructive, anti-individuality themes centering around the story of a beautiful fish which is coerced by mobs of begging, greedy, mediocre fish and an ominous octopus into tearing off its body parts (scales) to appease its peers. It is absolutely disgusting. While many reviewers like the theme of \\"sharing\\" in this story, the reality is that for an extremely young audience, the analogy is completely inappropriate. Even a very small child knows that scales are necessary for a fish and part of its body. How many adulating reviews would there be if the protagonist were a child asked to mutilate himself by giving up his skin to win \\"friends\\"? Even putting aside this disturbing analogy in this story, the \\"lesson\\" of this story really is twofold: first, \\"friends\\" are friendly if they are bought, and second, one must never have more than anyone else or by extension, try to work harder or excell beyond one's peers. Blend in, be part of the crowd, another sheep. I would encourage parents to avoid this garbage.

In fact, Socialism/Communism has killed more people in history than all wars combined.Sharing is one thing. Sacrificing yourself is another.There is only one place this road leads ... to the eradication of personal property and property rights.Everyone should learn the value of sharing, but there is no value in giving all to those who give none.I'm reminded of recent events, during which the United States was called \\"stingy\\" for not giving more, when, in fact, such individuals/countries will never be happy until we have given all, have nothing left, and are as destitute as they are.Sharing is caring and sharing is a choice.

Children are better to be told stories about liking themselves rather than stories of doing whatever it takes to be liked by others.It's doubtful the two sides will agree on this book, but I suggest that before buying this it, take a moment to read it and determine the message for yourself.A better story about sharing is Donna Jakob's My New Sandbox."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Defining what makes a children's book a classic is difficult. Increasingly, today, a classic is any book that a publisher manages to keep selling for more than five years. The Rainbow Fish is, to my mind, one of these books.Rainbow Fish is gifted with unusual iridescent scales, which he arrogantly declines to share. As a result of not wanting to share his scales, he is unpopular, and eventually, with the aid of a wise octopus, learns that by sharing his scales he can make friends.What exactly is the message here? Are the fish's scales a form of wealth? If so, does the lesson Rainbow Fish learns mean that fish are socialists? Is it wrong to differ from your peers, as he does before distributing his scales to others so everyone has exactly one rainbow scale? What does this say about his individuality? Alternatively, is this not a question of difference but of class, with the sparkling scales a form of inappropriately conspicuous consumption? Put simply, is it wrong to, pardon the pun, upscale your peers? I find the suggestion that Rainbow Fish has no other way to make friends than to surrender his unique scales disturbing. Should my son surrender his prized new tie-dyed shirt to his preschool peers if they desire it, perhaps in swatches so everyone can have a bit? Why should he? Sharing is a noble and vital virtue to instill in our kids, but not at the expense of their identities.Many reviewers on this site cite this book for its \\"wonderful moral and terrific lesson,\\" so I anticipate that I am not going to get a lot of people who found this review helpful. Regardless, I can't pretend that I find this a good book. If the message is one about appreciating inner beauty, shouldn't the Rainbow Fish simply have laid his finery aside altogether?Visually, the book offers an appealingly rich underwater palette of blues, and the magically sparkling iridescent scales embedded in the pages contribute, no doubt, to small hands pulling this book off the shelf. But all that glitters isn't gold; this book certainly isn't."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"In my culture sacrifice for common good of the people is a good thing.

More obviously, this book preaches conformity and appears to pay homage to the idea that no one should be any different than anyone else. The very idea that an individual should give away or somehow destroy the thing that makes him/her unique is terrible. Instead, the book should teach children how to treat others nicely and not use natural beauty/talent as a means of alienating peers."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I received this book as a gift. Thankfully, I read it to my 3 month old twins so they really couldn't understand it. The moral of this book goes against everything we teach our kids about being themselves and making friends. What this book tells kids is that if you give others \\"your most valuable possessions\\" they will be your friends, and that everyone should look the same. I was dumbfounded when I read this book. All the other fish (that looked the same) shunned the fish that was different because it wouldn't give the other fish it's shinny scales. The idea of the fish taking off pieces of his flesh and body to make friends and discontinue to be exiled is disturbing. These are not the morals I want to teach my kids.

This is a wonderful book about sharing and good attitudes! My students (3-years-old) love this story and compliment illustrations in the full length book.

He's arrogant and mean about it, so the other fish refuse to play with him (because he's a jerk, and not because they are jealous). After taking someone's advice that he might be happier giving away his scales; he ends up giving his shiny scales away to all the fish until they each have one... AND HE FEELS GOOD ABOUT SHARING.I think this is a great story when discussing sharing and how good it can feel to give gifts - and I'm not a Socialist. It also teaches children if they are mean to their friends, they won't have anyone left to play with. My students have never taken away a message that you need to buy your friends or that one cannot be special and unique - because they are children and not insane adults. Those who gave the story a poor review clearly have a negative view on society and are most likely raising selfish, materialistic, bratty children."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The story sounds simple enough. A fish with beautiful scales is asked by other fish if they could have but one of the Rainbow fish's scales. The Rainbow fish refuses to do so, and begins to alienate the fish around him. Dejected, the Rainbow fish gets advice to share the scales so he will become happy. After doing so, the Rainbow fish now has one scale, just like the rest of the fish around him, and the Rainbow fish is happy.All this under the guise of a great book on sharing. It's an important Christian concept, isn't it?The concepts are very clear: equal distribution of wealth, and a feeling of entitlement by the non-rainbow scaled fish. The Rainbow scales are not a necessity to any fish but the Rainbow fish. The other fish are disappointed with the stinginess of the Rainbow fish and refuse to associate with the Rainbow fish. The focus of the story is on the feelings of the wealthy fish, not on the greed or need of the other fish. The values that should be taught with respect to this story is not that sharing makes you happy, but rather greed (and gossip) makes you unhappy. One should be pleased and satisfied with one's own self. The coveting of the other fish is a *bad* thing, and should not be ignored.Sharing is important. It does have a tendency to imply return of ownership of property, however. If that isn't the case, it's called \\"giving\\" or even \\"sacrifice\\". The Rainbow fish had no obligation, morally or ethically, to give the protection of life God gave it to others. God's view is a capitalistic view. It is important to use your God-given gifts to help others selflessly, but prudently.Communism is all about equal distribution of wealth. Everyone is equal. Nobody above any others. It isn't fair that anyone is rich. Didn't Jesus tell a story about talents that were given disproportionately? Each of the talent recipients were given different amounts. That wasn't fair, was it? The Bible also says (roughly) that those who have shown responsibility in little, more will be given for responsibility. The wealthy fish was guilted into distributing its wealth, to fish that weren't in need. That isn't what the Bible says to do. (The rich man being told to give everything away wasn't told that to make friends.)Even if one doesn't agree with me about the existence of God, or the precepts of the Bible, please take other comments here to heart.

As many other reviewers have pointed out, the book begins with a premise which could serve to teach many valuable lessons. The protagonist is more beautiful than all the other fish, and is prideful because of his beauty. Rather than creating a story where the fish must deal with his pride, the author instead points to the fish's beauty as the source of his problem. In order to win acceptance with the other fish, he removes his beautiful scales and gives them to the other fish to buy their affection. If the author wants us all to be socialists, he should begin by giving his book away for free (hopefully, he won't. The last thing we need is greater circulation of claptrap such as this)."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Ouch - I paid too much for this glitzy book based on its cover.

That is, if I keep giving and giving and giving, maybe someday people will love me and meet my needs. The only possible use I would have for this book is to provide an example for Self Sacrificing people to see that this strategy is self defeating. In a nutshell, the message is: give away your most prized possessions to any random acquaintence so that you may avoid being ostracized, and if you give of yourself (to your substantial loss) others may \\"include\\" you, even if only for a fraction of a second. If you take the book one step beyond, and postulate what happens after these so-called new \\"friends\\" are done celebrating their ill-gotten gains, one may wonder how long Rainbow Fish's warm & fuzzy feeling lasts once those bought (fake) friends decide to turn their attention onto other facinations or get annoyed when Rainbow Fish has nothing left to give.

A little fish asks for one of the Rainbow Fish's pretty scales. When the Rainbow Fish says no, all the other fish ostracise him for refusing. After he gives all his scales but one, the other fish become his friends. They were never his friends to start with; he had BUY their friendship. The other fish were jealous and greedy, and pressured him to give what was rightfully his in order to be his friends. If the Rainbow Fish had given some scales to a fish who never asked just to be kind, that would be a very different story and maybe a decent one, but that's not how this book goes. Talk about encouraging an attitude of greed and entitlement on the part of all those other fish.

I picked this up and read it in the bookstore. I was shocked at this book, why is explained below, and I strongly suggest that you carefully consider the book's message. Please keep in mind that I did not come into this book with any preconceived ideas and I did not read a single review prior to reading the book. But after one reading, I realized this is not a book about sharing but about discrimination, conformity, bullying, self-mutilation, etc. I am sure the author did not intend this, but let me explain to you why this is the message of the book.Summary of the book:The rainbow fish was born with a natural gift of beautiful sparkly scales (note its a genetic trait the same as blue eyes or blond hair). Because of how beautiful she was, the other fish discriminated against and mocked her (note they were not punished for that bullying). The rainbow fish therefore could not make friends and was terribly lonely. So the only way to make friends was to rip off all but one of her beautiful scales and give them away to those who had persecuted her (self-mutilation). Only when she bribed others by giving them things, could she have friends and be happy with herself. Seriously that is the story in this book but written in more colorful words with pretty pictures.So what this book actually teaches are the following:1. You should be ashamed of your natural beauty, talents, giftings, etc. and others have the right to hate you and discriminate against you for them.2. In order to make friends you have to destroy yourself or bribe them because having friends and not being lonely are the only things that can possibly make you happy in life.3. No one can get along unless everyone is exactly the same and has exactly the same things.All of this is totally the opposite message we should be giving to our children! Diversity in talents, skin color, hair types, abilities, giftings, etc. is what makes our society INTERESTING and children should never mock others because of those differences and no child should feel ashamed for being smart or beautiful or athletic. They should use those talents to serve others and work together as a team.Therefore find another book to read to your kid that actually deals with sharing."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This is a beautiful book and the shiny scales are very attractive to babies of all ages. Although I understand where one-star reviewers are coming from, I think that once a child is old enough to understand the message he will be old enough to recieve the complete version of this story, which explains the fish's \\"sharing\\" in better detail. Keep in mind that babies young enough for a board book will be equally happy with your own narration of the story. I think a perhaps poor abbreviation of a great story is outweighed by how cute the board book is, and I'm sure babies will be more interested in the shiny scales on the pages than the specific narration of the story."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book has a terrible message. No one wants to be the Rainbow Fish's friend because he won't give them his shiney scales. Eventually Rainbow Fish gives all his scales away and everyone is his friend. So let me get this right, if I have something you want and I won't give it to you then you won't be my friend. Nice pictures, bad message."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book is so beautiful on the outside it's a pity that the words are so incredibly hurtful and wrong. The story is about a fish who is covered with beautiful scales. Another fish comes up and asks to be given one of the scales and the beautiful fish says no, after which none of the other fish will play with it. The fish is advised by someone \\"wise\\" to give away its beautiful scales so that the other fish will like it. It follows that advise and gives every other fish a scale so that by the end of the book the page is filled with a bunch of pathetic looking fish that all have one shiny scale and everyone is supposedly happy. For me this is a terrible moral! It's wrong to be prettier or smarter or more talented in some way? You should try to make yourself less pretty or dumber or ignore your talents so other people won't be jealous? It's OK to demand other people give you things that you covet? Yuk!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"From Publisher's Weekly, '...the lonely fish seeks advice from the wise octopus, who counsels him to give away his beauty and \\"discover how to be happy.\\"'So because no one likes him, he is supposed to share what makes him an individual so that everyone else can be just like him?I won't be reading my children anything that says Socialism is okay."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book will soon become one of your child's favorites. No one is immune to the stunning beauty of the vivid watercolors that are highlighted with reflective, colored foil to make the Rainbow Fish shimmer across the page. The sheer gorgeousness of the image makes the moral of the story hit home like a smack into the middle of your forehead. All children have trouble learning to share, and this book makes an eloquent case for why that's in your child's best interest. It is easy to see why this book won the American Bookseller's 1995 Book of the Year Award!The Rainbow Fish was simply &quot;the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean.&quot; He had scales that &quot;were every shade of blue and green and purple, with sparkling silver scales among them.&quot; Not only was he the most beautiful, the &quot;other fish were amazed at his beauty.&quot; When the other fish invited him, &quot;Come play with us!&quot;, he would just glide by. But he did enjoy being admired.When one of the fish asked for a scale, the Rainbow Fish haughtily said, &quot;Get away from me!&quot; Pretty soon everyone avoided the Rainbow Fish, and he was lonely.The rest of the story describes how Rainbow Fish achieved happiness through sharing. In the process, he makes the whole ocean more beautiful and his own life a study in connectedness. Psychologists tell us that people have both a need to be distinctive and a need to be connected. Those desires can cause behavior that improves one satisfaction at the expense of the other. The Rainbow Fish effectively shows how the two dimensions can be combined through locating and sharing with others who have the same interests.This book will be improved by some discussions because a child may not have the experience to know how to extend the moral of this story into her or his own life. For example, your child doesn't need to permanently give away 90 percent of his or her toys in order to have any friends. However, your child should be prepared to share 100 percent of toys when friends or relatives visit. You can explain to your child how the same sharing will occur in reverse when visiting the other children. In that way, everyone has more and more fun.You can also use the story to help explain the joys of giving to those in need. For example, you could read this book before your child trick or treats for UNICEF (or helps raise money for some other charity) for the first time.Unfortunately, your child can mistakenly see this book as suggesting that it is a bad idea to stand out. That can be harmful in areas like academic achievement, where there is a lot of peer pressure not to excel in some schools. You want your child to understand that excellence is praiseworthy, but pridefulness and rudeness towards others are not.You can turn this around by encouraging your child to come up with games and activities that can be shared with others. When we share the richness of our minds, the lives of all are improved. The bounty we receive in return is boundless.I like books that raise fundamental questions about how to live an upright and emotionally rich life, and The Rainbow Fish will provide many wonderful opportunities for discussions of this sort. As a result, you will have more wonderful experiences with your child. That's a great benefit to get from sharing this book!After you have finished reading the book many times, ask your child how a person can obtain more happiness. You will be impressed with the good ideas you will hear, and you can enjoy the happiness of seeing the beauty of your child's character in the answers.Create beauty through giving!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I was vulnerable pre-school student when The Rainbow Fish was originally released. Our teacher was excited, it was a new release, included beautiful images, and she thought it would convey a valuable message. I am currently a university student and feel that it is important for parents to understand how this book damaged my social life. The book basically brain washed me into thinking that if I give other children nice things, they will be my friends! The main character has beautiful rainbow scales and the other sea creatures refuse to befriend him until he gave everyone a scale, resulting with the fish having nothing left for himself. As an impressionable five year old, I absorbed this message and this resulted in major social conflicts during my youth. During lunch time, the other students would ask if they could take parts of my lunch or if I could give them some of my lunch money. I would willingly agree and often had nothing left for myself. I spent my childhood worrying that if I did not give people nice things or did not meet their demands, they would not befriend me. I'm now twenty and luckily I have overcome the self-esteem problem that this book encouraged. How about teaching children to befriend people who like them for who they are, not just when you give them nice things! My experience might have been an extreme case, I'm not sure, but I do put a lot of the blame on this book. It has been 15 years since this book was first read to me and I still despise it. Please avoid reading this garbage to your children.There are tons of children's books out there with useful messages, and this isn't one of them!0 stars"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"My, how sad for you!

This book teaches children that being different is a horrible thing to be. Shame on the publishers for publishing this book!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The Rainbow Fish by Marcus Pfister is probably one of my top favorites. The special effects on each page are very pretty. The scales on this peculiar fish aren't just normal and dull, but they are shiny and rainbow.The book starts out with Rainbow Fish adoring his scales. He would glide through the sea proud of his beautiful scales. But when the other fish would call to him to come and play he would be too indulged in himself to even pay attention to the other fish. One day a small fish asks him to share a small scale so he can show the beautiful scale off too. The small fish angers the Rainbow Fish because he thinks he shouldn't have even asked. No one would want to give away gorgeous scales! After a while no one wants to play with him. He is puzzled and goes to the wise octopus. The octopus says that if he shares a scale with almost every fish in the sea, he will be happy and loved.The book teaches a lesson that describes how beauty comes from within rather than on the outside. A good lesson that almost every child should know for a key to happiness."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I love this book! I bought it for my Grandson's Graduation from Pre-K.

But I just know they'll love it!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book was a gift to my 2-year old, but has now been hidden away. It seems possible to draw a positive messages out of the book, namely that (1) someone who has special &quot;gifts&quot; (shiny scales, here) shouldn't be rude to others, and (2) having shiny scales won't really make you happy. However, this positive message can be easily confused with the more pernicious messages that (1) it's justifiable to ostracize someone that's different from the crowd, and (2) if you have been gifts, you should &quot;share&quot; them with everyone who demands (yes, demands: &quot;Give me just one little scale!&quot;) this of you. Gee, if I'm good at playing soccer, then how do I &quot;share&quot; this? The obvious way to achieve the situation at the end of this book--everyone is the same--is just choose to *not* play soccer better than my peers, meaning not as well as I could. If the &quot;shiny scales&quot; are taken to represent money or possessions in general, then the book amounts to a brainwashing in Marxism. We'll all be happy if only those who have more possessions will give them up to the community. I always wondered what happens to the poor fish that aren't among the lucky 15 or 20 who get to share the rainbow fish's scales. What happens when he is only down to one? The result is an &quot;oligarchy&quot; of a few fish who each have one shiny scale. Message: Obviously they're all better off than the millions of other fish who have none. The negative message remains: Shiny scales make the fish happy. That's what my 2-year old got out of the last page, when I asked &quot;Why are all the fish happy now?&quot; Probably a well-intentioned book, but a failure to convey a clear and profitable message."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The reviewers who said the book teaches children that you can buy friendship must spend their lives believing that everyone who does a good deed has an ulterior motive. The story actually shows that rainbow fish felt good about himself when he learned to share and he gained friends as a bonus."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Kids love the graphics.

So, not wanting to be left out (as usual), I grabbed a copy from the library and gave it a go. (How popular it is can be measured by how long I waited for this on hold-- close to six months.) And it's not bad, if a bit gimmicky (the little reflective bits on the pages, which seems a lot more like something someone in marketing came up with, rather than the author saying \\"hey, wouldn't this be cool?\\") and more than a bit heavy-handed (this is one case where my well-trod phrase \\"as subtle as a week-old dead haddock\\" is actually more apropos than usual). And, of course, the book's moral has been done eight hundred thousand times in kidlit, so if you prefer your kids getting the \\"sharing is caring\\" message in a more well-presented way, you've certainly no shortage of alternatives. But the shiny bits will probably hold your kids' attention, and it's an easy-to-follow story. Not bad. ***"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I totally reccomend this book to any aged people.

This group also tries to do things just because it has ten, twenty, or more group members, and exert power on other persons or small groups. To me, this kind of group stinks, and this book depicts a group similar to such a group and glorifies it.Extension to this story:The rainbow fish lost his scale one day, and he missed the scale so much. So he asked other fish, whether any one of them doesn't want the scale and will give it to him. Some fish say, \\"I am very busy lately\\". Some fish say, \\"It is YOUR problem, not mine\\".

The community organizer fish would stir up all the other fish to rise up against the rainbow fish, telling them that the rainbow fish had acquired their scales unfairly and that those scales needed to be re-distributed. The community organizer fish uses vague nonsensical phrases like, \\"Hope and change,\\" or, \\"We are the ones we have been waiting for,\\" and, \\"Yes, we can!\\"Then the community organizer fish gets all the other now disgruntled fish to elect him head fish. He then proceeds to make new fish rules and create all kinds of new fish governing agencies (staffed by his cronies) which pretty much makes life miserable for all the fish. But that's okay because, he tells them, the rainbow fish are really getting taken to the cleaners with all these new rules and regulations and that should make everyone feel really good.It's not long before the rainbow fish are either all killed off or just leave for safer waters and now everyone is really miserable. Well, everyone except for the community organizer fish and his obnoxious wife (she tells all the other fish how to eat healthy even though she is obviously overweight) who go on elaborate vacations at the expense of the lesser, ordinary fish.

It has been said much better than I can, so I won't repeat the sentiment. But, for a lesson in blatant hypocrisy, check out the \\"see inside feature\\". Ain't much to see, comrade. About all you get is the copyright page that explains that the pretty scales all belong to Mr. Pfister and you can't have a single one without his permission - which he will gladly give to you in exchange for some of the currency in your possession. Not even a peek-a-boo on amazon.com.However, it is about the only page worth reading anyway. The fact that it is REQUIRED reading in many public schools is absolutely repulsive, but it speaks volumes of the current state of public education/indoctrination. The slimy little Bolshevik should be squished under a weighty tome of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and be put out of his misery before he dies a slow death from a nasty sea fungus infecting his raw, weeping, denuded and unscaled flesh.

My Grandson will love it as much as his Daddy did"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book has a nice message, and I am looking for further Rainbow Fish books. I was shocked to see the negative reviews so prominently displayed on Amazon. To those who think the Rainbow Fish is \\"giving away his identity, or that part of himself that is unique\\" you are missing the fact that this is a PARABLE, not to be taken literally. Obviously a fish cannot really take off and share scales. Folks, the story is a METAPHOR for sharing your desirable possessions with others. It is not suggesting that your child should rip out her pretty blue eyes and give them away. But guess what? Being pretty does NOT qualify you as a special and unique individual -- and that's exactly what this book teaches! Don't you all know that it's \\"what's inside that counts?\\""},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"While the intended moral of the story may be \\"sharing\\" it fails miserably in its attempt to portray it. It really says that friendship is conditional. That you must somehow \\"buy\\" it. Such friendships are alwsys shallow, fair weather at best, exploitive at worst.The Octopus (that produces ink like a squid?) is the main villain in this story. First, she fails to understand that the Rainbow Fish was rejected not for having prettier scales than the other fish, but rather for being snobbish. Rather than being urged to mutilate himself by ripping out his own scales, the Rainbow Fish should have been taught that each fish is beautiful in its own way. Having learned this, he would no longer be snobbish. Not only would he then gain the respect of the other fish, but also he would establish a much truer friendship with them than one that was simply bought.The epilogue to the story: The Rainbow Fish, deprived of his protective scales, dies of exposure and infection. The other fish, those who have not been killed by an allergic reaction to the rainbow fish scales, watch their own pilfered rainbow scales shrivel up and die, since they are no longer attached to the owner."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I'm pleased to see all the negative reviews because I hate this book. I really, really HATE this book. It's strange such a simple children's book would awake such vehement feelings, but this story is wrong on so many levels it's hard to know where to start. I'm a parent and an educator and would never choose this book, despite the pretty watercolors and gimmicky prismatic sparkly scales.The Rainbow fish is a beautiful sparkly fish. He's also vain and rude. We see him at the beginning refusing to share his sparkly scales with a smaller fish, and subsequently all the other fish refuse to play with him. Mr. Rainbow is lonely, so he goes to the wise octopus for advise. Now, does the wise Octopus tell him to be kind to others and they will like him for who he is? No! Does he tell him to recognize the beauty in the other fish and curb his vanity? No! Does he tell him to throw a really great party and invite everyone? NO! He tells him he must give away all his sparkly scales. Yes, Rainbow is going to buy himself some friends!The little fish arrives right on cue, and Rainbow hands out a scale. Soon every other fish is clamoring for scales, and he doles them out until everyone has one, everyone is the same, and now they can happily play together.Now, let's pause for a moment and see what kind of message we really want to send to our children. Here are some possibilities:* It doesn't matter how obnoxious you are, if you give away fancy presents people will like you.* If you are more attractive than the people around you, they will not like you.* You must be the same as people around you to enjoy their company* Don't even bother trying to make friends with someone who is different than you.* You should give things that are important to you away to people you don't know or they won't play with you.* People will not like you if you have things they want and won't give them to them.* I must change who I am for people to like me.You get the idea. I don't want my kids to have the idea that friendships are solely based on things, or to think they have to change to be who other people want them to be - the Rainbow fish is no longer a Rainbow Fish at the end of the book, he's just like everyone else. The book had possibilities. It could have been a lesson in diversity. It could have been a lesson in being kind. It could have been a lesson on standing up to bullies. I would so much rather the Rainbow fish found new friends who liked him for who he was. But instead it's a poorly done \\"sharing\\" story where the hero doesn't share his things, he has to rip off pieces of himself until he's someone else. There are better choices."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The illustrations in this book are well done and creative but that is the only good thing to be said about Rainbow Fish. To quote another reviewer - couldn't say it better myself - the \\"moral(s)\\" of the book, can be summed up as follows: (1) being special is evil, and worthy of hatred; (2) if you do not give your possessions away to others on their demand and pursuant to their coercion, you will be rightfully hated; (3) you will be happy only if you are mediocre; (4) you need to bribe people to be your friends. And the message here is not about sharing. Notice, the Rainbow Fish does not \\"share\\" his scales (sharing would imply that his friends were going to give the scales back when they are done.) No, the Rainbow Fish is compelled (by emotional coercion) to give away that which makes him special.A much superior and positive message can be found in the new book Starboortz Fish. This story is about a starfish that sets about to find his special talents and how he can can use his skills make him successful and happy. That is the message that children ought to be hearing."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The author of this book has mis-directed the resentment against the Rainbow Fish. He wasn't disliked because he wouldn't give up his scales (only ONE FISH had expressed a desire for a scale!!) He was disliked for being arrogant and a jerk. This could have been a wonderful story about true friendship and how close friends confide one to another along with the consequences of gossip (something Pfister totally glossed over).Although I can appreciate the author's intent in teaching a lesson on sharing, it seems the logical extent that he give up his scales in order to make a friend and to feel happy just doesn't work.I suggest an alternate: Friendless, the Rainbow Fish becomes humble and asks the small fish for forgiveness for being a jerk. He tries to \\"buy\\" the small fish's friendship by first offering him a scale. The small fish sees through it and refuses the scale. The RF cries and confesses to being a jerk. The small fish seeing the pathetic state of the Rainbow Fish accepts the apology and they become best friends. At some point as their relationship grows, the Rainbow Fish, as a token of his true friendship gives the small fish one of his scales. The small fish is overjoyed, but he starts to feel bad. He told all the other fish what a jerk the Rainbow Fish was. He confesses to the Rainbow Fish what he told everyone. The small blue fish then, to make things better, goes and tells the other fish that Rainbow Fish is not like he used to be. In fact, RF gave the small fish a beautiful scale and RF did it not to MAKE a friend, but because he WAS a friend.The other fish are impressed and decide if the small blue fish can be convinced, they will accept RF as a friend, too. The end."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The Rainbow Fish is a great book for all ages! I am a student teacher and used this to create a book extension for the kids.

I picked this up and read it in the bookstore. I was shocked at this book, why is explained below, and I strongly suggest that you carefully consider the book's message. Please keep in mind that I did not come into this book with any preconceived ideas and I did not read a single review prior to reading the book. But after one reading, I realized this is not a book about sharing but about discrimination, conformity, bullying, self-mutilation, etc. I am sure the author did not intend this, but let me explain to you why this is the message of the book.Summary of the book:The rainbow fish was born with a natural gift of beautiful sparkly scales (note its a genetic trait the same as blue eyes or blond hair). Because of how beautiful she was, the other fish discriminated against and mocked her (note they were not punished for that bullying). The rainbow fish therefore could not make friends and was terribly lonely. So the only way to make friends was to rip off all but one of her beautiful scales and give them away to those who had persecuted her (self-mutilation). Only when she bribed others by giving them things, could she have friends and be happy with herself. Seriously that is the story in this book but written in more colorful words with pretty pictures.So what this book actually teaches are the following:1. You should be ashamed of your natural beauty, talents, giftings, etc. and others have the right to hate you and discriminate against you for them.2. In order to make friends you have to destroy yourself or bribe them because having friends and not being lonely are the only things that can possibly make you happy in life.3. No one can get along unless everyone is exactly the same and has exactly the same things.All of this is totally the opposite message we should be giving to our children! Diversity in talents, skin color, hair types, abilities, giftings, etc. is what makes our society INTERESTING and children should never mock others because of those differences and no child should feel ashamed for being smart or beautiful or athletic. They should use those talents to serve others and work together as a team.Therefore find another book to read to your kid that actually deals with sharing."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"My wife wanted this book for our daughter-in-law.

It has colorful, sparkly images, and a simple story line about sharing. This is a great book for young kids to learn the importance of sharing what they have with others, and that what's on the outside doesn't matter nearly as much as what they have on the inside. I've read many reviews about how the fish is giving away his originality, which left those readers believing that this is a negative message to send to kids. In the ultimate age of the egocentric youth and me-me-me-the-world-revolves-around-me, it's okay to send to message to kids at a young age that giving a part of themselves to make others happy can be a good thing.

I picked up the book and read it while at their house to humor myself. Much to my suprise I ended up in a heated disucssion with my friend's wife. We life in a country with rights and freedoms not allowed throughout the world, and furthermore, we are a society that embraces capitalism and the right to property. The morals that this book teaches is an insult to American culture and values (not to mention capitalistic values). Reminds me of when one of my Aunt's children went to school on their first day (after my Aunt went out and spent way too much money buying expensive school supplies for my cousin) and came home crying saying that the teacher \\"stole all my school supplies.\\" Turns out the teachers at that school CONFISCATE all children's school supplies and divide them evenly to be fair and make sure everyone has the same amount!

If justice existed in this world, Guarldo Rivera would descend from his golden chariot to give you the WWII Medal of honor stripped from Mother Theresa's illegitimate child's refridgerator. I wouldn't trade my copy of the book for all the monkeys in china, which add up to 20 score and, if I may add, taste quite qunudulatous. Why, even now I feel like pushing a sushi-stuffed fingerpuppet into a room with a note attached that reads \\"take a shower\\" just because this book hjas opened up my eyes. My eyes are open to a world where the rainbow fish sheds enthusiasm and stunningly good looks to every corner of the globe, which is flat. Magellan can take his circular world and jam it straight up his pie hole. And by pie-hole, i of course mean fish tank filled with shaved armchairs. I like them shaved because I have fair skin, and furry chairs hurt my pores.

Kudos bars to you."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"What a wonderful book! It teaches children that material and superficial things, like outward beauty, aren't as important as having friendship with others. It also teaches children not to value themselves for what they look like.The Rainbow Fish is the most beautiful fish in the ocean, filled with silver sparkly scales that none of the other fish have. The Rainbow Fish thinks he is better than all the other fish and won't play with them just because he has silver scales and they don't. One day, a small blue fish asks the Rainbow Fish if he could have one of his scales, and the Rainbown Fish scoffs at him, and refuses to share, thinking that the silver scales are his most prized possession and are the only things that make him special.Ultimately, the other fish refuse to be friends with Rainbow Fish because of his superior attitude/refusal to share. Distraught, he seeks the advice of a wise Ocotopus who advises him to share so that he can find happiness. When the Rainbow fish shares his scales/beauty, he begins to put less value on his outward appearance. He also enables the other fish to feel special, too. A friendship is built when the Fish share with each other, and now that the Rainbow fish has stopped feeling and acting superior to the other fish, he has opened himself up to their friendship.Beautiful story!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"As a teacher of two-year-olds, I could not be happier with this book. The Big Book style keeps the children entralled while I \\"read\\" the book.

I might add that in the electronic world that we live in, we need more books like this to stimulate children's desire to read.

I think not, especially when it is YOUR children being indoctrinated with this book BY TEACHERS that LOVE this book WHO BELONG to a UNION who constantly changes educational policy that continuously feel sorry for the underachiever and contempt for the overachiever while dragging america slowly to the middle of the Global Bell Curve.You think your children are going to school to learn to be brilliant? mathematical geniuses? Science Wonks? guess again, they play little RF activities that involve making Rainbow Fish and then YANKING the scales off thier project and giving it to someone else in the class. I know this because my college trained-socialist-teacher-wife did this every years since 1997 not knowing it was a lesson in class-warfare. In my day(1974) you sat down in class, hands folded, did your work, were drilled to death all the while being told that 'education' was your way to get a 'silver scale'. The underachieving students were your future blue collar workers and the smartest were the doctors/lawyers and such everyone accepted their place in life.Then along comes RF in the nineties a fews years after all that conservative/capitalist/ jingoist culture from the 80's has finally worked its way out and it fills the perfect literary vacuum that existed in child literature.There is not a sucessfull parent out there today that can claim thier success and ancestors success on socialism and communism while living in this country, in fact, most of you are RAINBOW FISH, and at least 1 millions american want what you have.Thank goodness that your childs friends have been too stupified to realize that your child and you are RAINBOW FISH and decide to unite against your family.Please, throw out the Che poster, hang up an american flag and teach your children to be great people yet compassionate, a lot of wealthy people donate to good causes, why not go that route?This book should have woken up america to what was happenening to thier chidren, but did not.

Well, here's news for you: children are children. They don't read Jack Kerouac, Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Virginia Woolf. I have never met a child in my entire life who was searching for some life-changing philosophy while reading \\"Grug\\", and if I did, I'd worry about the sanity of their parents.When I was young, I read \\"The Rainbow Fish\\", and to this day I have fond memories of it. I didn't care in the least that Rainbow Fish didn't change his facial expression. I didn't think that he was being emotionally blackmailed. I certainly didn't come to the conclusion that mediocre and conformist is the best you can strive for. No; I enjoyed it because it was a fun tale, with some beautiful artwork. I was once asked what the book was about, and I said that Rainbow Fish was very arrogant, until no one liked him. So then the octopus told him to do something about it. Thinking back, it's obvious that what the author was intending by the giving of the scales to the other fish, was simply to be used as a metaphor so that the child reader, at the end of the day, to possibly realise that, really, everyone is equal. Rainbow Fish gave the other fish his beautiful scales so he could see that they had beauty too.Yes, it's simple. Yes, the characters are shallow. But it's a book for children! It doesn't pretend to be a great, all-encompassing tome of wisdom. It does profess to be an easy-to-read, fun tale, one that children will enjoy. And at the end, there is a moral, and it's a good one, but it's not so obvious that children will yawn and think, \\"not another goody-two-shoes story.\\" Unfortunately, it seems that this message, while easy enough for children to divine, is too subtle for certain reviewers to understand..."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Both my 3 and 4 year old daughters love this book.

It is about overcoming selfishness and vanity. It is about how much more fun you can have when you spread things out equally amongst everyone. You'll never have any fun keeping everything to yourself. Whoever it was that said that because the fish didn't give the scales back at the end, therefore it's not \\"sharing\\", the scales are a metaphor not for talents/gifts but for possessions that are not really needed. I find these \\"insulted\\" readers to apply a very individualistic attitude to the book, which is not necessarily the only correct or moral one to have.

OTHERWISE THE BINDING AND PAGES WERE IN GOOD SHAPE"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"What makes this book so special? It's the Big Book version, published in 1992, to be used with small children in classroom settings, or in your home, for that matter. It is 18 inches by 13.3 inches, less than a quarter inch thick. Lucky the little girl or little boy who may be given a copy of this \\"big book\\" to stimulate their interest in reading, even at an early age. While many primary classrooms use this version, some lucky little girls and little boys have been given copies of this. Perhaps you will find it at your local library.The artistic quality of the illustrations can rarely be matched, with the holographic inserts on the scales of Rainbow Fish. As you read this story to one of your little dear hearts, you will be caught up in the beauty of this fish and the blue, green, purple, and silver scales, the latter being the holographic dimension, that embellishes his personality.Rainbow Fish is admired by all the other fish; some even ask for a scale or two, but he withholds giving scales, and they, in turn, withdraw from him; he feels the loneliness, and seeks advice from the Starfish who, in turn, sends him to seek help from the Octopus.At this point, a love story develops when Octopus advises Rainbow Fish to \\"give away\\" a scale to each of the other fish, with the consequence of not being the most beautiful fish, but perhaps finding the way to be happy. The Octopus disappears, and as the little Blue Fish swims by, his fin touches Rainbow Fish; he asks Rainbow for \\"just one scale\\". Rainbow Fish gives in and shares a small scale with Blue Fish; he watches the Blue fish whizz by \\"with his new scale glittering in the water\\", and Rainbow Fish is in awe that so small a gesture would make another fish so happy. Soon, all the other fish surrounded him and he, in turn, gave each one a simple glittering scale. He was filled with delight, and at last, \\"at home among the other fish\\".With only one scale remaining, Rainbow Fish was now happier than he had ever been, swimming with his friends. You see, now he looked just like them! What do you think the message of this story is? Read it, and find out!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"In this story there is a fish that has beautiful shinning scales. He was the only one in the ocean that had them. The other sea creatures called him \\"The Rainbow Fish.\\" When he swam by all the other fish they would just sit there and stare at The Rainbow Fish. If someone would call out to him, for him to come and play he would just swim right by as if u never heard them. Everyone started to not like The Rainbow Fish anymore so he goes to the wise Octopus for help.This book teaches the lesson that no matter or pretty or handsome you are, you are not greater then anyone else whether u think it or not. It also makes sure that the people that read the book will act the same way to others as they act to them.The age level for this book is 4-11. This book was a very good book and I would recommend this book for kids all over because it teaches them some simple lessons about life that everyone should know."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This is a wonderful story of giving. My daughter loves the beautiful pictures"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Pfister's colorful book, \\"The Rainbow Fish,\\" tells the story of a beautiful fish who has spectacular, shiny scales. The shiny scales make him, the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean. The other fish become very jealous of the Rainbow fish when he won't share his scales. Sad and alone the Rainbow fish seeks help from the octopus,. Rainbow fish realizes he needs to share his sparkling scales with his friends and not be selfish.I think this is a wonderful book about sharing and being unselfish. The main character in the story, the Rainbow Fish, learns that his own outward beauty is not as important as his inner beauty. He also learns that by being beautiful on the inside, and giving up the beauty on the outside that he finds true happiness.However, I have heard some people discuss the fact that this book does have some negative connotations. The story could convey that you have to buy friendship, and it is not good to stand out. I see the point in these arguments, but I do not think that is the moral that children will take from this book. I certainly did not gather that conclusion, let alone a five year old.I think the use of the glittery material for the scales is a very eye-catching idea to use both for adults and children. Children love to look at the sparkling scales throughout the pages of the book. The rest of the ocean and fish are done in soft watercolors of blues, purples and greens. The colors give a very calming, and gentle feel throughout the book. The colors also make the sparkly scales stand out even more. You can definitely tell the Rainbow Fish is the most beautiful fish in the ocean, by the illustrations.I personally love this book for its beautiful illustrations and the story itself. I think it sends a positive message and truly captivates the children with its eye catching and mesmerizing artistry.The illustrator's use of soft watercolors and soft shapes add to the plot and setting of the story. The colors and shapes exemplify the flow and the serenity of the ocean. Watercolors make a perfect texture, since the surrounding is water, and they give such a soft look to the pages. The holographic material used on the Rainbow Fish, truly let the reader see how beautiful and noticeable the fish really was. Any reader will be drawn to the beauty of the Rainbow Fish, due to the pretty, sparkling scales. This truly helps develop the character's physical self.The illustrations also reinforce the text throughout the book. For instance, when the Rainbow Fish is left alone by all the other fish, the illustrator gives the fish a sad look to him with use of line and color. The lines give the fish a sad expression and a sad floating state. Also, the colors become darker purple, and less blue. The purple colors on these pages are darker and drearier than the bright blue on the previous pages. All of the surrounding wash out of the picture, whereas they are more defined and colorful when the Rainbow Fish is happy and is surrounded with friends.Another good example of the illustrator helping to build up the characters in the story, is evident with the illustration of the octopus. The octopus is hidden in a dark colored cave, with little detail to his body and face. This artistic quality creates a mysterious and almost intimidating characteristic to the octopus.The overall artistic style of the illustrator helps to enhance the literally style of the author. Both, the illustrator and the author come together beautifully to portray a sensitive yet important message to the reader."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This picture book is obviously a set-up by the CIA and Ayn Rand cultist who have conspired to present a straw-fish to undermine the inevitable historical progress towards socialism.The oh-so-tragic rainbow fish, forced to give up its glistening scales to the colorless masses of guppytariat, is an unrealistic archetype used to muddle the waters. Little children who object to the loss of \\"specialness\\" are being primed to object to the estate-tax, unions, and the proletarian uprising.In the real world, it is the little guppy fish who toil to give the rainbow fish its brilliant scales ... which this picture book has so cleverly and deviouly subverted.

All the other fish wanted to be like Rainbow Fish, so they would invite him to play with them. Rainbow Fish was self-centered and always said no. Once a little blue fish asked if he could have a glittery scale, but Rainbow Fish said no. All the other fish grew angry at him and did not speak to him. Rainbow Fish was worried and went for advice from the Wise Octopus. The octopus told Rainbow Fish to be kind to others and not to be selfish. So Rainbow Fish went back home and gave the little blue fish a scale. The blue fish was so happy he couldn't wait to show off his glittery scale. Soon after, all the fish wanted to have glittery scales. Rainbow Fish gave everyone a scale and became friends again.I think this a great book for children because it teaches them a lesson. The lesson learned is to always share and you'll have many friends."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"My daughter has this book, but after reading it several times, I have found it to be somewhat problematic. The illustrations are vivid and beautiful, however the underlying story has some problems in content. The rainbow fish is the \\"most beautiful fish\\" and therefore he falls prey to vanity. Because he is full of himself, other fish choose not to associate with him. He goes and asks for advice, and is told to share his beautiful scales with those around him. When he does he makes friends.1. If your child is the one with a superiority complex, then I think this book is great for them. Children who view themselves as better, should understand that it is through humbling oneself that you gain the greatest rewards. However,2. If your child is one the other side of the issue, this book paints a poor picture of how to handle the situation. We should reach out to everyone, not just \\"nice\\" people. We teach through example, not by rejecting someone because they hurt or offended us. Likewise, we should never ask someone for something just because they had more that us. We should be happy with who we are: Most beautiful or not.3. I do like the fact that the \\"wise Octopus\\" told the fish to give up what he had. This mimics Christ and the rich man in the bible. Christ tells the man to give up what is most important to him. Thus the fish must do the same. But it is dis-heartening that only because the fish does so, does he make friends. This is off-base. Friends like you for you, even if you are a show off."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Wow.

He wasn't ostracized.The book is about sharing, showing others that we are ALL beautiful, and that it isn't good to think you are better and more deserving than the guy (or girl) next to you.

It's no different from getting Christmas presents for others and receiving them back. If everyone was helping each other out then we wouldn't have as many problems today.

I disagree with some of the other reviews. Rainbow Fish loses friends at first because he is vain, snobbish and rude because he thinks he is the most beautiful fish in the sea (based upon external shiny scales). When he gives away most of his scales, he learns that greater happiness comes from giving and from friendship than from having beautiful possessions (scales).I especially like the large version of the book which makes it easier to share it with groups of kids."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I was initially amazed to find that this story was considered controversial by some, particularly by conservatives, unfortunately including conservative Christians. You have to really twist the intended message of this story to make it about communism or giving away one's uniqueness to blend in, or something along those lines. The message is, I think, much more simple and at the same time more profound than that. It reminds me of a song I learned in church camp called \\"The Magic Penny\\", which said, \\"Love is something, if you give it away, you end up having more.\\" The Rainbow Fish's scales do not represent wealth; they represent greed, which is the love of money, which the Bible defines as the root of all evil. Giving the scales away to the other fish does not represent giving away what makes you unique; it represents learning the lesson that others are more important than things, especially things you did nothing to earn, but only received as a gift. And at the end of the story, the other fish don't like the Rainbow Fish because he gave them good gifts, but because he has become someone who is genuinely likable, because he has learned to be humble and to care about others. This is a wonderful lesson to teach people of any age, especially children. And it is essentially the message of Jesus, which is why I am shocked that so many Evangelical Christians despise this story. To me, that simply reveals that they have been misled into thinking that Christianity is more about defending a system of economics or a political system than it is about \\"doing justice, loving kindness, and walking humbly with your God\\", as Micah puts it."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book has always been of favorite of mine and my kids (16, 14, & 11).

The first time I read it to her, I closed it half way through and still shudder when I think of the message in this story - not to mention how many kids are getting this message. I have been told, time and time again, that this is a book about sharing, but I don't find that message at all. Instead, I see a uniquely beautiful fish who has a hard time making friends because he is different. So he starts giving away the very thing that makes him both unique and beautiful, his rainbow scales. Soon, everyone has his scales. Not only did he give away the essence of himself, but he created a world where, in order to get along, everyone is exaclty the same. Although the illustrations are beautiful, the subtle messages that we need to be the same in order to get along and that it is o.k. to change who you are to make friends are not messages I want my daughter to hear!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I am also surprised by the number of negative reviews. I just read this book and I only got a good feeling from it. The fish is disliked CLEARLY because she is being arrogant and mean, NOT because she is beautiful. The other fish don't want to have anything to do with him ONLY because she is mean. Yes, one fish asks to have one of the scales, but the fish only start alienating the Rainbow Fish when she answers, \\"You want one of my special scales? Who do you think you are? Get away from me!\\"The Rainbow Fish then thinks, \\"I am beautiful - why doesn't anyone like me?\\"As she gives away her scales, it helps her to become humble. It's not like children will start giving away limbs of their body to make friends. If you want to make an analogy, what if your little girl is being arrogant about how pretty her long hair is. People start to not like her because she is so haughty. So she cuts it off. TO HUMBLE HERSELF.

The book was about the transformation in the fishes attitude, by the time the book was finished a 6 year old would get the message that maybe beauty & friendship is deeper that outer appearance?gosh people are so annoying, making such a simple, beauitful message into something political."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Rainbow Fish is not very nice. But I also don't think highly of that little fish that thinks it is ok to ask him for a scale.The message seems to be that Rainbow Fish needs to give away what makes him special so that he can make friends. Buy your friends???Surely Rainbow Fish (and the other fish) could have learned a better lesson on friendship. This book really misses the mark.I will not read this book to my son. What a shame too because it is so pretty.(updated after reading some of the other reviews) I do get what the other reviewers are saying about the general lesson of sharing and vanity but when I read it the other message hits me so hard that I just can't get past it. I just don't like the story."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book sets horrible examples and lessons for children. The Rainbow fish is ostracized by the other bratty fishes, until it finally gives up parts of its scaly self to these mean fishes just to be able to get along. I didn't like it at all.Reading the positive reviews and their \\"carping\\" (pun intended) about those who have left the serious reviews that point out these glaring problem, I think this book must have been made some kind of showcase item for people who think that the collective is superior to individuals.I really think this book is bad for children's self esteem. It doesn't give a positive message such as we should respect people's differences. It says to a kid that you should merge with all the others. There is no good reason for the Rainbow fish to rip off parts of his body to give to those other fishes who are mean to him. I mean they were the maladjusted ones, not the Rainbow Fish. Leave the Rainbow Fish alone!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This well-known book is a winner for the toddler set. The Rainbow Fish has brightly colored scales, and some of them shine like silver. In a design coup, the book shows the fish decorated with tiny metallic paper scales. The \\"oooooo\\" factor is high. Not only is the rainbow fish an attention getter, but author/illustrator Pfister's ocean backgrounds show an imaginative color range.Fish's problem is whether beauty or friendship is more important. When the proud fish haughtily, angrily refuses a small blue fish's request for one of his scales, Rainbow gets a bad \\"rep,\\" and the other fish ignore him. Rainbow Fish advances one level of maturity when he realizes the consequences:\\"What good were the dazzling, shimmering scales with no one to admire them?\\" He reaches a somewhat more advanced level when a huge octopus, eyes gleaming in a purple-shadowed cave advises him to \\"'give a glittering scale to each of the other fish. You will no longer be the most beautiful fish in the sea, but you will discover how to be happy.'\\" And so it happened: \\"the more he gave away, the more delighted he became.\\"I agree that Rainbow Fish's motivation isn't very altruistic, and that he also could have pointed out the non-shimmery qualities of the other fish. But this is a book for small toddlers, not a platform for budding Rand followers. Slightly older kids could be led into a discussion of defending Fish's solution or proposing alternatives, and the visual highlights might inspire some painting or drawing. Pfister first published the award-winning book in Switzerland (\\"Der Regenbogenfisch\\"); the translation is by J. Alison James."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"My 2 year old pulled this book off of the shelf so I bought it without reading it first. I knew it was critically aclaimed. Big mistake. This book is the worst children's book I have ever read.It is not about sharing. It is about giving everything away that is yours, and then people will like you. Seems very communistic to me. My 4 year old also wanted me to read it to him. After I did, we had a big discussion about how you should not have to give all of your things away to have friends, and those are not the type of people you want to be your friend anyway. A sharing book should be about letting others use your toys, or other things. Not giving something very precious to you away. This book is absolutely aweful!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I agree that we don't need to flaunt the best things about ourselves, but I am upset that this book (and The Giving Tree) teaches children that they should give up the very things that make them special in order to have friends. If the other characters wouldn't be friends with Rainbow Fish simply because Rainbow Fish wouldn't give a piece of himself to them, then why should he want them as friends? What did they offer? Certainly not friendship! Talk about judging others! I like the story's attempt, but for a child, I think it backfires into a poor lesson!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"After receiving this book as a shower gift I read it and pitched it! It is a story about a fish that is beautiful (but vain) and lonely...so he buys some friends by giving away his beautiful, shining scales. Yes, there is the lesson about not thinking yourself so grand that you do not want to play with others, however that concept is quickly lost in the prose as the fish gives away all of his scales until he looks like the other fish. WHAT NEXT??? Are we going to have a book about a wise owl that acts stupid to gain friends? This book really reeks of assimilation at all costs, and that looking like others is the road to happiness!It is frightening to think that someone that creates television programming for children thought that this is a morality tale.Beware!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"When first I read this book, I was stunned: all the friends I have that own it love it and so I thought I had gotten the demonic version.So, I read it again, and nope, it was the one everyone was raving about.I was so stunned by the message that I immediately began checking the front page to see who/where produced this book.I was not surprised to see it was written by a Swiss author.The message made me recoil, it honestly did. It says: if you do not do what I want you to do, I will run whinning to everyone I can and convince them that I have been injured and you will be a social pariah-- different is to be fear and emotional bullying is okay.I will not flog this horse anymore, as Mr. M. Newman, one of the reviewers, said it best any way.This book is cruel and mean in message and should be kept away from any child that we hope to make into a good, productive citizen of this country."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"My husband hates this book, and I was undecided. But after hearing the points in some of the positive reviews, I now agree that adults are over-thinking this very simple message. If the Rainbow Fish were a person - he would be selfless Mother Theresa instead of haughty Paris Hilton ... and I would rather my girls be influenced by the teachings of the former. Would have given it a four, but I don't think the illustrations are that great."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"My daughter is only 4-months old and doesn't have much of an attention span but she does enjoy this book more for just chewing on. She looks at the pictures and will listen to me read it beginning to end. I was surprised, but it is a hit! I'll be glad when she is old enough to understand the story too because it does teach a good lesson and is very cute."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The story of the Rainbow Fish is charming and worth reading to your children.My issue is with the product description from Amazon.It stated this was a hard cover edition.When I received it, it was a board book.My purchase was for a five year old, who was a little insulted at being given a board book.Same great story either way, true, but a different reading experience."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This is a book about a fish who becomes a social outcast by refusing to give away his possessions who then redeems himself by giving away his possessions (the rainbow scales) until he has only one left, thus making everyone accept him.The message is so blatant and heavy handed that it could have been written by a one-dimensional villain from an Ayn Rand novel.Certainly a good book could be written about the isolation of thinking yourself better than everyone else, but that book could have been written without a political message of wealth redistribution."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This is an excellent book for young children to adolescents. I purchased the book erraneously, and was daunted at first by the size of it as I had intended to buy a normal-sized copy for home use, but I can certainly use it at the English language school where I work. The artwork is fabulous!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book starts out talking about a beautiful fish with shiny scales, who refuses to give his scales away, when asked to by a random smaller fish. Because of his refusal he becomes lonely as no one wants to be around him, until gives away his scales and has many friends due to his sharing and generosity.As a parent I understand the need to teach our children to share, and to be giving. However, The Rainbow Fish goes a bit beyond that, telling a story where you are not able to have friends unless you give them gifts. It reminds me of a very lonely child at school who gives people things so others will like him. On the up-side it does speak of the happiness that can be found in giving things to others (Why I gave it two stars) and the illustrations are very captivating - especially for toddlers and infants.Overall I would Not recommend this book to other parents, even with all the pretty pictures."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Calm down people. This book isn't anything that deserves this much discussion. It's an average quality children's book; in the story and in the illustrations. The illustrations are nothing more than a marketing gimmick to get the attention of children and parents as they pass by the shelves at the bookstore. You take away the sparkle and the illustrations become forgettable. The story is predictable and cliche', but it does appeal to children. It's a very simple story about sharing. It won't turn your child into a communist or a socialist, and it won't make them lose their individuality. The author isn't attempting to brainwash your children. He's a capitalist that figured out a way to sell books because he noticed that small children like sparkly things."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Am I the only one in the world who hates the Rainbow Fish's message, i.e., that one has to buy friends by giving them the things one cherishes most? Sure, the watercolor-like pictures with the shiny, glittery scales are pretty, but I don't want my kids absorbing the moral that friends will like you if you give them stuff, as opposed to them liking you for who you are. I'm all for encouraging young children to share and to think of others' feelings -- but this socialist fish is for the birds!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I didn't think the illustrations were that great. All the sea life presented has a bland sameness about it and the colors are limited to a cold blue palette.More important,I think the lesson presented in this book is shallow and one-sided. Yes, the Rainbow Fish is vain and selfish but the behavior of the other fish is never questioned and therefore assumed to be correct. Why, for instance, does the little fish deserve a shiny scale? When he doesn't receive one he immediately tells the other fish and they all shun the Rainbow Fish. Apparently, the only way for the Rainbow Fish to regain their friendship is to &quot;buy&quot; it with his beautiful scales.I would have much rather seen the Rainbow fish do something heroic and perhaps lose or dull his scales in the process. Then the other fish could seek his friendship based on the Rainbow Fish's heroic character."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"When I first read this book, my husband and I were both disappointed -- is it about a vain little fish who learns that he can buy friends? That potential fishy friends will keep coming back for more snottiness as long as you have something they want -- or as long as you're beautiful? Quite frankly, I think the Rainbow Fish was the ugliest fish in the sea . . .Whatever happened to themes like &quot;never judge a book by its cover&quot; and friendship will come when kindness comes from within, when you are accepting of another's inadequacies as well as their excellence, or when you are honest and build trust by caring and sharing?"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I mean can you really get better than Rainbow Fish. It has been used in classrooms for years and will continue to be used. I was shocked to find that it even engaged 3 year olds and had them talking about how it is nice to share. That's impressive. But The Rainbow Fish is truly a classic and a staple in any Children's Literature collection."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"what a great story of learning to share and making friends, my children love the foil detail on each page and ask to hear it nearly every day. terrific book, should be a part of every collection"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Rainbow Fish has been widely criticized for having a bad message. Well, I don't think the librarian an my school knew this because she read it frequently. I remember this book fondly and even have a framed pic of Rainbow Fish on my wall. But now that I reread it, I totally agree. This book shouldn't be read to young, impressionable children(K-2). Rainbow Fish gave all but one of his shiny scales to the other fish. Think about it parents. What if your child did that with his/her lunch money? Or lunch, for that matter?I really like the illustrations and can see why this book was popular, I just wish it had lived up to my memories. Maybe a parent could turn the books message around by saying that Rainbow Fish acted without much thought.R"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This is a terrible book. Sharing is meant to be the moral behind this story. But the subtext is really: one is not entitled to anything that makes one special but should instead give it away for the good of the whole. The beautiful things that truly make us unique can sometimes be taught to others. But, cannot be surrendered away like so many shiny scales."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"My daughters love this book, primarily for the illustrations. This book often gets mixed reviews from adults, some who find the message troubling. However, to those who might see a Socialist bent, or other negative moral, as a Libertarian I offer this: By discussing the various aspects of the story with your child, you can make the moral lesson to your liking. The rainbow fish is unhappy and lonely because he has something that other fish covet, however he is unwilling to share. Certainly the rainbow fish has no obligation to share his scales and nobody (not government nor society) in the book coerces him into doing so. Indeed the rainbow fish discovers how good it can make one feel to voluntarily give to others. He doesn't just receive friends in exchange for goods as some have shallowly accused, but looked at in another light the rainbow fish donates not only for others' material wants but because it MAKES HIM FEEL GOOD INSIDE. It is also in the community's interest. An important lesson for children is that voluntary giving is a good thing and our society, if it is to remain free, depends on it. I applaud the lesson in this book of free giving over coerced taxation or socialism. And, so others might not think I'm off my rocker in over-politicizing this book..I must point out that the characters are fabulous, the paintings gorgeous and both my young daughters find it irresistable. My youngest, at 2 and 1/2 is a HUGE rainbow fish fan, and that makes me a fan too."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The Rainbow fish is a delightful children's book with alluring illistrations. The book has good moral values that children can learn from. What the reader must remember when reading this book, is that it is a children's book. Children are not going to interpret from this story that you must buy your friends. Children see a beautiful fish that gives away his most prized posetions to make others happy, and in return finds happiness himself. The message of the book can be taken out of context, but the children see the message the author is intending to teach. The message of this book is that it is better to give than recive, which is a very large issue with children. This book is beautifully written, and told in such a way that children want to read it again and again."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Wow, maybe I haven't quite gotten the hang of it yet, but is this how adults are supposed to think? Finding ulterior and negative hidden messages in children's books? You can imagine my surprise seeing such controversy over a book I loved as a child!My parents and grandparents used to read this book to my siblings and I, and I promise you not once with my child's mind did I EVER see socialism, self mutilation, or any of this other nonsense some seem so worked up about. What I saw was a story about vanity, selfishness, and sharing. Couple that with beautiful, rainbow-sparkly scales I loved to touch on every page and it was an instant classic in our household.There is a valuable lesson in this book, one a child can understand, and definitely not misinterpret into negative adult ideologies. This is not a book about being disliked because you are beautiful, this is a book about humility and sharing: something I think a lot of people need to learn. Not to sound overly cliche, but \\"it's what's inside of you that makes you beautiful.\\" That is the message I was taught by rainbow fish.I will definitely read this book to my own children, and I recommend it to any parent who doesn't see ulterior motives in every children's book. Most of the time there just isn't any dark purpose, except what you put in for your child to learn."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I grew up with this book as a child. It wasn't till I was reading some of these awful reviews that I realized it was a love or hate relationship with parents. I have not read this book recently, but the child in me remembers a story about a mean and selfish fish who is hated because of his attitude. The moral of the story is that looks aren't super important, but being nice is. It is not teaching our children to conform to society, but to be a better person to be a benefit to society. Some of these parents just need to cool it with the whole Socialism aspect and look at this book from a child's point of view."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I have used The Rainbow Fish in my junior high math classroom this year. While I realize that some people feel as though Rainbow Fish feels he must share his beautiful scales to be liked, he also experiences how great it feels when you share your \\"gifts\\" with others. As I explained to my students - we ALL have gifts - and we have hundreds of \\"choices\\" each day in which to use and share our gifts."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"At first glance I thought this would be a great book about sharing and mutual respect. Boy was I wrong! A little blue fish demands one of the rainbow fish's shiny scales and when he refuses, all of the fish shun him. It is only after he gives away all but one of his unique scales that the other fish befriend him. I think that's a horrible message! After reading this to my child we talked about the outcome and I told him that the blue fish was very mean and that you should love and care for someone just the way they are, and that envy, for shiny scales or otherwise, is destructive. After that lesson we threw the book away. It's a horrible story for children disguised in a very attractive package. Stay away!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Loved this book as a kid and I got it for my own.

The pictures are very beautiful."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Im super happy with my purchase my book was on time and there wasnt any pages or scratches on the cover."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"It's interesting and has a clear lesson, my daughter gets it...and maybe eventually she'll be able to apply the moral."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"My young daughter was immediately draw to the beautiful illustrations in this book when she saw it at the bookstore and would not put it down. It was amazing to watch her become so immersed into her imaginative world, turning the pages making up stories about the fish and their undersea world. That's the reason I bought the book, and honestly, didn't even read it prior to leaving the store.We've read it about a dozen times since then and it is easily her favorite book of the many we have at home. I think it's fostered a love for reading and creativity within her and for that alone I'm thankful. My only issue has been that it seems a little long for the age it's designed for, and at times I've had to be more brief to hold her attention.As for the debate about the message contained within the book, I had not considered that it promoted socialist ideals until reading these reviews. Now that I've reread the book I can see how it could construed that way.When my daughter and I read this story together I told her that it was possible to be beautiful on the outside, but very ugly on the inside- and that being kind to others made you beautiful. We will keep this book and still read it, but I'll be sure to clarify that being kind doesn't mean she can't be special, or that she has to give everything she has away to others.I'd still recommend this book to others and I'd tell other parents to read it themselves, and find a meaning within it that they want to pass along to their children. A child's morals and what they grow up believing depends upon a lot more than a storybook- it depends on what you teach them."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"A stunningly beautiful book to teach a young child the joy of reading and the importance of sharing, all in a good format for chubby little fingers."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I just ordered this book for my neice who is expecting a baby soon. For the shower we were asked to bring a favorite book and I picked The Rainbow Fish. I've always loved this book which I first heard while volunteering at our church's daycare. I purchased the book and shared it with my grandchildren. I feel it teaches a lovely life lesson.While ordering I saw that it wasn't getting rave reviews. So I read them. Socialism? Wow? If we share with other people, is that socialism? If our children share their things with other children, is that socialism.

The poetic stanzas are perfect for little children, helping them with language development. The illustrations are bright and beautiful. Most importantly, the story theme is positive and important. YES, it is a book about sharing. I too, think this book has been over analyzed and accused of the messages that I do not see being told. The fish was arrogant and had an attitude, but he learns two lessons in the end. He learns to share, and he learns that friends are more valuable than how he looks or what he owns! The message was clear, anything else is contrived and just plain not the intensions of this delightful tale (or is it tail?)."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I am a college student and I just finished working on a project on the Rainbow Fish by Pfister, and his other Rainbow Fish books. I was able to read the book to a couple of children that are in my family, and that are struggling with some issues of sharing. One two year old expressed how happy she was that Rainbow Fish could share his scales with his friends. Isn't that the true meaning here? We want children to share and be happy about what they have accomplished, and that is what happens in this book. Those who think this book shows that all the fish are alike after they all share a silver scale are really reading to much into this book for preschool kids, and missing th message it shares. I look forward to reading more Rainbow Fish books, and also sharing them with more children. The wonderful colors and drawings that represent the fish are wonderful. I read Rainbow Fish from the &quot;Big Book&quot; series and it allowed the children to see the pictures and colors in a much bigger perspective. This is a wonderful book to share with others."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"One thing that's not mentioned in all the 28 pages of reviews I've read about this book is the unfortunate reality that being nice and generous to other people will not automatically make them your friends.Any way you interpret the analogy - whether the fish scales represent \\"giving of yourself\\" or giving money, belongings, gifts, kindness, time, or talent - people will not flock around you eager to be friends because you've given them something. It can be disillusioning and disappointing when one grows up and finds this out.For many years I've been a philanthropist, and volunteered my time and caring and finances to help others. I've tried to be nice to everyone - from neighbors to homeless strangers to kids in juvenile hall to coworkers. What I've observed is that it's a rare day indeed that a person gets true friendship in return for sacrificially giving away one's scales. Perhaps a quarter of the time people are grateful and appreciative for what you did (but not interested in starting a friendship). About a quarter of the time your generosity is accepted but you don't get even a personal thank-you in return. (If you're giving to a large organization, you'll get a form letter, and their next request for your donations will have more zeros after the numbers.) About a quarter of the time the person you've given to becomes a sponge who then tries to milk you dry - the only time you ever hear from them is when they want more money from you. They aren't satisfied with getting just one scale, and they get really angry if you ever stop handing over scales to them when they want them. Like the fish in this book, they feel entitled to get whatever you have - it seems right to them that they go through life getting something for nothing. And about a quarter of the time your generosity is coldly or vehemently rejected, or it's taken but you're actively hated for it. I don't know if this is because the receiver is jealous that you have something to give, or they feel you must be looking down on them (even if you aren't). Perhaps they're carrying a chip on their shoulder and are quick to take offense at someone's \\"charity\\". Maybe they're embarrassed and humiliated that they needed someone's help (even if they asked for the help), and they take out their anger by lashing out at the hand that's feeding them. Maybe they've become cynical and suspicious and are sure that someone being nice to them must have ulterior motives or plans to use or manipulate them. I don't know what their personal problems are. But I do know I've been violently hated by people I knocked myself out trying to be nice to.People do hate others for being different, and they hate you if you have anything they don't - whether that's money, or a clean upright life, or a happy family, or better grades than they have. Trying to befriend people who are excluding you or talking badly about you behind your back is not going to make them your friends, except in the world of fantasy and children's literature. My response to reading this book was to cry - because it's so sad that we go around preaching to our kids, \\"If you're just nice to other people and you share with them and don't act rude or stuck up, they'll all like you and want to be your friends,\\" when it's simply not true. (Hey, even Jesus - the ideal picture of goodness and generosity, didn't have everyone wanting to be his friend.)Other reviewers of this book have said, \\"I think this a great book for children because it teaches them a lesson. The lesson learned is to always share and you'll have many friends.\\"Or, \\"Ultimately, though, children who read this story will interpret on a much simpler level: The Rainbow Fish is mean and greedy, so the other fish stop playing with him. When the fish acts nice and generous, everyone plays with him again.\\"What do you tell a child who is nice and generous and everyone calls him a \\"goodie two shoes\\" and doesn't want to play with him? True, no one wants to play with a mean, stuck up, selfish jerk, but no one wants to play with a saint either. The whole premise and message of the book - sharing with others will make them your friends - is wishful thinking. The book's happy ending only works if you read it as a story about conforming to your peer group. Blending in and looking and acting exactly like everyone else might in fact get you accepted into the \\"in group\\". Maybe generosity is the path to happiness and social acceptance in preschool, but that isn't going to be true by middle school. Hopefully impressionable kids will have forgotten everything about the book but the pretty fish pictures by then."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This book has pretty illustrations.

Using this as a teaching tool for special needs children, I feel bizarre teaching \\"The fish demanded that Rainbow hand over his scales. He said no, so nobody like him. So, Rainbow Fish gave each fish a scale that he ripped from his lil fishy body, and because of this they agreed to be his friends instead of ignoring him. He was sooo happy! The end.\\"While the emphasis is probably supposed to be about sharing and being unselfish, it comes across as \\"If you want people to like you, you have to give them stuff!\\" or \\"If someone is really your friend, he should give YOU stuff.\\" In a funny way, in trying to teach that materialism is bad, it sort of sends the opposite message. Sure, Rainbow Fish learns about being giving - but on the other side, the other fish in the ocean don't want to be his friend until he gives them a worthwhile gift.On the other hand, this is a beautiful book, and has a story line that is just the perfect level for children at the \\"early narrative\\" language level. Not a lot of sub-context; less than 10 events overall; a very quick and clear: introduction - problem - resolution format. Not to mention, the follow-up craft possibilities are endless.If a child is advanced enough to read the text on her own, well, she's probably able to understand a conversation regarding what the book means. For other children, I change the wording slightly to talk about Rainbow Fish refusing to \\"share\\" when the other fish want a turn."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The rainbow fish finds friendship because he is willing to share his rainbow colours with the other fish. The story thus implies that friendship is bought with gifts. This is a misconception that young children can easily gain; most infant teachers will have met the phenomonen of the child who brings bags of sweets to school in an attempt to win friendship or who gives away toys which may indeed be precious in order to gain or maintain friends. Do we really wish to encourage this attitude with a book which reinforces this outlook ? Howeve,this book could be used by a sensitive teacher to challenge the outlook of the author and promote a discussion on the subject."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"If you are anti-individual, don't believe in personal property, and yearn to raise an aspiring communist or socialist, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I am an Elementry Education student and I love this book.

It teaches kids about fish and that theres something special about everyone!-Laura R."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This is such a wonderful book! Of course for a child usually the pictures are the first to impress. THE RAINBOW FISH will far exceed any child's expectations! (Who doesn't love rainbow-colors with foil that sparkles even in dim light!) Also the watercolor illustrations are delightful. The complete package of the pictures PLUS the story is what makes this book exceptional. The story is simple yet holds much wisdom.THE RAINBOW FISH is the most beautiful fish in the sea. All the other fish are amazed at his outward beauty, however; judging from the way he responded to a simple request to share, THE RAINBOW FISH shows his &quot;true colors&quot; (vanity and selfishness.) Of course the news spreads throughout the sea and soon no one will have anything to do with THE RAINBOW FISH. Sad and lonely, he goes for advice from the Wise Octopus. She basically says &quot;SHARING WITH OTHERS BRINGS TRUE HAPPINESS.&quot;THE RAINBOW FISH reluctantly takes her advice; and discovers she was right. The more he shares the happier he becomes. He realizes that life is not about &quot;getting&quot; (being selfish) but &quot;giving&quot; (being generous.) And giving of yourself is the greatest gift of all! (This is not about money.) Sharing is a valuable lesson for children to learn and the sooner the better.I highly recommend this book! Five stars doesn't do it justice... it gets that from the illustrations alone. If you don't already own it; get it! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This story teaches children how to be bullies. It is not about sharing. The poor fish who was blessed with beautiful fins is ostracized by all the other little fish because he would not give them one of his fins. They called is sharing. They didn't want to share, they wanted his fins all for themselves, and when he wouldn't give them away, all the other fish refused to swim, play or interact with him. He was so lonely and sad that he relented and gave all but one of his fins away. If this isn't social bullying, I am not sure what is. The author and publisher should be ashamed for promoting such behavior to preshoolers. I received the book as a gift, read it and promptly threw it in the trash. And I am a book lover through and through, but this was trash. I wish I could rate it with a negative star."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"A great story with a great moral. It is in giving that we receive, not by keeping what we have only for ourselves. The book also emphasizes that happiness comes from within, not from outward appearance. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Wow, a lot of people seem to have a lot of issues with this book. Sure, there's sort of communist theme along with a sort-of conformist ending, but what four year old is going to turn to you and say, 'Mom, I think this book indicates that the Rainbow Fish had to give up the only thing that made him special through coercion, rather than a willingness to conform to the community around him.'I love this book--I hadn't heard of it until a few years ago when it was read in a pre-school class I was helping to teach. The three year olds there loved it, and at that age, when many of them were just beginning to have younger brothers and sisters, the message of sharing what you've been lucky enough to have all to yourself was an important one. I think it's a mistake to view the Rainbow Fish's shiny scales as his only special feature; just because he gives them up doesn't mean he gives up his uniqueness. On the contrary, now he'll be remembered for his generosity. Or are those fish so materialistic that they can only recognize another fish by how shiny they are? Perhaps the Rainbow Fish feels \\"forced\\" to give up his beautiful scales, but he certainly could have kept them and remained alone. Then it could have been a book about celebrating being alone. But that's a different book.Yes, the story is a bit communistic. But it also tells its readers an important message about both celebrating what you have, and letting others celebrate with you. It echoes that song that I learned when I was little--\\"love is something if you give it away, you end up having more.\\" Maybe the Rainbow Fish loses much of his outside brilliance, but he gains a greater inside brilliance."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"Despite some of the negative reviews you may have read concerning this wonderful children's book, it is everything a children's book should be. The Rainbow Fish starts out as everything we don't want to be--vain, selfish, arrogant, rude, etc.; a little fish asks him for one of his many shining scales, and he refuses. None of the other fish want anything to do with such a vain, selfish, arrogant, rude fish. Personally, I don't blame them. Rainbow Fish is just like all those little kids who refuse to share their toys and then grow up and refuse to share their money no matter how much they have. In fact, one can say Rainbow Fish represents the worst qualities of capitalism. Anyway, Rainbow Fish asks the Wise Octopus for advice; she tells him to share his scales, which he should have done all along. So he does. It makes him feel good to give scales to other fish because they are so happy to each get a scale. So everyone wins.Many who are offended by the book seem to feel that it is Communistic in its outlook on the grounds that the message is, \\"Give away everything that makes you special.\\" But it is not the scales that make him special, and I believe this is another point the author was trying to make. What makes a person special is not the outside, but the inside; the same is true for the Rainbow Fish. What makes him special is not the scales, but the fact that he was (eventually) willing to share them. Just as many don't see this about Rainbow Fish, many don't see this about other people. We assume things about people based on what color their skin is, what kind of reproductive organs they have, and how attractive we find them, when none of these things have anything to do with who they are as human beings. That people don't see this in Rainbow Fish shows how blinded we are to the concept of inner beauty.In short, I think this is a great children's book, and many adults would do well to learn the lessons presented."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I have never seen more negative reviews in my life than I have seen written for childrens' books.This book IS NOT about a fish that is forced to give up his beautiful scales. It's about a fish that CHOOSES to. This book isn't meant to teach your children that they have to \\"give up their specialness\\". Please...it is simply to show how a little fish did a big thing and shared with others. He's a fish...not a girl who cut off her hair to give to Suzie Q across the street. Now, THAT would be strange. But you people read into everything...YOU'RE really the warped ones. Not the authors.And the illustrations are GORGEOUS!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I must admit that I wondered about the message The Rainbow Fish was sending. After all, the fish does give all but one of his scales away, and unlike in some classics like The Happy Prince, the recipients of his generosity weren't saved from an unhappy fate by his gift - they merely received something they'd admired. I kind of wondered if this encouraged over-generosity and might lead a sensitive and giving child to be taken advantage of.However, I do think the overriding message of The Rainbow Fish is that giving is good - a message that we don't hear often enough in society today. I also think that the characterization of the fish before he decided to give his scales away - as a prideful, rude, unfriendly fish who was more concerned about his appearance than about someone else's feelings - makes it easier for a child to understand why the fish's actions at the beginning of the book were wrong. In large part, it's not simply the fact that the fish doesn't want to part with his scales but the fact that he rejects the smaller fish's request so brusquely that causes all the other fish to shun him. In that sense, giving away his scales is almost an atonement for his earlier actions.Ultimately, though, children who read this story will interpret on a much simpler level: The Rainbow Fish is mean and greedy, so the other fish stop playing with him. When the fish acts nice and generous, everyone plays with him again. The moral of the story: Be nice and generous. I don't think anyone can fault that message."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"The Rainbow Fish is truly a book that brings out the best in us all. It teaches us to treat others kindly and love them to receive love in return. The colors are vibrant and the pictures themselves are appealing to children from the youngest ages. I recommend this book as a delightful addition to any reader's private collection."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"These reveiws are ridiclous. My 2 year old sister loves this book! She loves the shiny scales and all the colors. She likes to point out the different sea creatures in the pictures and she loves that octupus! I think people are reading way to much into this book, I'm 17 now and I had this read to me when I was younger, if its lasted even more than 4 years, I'm sure its not that bad. Rainbow fish is a jerk, he thinks he's special because he's more beautiful than the other fish. The other fish all admire him, so when the little blue fish asks him for a scale he refuses. The little blue fish tells all the other fish what happened, and they no longer like him. Although he was beautiful, his personality sucked. Isn't that kind of showing children that beauty isn't everything? Then, the Rainbow Fish, lonley and sad, asks the wise octupus what he should do, and the octopus tells him to share his special scales. I don't think that he's telling him to \\"buy\\" his friends as others put it. or \\"mutilate\\" his body. I think that the octupus is telling the rainbow fish to share, and show the other fish that he can be nice. I think the moral of the story isn't that beauty is everything.\\" The Rainbow Fish\\" is a book for toddlers, not for elementary school kids. There is even a TV show based on the books, which is for toddlers and preschoolers. I think that we have to rememeber, that even though toddlers and children can wrongly interpret things, they don't thing along the same lines as adults. People need to get over their outrageus opinions and stop robbing their children of a wonderful and simple reading experience. This one book is not going to alter a childs mind, its just meant to be fun."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"A beautiful book that illustrates how the beautiful rainbow fish, knew how beautiful he was from his sparkling rainbow scales and he learns to share his beauty with others. He makes friends by giving some of the other fish some of his rainbow scales. He is no longer the only fish with beautiful rainbow scales, but he now has many friends. Pretty pictures & drawings."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"My kids, 6 and 2 1/2, have loved this story from day one. It's illustrations are very engaging, which helps keep them interested while learning a very valuable lesson. I emphasize the fact that rainbow fish has been given a very special gift, and only in giving of himself and sharing that gift with others is his uniqueness truly appreciated.The board book version has been condensed too much for those who want to get any value out of the story. I found it very weak. If your infant wants to look at the pictures and play with the book, the board book is fine, but I much prefer the original text in the hardcover version."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I liked the part when he gives his colours to the other fish."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"This stroy is about a fish who had glittery scales. All the other fish wanted to be like him so they would invite him to play with them. Rainbow fish was self centered and always said no. Once a little blue fish said if he could have a scale and Rainbow fish said no! All the other fish grew angry with them and didn't spoke to him. Rainbow fish was worried and went to ask advice to the Wise Octopus. The octopus said to be kind to others and not to be selfish. So he went back kome and gave the little blue fish a scale. The blue fish was so happy he couldn't wait to show of his glittery blue scale. Soon after all the fish wanted to have glittery scales. Rainbow fish gave everyone a scale and they all lived happly ever after as friends.I think this is a great book for children because it teaches them a lesson. The lesson is to be sharing and you will have many friends. Just like rainbow fish did."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"I'm not sure that the message of this book is completely clear (is it about sharing or conformity?), but nobody can honestly say that Pfister's paintings aren't truly gorgeous."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"At first, I found this book thoroughly enjoyable. My son will learn to share and delight in the fascinating foil scales of the fish. Then, I took a moment and contemplated the true meaning.
