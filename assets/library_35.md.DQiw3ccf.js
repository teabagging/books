He wanted to outline the future through examining history of the economics in Russia. His examination of the evolutionary processes and the functioning of Russia's economy in the past should best serves understanding the present and outlining the future guidelines. As Aristotle has said in the ancient Greece, \\"if you would understand anything, observe its beginning and its development.\\" The principal idea of Sergi's book on Communist Economics in Russia is thus observing the past and building the future. However, as the Irish writer Oscar Wilde wrote, \\"any fool can make history, but it takes a genius to write it.\\" And, Sergi wrote it, he wrote a history rich of lessons, and he did so in a fascinating way.This book is constructed in such a way that presents a deep and thorough narrative of the history of Russian economics. His story is exceptionally striking, perhaps the most comprehensive and in-depth academic endeavor on the Russian economics we ever had in our hands. His book starts with a chapter on \\"Ideology and Symbols in Russia\\" and ends with \\"The Evolving Russia: From the 1990s to Putin.\\" Other periods examined in this book include: The Tsarist Russia and Lenin, De-Stalinization and Economic Reforms, \\"Gorbachev, the Man with Iron Teeth\\", and Russian and Western Actions.Once he identifies certain symbols, political and economic, which have followed the historical configurations of the Russian economics and politics, Sergi analysis the logic of various Russian leaders in handling the economy. He addresses the role of communist power and the way it was used by various leaders in the course of Russia's history, and the reactions of Presidents Yeltsin and Putin after the collapse of communist system. He further highlights a number of causes and problems the post-communist Russia is facing, such as the rise of corruption, of the so-called oligarchs. The author also lays down a set of recommendations and proposals for reforms. Those with an interest on Russia should definitely have this book in their personal libraries."},{"Title":"Mafia Fix: Destroyer #4","review":"I had read the book, as well as almost all the Destroyer series and have almost all the books from the start to the 100's.

Schoenbaum doesn't discuss the plays, but instead the man who wrote them--or, more specifically, the differing ways that his life has been interpreted. That's right, it's a biography of Shakespeare's biographers, leading us step by step through several centuries of interpreters of the Bard, and the various wacky ways they have interpreted his life. It might not sound compelling, but boy it is. The early portions of the book are good enough, but it really takes off when the author starts to discuss the &quot;Baconian&quot; heretics--authors who have argued that Francis Bacon (or some other aristocratic, and therefore supposedly more intelligent, fop) actually wrote the world's greatest plays. He wonderfully illustrates the bizarreness of the men and women who originated this fanciful claim, and explains how it has unfortunately caught on in the popular imagination. (One of the first &quot;Baconians,&quot; the not-coincidentally named Delia Bacon, is a tragically grotesque character worthy of Shakespeare himself.) This is a hefty book that you won't finish in a single sitting, but I still highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Shakespeares Lives","review":"This book is the most thorough book on the life of the Bard"},{"Title":"My Mom's the Best Mom","review":"At last, a book about mothers that sees both the lighter side and the fuzzy warm side.

In case you don't know Kylix is Delphi for Linux (Pascal) but I've heard they are adding C++ as a syntax in the next release.The layout of the book was new to me in part because it's the first tech book from Wordware that I have read. It seems to flow correctly and I didn't notice any major editing issues. All the examples I tried worked and where laid out in a manner that was easy to understand.Of special interest to me was the chapter on porting code back and forth between Windows and Linux. But one thing that did surprise me was the coverage on specific Linux development like IPC's, Semaphores &amp; Debugging Shared Object Libraries.It's also kind of handy having the Kylix Open edition on the included CD, saved me from a large download.The only major negative from the book is that the tone of the writing does change from chapter to chapter, due to obvious tag team writing by the different books authors."},{"Title":"Exploring the Highest Sierra","review":"&quot;As a geologist who has worked extensively on the Sierra Nevada, I can say that Moore's book stunned me with its masterful treatment of much that I knew about this mountain range, but so much more that I didn't know. It has no competition and will be a bible to the specialist and visitor to the region alike. I am amazed at how superlatively Moore has organized so much material and put it together in a wonderfully readable fashion. No one who starts this book will be able to put it down. I finished it at 3 a.m. one morning!&quot; --Garniss Curtis, Professor Emeritus, University of California, Berkeley and Director Emeritus, Berkeley Geochronology Center&quot;No other author has captured the full panorama of the Sierra Nevada's geologic history and human endeavor in exploration--Moore has produced a dazzling, monumental work. Captivating writing and superb illustrations carry the reader into the highest Sierra along the paths of the pioneers, such as George Goddard, Josiah Whitney, Clarence King, and John Muir. Their struggles in exploration, mapping, and technology provided the all-important basis for geologic investigations that continue to the present. This book is a Sierran tour de force that includes wonderful maps and field guides. It deserves the highest praise.&quot; --Richard S. Fiske, Geologist and Former Director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History&quot;A wonderful, engrossing account not only of the geology, but also of the early exploration and topographic mapping of the range. Jim's half a century of geologic fieldwork in the Sierra shines through in this masterful treatment of the subject, presented in an engaging, non-technical style. The book should be of broad interest not only to geologists but to anyone interested in the Sierra Nevada. For the non-specialist, the detailed glossary should be very helpful. Visitors to Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks will be particularly interested in the detailed road and trail logs in the appendix, which give a marvelous description of the scenery, history, and geology along the major roads and trails. Most highly recommended.&quot; &gt; --Dallas L. Peck, Geologist Emeritus and Former Director of the U.S.Geological Survey"},{"Title":"Exploring the Highest Sierra","review":"Moore's book is the result of a lifetime spent studying and mapping the geologic structures of the Sierra. It is an incredible achievement and an important contribution to a detailed understanding of the geology of the Sierra for the amateur naturalist. As literature and science, it's a worthy successor to Matthes's Geologic History of the Yosemite Valley (USGS Prof. Paper #160). He includes terrific chapters on the work of the first scientists to study the range and then describes current knowledge about the creation of the Sierra: from the collision of tectonic plates to the retreat of the last glaciers.As an added bonus, Moore includes an appendix with detailed geologic comments for stopping points along several roads and trails in the Sequoia-Kings area: Highway 180 from Clovis to Cedar Grove; Highway 198 from Visalia and over the Generals Highway; the Mineral King road; the High Sierra Trail from Lodgepole to it's intersection with the John Muir Trail near Mt. Whitney; and, the John Muir Trail from Mt. Whitney to where it leaves Kings Canyon in the Evolution Valley region, 100 miles north.Although Moore concentrates his narrative mostly to the area of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (where, as luck would have it, I work as a ranger), anyone interested in the geology of the Sierra would find this book useful for its explanation of the major granitic and metamorphic structures we see throughout the range. It's large format makes it unlikely you'd want to slip it into your backpack as a field guide. It's also probably of interest only to the serious amateur, though I think it's photos and organization make it accessible to a beginner who might just want to skim some of the detailed sections."},{"Title":"Exploring the Highest Sierra","review":"Moore has worked a wonder--this is a captivating read designed for the layman but also filled with surprises for geologists, historians and naturalists. It is an indispensable, complete guide combining a history of adventures in Sierran exploration with tutorials on geology and natural history. We are led by the hand along carefully marked maps and trail guides to vantage points from which geologic features can by easily examined in the field; that allows a reconstruction of the forces and events that produced the majestic landscape. Clearly, simply, and arrestingly written, and frequently puncuated by anecdotes of Indian tribes, early settlers, pioneers and scientists, the book is studded with photographs, diagrams,and maps--I could hardly put it down. It will become the premier guide to the high Sierra."},{"Title":"Exploring the Highest Sierra","review":"James Moore has compiled a fantastic account of the earliest history, exploration, mapping, mining, politics and geology of the Seqouia - Kings Canyon National Parks area. This book, more so than any other that I have read on the Sierra, provides insights into the people, the origin of geographic names and the forces and interests that drove the people into the high Sierra region. A fascinating look at the barometric and surveying tools that were lugged to the top of the highest peaks is given and a historical account of the ever increasing accuracy of the maps and just how close the original estimates were. True to his profession, Moore then goes into an in-depth discussion of the current understanding of the geologic history of the region. This discussion will be a great interest to those with a casual to serious interest in geology and will provide a greater awareness for your next trip into the area. It held me, a retired geologist, captive and will remain on my shelf as one of my most treasured references."},{"Title":"Exploring the Highest Sierra","review":"The author of Exploring the Highest Sierra first backpacked across Sequoia National Park, via Mt. Whitney, in 1947. He went on to earn a PhD in geology with his research based on the geologic structure of the highest Sierra - the crest from Mt. Langley on the south through the Palisades region to the north that includes all of the Sierra's 14,000' peaks and a sea of other high mountains, lakes and meadows - and then had a long, successful career as a research geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He clearly loves and is highly expert about this mountain range, the highest in the 48 coterminous United States, and the surrounding Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park.My personal experience in this region consists of three backpacking trips - including peak bagging and off trail travel - that totaled perhaps three weeks within the so-called Highest Sierra. I looked forward to reading this 427-page book, which has very wide margins and lots of blank space, in hopes of not just learning more about it but to get ideas and inspirations for additional \\"explorations\\" of the area on my own. Unfortunately the book turned out to be less than I hoped for.Nearly a third of the pages are devoted to chapters about the original Euro-American exploration and mapping of the region, especially the 1860s-90s work of the California Geological Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey and its predecessors. Apart from the detailed coverage of progressively more accurate mapping efforts over the years, most of the characters - Whitney, King, Hoffman, Muir, etc. - are well know to anyone who is generally familiar with the 19th Century exploration of the Sierra (all of them explored and mapped the Yosemite region and elsewhere in the Sierra). These chapters have a lot of interesting photographs of the explorers, their equipment and so forth that I haven't seen elsewhere.The remaining chapters are mostly hard core geology. And much of it is very technical to the lay reader. There are a lot of aerial photographs originally taken to document the region for mapping or geologic research, detailed photographs of rock strata and structures and numerous textbook-type graphs and charts of geologic phenomenon. A typical exhibit (6.21 in the 54-page chapter titled Granitic Rocks) consists of a set of eight graphs - admittedly incomprehensible to me - that plot the occurrence of silica (SiO2) against eight different chemicals found in hundreds of rock samples throughout the region's mountains. There are dozens of similar charts, graphs and scattergrams. I have to rate a lot of this information as either inaccessible or simply technical overkill for the non-geologist. It's far more detailed than most non-geologist visitors to the region will ever want to know.This author's idea of an \\"exploration\\" of the highest Sierra is almost exclusively geologists and geology. There is virtually nothing about plants, animals, lakes, weather, wildfire, etc., etc. And nary a description of a mountaintop sunrise, a flowery meadow or any of the other charms that still make \\"exploring\\" this region so attractive to hikers, riders, climbers and skiers today.Recommended to anyone seeking an overview of 19th Century geologic study and mapping along with a textbook on the geologic phenomenon - especially rock structure and chemistry - of the highest portion of the south-central Sierra Nevada mountains of California. Not recommended for those who want a generalized natural history overview of the region or want ideas and inspiration for planning their own trips into the high country of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park. I note that most of the other reviewers of this book who rate it higher than I do seem to be professional geologists. And although Amazon does not seem to be stocking this, it can be found at the Yosemite Association's online bookstore."},{"Title":"Exploring the Highest Sierra","review":"I'm a graduate student in geophysics. Some may argue that a geophysicist has no license to criticise a geologist or vice versa, but here goes nothing. :)Moore begins with an interesting anecdotal account of the early mapping and exploration of the high Sierra. I found this interesting, but then again, I had not read much of this history previously. There are certainly other historical texts out there, so the question to ask yourself is: are there better ones? I don't know the answer.Before I knew it, the book had morphed into what I took for a geology textbook. A bit too esoteric to be considered general-interest, but certainly not written for a Ph.D. geologist. It smelled an awful lot like an introductory undergraduate geology text, and I've read others that are much more lucid than this one.Perhaps my biggest disappointment was the photography. Lacking, to say the least. Since Moore's historical coverage ceases before the advent of modern photography, I suppose this is understandable.In closing: I wasn't quite sure what this text aspired to. As a historical text, I'd say that it was worth the paperback price. As a geology text, I don't think it was worth much. As a photography book, it was worth even less."},{"Title":"Exploring the Highest Sierra","review":"This is an excellent book! The geology portion is easily understandable for the layman, yet still interesting enough for the professional geologist.

You will never look at the Sierra - or any area of geologic interest - the same way again."},{"Title":"Barefoot in the Rubble","review":"A family is awakened in the middle of the night as strangers with guns and knives burst into their home. The Father is not there to comfort them, he has been taken away and shipped off to Russia. The Mother is alone with her children. The strangers make demands in a foreign language and indicate they are forcibly taking the family away from their home. The family is terrified and they have no choice but to obey, leaving all of their possessions behind.And so begins this shocking story of concentration camps, starvation and death - all taking place as World War II was ending - and when these atrocities were supposed to have ended. It's the story of the Expulsion, a period of time after WWII when Tito came to power in the then country of Yugoslavia, and proceeded to kill over half a million* Danube Swabians (ethnic Germans). Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans were killed by Tito's forces and thousands of others were locked in concentration camps and starved. Their only crime? They were German.This story is told through the eyes of a child. The author, Elizabeth Walters, was only 4 years old when these events began. After 3 years, her family eventually escaped the camps and they walked by foot across Hungary and halfway across Austria. They scaled a mountain range to reach safety in the American Zone.Most of the Western Media, and even our history books have neglected this horrific time in history, and some officials even deny that the action against Yugoslavian citizens of German nationality ever took place.That's why the book, Barefoot in the Rubble, by Elizabeth Walters is so important. She dares to speak the truth about a period of history that remains largely unknown. Ethnic Cleansing is not limited to one country, or one time period in history. For centuries this has been going on and continues even to this day. This is a story that must be heard.Source: *\\"Nemesis at Potsdam\\" - Alfred M. de Zayas"},{"Title":"Barefoot in the Rubble","review":"Ms. Walter's memoirs of growing up in post war Europe is an excellent addition to anyone's library that focuses on the incredible history of WWII. Written from a child's perspective, it serves to remind us that there are always many more who suffer from the actions of our leaders, and continue to live the trauma of memory and the difficulties in resolving the whys and hows of experience. For anyone who would like to dismiss the subject of this book based on the German ethnicity of the author, I would suggest some research into the history of Yugoslavia and the current events of this dismantled country and think again about our perpetual need to label others according to their religion, ethnicity, language and skin color. Ms. Walter offers an empathetic hand to all victims of group identity and particularly to the children who always suffer the retributions doled out to the adults."},{"Title":"Barefoot in the Rubble","review":"Elizabeth Walter has done a great service to all Germans imprisoned...and often murdered...in Tito-era Yugoslavian concentration camps by writing this memoir. Too many Donauschwaben Germans still living today who experienced being evicted from their homes, their liberties taken from them during post-World War II Yugoslavia just because of their ethnic heritage, will come to tears when asked about what life was like at that time. Most of them understandably just do not have the willingness to recount in detail and at length what had happened to them during that part of their lifetime. For all those who doubt the accounts of their German relatives who lived in Yugoslavia (as well as Hungary) at that time, Elizabeth Walter is among the few who has finally offered a detailed, written memoir so that this part of history will not be completely forgotten. The content provided on the back cover of the hard cover version of this work grabbed me and did not let me go until I finished reading it: \\"This is not true!\\" reads the back cover. \\"The red words written across my essay burned into my heart. I had followed the assignment, I had written about a true life experience, but my high school English teacher, Miss Shay, didn't believe me. I put my essay in my notebook and wrote not another word until years later. As I grew older and watched my children grow up to young adulthood, I felt a need deep within me to let the world know how we were torn out of Yugoslavia as a people.\\" Although the writing of this memoir is a bit amateurish, and not the page-turner that other similar-genred books are such as German Boy, this account of a young girl - whose ancestors, along with thousands of other Germans, were given free land in Yugoslavia along the Danube river during the seventeenth century to develop the area, only to be persecuted solely for their German blood during the mid-twentieth century (although against and not in any way affliated with the political structure of Germany at that time) - is a rare find."},{"Title":"Barefoot in the Rubble","review":"My grandmother is the kindest lady as most of them are and she was also a German refugee taken into a concentration camp by the Russians during WWII. Growing up I never quite understood how my grandmother was in a concentration camp since she and we are not Jewish. Until I listened to her story a few weeks ago, at the age of 22 and about to graduate from college, I had no clue about Germans who had nothing to do with the war that were treated so horribly and punished for crimes they did not know existed let alone had any control over. How could one fight for the Jews to stop being persecuted and then persecute others! How hypocritical and inhumane. It makes me sick but I felt as though I needed to read this book because my grandmother said Elizabeth Walter's story is similar to her own and my grandmother does not want to have to tell the gruesome details to me and my family.

I bought the book because my father was a refugee to America from post WWII Germany. I wanted to support anyone who helped to tell the true story of the average German during the war. I did not expect to be so engrossed by a story written with such expert craftmanship that is also moving and compassionate of the human condition on several war fronts. Walter is a gifted story teller with just the right rhythm and emotional nuance.The book is an inspirational account of the triumph of the human spirit during the final year of WWII and afterwards in the refugee/slave labor camps. Walter tells the story through the eyes of a child, but we are able to enter the lives of those close to her. The description of her mother collapsing as they reach Austria is very powerful. The book is compelling because it forces us to consider both sides of human nature, the good and evil in everyone. I recommend this book highly; I found it hard to put down and will lend it to many of my friends. I think a condensed version should be made available to all school children.

With this perspective, I can really appreciate the value of Whole-Scale Change, and attest to the reader about its worth, as I have personally experienced it.The book is full of the authors' collective wisdom, and rich material that walks the reader through their model for changing the whole organization. Their concept of \\"One Mind, One Heart\\" is a great metaphor for getting everyone in an organization aligned with Purpose, and is really the \\"magic\\" behind Whole Scale Change. When everyone is aligned, the entire organization pulls together in support of each other to achieve its purpose.Another huge benefit of Whole Scale Change is that the organization automatically achieves team building at the same time it is re-creating itself.Organizational development practitioners and human resources professionals should be very interested in this book. Add to that any management consultants who are trying to effect a \\"culture change.\\"For those who would like to apply this process -- your own personal style & integrity are so fundamental to success that unless you can \\"walk the talk,\\" don't even try it. Loving the work more than the money is a fundamental concept that a practitioner would have to have. Kathie Dannemiller especially was so real with clients that it helped them overcome barriers to openness, and enabled the magic to happen.A few other key concepts that resonate throughout the book:\\"Action Learning\\" is another way of saying you have to \\"trust the process\\" to get the right results, even though the steps to get there might change along the way. Life is like that.Remember that in large-scale organization change, none of this has been done with these people, under these conditions, which means you will have to also make adjustments in real-time (also known as \\"improvisation\\") to deal with realities and learnings from the group events. Whole Scale Change does an excellent job by allowing for this, and cites many examples to show what it looks like. Also, \\"Everyone's truth is the truth\\" - to believe this you have to have a sincere & abiding respect for people - that may not be possible for every organization's leaders, which will limit the results.The book includes excellent references for further reading, and also great discussions on how Whole Scale was influenced by other practitioners (a thinking bibliography) that were very valuable."},{"Title":"Whole-Scale Change: Unleashing the Magic in Organizations","review":"If ever there was a book that sounded like it was written by a bunch of consultants it's this one. And - surprise - a look at the cover reveals that the author is none other than Dannemiller Tyson Associates, with about 15 people connected with the firm credited as contributors. With origins like these, it's no wonder that the book is chock full of phrases like, \\"If you facilitate a paradigm shift among enough microcosms, the entire organization will share the experience.\\" But don't let the lame language scare you off. If you want to learn change management strategies, sooner or later you're going to have to pick up consultant-ese. Once you do, you'll be intrigued by the concepts set down in this book about whole-scale change and the use of microcosms in bringing about organizational change. In fact, we [...] strongly recommend this book for its innovative ideas, in spite of its tortured prose."},{"Title":"Whole-Scale Change: Unleashing the Magic in Organizations","review":"Amazon book reviewI'd like to recommend two titles that I recently acquired. They are the two Dannemiller Tyson Associate titles The first title is &quot;Whole-Scale Change: Unleashing the Magic in Organizations.&quot; The second is Dannemiller Tyson Associates &quot;Whole-Scale Change: Toolkit. Both are published by Berrett-Koehler Publishers in San Francisco.The Unleashing the Magic is the title I think those interested in organizational change will find most useful. It combines a lot of practical techniques and suggestions with explanations about the underlying theory on which &quot;whole-scale change is based. For me a practitioner who has used whole-scale change techniques for several years I've used the book to reinforce techniques I already use; it has also served as a source of ideas. The second volume is also helpful in that it provides a lot of tested designs. However, I suspect that the Toolkit will be most useful to those who are already versed in the whole-scale techniques. I think it would be very difficult for a person not familiar with whole-scale change techniques to apply the designs. I should note that the variety of designs clearly underscores the power and flexibility of whole-scale change.These are definitely worthwhile purchases."},{"Title":"Whole-Scale Change: Unleashing the Magic in Organizations","review":"How can you think positively, involve (litterally) everybody, and make sure that the process is well managed? This book shows the way! I met Kathleen Dannemiller at the first World Congres on Systemic Thinking (May 1-6 2001, Vienna), and I really apreciated the message she had for the public. Probing further, I discovered that the method has generated impressive results as well! One of the examples has been a Whole-Scae process with the people involved in making the Mustang IV a success. At the moment Dannemiller was called in (around 1991), Ford was thinking about dropping the Mustang. In stead of asking what the problems where, people from throughout the organization were asked to dream about the &quot;new&quot; Mustang and how to make this dream come true. that car was developped in about 2 year's time, costed 22% less to build than a Mustang III and had limited problems at introduction. Some people at Ford even quote this car's introduction as &quot;scary&quot;, because everything went almost as planned. One would wonder why Murphy's law didn't apply. The answer is simple: all people felt involved and they felt had to make this car a success. If you ask me what's missing? Well, dannemillers knowledge op people skills is &quot;unconcious&quot;: her techniques do not cover the emotiunal intelligence one needs to make all this work.

While most people acknowledge that changes are necessary and also recognize that changes are often resisted, based on the low success rate of effective change, few people appear to understand the dynamics of achieving progressive change. In the context of human organizations as functioning systems, Dannemiller Tyson Associates: define the dynamics of organization al change, acknowledge to forces for and against change, recommend constitutes whose collaboration and support must be earned, and describe practical processes for planning, executing, and institutionalizing organizational changes. To earn the reader's confidence, the authors use real world examples that demonstrate how \\"whole scale change\\" has worked in everyday organizations.I highly recommended \\"Whole Scale Change: Unleashing the Magic in Organizations\\" and \\"Whole Scale Change Toolkit\\" for everyone working to achieve change in their organizations."},{"Title":"Whole-Scale Change: Unleashing the Magic in Organizations","review":"In order for the reader to fully appreciate my comments, I must begin by explaining that I know several of the authors of this book and my interview with Kathie Dannemiller is cited at the end. I love them and their work. Kathie is a dear friend and valued teacher.Then I have to say that it took me a couple of chapters to warm up to this book that I desperately wanted to love from page one. I came to realize that the part of me that still seeks comfort in prescriptive approaches was looking for directions, answers and destinations in a time when values and journeys are the new call. By the middle of Chapter 3, I was gaining respect for the experience and wisdom its authors were sharing. By the end of the book, I was able to appreciate the gifts this group of groundbreaking consultants had made available to me. While it sometimes seems that &quot;Large Scale&quot; change initiatives have been with us for some time in organizations, their use is in its infancy compared to hundreds of years of small scale, Newtonian, cause-and-effect planning. This book lays out fundamental concepts that can help each of us allow the emergence of change that is more organic, natural and, yes, far less predictable.If you are weary of trying to \\"manage\\" change, and are interested in finding ways to enroll the hearts and souls of everyone in your organization, this book is a must read.

Mastering Red Hat Linux 9 is a huge and very complete guide to Red Hat Linux 9. It's over 900 pages, and includes the &quot;Publisher's Edition&quot; of RH9 on 2 CD's. It is written in a style which should accomodate Linux newcomers and more experienced users alike. There are a LOT of examples, code snippets, and screenshots throughout the book. In fact sometimes the abundance of these tend to make the material a little long to wade through. Experts should have no trouble skipping over the sections they don't need though.The book starts out with in an introduction to Linux, and has a good chapter on preparing to install, including hardware checklists. This is followed by a very detailed step by step explanation of installing Red Hat, both locally and via network. A nice part of this is a troubleshooting chapter for solving installation problems. Part Two explains the basics of using the command line, how filesystems work in Linux, and using the shell for various tasks.Part Three includes chapters for administering users and groups on your new system, and how the RPM software package management process works. Other chapters in this part explain the bootup process and how to configure it, various ways to perform system backups, and other common adminstration tasks such as cron jobs and logs. Especially useful should be Chapter 12 which explains how to update/compile your own kernel. There are very good examples of the myriad kernel options, mostly by using the xconfig utility.The next several chapters go over how to configure and use the XWindows display system, including good examples from the XF86Config file. This is followed by detailed explanations of configuring and using the Gnome and KDE desktop environments. The KDE discussion is very good, considering Red Hat is more known for it's use of Gnome as the default desktop. Chapter 18 introduces many of the more commonly used graphical applications in Linux, such as OpenOffice, Gnome Office, and the KOffice suite. Chapter 19 should be very handy for Linux/RH new users, as it outlines the Red Hat graphical configuration utilities which allow customization of the desktop look-and-feel and other system preferences.Chapters 20-22 cover basic Linux networking. The first part of this section gives a very understandable primer on TCP/IP and network terminology. This is followed up by excellent discussions on how to setup and manage networking on your Linux computer, including security recommendations and firewall/masquerading methods. Once you've got your network running safely, there are additional chapters which cover topics such as remote access and xinetd services, and various server applications installation and operation. These include DNS, DHCP, CUPS printing operations, FTP servers (and clients), NFS and NIS, and mail servers (sendmail). Some of these services are probably more than most home users would need, and the sendmail operation in particular is a little difficult to understand.Chapter 29 (using Samba) will probably be a great help for people desiring to integrate a Linux system with existing Windows computers on a network. It offers an excellent tutorial on how to share files and resources across the LAN, and includes an explanation of the SWAT configuration utility which greatly simplifies initial setup for newcomers. The final chapter in the book explains how to install and setup a basic webserver using the Apache sofware. The Appendix of the book is a relatively short section called the Linux Command Reference. There is some handy information in this, although it seems to be organized somewhat haphazardly. The book's Index seems to be very complete.Overall I found this book to be a very useful reference tool. It is basic enough for most beginners to get all the help they need, and has a good amount of usable knowledge for more advanced Linux users. One thing I have realized is that much of the information here is not necessarily RedHat-specific, so can be helpful to users of other Linux distributions as well. I would highly recommend this as a valuable addition to your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Mastering Red Hat Linux 9","review":"I have been a Solaris system admin for some time, so I understand a bit about this subject. However, when going through this book word by word, I have found mistakes that make it almost impossible for the average user to learn. Fortunately for me, I can look and say, hey, this isn't right and figure out what figure he should be referencing; figure out that his IP address was added incorrectly, figure out what the heck he is REALLY talking about. Whoever proofread this book should be fired! IE. page 375, Table 13.3 stop (table says this command STARTS a service)! Too many mistakes to mention individually. Some of it is well written, but certainly not much of it for my mind."},{"Title":"Mastering Red Hat Linux 9","review":"The book is pretty comprehensive and generous with examples. It serves well as a guided instruction on those who are just starting with linux. This is book is also a good refernce material, however, there are certain topics I was hoping would be included, like OpenLDAP, mySQL, TACACS+ and how these tools integrate with Linux for it to become more rounded.Overall, Mastering RH9 is still book worth having on our shelves."},{"Title":"Mastering Red Hat Linux 9","review":"I'm a Microsoft Windows admin, who wanted to learn Linux. A friend told me to pick up this book, and I'm glad. It just amazed me. The other big Linux Bible book has like no pictures showing how to install. This book shows me step by step! I thought I did a stupid thing not backing up before installing Linux on my old D: drive. Not a problem! This book helped me do it easy. Didn't even touch my C: Drive. Kickstart? It's like installing Linux automatically like MSBatch.Others told me that NFS was hard to do. Not if you have this book! The graphical tools that Red Hat got work well for me. What a relief that I don't have to work at the command line - and this book shows me how. I wish it did more of the GUI though.... the coverage of the desktop is like too few words on every last thing in the GUI. Not enough GUI for me. I know, the people in my Linux user group tell me that the command line is better, but I'm just not used to it. Takes time to read through all those commands. But this book is better than the man pages! And hey, I got it working on my LAN easy with Red Hat's GUI network tools. Wish they had a GUI for DHCP though.Next step - I want to see if I can make my Linux computer into a gateway for my network. That Red Hat Security Configurator looks promising. Then I'll be able to run my Web server off of this Linux box. But so far with this book, no problem!

Explanations of the kernel in other books confuse the h#(# out of me.Starting with the intro, Chapter 4 helped me set up a network server for installing Linux. Several chapters gave me the courage to use real commands at the command line for the first time. As a Windows user, I wish it went more into the stuff you can do at the GUI. But I've set up FTP and Web servers that work on my home network."},{"Title":"Mastering Red Hat Linux 9","review":"Michael Jang's Mastering Red Hat Linux 9 is bar-none, simply the best of the BIG books on RH 9.

It's clear you have the reader's needs in mind and that you understand the challenges Linux users face, and the questions we will inevitably come up with. In the perfect world, Red Hat would give authors like Michael some of the profits, since his book will most definitely help their company sell more product."},{"Title":"Mastering Red Hat Linux 9","review":"I had great expectations when I first opened the book, expecting a tutorial format leading me from novice to accomplished. I'm pretty disappointed... On the surface, the book appears to head in that direction, but I soon found myself being &quot;exampled&quot; to death with commands that had not been previously introduced or explained. I got the distinct impression that Mr. Jang was trying to show us readers just how knowledgeable he is on the subject. I'll grant him that, but that's not what I needed.The book has lists of &quot;things&quot; in many places, but I'd much rather have an explanation of the relevant items before I'm tossed the entire set of &quot;things&quot; with no way to discern what's most important from what's less so. I've learned more from the online RedHat documentation than I've learned from this book; if I had the chance to learn Linux all over again, I'd spend my money elsewhere. Caveat emptor, as always...."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"I have eagerly anticipated another Irene Adler book from Carole Nelson Douglas for several years now. I learned about &quot;Chapel Noir&quot; several months ago and eagerly rushed to the bookstore as soon as my copy arrived in the store. That said, I can admit I am a fan, albeit a slightly disappointed one.No, I do not mind that the book is darker than the previous ones in the series. It fits the story. I love the growth and development of the characteters, so no complaints there. I can even handle a cliffhanger as much as I personally detest them. I hate waiting at least a year for a resolution in books I read primarily for entertainment.What I didn't like was the constant change of narrator in the book. Yes, I understand it was necessary, considering the inevitable cliffhanger. Yes, I even like Pink (or whatever you want to call her). But although she is vastly different in personality from Nell, her narrative voice is not sufficiently different. I kept having to keep the narrative clues straight as to who was speaking, since the voices were all too similar. It's not that I was confused, but I had to work too hard to read the book just to keep the narrators straight, let alone the clues and story developments. It was horrific when I had to put the book down for a break and come back and figure out who was speaking before I could become immersed in the story. The narrative clues are dense, actually, and also slowed the flow of the story. It was as if the editor knew the voices were not different enough so we were peppered with narrative clues, not mystery clues, since the conceit had to be maintained to obtain the ending.Still, Irene is back, and so is Nell. If you love them, reread the other books and venture onto this one. If you haven't read the former books, please start with them. Nell is a jewel, a Dr. Watson and an Archie Goodwin rolled all into a Victorian woman. Don't miss her. I love her. I just wish the book had been more about her again than Irene. Irene is wonderful, but Nell is the true heroine. Nell humanizes Irene's perfections.If you also enjoy Holmes tempered with a strong female character, I highly recommend Laurie R. King's &quot;The Beekeeper's Apprentice.&quot;"},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"I have to admit that I have not been a fan of Carole Nelson Douglas. I dislike cats; therefore, I do not read mystery books which feature crime-solving felines. The only reason I read her Irene Adler series was to catch brief glimpses of Sherlock Holmes here and there. Honestly, I found nothing all that remarkable about her Irene Adler series--until now.I have been converted. This past week, I picked up Chapel Noir planning to quickly flip through the pages searching for Holmes. Boy, was I in for a pleasant surprise! The riveting plot: it would appear that Jack the Ripper is in Paris, and seems to have picked up where he left off back in Whitechapel. Irene and her Watsonian sidekick Nell are summoned in the middle of the night to investigate the crime. Famous personages pop up throughout the book a la any historical mystery, but rather than crowding up the storyline, they simply make their appearance and exit stage left.By the way, for all you Sherlockians, there is enough Sherlock Holmes here for your enjoyment, but what caught my attention is that Douglas' pen seems to have found new life in this series. This book is far darker and more complex than its predecessors, but it sure makes for a far more engrossing read.Sherlock Holmes stays for a bit longer in this book than he does in all the previous Irene Adler books combined (which is a plus!). The interplay between the two are especially fun to read, and Huxleigh's observations of them are just flat-out hilarious!Chapel Noir, the latest and in my humble opinion, the greatest installment in this series, is a must-read mystery novel! And oh, the ending! Talk about a cliffhanger! I can hardly wait for the the sequel to come out in August 2002!"},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"A number of authors have attempted to follow Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes' tales with new exploits of their own devising. Some have succeeded and some have failed. Chapel Noir is an example of a failure. Although the book focuses on Irene Adler and only tangently includes Mr Holmes, it attempts to use the famous detective as a lure to bring in unsuspecting readers. I was intrigued at the thought of a story including Mr Holmes, Irene Adler (the woman), and Jack the Ripper. What I found was a story that was repetative and boring. I can only read so many times about the wardrobe of Irene Adler or the manner in which Mr Holmes and Doctor Watson misunderstood her. Repeating the same information yet using different words is still the same information. This was a 450+ page book that could have easily been tailored down to half the size. If you are looking for a book with action, this is not it. If you are looking for a book with solid dialogue between parties, this is not it. I felt this was a waste of my time."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"I even wrote to CND and told her that I thought Chapel Noir was fabulous. (She wrote back!!!) I loved the character interactions and the more personal views of Nell, Pink, and of course, &quot;the Master.&quot; I thought that the plot was very well-written. And SHerlock Holmes and Irene Adler match wits. What more can a reader want? Of course, the cliff hanger ending left me wanting more and I can't wait until Castle Rouge. Irene seems so mature in this book, which is great. And Nell's unreasonable animosity towards Holmes is really comic relief.The other critics said that this book was much darker than all the others and some didn't like that. I say, &quot;No, duh!&quot; The darkness was a necessary part because the book was about &quot;Jack the Ripper,&quot; crimes against women, and a conspiracy against a whole race. Obviously, the novel was going to dark. And what are you doing reading murder mysteries if you can't stand a little darkness?? Mysteries are designed to show the evil in men's natures.Brava Mrs. Douglas."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"Wow.

It was wonderful, but a warning - it is darker than the other Irene Adler mysteries have been, and has a &quot;cliff-hanger&quot; ending that frustrated me no end. Don't expect a cozy mystery, or easy answers.It is wonderful to see Nell grow and change from the naive spinster. Oh, don't worry, she still sticks to her moral ideals, but in this outing, she shows her strength. She even faces down Sherlock Holmes!Irene and Nell are called in when two &quot;ladies of the evening&quot; are found murdered at a French brothel.

I would never buy it for anyone. I am dismayed by an author and a publisher who would sell a book that is incomplete and ends with a cliffhanger. Who needs the aggravation? Furthermore, there is no pleasure in reading the book - it is tough slogging the whole way.

The main plot element - Holmes meets Jack the Ripper - is a tired and overdone cliche. The book moves along too slowly and is overburdened with endless descriptions of clothing and other distractions. The plot devices seem overly contrived, and settings like the wax museum and the exposition seem gratuitous. And the \\"you will buy the sequel\\" cliffhanger ending feels like a ripoff."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"In 1889 American Irene Adler Norton resides in Paris with her beloved British husband Godfrey. At first the social swirl provides Irene with much distraction, but that quickly turns boring for the only known female to outwit and out-deduce the great Sherlock Holmes.Thus, when the police, acting at the direction of a higher up, ask her to assist with the inquiries into the murders of prostitutes, Irene jumps at the opportunity. Upon seeing the brutalized corpse of the latest victim, a horrified Irene immediately thinks of London and Ripper. Unable to resist full involvement, Irene begins to investigate the grisly homicides only to find that once again she competes with the internationally renowned Holmes.Anyone who enjoys the full Holmes pantheon (not just Doyle&#8217;s prime piece of heaven) will want to read the first Irene Adler novel released in several years. The story line is exciting as Victorian Paris comes to life through the eyes of Irene and her shocked companion Nell. Holmes also plays a secondary but important role. The who-done-it is cleverly designed so that it is elementary to Dr. Watson that this novel is quite appealing. Fans of Holmes will want to read CHAPEL NOIR, Carole Nelson Douglas previous Adler novels and demand a shorter gap for her next appearance.&lt;P{>Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"Ok, so maybe i haven't read the other novels of the Irene Adler saga, i didn't have to, this was after all, a report. A great topic and era to present this story in, and the cast of characters were unbelievably cool and rich in historical fact, but the ending was a total cliff hanger, which turns away readers like me, who are probably not going to buy the sequel, and the narritive moving from Nell to Pink is alright but the other little tid bits were weird and really confusing, not really necessary in story.

I hope that the tone is a little lighter, and that the sparkle comes back."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"Awful stuff. Torpid and turgid with sad delusions of grandeur. A painful read. Plot development is slow and the author takes every opportunity to trumpet the ladies and denigrate the men. I could have swallowed that if the book had moved at a decent clip. Instead, we are subjected to the blatherings between Adler and Nell ad nauseaum. In one particular scene, the author takes over 3 pages of conversation and description as the two main protagonists pick up a few crumbs from the first crime scene.The topper was the &quot;discussion questions&quot; and interview with the author at the end of the book. These clearly displayed the author's self-infatuation and pretense of &quot;deep ideas&quot;, with the questions focusing on women's roles in the 19th century and such tired old chestnuts as the duality of sexual mores concerning men and women's roles and habits (e.g. If Jack the Ripper had murdered a series of men, would anyone still be talking about him and what are the societal connotations of this apparent infatuation with men savaging women? Why was it acceptable for men to be promiscuous and women not to be?).

But Carole Nelson Douglas' treatment puts a new and dramatically personal spin on it that captures the reader's attention and pulls you willy-nilly through the darkest of deeds set against the dazzling grandeur of a Parisian World's Fair.The intriguing switches of narrator leaves you not only wondering who the villain truly is, but keeps you guessing about everyone involved. And the mad roller coaster plunge to the end will keep you hard-pressed not to skip directly to the end to read the outcome.My only quibble is that I must wait until August to learn the answers to my burning questions...As always, a brilliant and darkly stirring performance -- by the author AND the heroine and her &quot;supporting cast&quot;.

Well, the mistake was not reading it sooner! It's great! I am disappointed in my fellow readers who obviously haven't checked the FACTS of the book.#1. The suspect in the story (read it yourself, Mac!) is a genuine Jack-the-Ripper suspect, and considered by many to actually BE the Ripper. He had murdered his wife and was an escapee (or more likely let go) from a madhouse.#2. The Ripper murders have always been claimed to show some religious or occult symbol, authors vary on what. Me, the ol' Raven is like The Great Randi, skeptic unparalleled, who points out that any pattern is only possible if you connect the dots that way.#3. Pink. Yes, that was her nickname, and her name as given in the book is her real one. But no one remembers her by that name, since she is world-famous under a pseudonym. I won't say what it was, but if I did all of you would slap your forehead and say &quot;Oh, yeah! I've heard of her!&quot; You probably think Mark Twain was his real name too.As for the story ending midstream, do you really want an 800 page book? There's just too much to tell in one story.

What a pleasure it is to again be immersed in the universe of Irene Adler-Norton! After an interminable wait, Irene is back, and on her most difficult and gruesome case yet.In this newest outing, Irene is drawn into a lurid web of murder and mayhem that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat throughout the book. The only woman to ever outwit Sherlock Holmes (by his own admission), Irene is a force of nature who relies on her wits and intuition to solve cases others have given up on. She also delights in giving Sherlock Holmes a run for his money, and often astonishes the seasoned Consulting Detective with her sharp deductions and ability to stay one step ahead of him.In Irene &amp; Nell, CND has created characters that have depth, intelligence and intuitiveness that captivate the reader. Ms. Douglas' attention to detail is amazing -- Victorian England &amp; France seem to come alive on the pages and immerse the reader in a by-gone world.If you haven't had the pleasure of reading the other Irene Adler books, you're missing out on a fantastic series. So do yourself a favor, and read the entire series -- you're in for a marvelous treat!PS. August 2002 for the next book?? Madame, your ARE sadistic! &lt;grin&gt;"},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"Disappointing, Difficult to follow,and Forced. Not nearly as enjoyable as the other books in the series. Too much Holmes, not enough Nell - and three narrators is too many. This made the book too much like work and I read for pleasure."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"I gave this book 4 stars, but it is difficult to rate a story that is only halfway finished. Castle Noir will be out next fall to finish up the story. Fair warning: this book ends with a cliffhanger and characters in transit and danger. It is much darker than the previous Irene Adler novels. The 'noir' in the title is justified because there is a very suspenseful and almost horror like feel to the book. This certainly could be due to the subject matter (is Jack the Ripper loose in Paris?) Sherlock Holmes also appears more in this book than the previous ones. Buy and read the book if you do not mind not knowing what happens until next fall."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"Chapel Noir is a great read. I've never read any Irene Adler mysteries and I actually picked up the book because Jack the Ripper was named on the cover and was greatly suprised. I couldn't put the book down and quickly became attached to the characters and the story line. Beware though, if you read Chapel Noir you'll have to read Castle Rouge because where Chapel Noir ends Castle Rouge begins. I hope Ms. Douglas doesn't wait another seven years to write another Irene, Nell and Godfrey adventure. In the meantime, I'll have to go back to the beginning and try to find the first books of the series."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"Yes, this is a cliffhanger &amp; yes, it is darker than the previous Irene Alder books, but it is definately the best yet. I read it nearly straight through, then had to re-read it immediately to get all the nuances. Ms. Douglas' extensive research into the Victorian era shines. This is not an easy, quick read. It is certainly a compelling one. I can't wait for Castle Rouge to come out."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"Irene Adler is the only female adversary to outwit Sherlock Holmes and she may have stolen his heart as well. Carol Nelson Douglas has taken the brief outline of Irene Adler in the Sherlock Holmes adventure A Scandal In Bohemia and fleshed it out into a marvelous sleuth of her own design. She has created her own series of books with Irene Adler as a 19th century detective with a feminist flair.Adler's latest two-part adventure, Chapel Noir and Castle Rouge, is told through a series of journal entries by her female companion Penelope Huxleigh. Additional chapters are supposedly taken from notes written by a prostitute called Pink and sections of a mysterious yellow book of anonymous authorship. This multiple &quot;authorship&quot; allows Douglas to present her story from different perspectives.And what a story! In Chapel Noir Adler is called on by Baron de Alphonse Rothschild to investigate a particularly bloody murder in a Parisian bordello. Before long Jack the Ripper is the suspect and Sherlock Holmes (sans Watson) has come to Paris to investigate. As the plot moves on, more famous historical figures are drawn in either as suspects or allies. 470 pages later I found, instead of the end, that this is the first of a two part story.A rollicking adventure that continues for another 470 pages in Castle Rouge. Lots of fun if you can stand the gruesome aspects of the crimes."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"I was incredibly disapointed with Carole Nelson Douglas' new Irene Adler mystery, 'Chapel Noir'. This is the 5th in what used to be a first-rate mystery/adventure series tied in with the Sherlock Holmes characters.'Chapel Noir' has Irene Adler and Nell pursuing the infamous Jack The Ripper of 1889 in what could have been a potentialy thrilling mystery, but instead we are subjected to 450 pages of endless 'girl talk'! As a bonus, Nelson Douglas adds a character of a reformed American prostitute in Paris, who prefers to go by the anachronistic name of 'Pink'. This character appears so unauthentic and bogus, Douglas must have intended readers to be reminded of the current rock star 'Pink' of the same name! Even more annoying, Pink joins the two female characters in this constant chattering that always keeps the mystery from ever begining! Why?! Because 'Chapel Noir' even at 450 pages, is only the first half of the 'adventure'! This story continues in the sequel 'Chapel Rouge', which is why Douglas gave us three clucking female slueths instead of the usual two!Go back and re-read Carole Nelson Douglas's previous Irene Adler novels, which were all either good and even terrific. In particular, look for the titles 'Irene At Large' and 'Irene's Last Waltz' which are among the very best of Holmes era mysteries anywhere.As for 'Chapel Noir' don't waste your time!"},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"Irene Adler and her sidekick Nell Huxleigh are visiting Paris when Irene is called to Paris. Two young prostitutes have been murdered and the deaths risk implicating the Prince of Wales and the Baron Rothchild--worse, the method of murder is highly reminiscent of the recent Jack the Ripper killings in London. Irene feels compelled to investigate using a combination of Holmes-like deduction and female intuition. What she finds is evidence that Jake the Ripper was not a solitary madman, but something more, something with purpose, and that Jack the Ripper certainly did not kill himself in London but survived to terrorize France.Sometimes working in conjunction with, and sometimes in partnership with the vain Sherlock Holmes himself, Irene and Nell, along with Irene's adopted second sidekick Pink, adopt any manner of disguises to discover the truth about the Ripper, including whether Holmes himself might have been the crazed killer. Huxleigh, the primary narrative voice, adopts a generally amusing air of condescension, conformance to society's (Victorian) rules, and British superiority while Adler represents the rule-breaking genius.Author Carole Nelson Douglas blends a nice mixture of female fashion, rules of convention, and exciting action in CHAPEL NOIR. The rivalry between Adler and Holmes is true to the original description of Adler in A SCANDEL IN BOHEMIA, with Douglas adding a female slant to the distinctly male-dominated Holmes legend. Douglas had left this historical-era character for several years, but has now returned after a stint writing Midnight Louis mysteries.Be warned, at the end of nearly 500 pages, CHAPEL NOIR readers are left with a cliffhanger. This story will be concluded in a sequel."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"Irene and Nell are back in action, along with &quot;The Man&quot; himself!I have been eagerly anticipating another adventure with my two favorite victorian slueths and this book did not disappoint. I agree with the other reviewers that the theme is much darker than the others, but we get to see sides of Irene and Nell that we have never seen before. I cannot wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"I really disliked this one. It rambled and was difficult to read. If you hadn't read the previous books in this series it would be completely baffling. After many hundreds of pages, it ends in the middle of the story. A very cheap trick to get me to buy another book in this series. I'm not falling for it.LOUSY!"},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"I'm so glad I've gotten back into reading this series. I'm even happier that I waited, even though I've been buying the books in hardcover as soon as they've been released. At least I'm happy that I didn't read this one when it first came out.Why? Because it's part one, and it wasn't clearly indicated that there was a part one and a part two; nor did it end with a conclusion of any sort. Since part two, Castle Rouge, was right there on my TBR pile, I didn't mind, but I imagine I'd have been rather upset if I'd had to wait a year for it, and not in the good way I was upset about waiting to find out what happened at the end of Evanovich's High Five.Anyway, ex-opera diva Irene Adler Norton, best known as the only woman to outwit Sherlock Holmes, and her companion Nell Huxleigh are back in Paris, while Irene's husband Godfrey is off to Prague on business for the Rothschilds. Irene gets a summons from An Important Personage to investigate a pair of gruesome murders in a brothel that are uncannily like those of Jack the Ripper some months earlier in London.Irene and Nell are joined by \\"Pink,\\" the young prostitute who discovered the bodies. It's soon apparent that Pink isn't exactly what she seems, but Irene brings her home and includes her in their investigations, which also involve the Prince of Wales, Bram Stoker, Sherlock Holmes, and Buffalo Bill.Once again, I very much enjoy Nell's first-person narrative. She's a somewhat unreliable narrator, often misunderstanding things, though this case is a definite eye-opener for her. And that's part of why I didn't like this book as well as the previous ones: the chapters alternate between Nell and Pink and an unidentified, but also female, source. There's a reason for having more than one narrator, and Pink did grow on me after an initial dislike, particularly after we learn her secret, but the narrator change did distract from the story.I also missed the character of Godfrey, who seemed too conveniently missing until his absence was better explained toward the end of the book. Mostly, though, if I'd realized before the very end that Chapel Noir was just part one, I think it would have been another 5-star read. I'd have been less impatient, knowing I had nearly 1000 pages for the threads to all tie together."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"She took me halfway there. I HATE when books continue in another tome, yet the reader is not warned ahead of time. The author thus forces you to buy the second book. Guess what? I am requesting it from the library. Other than that Ms. Nelson Douglas has a masterful command of the language and the epoch and her Irene Adler sereis are most entertaining."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"\\"Chapel Noir\\" and \\"Castle Rouge\\" are two halves of one very, very long novel. You can't enjoy them separately, but that's no reason not to wade in with Irene Adler and Nell Huxleigh on another Victorian sleuthing and competition with the indomitable Sherlock Holmes.This time, Carole Nelson Douglas offers a new analysis of the Jack the Ripper murders and examines old and new suspects for the role of \\"Saucy Jack\\" as her inquiry agent, Irene Adler, investigates Ripper-like crimes in Paris. For help, Irene enlists the real-life Bertie, Prince of Wales, Baron de Rothschild, Buffalo Bill Cody and Bram Stoker. She delves deeply into religious cult symbolism and mystery and discovers through Richard von Krafft-Ebing's \\"Psychopathia Sexualis\\" that the Ripper's slaughters are far from unique. As we could well tell her with such modern examples as Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and John Wayne Gacy.In addition to Penelope Huxleigh's exhaustive diaries are observations from a mysterious yellow journal and from the journal of the irritating Pink, a supposed habitu&eacute; of a Paris \\"maison de rendezvous.\\" These lead us on a harrowing journey through Paris, London, Prague and Transylvania to the far-fetched, but possible, conclusion of this entertainingly dark novel.As admirable as Irene Adler is, and the perfect foil for Sherlock Holmes, for me the best character in the series has been--and remains--the very human, Nell Huxleigh. This prim and proper parson's daughter has a taste for grue and gore that she continually denies, yet she won't be left out of the adventure despite her traditional upbringing. Nell's stretching and growing personality provides the dry and wry humor that permeates the series, and in this story she has ample opportunities to see herself in new lights.This review is based on earlier hardback editions."},{"Title":"Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the Ripper","review":"Come join Ms. Douglas on a wild ride in Paris in spring of 1889. It is the year of the unveiling of the Eiffel Tower as well as the scene of the 1889 World's Fair. And Irene and Nell are on the trail of a particularly vicious killer. Could it be that Jack the Ripper who terrorized London last fall has moved on to Paris? There are a number of particularly gruesome killings involving women in Paris that spring. So Irene and Nell who are joined by a young American protegy called Pink are trying to stop the slaughters. With the aid of Sherlock Holmes, an American trapper called Buffalo Bill Cody, an Indian tracker called Red Tomahawk as well as some French Gendarmes, it looks like they may be successful. But be prepared this book leaves the reader with a mighty big cliff-hanger, so that we feel that we have to rush right out and get the next book in the series. Ms. Douglas' series is a winner.

Fantastic! &quot;Chapel Noir&quot; is the first book I have read by Carole Nelson Douglas. It definitely won't be the last. This is an incredible book. &quot;Chapel Noir&quot; is set in Paris, France during the late 1800's just a few months after the Whitechapel Jack the Ripper murders. Irene Adler, one of the main characters, and her friend, Nell, are in search of a murderer crusading around Paris, which they think might be the same Jack the Ripper who committed those in Whitechapel. Many of the famous historical sites of Paris are included in this book, as well as the famous Sherlock Holmes. The mystery begins at an amazing pace, and will not let you go until the very last page. Compared to my favorite book, &quot;Bloodline&quot; by Jill Jones, this lies on the same scale. It is definitely as good as my favorite book, so now I have two favorite books. There are some French words and phrases in the book, which I am able to translate. I love Paris, France, and the French language, and everything about France, which also motivated me to read this book. There are some factual information charts and sayings in the book from the real Jack the Ripper evidence which is amazingly interesting! This book has little sayings out of different books and such at the beggining of every chapter.

If you find any of her books, it is a definite read.This particular story takes place in southern Wales, a locale drenched in Authurianfolklore. The author skillfully uses this to create a mystery for her prime character, Lynette.Is Lyn really the protector of the child which the dragon wishes to harm or is she onlydreaming of old tales she's read?

I love the bleak, desolate setting, and the historical backdrop to the story provides some wonderful atmosphere. I also liked the interplay of historical eras: the ancient Welsh kings and the old Arthurian legends; the more recent Normans; and the even more recent Tudors, one of whom features in Lyn's dreams. The psychological suspense is also top-notch, though I thought that Lyn's \\"turnaround\\" with Stevie was a little too abrupt.

Lyn finds herself pulled into a mystery that is beyond her control. Now her dreams are not just disturb by the haunting cries of her own lost baby, but by someone else's child as well. What do they want? Why does she keep seeing people in her dreams that do not exist?Susanna Kearsley's writing impressed me greatly! The first page captured me immediately; once drawn in I couldn't let go. Although Named the Dragon is a contemporary novel, the historical aspects of Wales, its castles, its myths and its royalty, along with the quotes at the beginning of each chapter by Shakespeare, W.B. Yeats, and Lord Tennyson made the read that much more delightful for me as a historical buff.Susanna Kearsley's writing has been compared to Barbara Michaels and Mary Stewart. I have to agree - it is that good."},{"Title":"Named of the Dragon","review":"Author Bridget Cooper persuades her literary agent Lyn Ravenshaw to join her on a Christmas vacation in Angle, Wales. Bridget looks forward to spending some time with a famous playwright, whose name she refuses to divulge to Lyn. She wants Lyn to occupy a boy friend, noted writer James Swift. Lyn looks forward to meeting James because she loved his last work &quot;The Leaden Sky&quot; that she thought deserved a Booker.After they arrive in Angle, Lyn learns that Bridget plans to have a tryst with the renowned recluse Gareth Gwyn Morgan, whose play several years took the world by storm. Gareth rejects the spotlights of the London stage and has not published anything since he was heralded as the greatest. When Gareth and Lyn meet for the first time, no sparks fly. There is only a squabble that occurs whenever they're together. As they see each other, they begin to fall in love. However, neither one can handle a relationship filled with love because their respective hearts are overloaded with guilt from their pasts. Adding to their problems is the continual dream that Lyn suffers involving a mother and a child.NAMED OF THE DRAGON is a very interesting contemporary romance that centers on protagonists predominantly belonging to the world of literature. The story line is character-driven, which works because the prime players are different in temperament yet add much to the mix. Though the subplot involving Merlin's Prophecy (Lyn's dream) seems distracting at times, it ultimately works its way into the main plot. Susanna Kearsley provides her audience with a complex relationship drama that shows her ability to showcase her cast.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Named of the Dragon","review":"I liked the book. I like Kearsley's writing and her plots, and her dialogue is good. But I keep having the same problem-- her climaxes fizzle. There just isn't much to them. The climax in this one just blew up out of nowhere and lasted so brief a time that it hardly seemed to qualify as one."},{"Title":"Named of the Dragon","review":"Susanna Kearsley's books never disappoint. With her evocative descriptions of place, her engaging characters, her special gift for dialogue and a dash of suspense thrown in, they are always fun and entertaining reads: fast can't-put-down-until-it's-finished books.In Named of the Dragon she takes us to a little corner of modern-day Wales, to Castle House in the village of Angle. In looking up Angle on Wikipedia I discovered that Castle House is a real place; in fact, the picture on the cover of this book looks to be taken from an actual photo of the place. And indeed, in the Author's Note at the end, Kearsley explains that she once spent at winter at Castle House and that its owners invited her to write about it. Cleverly, she used the names of the owners -- Ralph and Pam -- as the names of the owners in the book.The heroine is a young widow who, five years later, is still grieving and having nightmares about the baby she lost at birth. At the invitation of a client she goes to Wales to spend Christmas, and there her constantly-recurring nightmares take on ever-new twists as they become entwined with the story of a young widow living at Castle House who lives in fear that someone is trying to take her baby boy. Added to the mix is a dose of Arthurian legend, as the young mother, who most consider half-mad, constantly refers to the prophecies of Merlin and mysteriously believes that Lyn (the heroine) has come to save her baby.If this sounds a bit melodramatic and over-done, it does verge on that at times. However, Kearsley rescues her book from going completely over the top by her engaging and witty characters. Although the dialogue wasn't quite as sparkling and witty as in The Shadowy Horses, she still manages to create people you wished you knew.The romance was a weaker element in Named of the Dragon, as Lyn and her would-be love interest spent the entire book sparring with each other. He wasn't handsome, he wasn't intriguing, in fact he was a jerk most of the time. But by the last five pages or so it was evident that in the near future they would finally get together.Named of the Dragon isn't Kearsley's strongest book, but it is an entertaining, fast read recommended for her fans, or fans of Mary Stewart."},{"Title":"Named of the Dragon","review":"Another winner from Susanna Kearsley, who is on the fast track for overtaking some of my favorite \\"spooky\\" writers, Barbara Michaels, Barbara Erskine and Mary Stewart.Canadian writer Kearsley pens the kind of books I particularly enjoy (and have a hard time finding) for a weekend read - an atmospheric, somewhat romantic mystery set in Europe (particularly Great Britain) and containing historic or mythic references. Named of the Dragon is set in a small coastal village in Wales, and references Tennyson's epic poem, The Idylls of the King (which also happens to be a beloved favorite of mine). Nerd that I am, I knew immedaitely from reading some reviews that the hero and heroine, Gareth and Lyn, MUST be somehow connected to Sir Gareth and Lynnette of the Idylls, and they were! Lots of Authurian references from the Welsh mythic tales, The Mabinogi, as well as some brief history of Henry VII and his young(!) mother, Margaret Beauford.I've read three Kearsley books now (Mariana and The Shadowy Horses), and this offering, while the weakest, is still better then alot of what passes for romantic suspense these days, IMO. If you enjoy Barbara Michaels, Barbara Erskine or Mary Stewart, you should enjoy the books of Kearsley. The only problem is, her books are very difficult to get a hold of in the US, and she hasn't written but 7 or so.I'd love to see a resurgence in this genre of book, which hasn't been popular since the 1970's. Alot of current books claim to be romantic suspense, but usually feature 80% romance and 20% suspense, which isn't really my thing. In addition, I personally want my \\"paranormal\\" suspense to include spooky houses, ghostly sightings, reincarnation or time travel...not vamps- and weres- and zombie-lovers....

It is not my favorite of all she has written. That would have to be 2008The Winter Sea, but it is an enjoyable read nonetheless.The setting is Wales, the small town of Angle, near Pembrokeshire and historic Pembroke Castle. (BTW, do go to this book on the author's website to view photographs of this historic place. They're lovely.) The heroine Lyn is a widow still grieving the loss of her baby 5 years ago. She's a literary agent invited by one of her authors to spend Christmas at the home of another famous British author. She also discovers that a very famous reclusive Welsh playwright lives nearby.Add to the mix Lyn's disturbing dreams, an emotionally-fragile widow Elen, who's fearful for her infant son's life and believes Lyn has been sent to protect him, legends and prophecies with ties to King Arthur, Merlin and dragon kings, and you've got another Kearsley novel with a bit of romance, a bit of the paranormal, and a bit of history. As has been stated by many a reviewer, Kearsley is probably the modern writer closest to Mary Stewart in topic and style of writing and that's a big part of the reason I'm so fond of her work. Reading Kearsley is almost a nostalgic trip down the memory lane of my teen years when I loved Mary Stewart so.As I said before, this is not my favorite of her books but it is quite good. The mystery and paranormal element is the weakest part of the book. I enjoyed it more for the characters and their interactions and for the history of the locale. And now there's that wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Named of the Dragon","review":"In this offering, Susanna Kearsley introduces us to Lyn Ravenshaw, a literary agent who, plagued by a past tragedy involving her deceased child is coerced by her man-hungry client, children's author, Bridget, in spending her Christmas holiday observing Bridget's manhunt in Wales. With her usual flare and ease, Kearsley introduces us to an odd combination of guests/inhabitants in an isolated setting that is reminiscent of that of Mary Stewart's in her novel, &quot;Wildfire at Midnight&quot;. Among the cast of well-drawn characters are the two &quot;hunted&quot; men, James and Gareth, who provide some provocative mind-candy for the female readers and Elen, the fanciful young mother who is certain that her baby is &quot;Named of the Dragon&quot; in the Arthurian sense and claims that Lyn has arrived in role of her baby's protector. Of course, this proves unsettling to poor Lyn who plunging headlong into her own memories of the loss of her own child, must finally face her demons as she unravels the mystery surrounding the threat to Elen's child. The mystical Arthurian themes as well as the reclusive personalities of the more shadowy characters in this story add to the rather misty ambiance and act as an enjoyable foil to Lyn's reemergence into the light of life. Great story with a fantastic setting which I heartily recommend."},{"Title":"Free Stuff for Collectors on the Internet (Free Stuff on the Internet)","review":"FREE STUFF FOR COLLECTORS ON THE INTERNET is the greatest little addition to my book collection! It gives me much better matches than the search engines for whatever I'm seeking. I can't believe how much time it has saved me in the few short months I've had it.

Cakewalk is a collection of short stories that bring together a diverse group of people that only Lee could create. Debbi has left her old life behind and has started a life with Bobby who has a job with dolphins at hte Seaquarium. It is just a matter of time before Debbi and Bobby are able to get things on track. Lauren and her friend georgia Rose and the terible gift Georgia Rose had...the gift of foresight. Florrie, the cake lady who is married to Earl Mingo and their unconventional marriage. Florrie's cakes keep her family together and her home safe. Martha Resnick is writing a letter to Phil Donahue, the only adult she feels she has a constant connection with in her life, at least she can count on him to show up every morning. All these people and many more are like the people you may know and Lee Smith is able to bring each of their stories and many more to the page with humor and a keen ear to the south."},{"Title":"Cakewalk","review":"Almost without exception, I loved every character and every story Lee Smith introduced me to in &quot;Cakewalk&quot;. From Joline Newhouse and her dark secrets, to Georgia Rose and her hidden powers, and to Martha Rasnick and the stranger she kept hidden in her garage, Ms Smith kept me entertained. But for the very reason that I am not a fan of short stories, I felt cheated by the time each story ended. Just as I grew to know each new character and to be baited with each new plot, it was over. In every story, Ms Smith has the groundwork to write an entire book - complete with plots full of potential and a cast of new and diverse characters. I have read several of her novels and look forward to reading those I have not managed to get to yet, but I'm simply not into short stories.If you are a fan of short stories and a fan of fiction set in the Deep South, then I do recommend &quot;Cakewalk&quot;. But if you are like me and like to really settle in for a while with a novel, then try one of Lee Smith's full-length works instead."},{"Title":"Cakewalk","review":"One of the best short stories i have ever read is by Lee Smith (Live Bottomless, in News of the Spirit). So i was really looking forward to this book. I have to admit that short stories are not for everyone. Sometimes, especially if they are too good, you may feel let down when they finish. But the stories in this collection are great. Each one of them, though, would make great preludes to a novel.Lee Smith writes about Southern characters without the common fallback of making them seem lovable hicks. There's many an author (and especially movie writers) who love to portray Southerners as a bunch of illiterate adorable rednecks. This is not the case with her. The stories could be set anywhere, except that there is always an air, a scent of all things Southern, percolating the narratives.Some of the common themes throughout the stories are the ability to see the future, the stigma of being a \\"fast\\" woman, and the curse of being artistic.I'd recommend this collection to anyone!"},{"Title":"Cakewalk","review":"I love short stories and I really love Lee Smith's short stories, especially in Cakewalk. I feel like she is writing about my relatives and my friends. And about me. Every story is a small gem that sparkles on its own. The short story is a vastly underappreciated art form these days, but if more people read Lee Smith's, I'm sure that short stories would make a comeback. I hope she continues to write novels, but not give up on her short stories. They would be sorely missed."},{"Title":"Cakewalk","review":"The stories were good but I think I've been spoiled by Lee Smith's novels.

This is just ONE of them.NT"},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"This book was not what I'd call an in-depth novel, but it offered a cute story to read for the summer. It is a tale told by a young man about his summer job and the people who worked alongside him at a Maine resort in the mid-1960's. I learned a little about the Maine coastal area and its summer tourists, and all the characters were memorable. There was not a huge climax in the story, but it was a nice little read. I could have done without the Maine accents - at times that detracted from what I was reading."},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"It is necessary to place \\"Kitchen Boy\\" by Sandy Phippen into its proper context. Phippen has written a classic great American novel that can be placed next to books such as \\"The Town and the City\\" by Jack Kerouac and \\"Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me\\" by Richard Farina.If readers initially respond to the historical context that this places \\"Kitchen Boy\\" in, and that being the late 1940s to the mid-1960s, then that response is an appropriate one. Phippen replicates the period between 1958 and 1965 with such accuracy in his prose that the tastes and smells from the \\"Kennedy era\\" come alive off each and every page of this fine book.An example being Chapter 41 (of 62 Chapters), in which Phippen writes with memorable alacrity the August morning of 1962 when news of Marilyn Monroe's death filled the consciousness of Americans that sunny summer morning. This particular chapter is also significant for Phippen's portrayal of Mia, one of the co-workers of the book's protangonist, Andy Harrison, the \\"kitchen boy\\" of the summer Manor. The older woman, Mia, instructs the young man, Andy, how to dance, and in doing so, the writing reveals a stunning intimacy: not one illustrating sexuality, per se, but the alchemy of eros, including the ever-so-delicate inflection of the dynamic of feminine psychology and the portrayal of its power and not its \\"machisma.\\"\\"Kitchen Boy\\" is an American classic that Grace Metalious's \\"Peyton Place\\" is not. Not unlike one of Andy Harrion's favorite author's, Thomas Wolfe, the prose of this book evokes a distinct and clarion image of the times which surround the coming of age of American youth during this ear. Also, unlike many books written by a male writer, especially during this period and later, \\"Kitchen Boy\\" is peopled with female characters: both those growing into adulthood and those in charge of their own lives as well as in counseling and informing the lives of others. Phippen is perhaps one of the most celebratory of writers concerning the feminine psyche. Although in keeping to the acccuracy of his vision, the writing in \\"Kitchen Boy\\" does not circumnavigate the dark side of either the era or his characters.Sandy Phippen has written an American classic. If \\"beach reading\\" is what any reader is seeking, then \\"Kitchen Boy\\" certainly fills that requirement, especially in the book's honest portrayal of \\"summer people\\" and the \\"Maniacs\\" who are their servants; however, it is also an addition to the canon of American literature, and the book can be placed among the very best writers of the 20th and 21st centuries.--Wally Swist"},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"I have a signed copy of this (says \\"Have fun with this\\" Sanford Phippen\\" and I did! I picked up at Goodwill for 40 cents and really got quite a hoot out of it. Especially liked the fact that it was set in the 50's and 60's and there was such a certain kind of \\"innocence\\" in that era. Today's books, nothing is sacred and left to the imagination. I only wish that he would go on and tell us what Andy had done after graduating. All the hub bub in the book about Andy's girl watching and at the end of the book you get one line about his new girlfriend. The book was good enough to write more about Andy's life.

Full of interesting people and breathtaking scenery, Kitchen Boy made me realize how much I missed it. A vivid story telling. Would recommend."},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"The thing I liked best about this book is its reflection of the resort experience of the 1950's and 60's, a time when New Yorkers and Bostonians would flee the city in summer to enjoy the slower pace of a Maine manorhouse. The characters who work and visit the resort of \\"The Kitchen Boy\\" may be odd, but they're realistically odd. It would have been easy for the author to exaggerate their quirks, but that did not happen. Unlike a few of the more negative reviewers of this book, I found I did care about Andy. He reminded me of so many of my own friends I knew in my high school and college days--drifting to some degree, not always making the best choices or exercising the best judgment, looking for what fun could be found in a small environment, but ultimately having experiences worth looking back at later. The author could easily have made him a major stud with the ladies, for example, but resisted the temptation, and the character is much better for that restraint."},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"Not a bad read. His depiction of working class folks in Maine seems eerily similar to the people living in Appalachia."},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"As comfortable and cozy as a book on a rainy day, the story endears as it relates life along the Maine coast during the innocent days of the 1950s.

I hurried back to the bookstore to get another book by Mr. Pippen- Cheap Gossip- and was promptly informed by the cashier that he had been her High School English teacher! The book is a very &quot;easy read&quot; with the dryest humor. I had a similar upbringing as young An-dy in the book- working in a hotels and restaurants on Cape Cod, clamming with the parents, eating tons of fish, and waiting on the tourist population. This is surely a book that I will re-read each summer!"},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"After reading reviews of Sanford Phippen's latest in the Boston Globe,I was excited to read his novel about being summer help at theFrenchman's Bay Manor. My mom was a college classmate of Phippen, and knew him thenand we both recently finished this book. As Mum said, it's hard to tell where the truthstops and the fiction starts. The girls at FBM were quite ariot, and the descriptions of the guests a real hoot. As a former Kitchen Girlin the Mount Desert area a generation later, I remember waitingon the same people! Well, maybe not exactly.This book was laugh-out-loud funny in some parts, and in others,too true to be comic.My only disappointment was the ending that just sort of faded out. The first three summers at the Manor are my favorite- Hattiereminds me of many people!It makes me want to go driving around Sorrento and Winter Harbor, looking for evidence of the3R's Remedial School for Rich Boys, and what might be left of the Manor1"},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"I wish I could give 3-1/2 stars; I'm kind of waffling on this one.Parts of the book were quite entertaining, parts were boring, and a couple of things were downright annoying.I appreciated the \\"insider's view\\" of Maine and its permanent and temporary residents. The author's love for Maine comes through very well and I enjoyed those aspects of the book. The characters came across clearly and their individual personalities were generally conveyed well. I absolutely adored Mrs. Richmond. The writing itself was very enjoyable. In the first chapter, I came across \\"Such was the depth of my good servant's complex and lifelong working class training: always fearful of being let go, of being found wanting, of getting a bad reputation, always willing to serve and to do a good job, no matter what, and never questioning my boss to her face.\\" I immediately understood and could relate to that, and I liked how the sentence \\"felt\\" to me.However, I found myself skimming through pages to get to the next \\"good bit.\\" I think the problem is that I just wasn't all that interested in Andy himself. I didn't care much about what his plans were, what he was reading, things like that. I liked him better as a narrator of events than the focus of the story. His stories about his driving test, the stuck car, and his swim date with Caroline are good examples of areas that I bogged down.The ending, to me, seemed like the author had to wrap things up in a hurry for some reason.For some reason, and this may just be a personal quirk on my part, the Maine accent used almost every time a name was used in dialogue (An-Day) drove me nuts. The accent was used in other ways and wasn't off-putting, but the name thing really bugged me. It wasn't completely consistent, either. Andy should have called Hattie \\"Hatt-ay\\" when speaking to her, just as he called Essie \\"Ess-ay,\\" but he didn't.By the same token, the \\"errr...\\" given consistently to one particular character at the beginning of almost every line they spoke was very distracting. I realize the author was attempting to portray this person's mannerism, but from my perspective, it could well have been done without.I went with the 3 stars because halfway through, I realized I was more bored than anything and didn't really care how the book ended. It's difficult for me to set aside a book without completing it, but I did consider doing just that. (I was glad I didn't, though, because Mrs. Richmond popped up again a few times.)"},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"I too was a former student of Mr. Phippen, (high school in Syracuse, NY)- and he was the best - as is this fun and funny book. I have the advantage that I can imagine his voice narrating as I read. I'm looking forward to his next!"},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"This book is a thinking person's hoot! It would be way too easy to pass judgment on the snobbish or eccentric or profoundly-lost guests who come to soak up Maine in a resort hotel. Wisely, Phippen passes judgment on no one: he simply embraces their quirks and admires them with a totally unjaundiced eye And many of the guests' proclivities and personal styles are very amusing. Just as fascinating for a kitchen boy are his employers, who have their own foibles--and who are responsible, summer after summer, for staging a Maine summer that meets the expectations of the guests. Reading this story, you are taken behind the scenes, where you can revel in an extraordinary split vision--of the imagined Maine and the actual Maine. The disconnect between the two is often extreme, and, its effect reaches both the surrealistically funny and the out-and-out sad. I find this book very moving: everyone is pursuing a dream, an entirely reasonable exercise; but the dreams seldom fully coincide. I also greatly admire Phippen's attitude, which seems to be something like \\"Hey, this is the way it is. Let's make the best of it and have some good fun along the way.\\" There is a dark side to fun, just as there is a light side, and KITCHEN BOY captures both--with a highly-engaging style. If you have never been a summer employee at a business dependent on tourists, this book will give you the skinny on just what that was and is like--and you may very well find that, even with its long hours and sometimes aggravating guests and employers, you wish you'd been the help for at least one full roller-coaster of a summer."},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"This was one book that I kept reading mainly because I kept waiting for something to happen, which it didn't. A series of vignettes about summer employment in Maine, I was expecting some revelation to tie it all together, but it never came. The characters were well developed and interesting for the most part, but other than revolving around Andy, the main character, the pieces seemed to have little to do with each other. Couldn't wait to be done this one."},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"The reviews were good and sounded like a great read. Granted, it did start out good .....but......unfortunately, in my judgement, it became tiresome and repetitive. I must admit after reading about 3/4 of thie book, I gave up and put it down. I may have missed a fascinating final fourth of the story but it turned out to be one of those stories that you eventually put down because there are way too many wonderful reads out there waiting to be read."},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"Growing up during the same time frame, no matter what part of the country, one can relate. The book is funny, sad, mixed up, the list goes on. It is written exactly like a late teen to early mans mind worked in the late 50's early 60's. If not raised in that time period you are not able to relate. Excellent work and look forward to reading more."},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"A good read that was a little too long. Either could have been two books or one book of the three summers working at the hotel with a follow up chapter of where life led for the characters. The three summers working at the hotel are well written, interesting and have good character development. We follow An-day as he completes his teen years while working at a summer resort in Maine. We get to work beside him and are introduced to his co-workers and the guests of the resort. Learn how the hotel help survive the owners and guests each year."},{"Title":"Kitchen Boy","review":"I am a native Mainer who is in love with the Maine coast. Unfortunately, I live over 100 miles from it, so I do not get there as often as I would like. Sanford Phippen's _Kitchen Boy_ has been like a trip to the coast every time I've opened it. It's a quasi-autobiographical, coming-of-age story which chronicles several summers in the life of \\"Andy\\", a young man who works in the kitchen of the Frenchman's Bay Manor, a favorite summer vacation spot for out-of-staters looking for a genuine Maine coast experience. Spanning his years from the end of high school through college, young Andy struggles with the personal ups and downs that come with those transformative years, as well as some unique to his job. Along the way, he encounters a fascinating array of people in the guests at the manor as well as his fellow employees there. Set in the early 60s, _Kitchen Boy_ is also an interesting foray into recent history. I was constantly reminded of how much things have changed in Maine in just the last 50 years while reading this book.The author spoke to a group I was a member of back in high school in the late 80s, and at the time, I just didn't \\"get it\\". The group's advisors gushed over Phippen and his work, but I failed to see the appeal at all. At the time I had my sights set on what I thought were bigger and better things beyond high school and the state of Maine. Reading his works now through the eyes of the middle-aged man I have become, I can appreciate how Kitchen Boy and Phippen's other works both entertain the reader and provide authentic look into an often-overlooked aspect of Maine life, that of those who work so very hard behind the scenes to make this the \\"Vacationland\\" enjoyed by so many._Kitchen Boy_ by Sanford Phippen is really a hidden gem. The lively characters Andy meets are painted deftly by Phippen, and the Maine coast setting almost serves as another character, its role is so prominent. Published some years ago and only recently made available in electronic format, I would consider _Kitchen Boy_ required reading for anyone who grew up in the state of Maine, and highly recommend it for anyone who has ever visited Maine or has dreamed of doing so."},{"Title":"Social Text (Special Issue of Social Text, Nos. 1-2)","review":"The editor, Andrew Ross, describes this book as \\"an expanded edition\\" of a special issue of the journal \\"Social Text\\". Potential readers should be warned however that it is also an expurgated edition, from which Alan Sokal's celebrated parody of recent socio-cultural jargon has been suppressed. One understands Professor Ross's chagrin at the cruel and unusual joke that Professor Sokal practised on him. However, the unadvertised deletion of Sokal's contribution is a hoax on the buyers of \\"Science Wars\\" who naturally expect to find in it the one item of the original publication that has received worldwide attention."},{"Title":"Social Text (Special Issue of Social Text, Nos. 1-2)","review":"For those of you so bemused by the exclusion of Sokal's piece, take a look at his website. You can access it easily (ever try google?), and more importantly, you can get the article in which he explains his reasoning for the hoax. After all, the hoax piece is rambling nonsense (like much in Social Text, unfortunately); why would you want to read it anyway? It is his reasoning, which I disagree with, that is most important.As for the rest of the pieces, I think several represent an excellent contribution to the debate, which many may see is trite, but others, I feel, could gain quite a bit. As for \\"Marxist biology,\\" a phrase displaying wondrous ignorance, Levin's \\"Ten Propositions\\" are likely followed by most genuine scientists, thus quite important to read in my opinion. Not necessary to buy the whole book though, just read some Stephen Jay Gould, etc. to get a taste of critical scientific praxis in action :)"},{"Title":"Social Text (Special Issue of Social Text, Nos. 1-2)","review":"Andrew Ross is a charlatan. This book is a collection of vile postmodern rubbish: already dated, though undoubtedly some pretentious/deluded fools will resurrect the folly that was the \\"strong program\\" some day."},{"Title":"Social Text (Special Issue of Social Text, Nos. 1-2)","review":"Imagine a book comprised of 19 contributors (mostly scientists and a few literary scholars) called 'Literature Wars' where the scientists--who have, at best, a cursory understanding of literature from their high school days--debate controversial claims about authors or interpretations about works of literature. What would one think of this collection? Probably not much. So one has to wonder why comparative literature academics, sociologists and rad feminists should be taken seriously when they make pronouncements on science.I won't deal with the editor's excuses as to why Sokal's spoof wasn't published in their special science issue of Social Text or why it is not in the book--which is a reprint of this special issue. (Since science illiteracy seems high among the editors, ironically, they have to take Sokal's word for it that it is a spoof!) After all the apologies and constructionist/relativist diatribes about science, are there any empirical claims or credible arguments in the book worth taking seriously? From the 19 contributors to this volume, three have legitimate science backgrounds; and of those three, two present 'Marxist biology' arguments which I simply consider irrelevant to biology and to science. (Since there is no such thing as Nazi science, likewise for Marxist science.) So from the one biology professor contributor, we get one example from the field of primatology that supposedly supports the feminist claim regarding androcentric bias in science--where a male researcher, supposedly influenced by his patriarchal culture, asks what happens when the alpha male is removed from a monkey troop.This claim is fallacious. One really can't unambiguously causally establish that primatologist 'A' from society 'Y' causes him or her to ask question 'X'. Compiling a society's general characteristics and then trying to argue that individual 'A' is comprised of these attributes that 'causes' him to act or perceive in a certain way is a rather dubious sociological undertaking. There could be a hundred different reasons why the primatologist chose to ask this question.Secondly, what does patriarchy have to do with removing the alpha male from a particular monkey troop? Is it because of the assumption that males dominate and provide order in all primate societies? We don't question why the male researcher sees an alpha male to begin with. Why isn't this also the 'result' of patriarchy? So far, all we have is a rather strained ideologically-biased association; but association is not causation.Thirdly, by providing one example, one data point, to make an argument about human behavior is, in my mind, not statistically significant. Usually, conclusions about human behavior are normally obtained by large statistically representative samples. The author of this essay has completely failed to provide this.Also, if the patriarchal apparatus is, and has been, so dominant and controlling in our culture, how did feminism arise from it then? What about men who advocated equality of the sexes starting with \\"The Equality of the Two Sexes\\" (1673) by Francois Poullain de la Barre and \\"The Subjection of Women\\" (1869) by John Stuart Mill. We could also ask how these 'patriarchal' males could propose something so contrary to the dominant condition of their societies of the time.I think it is a rather trivial claim that what scientific questions get asked and which ones get answered are conditioned by socio-cultural or personal factors. Who would think, for example, that African biologists asking questions about elephants now shows that science is afrocentrially biased? This only shows the possible connection between questions and context: it simply doesn't follow that science is now afrocentrically biased.There are big, basic questions that everyone from every culture asks at one time or another. What is motion? What is gravity? Why do the planets move as they do? What are the planets? What are stars? How does all this stuff around us work? What is the nature of the universe? What is life? How does the human body work? To my mind then, removing an alpha male from a monkey troop seems an obvious question. Is it a 'patriarchal' question? No.Wondering if the stereotypical view that men would be mainly concerned with competition in primate/monkey groups and women concerned with cooperation, I did a quick survey of a web directory containing the International Directory of Primatology (IDP) and the World Directory of Primatologists (WD). Using the word 'competition' in the directories returned 27 entries: 12 women and 8 men researchers; using the word 'cooperation' gave 2 women and 4 men. (I ignored research groups as there was no clear gender designation.)(http://www.primate.wisc.edu/pin/idp/idpsrch.php?scope=idp)So are men looking for competition and women cooperation in primate societies? From this quick survey it seems to indicate no. If anything, it seems to point to a reverse correlation.It therefore seems that the ideologically inspired, hand waving arguments in this supposed Science Wars book really amounts to nothing if they are contrary to relevant facts. And if you include basic scientific illiteracy, it's easy to see how the editors decided to publish Sokal's quantum-hermeneutical nonsense. I would recommend some basic classes in the natural sciences to counter the obvious shoddy scholarship coming from this science studies book."},{"Title":"Social Text (Special Issue of Social Text, Nos. 1-2)","review":"The subsequent reviewer found the current tome missing in scholarship, merely by not having reprinted Sokal's piece from the social text issue of the same name (science wars). If one cared to read through the book, however, one would notice a number of quite specific reasons for this: among these that the book is meant as a counter argument to Sokal, Levitt &amp; Gross's readings of their fave foe: pomos and other dangerous 'leftists' (what does this mean?). It is no secret that these authors are fired by a profound hostility and unwillingness to engage with the material with which they are dealing. This has already been shown ad nauseam in the litterature (see for instance Callon's review in social studies of science). Nevertheless this book stands as a nice response to some of the worst nonsense that has come out of the sokal/gross tradition. Specifically one should not miss Hart's devastating analysis of Gross et al's 'scientific neutrality' and their analytical abilities in Higher Superstition. Other pieces such as Mike Lynch's are good too; some however, are merely perpetuating the current stand off in a nasty 'war' (among these both of Ross's pieces). So is this review, I presume.

Unfortunately, this particular wagon train of pioneers would go down in history due to the horror and tragedy that it was to meet along its way. Stranded in the Sierras amidst its harshest winter in years, with unparalleled snowfall and frigid temperatures, only little more than half, mostly women and children, were to survive their unbelievable deprivation and suffering.This wagon train was a loose confederation of strangers who originally were part of another wagon train, but who collectively branched off by consensus to try a new, though untried and unproven, overland route through the Sierras that was alleged to be shorter. Their decision to take this new route was one that would haunt them for the rest of their journey, as it was not what it was purported to be. The inexperience of these travelers, the poor decisions that were sometimes made, and their seeming inability to truly unify as one entity contributed to their ultimate debacle. They were, after all, representative of humanity at large. Some of them were good, brave, and unselfish. Some were people with whom one would not wish to shake hands.Beleaguered by thirst as they trekked across a desert, marauded by Indians along the way, plagued by the loss of necessary oxen and cattle, beset by accidents and personal squabbles that would sometimes turn deadly, they would finally reach the Sierras and begin their perilous crossing, only to find themselves snowbound at the summit while within sight of the pass that they needed to cross to be home free. Trapped by the weather in early November, they would set up a make-shift camp, never thinking about just how long their encampment would last. With minimal food supplies at their disposal, these intrepid, westward-ho emigrants would find themselves trapped for months, facing incredible hardships that would tax them beyond human endurance. Some would resort to cannibalism in order to survive.This is a riveting story about survival of the fittest, about personal sacrifice, and human foibles. It is a story not only of those ill-fated pioneers but of those who would attempt to rescue them, often at great personal cost. It is a story that reflects the human spirit, both good and bad, in time of crisis. It is a story of often selfless heroism. It is also a story of greed and craven opportunism. While some of the book is politically incorrect, it is reflective of the times in which these pioneers lived, as well as that of when this book was first written.It is, however, remiss that the maps included in this book do little to illustrate the deadly journey undertaken by these pioneers. Still, the lack of comprehensive maps does not unduly detract from the powerful impact that this story has on the reader. Moreover, although the book was published in 1936, the author, a trained historian, added a supplement in 1960, which is included in this edition of his book. This supplement serves to correct errors, as well as incorporate additional relevant material not available at the time of original publication.Those who enjoy tales of survival will, undoubtedly, find this gripping tale well worth reading."},{"Title":"Massage Parlor","review":"I went back online to check after i got the book in because it was the only one at the time with no picture and sounded like the first book. i believe it was my fault in the end but it was the second edition wich is not what i wanted but still a good read!"},{"Title":"CliffsNotes Mythology","review":"When I was in 6th grade I did a project on Greek mythology, and the first and only book I looked in was this mythology book.

Honestly, you could remove any and all of the prepositional qualifiers from that assertion, and I'd still be willing to defend it. Under Western Eyes is a superb novel in every way - in emotional impact, in intelligence, and in narrative art - and it is very specifically a Russian novel as well as a novel about Russia. Anecdotes suggest that Conrad wrote it in response to his reading of Dostoevsky; if so, he exceeded his model in dazzling narrative acrobatics and in intelligence.The central character, Razumov, is the most dislikable anti-hero in all fiction, so it's an amazing feat of empathy by which Conrad brings us to care about his fate. Conrad's genius as a narrator is his ability to place himself and the reader in a realm of detachment, so that every event and every character can be observed from several angles at once. The \\"unreliable narrator\\" is child's play for Conrad. I don't want to spoil any of the prismatic effect of Conrad's narrative structure by telling any more of the tale of Under Western Eyes, but I will mention that the title is not insignificant.The Russia portrayed in this novel is a land of cynicism and naivete intertwined - hyper-emotionalism and psychological repression in equal measure - omnicompetent surveillance and hopeless myopia - ruthless bureaucracy and utter disorganization - a land in short of oxymoronic self-destruction. This is NOT, however, the Russia of Communism! The novel was written in 1911! This is Russia as it existed under the Tsarist autocracy, and everything about it clamors for revolution. It's interesting to compare Conrad's portrayal of the old regime with the nostalgic and idealized version served up by Vladimir Nabokov in his memoir \\"Speak, Memory.\\" Nabokov wrote far more beautiful sentences, but Conrad saw deeper. The horror for us, post-Stalinist readers, in Conrad's depiction of the pre-revolutionary state-of-things is that we KNOW that change will not change much, that autocratic, arbitrary repression will be replaced by...more of the same.Conrad wrote two novels aground, away from the sea - this one and The Secret Agent. They are among his best. Some readers of today seem to find Conrad's style involuted and dry, and blame it on his status as a 'second-language' writer. To my mind, they are missing the point, the complex lensing of perspective through the minds of Conrad's narrative intermediaries. This is a book to be read slowly and observantly; the effort will be rewarded."},{"Title":"Under western eyes. A novel.","review":"Conrad is a real star, I'm rather fond of him. Under Western Eyes is about living in a time of revolutionary urgency, individual fragility in a delicate system, and personal honor.To summarize; Razumov, the 'Hero' is a university student in Russia post 1905 but pre 1917 who keeps to himself and has no real family and no close friends. A fellow student and a revolutionary, Victor Haldin, assasinates a local oppressive Tsarist autocrat. He then takes a chance and takes momentary asylum with Razumov, asking him to help him get out of the city. Razumov is an evolutionary progressive, not a revolutionary. Not willing to risk association with a radical like Haldin and destroy his entire life, Razumov turns him in to the police, and Haldin is subsequently hung.The rest of the novel deals with Razumov's struggle with himself- he betrayed, and he has to live with a lie. Complicating things, he falls in love with Haldin's sister in exile. Raz can't bear it though, and eventually he does the right thing, but things get messy.Thats the general plot, but the real meat of the novel is in the characters and the ideas underlying the conversations between them. The idea of how you justify revolution, the chaos of revolution vs the order of gradual reform, the unwillingness and helplessness of the individual caught in it all. And there's a continual theme of the diference between East and West.Razumov reminds me a bit of Crime and Punishment's Raskolnikov- an isolated university student waxing the time away in a single apartment, brooding over Big Ideas and being slowly crushed by a powerful conscience. The stuff of modernity. Dostoyevsky was a little bit better, so thats why Under Western Eyes only gets 4 stars."},{"Title":"Under western eyes. A novel.","review":"Joseph Conrad is one of the most wonderful writers for me (although there are a couple of his novels that I am yet to come to grips with). Often novels give me cause to reflect on my life and my place in the universe, but this one is so personal to me that I wonder if my recommendation can be meaningful to others. You see, the narrator of Under Western Eyes is an English speaking man, an older man, an observer, who becomes a possessor of secret knowledge which reflects on the things he sees taking place around him - of the one holding the secret, of the ones ignorant of it. But the second most important character is a young woman, Natalie Haldin, living away from Russia with her mother (in Geneva). And by chance I have a work-based friendship with a colleague who happens to be a Russian woman living away from Russia (in Australia). The last chapter telling of the final meeting between Natalie and the narrator - for quite personal reasons (but it is so well written) was an emotional torment for me, my final meeting has yet to occur - I hope!The most important character in the novel (I discount the narrator, as I would myself, although he is of great importance - you may think the greatest) is a young student, Razumov, who betrays Natalie's brother and then is imposed on by the powers to spy on Russian dissidents in Geneva. There he meets Natalie and others who are totally unaware of his role in Natalie's brother's betrayal and subsequent execution. But it is known that he was a fellow student of Natalie's brother so they are drawn to him. Would Natalie and Razumov become romantically allied? Only if the secret is kept?I will not answer these questions. But I will say that Razumov, weak throughout the novel with the same sort of uncertainties that challenge me, turns out to be the most courageous of characters and, in fact, is afforded one tiny morsel of reward.Conrad is a great user of words although he does say very early on that words are the great foes of reality (page 1). The title of this review is a quote. Here are two more):The man who says he has no illusions has at least that one (page 188)There is always something to weigh down the spiritual side in all of us (page 122)While the novel may not have the same personal impact for you as it did for me, it is very engaging and rewarding. Typically for Conrad though, the writing is very dense, and for me at least, needed lots of time and reflection."},{"Title":"Under western eyes. A novel.","review":"It was a relief to find Conrad's Under Western Eyes somewhat less surreal and more concise; yet the complexity and subtlety prove to be no less daunting as the readers are lured into the very same maze in which the main character Razumov finds himself trapped in.As a time when &quot;men were sacrificing their lives for ideas&quot;, 1911 was not meant for moderates who wished to stay neutral between anarchy and hierachy. Razumov, a steadfast philosphy student in St. Petersburg is involuntarily enmeshed in a radical's political intrigue, and to put it in plain &quot;matter-of-fact&quot; tone, he betrays the anarchist. But the brilliancy of Conrad is the way he makes this statement grow by exploring the soft tissue of human interaction in between the hard mechanism of change. Razumov has no choice as the system's teaching induces him to turn in the &quot;criminal&quot; who is dismantling order in society. After the authorities dispatch Razumov to Geneva with a mission, he willingly accepts without realizing he is actually losing his individuality instead of regaining it as he once supposed. To spy on the radical's sister and mother does not lie coherent with his righteous character, yet Razumov's rigid faith in czarist bureacracy and inability to choose for himself lead to more lies. It is still truth however, that redeemds Razumov despite fate's little surprises to keep his betrayal in the shadow. And not unlike fellow St. Petersburg student Raskolnikov from Crime and Punishment, Razumov finds salvation in the betrayed radical's sister's deep love for him. Also like Raskolnikov, Razumov is at last reconciled to his existence through physical suffering.Conrad was by no means denouncing the blossom of revolution, he grazed at the thorns and showed us the many shades of reformation. No idealism remains pure in the real world; in this case, Haldin's kind of pursuit fuses with political murder as his compatriots in Geneva embrace a bureaucratic order. All this is coolly observed by Conrad's Western eyes-an outsider to the struggle and the inner turmoil of Russia to find a balance amongst the blinding clashes of change."},{"Title":"Under western eyes. A novel.","review":"Joseph Conrad had famously hard feelings for the Russians, occupiers of his Polish homeland. In \\"Under Western Eyes\\" (1911), Conrad employs tough love in depicting the Russian character, hopelessly divided between reckless radicalism and reactionary reasonlessness, between devotion and despair.Razumov is a college student in St. Petersberg content to labor under the Czarist system, under which he hopes to advance through study. Fate intervenes in the form of a fellow student, Victor Haldin, fresh from blowing up a secret police chief, who thinks Razumov is the man to aid his escape. Razumov is horrified instead, not at the murderous nature of the act but what it could mean to Razumov's future. Will he turn Haldin in, or try and get him out of the city?The introduction of my Penguin edition notes a popular criticism of \\"Under Western Eyes\\" is that its characters \\"exist only for the sake of the ideas.\\" That's a problem of much of Conrad's fiction, and after the very taut and thrilling first part is over, we are treated to a number of garden-path colloquies in Geneva that slow things down considerably. But the ideas Conrad deals with, about Russia's political and philosophical underpinnings, are often fascinating and certainly to the point, especially considering the novel was written as the real Russia stood ready to implode from the strife depicted here.Conrad tended to view revolutionaries with cynical remove, especially when they employed violence as a means to an end, yet many of the revolutionaries we meet here are a more sympathetic lot than the nihilistic goons of \\"The Secret Agent.\\" \\"You have either to rot or to burn,\\" explains Sophia Antonovna, a genuinely good character who supports the revolution. She's not one to wither quietly while there's injustice to be fought.Razumov might disagree. It's not that he believes in the system, just the futility of fighting it. \\"The exceptional could not prevail against the material contacts which make one day resemble another,\\" he tells himself. \\"Tomorrow would be like yesterday.\\" But as he is pushed into the world of revolution despite himself, he finds himself doubting more and more the shaky pillars of his prior existence.It's not clear to me which point-of-view Conrad held; likely he saw the merits of every ideology depicted here, a relativism that made him doubtful of any one solution. Certainly \\"Under Western Eyes\\" is about as even-handed a book about revolutionary struggle as you might care to read, compelling, deep, and quotable from first page to last. One wishes that Conrad could have sustained the dramatic force of the Part First in the latter three-fourths of the novel, but what you get is one of Conrad's most important books.Those thinking novels about Russians are reflexively depressing and opaque are not going to have their minds changed here, but they will enjoy the chance at seeing one of the world's most complicated nations through the prism of one of literature's most discerning, eloquent minds."},{"Title":"Under western eyes. A novel.","review":"In ways almost all students, and certainly their teachers also, are hard-pressed to explain, one particular work of an author becomes the one \\"assigned,\\" and the others are dismissed, usually unread, as \\"minor,\\" or, at least not necessary to have read in order to say that one has \\"done\\" this author. For example, for Thomas Wolfe, it isLook Homeward, Angeland for Gustave Flaubert, it isMadame Bovary. For Joseph Conrad, it isHeart of Darkness, and it still rankles me that it was adopted as a metaphor for the Vietnam War inApocalypse Now. The better intentioned readers will often say... someday... I'll read another work by that author. And I'm pleased to say that that someday has finally arrived, and I read my second work by Joseph Conrad, one that seemed better and more insightful that the one normally \\"assigned.\\"Conrad was born a Pole, lived for a period in exile in Russia proper, with his parents, and was orphaned at the age of 11. He commenced to \\"seek his fortune\\" in the merchant marines, at the age of 16. Nautical themes are the subject of several of his works. English is his THIRD language, and it is truly humbling to recall that while reading his exquisitely crafted prose, like beautifully polished fine grain wood.\\"Under Western Eyes\\" opens in pre-revolutionary Russia, in the first decade of the 20th Century. The majority of the novel however transpires in Geneva, in the milieu of Russian revolutionaries and poseurs. The narrator, sometimes direct, at other times indirect, is an older English teacher of languages, who is the Western eyes of the title, and believes himself an impartial observer, an \\"inertial reference frame\\" if you will, of the machinations and power struggles of the revolutionaries, primarily, but also of the Russian establishment figures as well. The action commences when a student revolutionary, Victor Haldin, assassinates Mr. de P--, the President of the notorious Repressive Commission. Haldin then turns to a fellow student he does not know well, Razumov, to assist him in his escape. Haldin is betrayed to the quintessential establishment figure, Counsillor Mikulin. However, it appears that despite Razumov's actions, he is \\"tainted,\\" and must seek exile himself in Geneva, where, inter alia, he develops a relationship with Haldin's sister and mother. It is a deeply psychological novel, and much of the action is in the drawing rooms of Geneva, where the revolutionaries pose, and establish pecking orders. Of the several sub-plots and minor characters of interest is Peter Ivanovitch, who supposedly made a spectacular escape from the Far East of Czarist Russia, with the help of a woman, and thence became an ardent \\"feminist,\\" though he sure manages to abuse his housekeeper / stenographer. Another theme in the novel is similar toThe Red Badge of CourageAfter the \\"battle,\\" with Haldin's demise, who really knows what happened, and is it possible for the coward and villain to portray himself as the hero?Conrad was generally considered to be politically conservative, with a strong distain for revolutionary elements, and certainly in this novel many do not come off well. However, Conrad also paints an exceedingly bleak picture of living conditions, and the repressive nature of Russian society, certainly sufficient to motivate revolutionaries. In his notes, as an afterword, Conrad says: \\"The obligation of absolute fairness was imposed on me historically and hereditarily, by the peculiar experience of race and family, in addition to my primary conviction that truth alone is the justification of any fiction...I have never been called before to a greater effort of detachment: detachment from all passions, prejudices and even from personal memories.\\"I firmly believe that Conrad succeed in his stated objective above. The novel is also an excellent \\"spy novel\\" filled with intrigue and duplicity that inspired Graham Greene, W. Somerset Maugham and John Le Carr&eacute;. Prince Peter Kropotkin famously said that the worse things are, the better, since reform is the enemy of revolution. Counsillor Milulin understood this dictum well, and is why he fought the revolutionaries, so that his reformist agenda could succeed.It was a bitter cold February day in Santa Fe, NM when my hiking friend and I sought refuge in an excellent second-hand bookstore. In continued attempts to broaden my literary horizons, Mike bought me this excellent work, with a historical picture of the Pont du Mont Blanc in Geneva on the cover.

A novel.","review":"Though not in Joseph Conrad's top tier, Under Western Eyes is an excellent novel that would be nearly any other writer's best. Moving further from the symbolic sea stories of his early career, it extends the remarkable diversity that Nostromo and The Secret Agent introduced. It is in many ways an extension of the latter but also mixes in elements of classic Russian fiction and other factors to make a truly great work. The novel is many things: a psychological portrait, a sociohistorical look at political unrest, a philosophical take on revolutions, a complex depiction of the Russian character, a dramatization of the conflict between politics/morality and idealism/practicality, a nuanced view of Russia filtered through a Western lens - and by extension a contrast between Eastern and Western sensibilities -, and more. It is essential for fans, and those not fond of more representative Conrad may be pleasantly surprised, especially those interested in Russian, historical, or political fiction.As Conrad's 1920 Preface notes, this 1911 work became in many ways a historical novel in only a few years. It depicts Czarist Russia's death throes, unflinchingly showing its many horrors and atrocities. Conrad always had great sympathy for the poor and downtrodden, and this may be the clearest example; the book's portrayal of poverty and other forms of want is truly eye-opening. That such suffering existed less than a century ago in an ostensibly modern country is enough to breed misanthropy in the staunchest optimist. Conrad leaves no doubt that it was ripe for reform - nay, that drastic change was practically inevitable. Revolution of course came in only six years, instantly changing the book's significance. The writing is very visceral, leaving no doubt that the era was anything but pretty; a focus on various forms of dreariness makes clear that it was in many ways truly wretched. It is particularly valuable as an antidote to those who for decades championed - and still champion - Czarist Russia as a haven of relative tranquility and liberty in the wake of the Soviet Union's admitted oppression.However, this is not a liberal work crying for revolution. Conrad was far too deeply conservative to ever write or even think such a thing - not in today's dumbed-down political catchphrase sense but in a truly pessimistic way. He had little hope for melioration in politics or anything else, tragically convinced that human life will always be pained and striving with the poor and downtrodden forever at succeeding tyrannies' mercy. I have never seen another work with such little faith in revolution or political change of any sort; Conrad's Preface concludes by mocking \\"the strange conviction that a fundamental change of hearts must follow the downfall of any given human institutions,\\" noting, \\"These people are unable to see that all they can effect is merely a change of names.\\" If this sounds dry, however astute, worry not; the dramatization is very engaging and intriguing, making the point clear without failing to entertain and managing to avoid heavy-handedness.Indeed, like nearly all Conrad, the novel can be enjoyed on a very basic level. Like The Secret, it deals heavily in international political intrigue complete with spies, assassinations, etc. It certainly has little resemblance to the superficial spy stories so sadly ubiquitous in recent decades but has more excitement and adventure than most century-old novels. Perhaps more integrally, it is told in an essentially straight-forward, though not linear, way, especially compared to most Conrad; the feeling of being lost and disoriented that turns off so many casuals to much of his work is only slightly present and used with great skill for suspense and dramatic irony. Under is thus one of his most accessible major works and a good place for neophytes to start or for the unconvinced to try again.Many other factors give wide appeal. For instance, Russian fiction's many fans would be very hard-pressed to find a more \\"Russian\\" work by a non-Russian. The novel is often called Conrad's response to Fyodor Dostoevsky, whom he apparently loathed, particularly in regard to Crime and Punishment. There are indeed many similarities between the latter's Raskolnikov and Under's Razumov; Crime fans and Dostoevsky scholars can have a proverbial field day analyzing this and other aspects. More fundamentally, much of the novel is set in Russia and is thoroughly inundated with all things Russian. We not only get a good idea of how early twentieth century Russia looked but more than a glimpse of its culture - everything from manners to speech to politics. Also, in the grand tradition of Russian greats like Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy, Conrad includes a wealth of thought-provoking material - without their famous bulk, doubtless to the great relief of many. The novel is both broadly and specifically philosophical, dramatizing a wide variety of abstract and practical issues in a way that forces us to confront the weighty subjects that many think necessary to great literature. The depiction of feminism, implicitly championed in other Conrad, is especially dubious and thus fascinating. Also like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, and unlike other Conrad, much of this is done via dialogue - another striking instance of Conrad's diversity.Even more fundamentally, Under is a profoundly penetrating study of the Russian character - not only as it then was but in its essence. This is in many ways what the Russian greats were really getting at, and that Conrad was able to approach their greatness is a true testament to his artistry. Rarely has a foreigner had such a clear vision of another country or its people. The thoughts, emotions, and sensibilities at the heart of Russia and its people are given with great verisimilitude and sensitivity. This alone would make the novel worthwhile, especially to the many interested in the subject. Like all Conrad novels to this point, Under was a European commercial failure, but the Preface notes with great satisfaction that it did very well in Russia, which says much about its believability and empathy.The most remarkable thing about the book in this and other regards is complete lack of didacticism. Conrad shows the characters and what they stand for on their own terms sans comment, never even coming close to preachiness or any other authorial intrusion. He simply dramatizes sociopolitical concerns and lets us decide, remaining admirably neutral. This is extremely rare in any sociopolitical work, and the story is better for it; those turned off by didacticism have nothing to fear. However, it is all the more remarkable in that Conrad had every reason to lambaste Russia; a Pole born in the Ukraine, his family suffered under Russian imperialism, crushing his parents and forcing him to leave his native land at seventeen never to return. As one might expect, the struggle to remain dispassionate was agonizing; he had a nervous breakdown lasting several weeks during which, in his wife's words, he lived the scenes and spoke to the characters, apparently in Polish. That none of this shows is truly incredible - an amazing feat of artistry rarely seen or even attempted.Separate from, and perhaps over and above, all this is the deft characterization that will be one of the main features for many. This is not one of Conrad's acknowledged strengths, but Under proves him on par with the best in this important area. There is a notably wide variety of characters, everyone from aristocrats and generals to intellectuals and revolutionists to the poorest of the poor, and all are drawn realistically and compellingly. The most important is of course Razumov, who forms one of Conrad's - and thus one of literature's - most intriguing character studies. He is in some ways the era's representative young Russian; well-educated and intelligent with a social status neither high nor low, he is clear-eyed enough to see the problems around him, but inherited loyalty and self-interest check his liberal impulses. This again recalls characters in the Russian greats' work, as do his more universal qualities. He is in many ways thoroughly dislikable, even despicable - vain, selfish, and indecisive with occasional malice. However, in a true sign of his artistic skill, Conrad somehow manages to make us care about him, even if he is not quite sympathetic. He may be more sinned against than sinning, but more to the point, he is like many intelligent youths throughout history - full of potential but unsure what to do and thus pitiably easy prey. His lack of resolve and true convictions may offend strict moralists, but he is distinctly human; his faults if anything make him more relatable. Some have criticized Conrad for not condemning him, but this misses the point - an essentially ordinary person, he could be almost anyone. Only the very few who have been in comparable situations can say how they would act in his place. Even more essentially, though, Razumov symbolizes many conflicts that numerous youths in politically turbulent eras have experienced: personal vs. public morality, idealism vs. practicality, politics vs. morality, patriotism vs. conscience, etc. His confessions also bring up many important debatable issues. Whatever we think of them generally, the acts have a certain courage that even the revolutionaries cannot deny. These and other aspects make Razumov one of Conrad's most fully realized and important characters.As all this suggests, different as the book is from most Conrad, it carries on his tragic vision. A dark fatalistic streak is particularly notable; Razumov shows how people can be pulled into extremely precarious situations against their will, and they seem unable to escape. Conrad shows little hope of meliorism here or in the larger political sense. Like The Secret, despite being published only shortly into the twentieth century, Under in many ways anticipated much of its darkness. It depicts humanity on despair's verge with little or no reason for optimism; the time and place may be distinct, but these and other factors are sadly universal.Great as the novel is generally, a few minor problems ensure it is below Conrad's best. The primary one is the narrator and the unusual narrative style to which he leads. Many will like this last because of aforementioned strengths and because it is yet another Conrad innovation, but the character himself is somewhat awkward. Conrad's Preface makes a good case for why he had to exist, and he may well be right, but Conrad himself often seems unsure how to use him. His presence is supposed to lend the verisimilitude that can only come from direct observation, but the narrative plan - having him write in the first-person but mostly from Razumov's perspective because he has read his diary - is quite a stretch. Conrad does an ingenious job of eventually explaining how he knows all he tells, but the apparent initial impossibility can be distracting, and his intrusions are particularly so. The author also attempts to explain the latter - in fact quite cleverly -, but the whole premise often seems contrived. Excerpts from Razumov's journal mixed with the narrator's recollections may have worked better. However, the narrator frequently seems out of place even when present, having little or nothing to do with the scene; it is almost as if Conrad forgot he was there or was simply unable to come up with a reason despite thinking him necessary. The ending - not the climax - is also somewhat weak, especially compared to Conrad's usual high standard, coming somewhat arbitrarily and failing to satisfy.Thankfully, though, these are minor limitations and detract little from what is an excellent novel overall. Indeed, it is one of Conrad's most widely appealing works. It comes highly recommended for nearly everyone who likes any type of classic literature."},{"Title":"Under western eyes. A novel.","review":"If you are familiar enough with Conrad's writing you will know he has a few favorite words - like \\"inscrutable\\" and \\"destiny\\". They reflect I believe Conrad's literary outlook. He likes to take characters, give them a haunted past with some shameful secret, emphasize a fatal weakness, introduce some culminating stimulae, and watch the tragic unfold. I think he could have written a brilliant biography of Richard Nixon. But to the point...\\"Under Western Eyes\\" is a quintessentially Conradian book. But unlike many of his other novels - Lord Jim, Nostromo, Victory - \\"Under Western Eyes\\" treats of period politics (namely the revolutionary movement on the rise in Europe) as he weaves his tale of betrayal and tragedy. There are no heroes in this book (save perhaps one) but only a motley collection of victims, fools, and eccentrics. There is not much action, despite its subject matter. I don't want to give away too much. The story unfolds in Moscow and Geneva, not around political machinations but around the tragedy of the central character, a young Russian thrown into the revolutionary movement entirely against his will. In this sense, I think it would be a good companion reading to Henry James' \\"Princess Cassamassima\\", which also revolves around a certain misunderstanding and like \\"Under Western Eyes\\" unfolds its story at the crossroads of the personal and political. The saga of the young man's anger, self-loathing, and attempts to extricate himself from his \\"situation\\" form one salient plot of \\"Under Western Eyes.\\" The ultimate solution to his unsought conundrum also serves to redeem him in his own eyes, if not those of others.\\"Under Western Eyes\\" is also an attempt by Conrad to explore the peculiarities of the \\"Russian character\\". This is another line of development in the work. I put this in partentheses because such notions of racial character are naturally not so well received now as in Conrad's day. Whether you agree or not, Conrad (who himself was Polish) offers some interesting personal insights into the nature of the \\"inscrutable\\" Russian soul - its ability to persevere, its mysticism, its ultimate radicalism. Such issues were particular relevent to the time the book was written (1908), as Russia was then already breaking out in revolutionary violence. The story's narrator - a retired English bachelor - are the \\"Western eyes\\" under which Russia is regarded.I might label \\"Under Western Eyes\\" a comic-tragedy, in that the primary factor behind the story's tragic chain of events is a misunderstanding. It is ultimately for the book's central character a journey of personal redemption. Within the context of this, however, Conrad details some of his views on Russia, its people, and the nature of the revolutionary movement. I did not find it as engaging as some of Conrad's other works but anyone interested in the Russian revolutionary movement, or radical politics of the period in general, or with a bent for stories of betrayal, tragedy, and love should take a look."},{"Title":"Under western eyes. A novel.","review":"Having just finished reading Under Western Eyes, I would like to say that I found it to be one of Conrad's best books. It is beautifully written, not too difficult to read (unlike some of his other works) and raises thought-provoking ideas about revolution and personal integrity. Conrad is one of the greatest English language writers ever and this book is very much worth reading."},{"Title":"Under western eyes. A novel.","review":"Joseph Conrad's Under Western Eyes should be of interest to those with a particular interest in Russia, especially the period of the late 19th century. Others may find the book boring, given that it is largely devoted to dialogue rather than action and trite in that the main conflict is the inner struggle of a man with his conscience. The title refers to the fact that the story is told by an English professor of literature who comes across a diary written by the book's protagonist. The reason Conrad gives for this manner of telling the story is that, in his view, Western readers cannot comprehend the circumstances of life in imperial Russia and can only view them through the eyes of a fellow Westerner. On pages 106 and 107 he has the professor say, \\"for this is a Russian story for Western ears (sic), which, as I have already observed, are not attuned to certain tones of cynicism and cruelty, of moral negation, and even of moral distress already silenced at our end of Europe.\\" I find this statement to be incredibly ethnocentric, and as events later proved, entirely wrong. He adds that Western European countries have already had their revolutions and thus are no longer able to fully understand czarist Russia. We can certainly argue with this viewpoint and in my view this literary device does more to get in the way of the story than to help explain it.In any case, the book begins with the professor saying that he has come across a manuscript written by a Russian student at St. Petersburg University, Kirylo Sidorovitch Razumov. Razumov is impoverished and without family and sees his only chance for success in life as coming from academic success. Accordingly he largely avoids the other students and is intent on his studies. As he is in his room one evening another student, Victor Haldin, comes to see him proclaiming that he has just assassinated a prominent political figure and asks Razumov to help him to escape. Razumov, having no sympathy for Haldin's cause, is reluctant to get involved but finally agrees to go to the lodgings of a sledge driver who has agreed to drive Haldin away to safety. But when he finds the man he is drunk and Razumov cannot arouse him. After beating him in disgust he begins to walk back to his room, pondering what to do next. Fearful that if Haldin stays with him too long he will be implicated as well, Razumov decides to give him up to the authorities. Haldin is then captured and executed.Razumov is still under suspicion and finally receives a summons to go to the office of Councillor Milukin, who, as it turns out, is the head of the bureau in charge of revolutionary investigations. After what appears to Razamov to be a kind of cat-and-mouse game he is given permission to leave. As he puts his hand on the doorknob Milukin asks him where is going to go.At this point part one of the book ends and the scene shifts to Geneva in part two. Here we meet the mother and sister of Haldin. They see him as the hope for their future lives and are devastated when they learn of Haldin's death. The mother goes into a state of shock and stays in her room staring out the window, while the daughter, Nathalie, an idealistic, but nave, young woman, tries to make the best of the situation. Other revolutionaries appear on the scene most notably Peter Ivanovitch, the leader of the group, Madame de S___, whose money is apparently financing their operations and Sophia Antonova, a long time revolutionary.The Haldin women receive a letter stating that a \\"friend\\" of Haldin is coming to Geneva and Nathalie begins to believe that this person will help them. The friend, of course, is Razumov, who has apparently reached an agreement with the government agents to spy on the revolutionaries. Razumov arrives and is accepted as a fellow revolutionary and friend of Haldin. He undergoes a difficult inner struggle trying to maintain this pretense, particularly in the light of the goodness and trust Nathalie shows him. The story then progresses as a struggle by Razumov with his conscience, whether to report on the revolutionaries or to reveal the truth about himself.The book bears some resemblance to Crime and Punishment with its psychological overtones and dialogues about good and evil, right and wrong. Much of parts two and three are devoted to conversations and it is only in the last part that there is dramatic action. I rate it as three stars because it is not as good as the best of Conrad (Lord Jim), nor is it on a level with the really good fiction of Russian writers. I could rate it at 3 and a half or even 4 as well. It can be interesting reading and thought provoking and does end in dramatic fashion."},{"Title":"Under western eyes. A novel.","review":"\\"Autocracy knows no law,\\" is the essential message Conrad send us in this harrowing tale of a young Russian student, Razumov, who finds himself involved in a political assassination in pre-World War I Tsarist Russia.We know his involvement to be purely accidental without complicity, but he is unable to prove that and the authorities, though accepting his account, leave him under a cloud. Unable to free himself of suspicion, Razumov leaves Russia for western Europe.In Switzerland, Razumov finds himself involved with other Russians, revolutionary plotters intent on overthrowing the Tsar. The events surrounding our protagonist's time in Switzerland are woven in Conrad's usual masterful way. Razumov finds love with a sympatico woman, a fellow exile, but ultimately nothing comes of it.I would be tempted to label Razumov a sociopath, given his described thoughts about others he encounters. He is a loner described as having no family or close friends, and seems driven by ambitions unrelated to the involvement of anyone outside himself. Fellow students he knows are seen by him as no more than nodding acquaintances. It is true that Conrad never suggests Razumov suffers from some emotional incapacity, but the evidence is certainly there.With respect to Conrad's theme about the autocratic state, we have been told that the totalitarian state is worse than one that is merely a dictatorship. Both would appear to be lawless, qualifying under Conrad's definition as autocracies. Insofar as neither would recognize any limit on the power of those in power, the foregoing distinction becomes one possessed of no substance.Today's Russia appears to differ from the Tsarist one in that some law appears even as limit on the power of the national leaders.[...]Does that leave today's Russia the same as the Tsarist one? Probably not: some power-limiting law seems to exist in the current Russian state."},{"Title":"Under western eyes. A novel.","review":"I picked this book thinking it was a Western about the Old West.

A novel.","review":"This book presents the problem that many Russians faced during the time of the Czars: to revolt or to meekly accept the harsh realites of autocracy. The principal character Razumov is a quiet philosophy student who gets caught up with the anarchist Haldin. Instead of helping Haldin Razumov goes to the authorities and betrays him.This leads to further complications. Razumov has been appointed as if by fate to become a tool of the autocracy; he has no choice really. He is sent on a mission to Geneva in order to spy on Russian emigres living there.Haldin's mother and sister are living there waiting for word from him. The emigres are grotesque. Eventually Razumov confesses that he is helping the government and is almost beaten to death. In the end Razumov returns to Russia where he is cared for by a servant woman. Conrad suggests, as he does in most of his writings, that our fate is something beyond us and his skill is in showing how that is so"},{"Title":"Under western eyes. A novel.","review":"This is a Russian story for Western ears, says the narrator, an Englishman who teaches languages in Geneva at the beginning of the 20th century.A Russian student in St.Petersburg is faced with a dilemma that must have been experienced in similar form by many others in many times and countries, and by many more in their imagination. What would I do, if...Say, you were a German student with vaguely leftwing orientation in the early 70s, and Ulrike Meinhof had just gone underground, and by some strange combination of coincidences she turns up in your flat and asks for temporary shelter and some minor help in an escape plan.This is the situation that Conrad puts his hero Razumov in. Not with Meinhof, silly, but with a freshly successful assassin of a high Russian politician; the 2 students knew each other barely.From here, Conrad develops a compelling story of betrayal and espionage and political revolution, starting in St.Petersburg, then moving to Geneva. Like in real life, one might say. Switzerland becomes the playground for the Russian revolutionaries in exile and for their hunters. The title of the story means exactly that: Russian fights fought in the West for \`them' to watch and wonder over.(This book is another case of oddly misinforming book descriptions, here on an otherwise blameless Penguin: the back cover says that the book explores the conflict between East and West. What nonsense. The book explores no such thing.)Conrad was far from sympathizing with \`the Russians', but he seems to have known them quite well. His Razumov (the word means \`reason' or \`mind', says the writer of the notes) is a variation on Razkolnikov. Conrad disliked Dostoyevsky, who was \`too Russian' for him, but he was rather obviously writing \`against' him here. Razumov's guilt is his betrayal of the assassin, and his atonement/punishment comes in hard struggles between reason/self preservation and emotion.The novel has a rather simple structure, for a major Conrad novel.The narrator came into possession of Razumov's diaries; he paraphrases and summarizes them for us. (Why not stick to the fiction and let us read the \`original' diary, as Nabokov might have done? - I thought of Nabokov here because VN, like JC, disliked Dostoyevsky; it may be an interesting subject to compare the differences of the dislikes of JC and VN.)Part 1 is the story in St.Pete, by the diaries. Then we follow the narrator's personal experience in Geneva. Protagonists in the story have not read part 1, of course... This gives the narration a Hitchcockian flavor. We know more than the people in the story, and that drives suspense.JC did not have the benefit of the Bolshevik revolution hindsight, that's why some of the politics are oddly off target. It could hardly be otherwise in 1910.The novel has more women than most other Conrad books. This about the main female character: at the educational institutions, she was looked upon unfavorably. She was suspected of holding independent opinions.Quite possibly, JC wrote women into this book as a defense mechanism. He had been attacked from that angle.In the life work of Conrad, this novel is in a surprising position. He wrote it before he reached his prominent and profitable phase. It is not necessarily a shocking departure in terms of methods, but it is for sure a pure thriller: a precursor of Graham Greene and John Le Carre, and their next generation. There is nothing of the complexity and complication of Nostromo in this novel. Even the Secret Agent is much more complex.I do not hesitate to include this in my short list of best Conrads."},{"Title":"Under western eyes.

It has all the soul searching and emoting that you expect from Russian works. Self destruction is a main theme.It also has some uniquely Conrad touches. The destruction of the main character's eardrums by Nikita's violent slapping is a typical Conrad detail. The reconciliation of the traitor and the rebels also has his touch.A rather dark and heavy read, but worthwhile if you enjoyed Heart of Darkness."},{"Title":"Under western eyes. A novel.","review":"An English teacher (the 'Western Eyes') tries to find the truth behind the autobiography of a Russian agent, for 'words are the greatest foes of reality', and 'speech has been given for the purpose of concealing our thought.'The Russian agent betrayed a friend-terrorist and meets afterwards his sister and mother. His friend combatted autocratic despotism, the destroyer of the spirit of progress and truth, of freedom, law and justice.This novel is Conrad's version of Dostoevsky's 'Crime and Punishment': 'A moral spectre is infinitely more effective than any visible apparition of death.'Conrad was a visionary: 'A violent revolution falls into the hands of narrow minded fanatics and tyrannical hypocrites. The scrupulous and the just, the noble, humane and devoted natures, the unselfish and the intelligent may begin a movement but it passes away from them.'His picture of the world of revolutionary conspirators is excellent: double agents, opportunists, naive idealists, hypocrites, rogues, agitators, fanatics and cynics. 'It did not matter what it was, vanity, despair, love, hate, greed, intelligent pride, a stupid conceit, it was all one to him as long as the man could be made to serve.'But this book has many flaws: melodramatic overreactions (attack on Ziemianitch, secret love of Razumov), high improbabilities (confession of Razumov, interventions of 'Western Eyes') or the ultimate verdict ('he was the victim of an outrage. He had confessed voluntarily.')Joseph Conrad was an ambitious writer, but this book has not the same high standard as his masterpieces 'Heart of Darkness' and 'Lord Jim'.A worth-while read."},{"Title":"Under western eyes. A novel.","review":"You have to be around my age (i.e., older than dirt) to remember Barry Goldwater, a right-wing Republican from Arizona who wrote a book with the above title and spectacularly lost to Lyndon Johnson in the presidential race of '64. I invoke his long-dead phrase because, without the irony, it could be UWE's subtitle. Conrad actively hated leftists and self-proclaimed \\"revolutionaries,\\" and this disgust shines through all of his best work, from the sniveling proto-unionist Donkin in \\"...Narcissus\\" through the bestial \\"generals\\" of \\"Nostromo\\" and, needless to say, the uber-hypocrite Kurtz. Razumov's moment of conservative illumination, in the snow on the night Haldin destroys his life, can be read as serious, humorous, or anywhere in between--but it is genuine. That fragment he pins to his wall (and which Councilor Mikulin finds so fascinating) sums up with Conradian depth and precision today's popular doctrine of personal responsibility. Peter Ivanovich, one of the slimiest characters on record (not to mention his \\"Egeria\\") could easily send major liberals over the wall. Naturally, all readers are free to interpret political novels as they see fit, but Conrad's biographers have documented his rightward tilt. UWE is wonderful proof that genius does not play politics.

He consistantly assists you moving from the classical to the quantum world, reminding you where you once were, and where you are now headed. I do wish he had more exercises and problems at the end of chapters, but overall this is a fantantisc textbook for those who grind their teeth hearing the phrase \\"quantum chemistry.\\" As the author presents subjects such as approximations to Schrodinger's equation or Hunds rules, he reminds us of where we used to be in chemistry, and now where we are headed. The challending nature of a topic such as this usually brings about headaches, and reviews of old books we discarded in other classes. But not this one. Dr. Pilar guides us through with ease, and makes Q chem quite the enjoyable subject matter or material it should be, instead of the nightmare it can be. The chapter on molecular structure is particularly well written for such a terribly complex subject although the ending with Raman spectroscopy of diatomic molecules is a little short. Overall this book is worth every penny you spend. Read it first, then the text your instructor is using. That will assist you alot as you progress.

Author Eubanks has caught the essence of \\"what right at the wrong time or what's wrong at the right time\\" which accounts for much of the humor. She seems to be saying that God has given us the ability to laugh at ourselves, for when He created us He created humor as a sunny companion.

All homebuilts designed and flown in the UK must be flight tested. Stinton flew a great many of these aircraft. Some were fantastic designs. Others were not. it is this eclectic flight experience that sets him apart from other authors. I've read his design book and I own this book. I would say about 40% or more of the material is common between them. Both give a good understanding of how to look critically at a design. (a necessity when you've been hired to fly an aircraft that has absolutely no engineering analysis backing up the design) The design book is a bit better for light aircraft designers.

As in Lord of the Flies, I think we all have an evil nature that has been a part of us from the day we were born, and the strength and character of a person is what tells us whether or not it will ever be revealed. Lord of the Flies shows us that no matter whether you are young or old, you can succumb to the evil that is tempting you. This is shown because the only reason the boys were on the island was becasuse of the war going on where they lived. I believe that we all need to take to heart the mesage presented by William Golding. A good example of human's evil nature in today's society is the recent school shooting out in Littleton, Colorado. Nobody will know exactly what set these boys off, but whatever it was, they didn't have the strength to overcome it. This was exactly the case with Jack and his need to kill. We all need to take responsiblity to make certain our fighting isn't the cause of children turning into savages, and we need to take responsibility in raising our children to be strong enough to overcome the temptation of evil.

In the book, Jack and the hunters become savages, obsessed with killing pigs. They even killed two of their own people. The gunmen in Colorado did pretty much the same thing. Society turned on them and they turned on society. Society is a cruel world and this book proves it.Not only did I like the book because it pertains to society and &quot;reality&quot; in many ways, it became very fascinating toward the end. Jack and the hunter's killed Simon because they weren't in &quot;reality&quot;. They were focusing more on killing the pigs and the &quot;beast&quot; that they didn't realize what they were doing. Don't get me wrong, I don't think that it was great that they killed Simon, but it shows the affect the environment has on people. There's so many ways you can relate this book to society.

He is the parent figure to the boys. He is the boy who is wise beyond his years. He is the only boy who wears clothing. The other boys hair gets longer, but Piggy's does not.

Both groups have their own ways of surviving, but both all that the boys are trying to do really is survive.The setting of, \\"Lord of the Flies\\", helps to create a world where boys run free and do their own thing to survive without any adults. In the beginning of the book when the boys wake up on the island they realize that they are all alone. They try to make a structured society to live in, being brought up in British schools all their lived, they know what is right and wrong. After a short time some of the boys begin to rebel against their new way of life, and they venture further from the safety of the beach. As time goes by the boys who stay on the beach at the original camp lead more structured lives, while the other boys turn to a more primitive way of life. Having the boys on a deserted island helps to show how their basic human nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the flies is a great book which shows the defects of human beings in an exciting and touching way."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I don't think that this book is as good as it is made out to be. I think that the idea, or theme of the book was well thought out, but I don't really think that is was well written. Golding had a good theme to his book, about how we still have wild instincts that are just covered up by civilization until we feel the struggle to survive or the threat to our own life. Golding book was, in my thought, not well written. It was overly descriptive at some points, to the point where it lost your interest. After finishing the book, it was easier to understand, thinking through the whole story without being held back by Golding's descriptive periods. I did not enjoy this book, though projects used to review the book in the classroom were fun and interesting."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is about boys who are in a plane crash and get stuck on an island. Its a story about Ralph tring to keep the boys together as one tribe but Jack pulling away. Jack and the hunters become savages. Their main focus is hunting. Ralph has trouble with this because he needs help with other things. Their disagreements lead to a lot of fighting and deaths. I didf not enjoy the book I found it very gruesome and there was to much savageness. Although the storyline was enjoyable there are very many areas that just made me put the book down and never want to pick it back up."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a very interesting look at human nature. The pacing of the book makes its tense moments all that much more scary and disturbing.I think, however, that teachers should stop assigning this book to their students. All that happens is that Amazon gets flooded with reviews about how boring it is, which is probably the worst criticism you can make about a book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the book, Lord of the Flies, a group of pre-teen military boys become stranded on a deserted island. When they finally come together as a group, they choose a leader of the group which leads to a huge disagrement between two of the boys. During their time on the island, the boys are faced with, death, hunger, other creatures on the island, and whether they can get off the island without death being the only way out."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies was one of the best books I have ever read. Not only did it have one of the best story lines a book could have; it also delivered a very important message pertaining to rules and anarchy. The book was about a group of young boys who's plane crashed on an island. There are no adult survivors and the kids are left to fend for themselves. Some of the boys that are on the island are Ralph, Jack, Piggy, and Simon. Ralph is kind of the leader of the boys in the beginning. He is later left alone with piggy, a rotund boy whose glasses play a very important role in the book. Jack is one of the meanest boys on the island. He is the leader of the choirboys, which later become the hunters. He is the one who later takes control of the group and moves them to the other side of the island and attacks Jack and Piggy. Simon is the one who discovers the Lord of the Flies. He also represents pureness among the boys. The book is about how a world without rules would only result in chaos and anarchy. At first the boys still acted civilized and respectful, but when the boys slowly broke away from the rules, their world descended into a world of madness. There are a lot of twists and turns in this book. You will never know what will happen next. I would recommend this book to anybody that wants to dive into a world without rules. It is a good source to show all of us just how important rules can be to us and that in order to maintain civilization; we must uphold these rules. This is a definite must read for all ages."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's first novel has rightly been regarded as a classic of modern literature since it was first published in 1954, in fact many consider this to be one of the finest novels of the last century if not ever. While it's certainly true that the greatest literature has a timelessness that lends itself to reinterpretation by subsequent generations, is this story of a group of boys who as Stephen King put it &quot;just went a little too far&quot; really in that category? In my opinion, absolutely.Set sometime in the near future during an unspecified world war, the story concerns the fate of a collection of boys stranded on a tropical island paradise after the plane evacuating them from the war zone crashes. All adults are dead and there is no way to make contact with the outside world. In short the boys are thrown back on to their own resources and forced to re-create the society that they knew. At first things go well &quot;after all we're not savages&quot;, but as tensions tear the group apart and fear and superstition reshape the boys world, we are confronted with the stark reality of just how fragile the structures of our own society which we have come to think of as indomitable actually are.Many feel that Golding was too pessimistic in his assessment that man is inherently bound to society and without day to day constraints imposed on us by the culture we live in we would more likely than not revert to nothing more than &quot;painted savages&quot;. But I feel that the power of the book derives from its fundamental truth, the darkness that dwells in the pit of the human heart is at times all to hideously evident and that's what makes \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" so brilliant and so frightening."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Having not been assigned to read this powerful and provocative work in high school or college, I decided to see what all the fuss was about, so to speak. Although short and compact in size, Lord of the Flies proves to be anything but that in breadth and depth. Nothing short of incredible, Golding's novella examines human nature and its internal and external variables that wield it into shape. An allegory no less, the pages of Lord of the Flies nonetheless come alive as they provocatively bring the reader into a paradoxical world of bestial Darwinian survival of the fittest versus rational deductional logic and care for one's fellow man.Unlike The Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies asserts that human nature is inherently evil - not corrupted by external forces, but rather an intrinsic trait to be overcome. Our innocence is not lost by some terrible experience, because conversely we have never had it. While evil exists in all of us, Golding says, we must conquer it and make a decision based on logic and sound reasoning to consciously reject it, and, in turn, not revert to barbarous savagery. We, as individuals, must cognizantly and wisely choose the righteous, yet discerning path of Ralph, as opposed to the malevolent and malicious evil one of Jack, or for that matter, the indecisive and naive path of hapless Piggy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I cannot even use words to explain the sheer beauty of Golding's writing. The novel is about british boys whose plne crashed on a deserted island, but they are devoid of any adults. They begin to live life on their own and their true animal instinct divulges from the depths of their souls.I read this book for my ninth grade English class. I usually do not enjoys books in class as much as I do books I read on my own, simply because I did not chose them and I fell as though I am being forced to read them. The Lord of the Flies is more fascinating than any book I could ever pick for myself. The words are strong enough to lift a house. My eyes were stuck to every words Golding described with such thouroughness. The words are more thick with detail than one's eyes could every see. Every word is important and expresses a new meaning to the nature of man kind. I am daring you to take a chance by reading this book, even if it is not forced upon you. You may have a completely different view on the genuine nature of yourself."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book in eighth grade - alright, it was about two years ago - and I still read it occasionally. I mean, it's no quick read and definitely something that needs analyzation (just ask my English teacher), but it *is* one of those books that you have to read more than once to a) understand it, and b) to truly enjoy it.LOTF (not to be confused with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings) deals with British schoolboys supposedly during World War II, although it can be deciphered for different times. These schoolboys have grown up on London and life that is perfectly serene, so when they find themselves on a deserted island - with no grownups, what a great life! - they think this is something new to them and has to be explored.But as time goes on, things aren't as pretty as the island sets out to be. Things get ugly, and intrusive and bloody. (One scene is not for the squeamish!) Things are not as easy as they seem, but unlike life back home, there are no grownups to turn to and have them put things right. There is only control in the one boy who has it, and there is no turning back.LOTF is a good read, it really is. Just be sure, if you read it in English class, to get ready to analyze it. You'll have to, with this chilling, thrilling book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read Lord of the Flies one time for school. When I first started reading it, I didn't like it that much, but I thought it wasn't too bad. Some parts were really interesting, but some were boring. I thought it really started to get my attention towards the end when a lot of interesting things started to happen, but I didn't really like the first half. If you didn't have to read this when you were in school, I would recommend giving it a try. But I suggest to read it all the way through to get the full enjoyment of it though."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Far more than a story of some kids on an island...really a tale of basic human savagery. The decent from civility to savagery is stunning; indeed, the boys on the island, in seeing the human spirit for what it really is, no longer look upon the world with the typical wide-eyed innocence of youth. In fact, they weep for the world at the story's end. In short, a hugely complex and important work- a must for all."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the flies helps you understand almost everything about humans and human nature.

It's a classic--the final sequences in Cry of the Hunters are absolutely terrifying, and the tragic and heart-felt disintigration of the boys' society which precede it wonderfully scripted. The description of the island's geographical environment is sometimes a bit hard to picture, but that doesn't detract from this being one of the most intelligent, thought-provoking and downright scary novels I've ever read. The ambivalent ending is even more effective when considered along with Stephen King's question in &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;: who will save the grownups?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It is strange that my facorite book was one that I had to read for English.

So as anyone would know, being hyperactive, book reading is not a favorite thing. But when I really started to understand the book I became quite intrigued.

Ralph tries to put responsibility in the gang of boys, so they don't just eat, play, and swim all day. Piggy is Ralph's advisor. He is a little chubby, and his \\"specs\\" come in handy to light fires as signals to passing ships. Jack is the leader of a group of face painted hunters. He becomes a large nuisance to Ralph's idea of order and responsibility. Jack lures many of the boys to hunt with him.

In magnificently eloquent prose and a deeply engrossing story to boot, Lord of the Flies has deservedly been dubbed a modern classic. One can relate to the actions of the characters simply because we were all once of that age and were all once driven by the same urges, impulses, and emotions that Golding so graphically and yet so effectively illustrates. An essential read there can be no doubt......"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"You can find in this book all about human nature, everything about the good and the evil. You can also take it like a book of history, and learn of it esential things for life."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I believe that it is the very stule with which Golding writes that captures the reader's attention. The book has a very curious nature which draws the reader inside of the characters' heads, forcing them to feel the boys' pain, suffiering, joy and fear. Each chapter is open-ended and seemingly meaningless until the final chapters pull the whole story together with a gripping climax and astounding finish. I reccommend this book to anyone who is a patient reader and like spooky, mysterious, chilling stories."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After reading Lord of the Flies, I was very disturbed at what had happen to the young kids on the island. They went through so much physically and mentally. I liked the fact that Golding used children as the strugglers and survivors. It just shows how so many things in the outside world can influence a young person's mind. I was especially attracted to Ralph who wanted to set order and maintain hope of being rescued. At the end he was able to realize that what he wanted could never happen because of what was lost in each child on the island, innocence."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Contrary to what many school systems believe, this is not a book for children. Although it may be simple to read, it is complex, difficult, and harrowing to understand. From a language standpoint, it is rich in symbolism and imagery, but more importantly, from a literary standpoint, it is a poignant story of the world's problems and the natural instincts of man. There are many Biblical allusions in the novel, but there are also an abundance of allusions to real-world, relevant problems."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding was an excellent book that can be read on multiple levels--literal, symbolical, and political. This novel really made one think about events and people in this world. For instance, Piggy and Raplph are symbolic representations of abstract things in life. After reading Catcher in the Rye, this book was very good. This book offers much to the reader and to a twentieth century world where genocide and world wide destruction is possible. Excellent read for anyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is my favorite book yet (and by the way, I've read quite a few.) Not only is the symbolism masterful, but the book is thoroughly interesting and captivating as well. I am shocked at some of the criticisms of this work of such epic proportions. I honestly can't figure how anyone could find fault with it. I understand that it's not the most enjoyable of experiences to &quot;read books for school,&quot; but this one is not one of the &quot;boring&quot; kind. The book is beautifully written and Golding's use of metaphor, allegory, and personification is consummate. Golding pulls all he can into this book, details from all walks of life. The book is incredible, as there is a vibrantly suspenseful surface story with ingenious characters and plot, as well as richly deep undertones of life and the depths of human heart and consciousness. All you have to do is read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Hey, reader from St. Louis: I don't think so. Yeah, forget Lord of the Flies -- just read Into Thin Air! Are you kidding? This is one of the greatest works of the 20th century. While you are at it, why not read some Danielle Steele -- it's better than this Golding garbage!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I would have absolutely loved this book, had it not been for the simple fact that it is so slow moving. It doesn't even start gettingcool until the last three or four chapters of the book (or more specificly, where the kids break up into two groups). I also have to say, that the characters are kind of flat (with the exception of Piggy, who is probably the best one in the story). I liked the concept behind the story a lot, but not much of its characters. I think that if I was ever asked to recommend a book that told a good story of a group of people &quot;free&quot; from a totalitarian rule (in this case, the rule of grown ups), then I would be more tempted to recommend &quot;Animal Farm&quot; then &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, although I might have to think twice."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am a pre-service teacher required to write up lesson and unit plans by the bucket.

Maybe I am just saying that because I had to read it for school, but this book doesn't make any sense. I see no point in this story whatsoever.

This is not one of those books that you can't put down; moreover, it is one that you can't pick up. The plot is very hard to follow and in the end none of the main points seem to all tie up in some main ending. Maybe the point of the author was to leave you hanging, but I don't know. Oh well, don't waste your time with this one and try either OF MICE AND MEN or INTO THIN AIR."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a great text and easy reading for those students who can abide the graphic nature of the setting.

You feel it or you don't, not saying that those who don't feel it are not intelligent. I read reviews and saw people complain about the beginning being boring. I think Golding meant it to be this way, so you begin to think yeah so there's a group of boys stuck on an island, so what? But Golding then draws you in, and dipics the change from civilization back to savageness. This book has so many meanings that many people overlook. The first time I read this I was terrified, because I asked myself what is stoping this from happening right now. I have heard critics say that they think this may even be Goldings preminition of apocalypse.

All this is justthe begining. The novel is realy about how evil emerges, evenfrom inocence. Golding was writing about the World at War andthe break-down of society. This book is perhaps one of themost important books of the century. Wiliam Golding wonthe Nobel prize because of this book. It is a treasure."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book in 9th grade. I am 26 years old now and still think about the morality and symbolism of human nature I discovered in &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. I decided to write this review all these years later after watching the first installment of the TV show &quot;Survivior&quot;. I saw a lot of similarities. In &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; we are given a sort of scenario...what if a group of young adolescent boys were left abandoned on a deserted island. This is what happens...and as I describe some of the scenes from the book, compare them to that of a real life TV show a lot of us watch. Maybe like me, you'll see a more animal, evil side to these &quot;real-life&quot; strategy survival shows. On this deserted island a natural leader is born, Ralph. He is kind, and understanding of the fears his fellow students face. He accepts responsibility and delegates &quot;chores&quot; for the other boys to do. They must tend a rescue fire. They must hunt for food. They must tend to the wounded pilot. Ralph chooses the path a responsible adult might. Soon some of the boys become lazy. They do not follow Ralph's rules. These unruly boys are headed by another natural leader. The more &quot;wild&quot; and fun-seeking Jack. Jack and Ralph argue. To maintain control the boys find a large shell ....the conch....and whoever holds it has the right to speak. This attempt at order works for a little while but soon Jack dismisses the control the conch holds. He and his pig-hunting, lazy friends split from the original group and leave to another part of the island. They want to &quot;do their own thing&quot;. They defy rules and organization which Ralph feels is the key to survival. Meanwhiile Ralph and his friend Piggy struggle to keep their small group in order. It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain adult responsibility. For the youngest who fear Jack and his clan, Ralph becomes almost their savior, their security on an island of unknown. Soon Ralph's pack decides they too are tired of rules, and one by one leave to join Jack's ideas of senseless fun. Jack represents abandonment of control, living purely through pleasures. This is where you can form a million metaphors between the two clans of boys. Jack and his bandits become so wild and animal-like near the &quot;end&quot; that they actually start hunting Ralph in the manner of a real pig-hunt. They have forgotten society, basic humanity, and most of all..they have forgotten they were once all friends. This kind of behavior echoed alot of the back-stabbing things I see on TV and in the government, religion, everywhere in real life. Read this book and never let yourself abandon what you truly beleive to be good in your heart...Let us compare this book of instinct and leaders and followers to our own lives....On a personal note....Jack always kind of reminded me of Adolph Hitler and his control over his followers during the war. I would love to hear some other thoughts via e-mail. If you are reading this book for school, like I did once, really try to think about some real-life comparisons you find between the pages of Golding's work of art."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I also read this book in high school and saw the movie afterwards.

At first the overview that my teacher gave me, it sounded like it was a real interesting book, however once I got reading the book, I found that it was at all as interesting as it had sounded.Here is a little overview of the book; a group of British schoolboys survive a plane crash and end up on a desert island with no adults to watch over them. They soon create rules about how to run the group and who should be leader. They divide tasks among themselves and even use a conch shell to determine who has the right to speak to the group at large gatherings. They soon create their own society based on the values they have been taught. They manage to collect enough food and even to keep a fire going in the hope of being able to attract attention from would-be rescuers. Later on in the book, the order in their society starts to break down, as their situation becomes more desperate and as alliances between different subgroups start to build. The group begins to turn on each other; a war begins between two divided groups with two completely different leaders. Some boys begin to kill off the other boys in the divided groups. The officer's ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure.The main characters of the book are,Ralph - The novel's protagonistJack - The novel's antagonistSimonPiggyRogerSam and EricThe Lord of the FliesI really did not like this book, when I was reading it; it seemed to be drawn out. Everything just to long to explain. At first it sounded like an interesting book, however when I got into reading it was not at all. It is just one of those books that I can not read with out falling asleep. It just didn't catch my attention form the beginning. There was nothing that interested me in the book at all. I found in many parts of the story, wondering what I had just read, I would have to reread that section over again, before I could understand what had happened. There were many sections of the book that I found myself confused. The scene of the book jumped from place to place making it hard to follow. Overall I just did not like the book at all, it just did not answer me from the beginning."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Kevin BradyLord of the Flies is a very enlightening book. It shows that with to much power people go crazy and do things so out of the ordinary. I enjoyed the book. Being a person who does not like to read, and is very picky about the books that I do read, this was a very good one.Due to the violence of a raging war, an airplane carrying a groups of English students is shot down. The boys of the plane find themselves to be stranded on an island. After they gather all of the boys on the island they start to make plans. Two of the oldest boys Ralph and Piggy find a conch shell, they decided to use it in order to summon the rest of the group. They Ralph as their leader, Ralph appoints another older boy Jack to be in charge of the choirboys who are in charge of hunting and getting food.The older boys set out and explore the island. They decide that they will light large torches to get the attention of passing ships. They gather wood easily, there is more than enough wood to have several fires. They use the glasses of piggy to focus the sunlight onto the wood and create fire. The problem is the boys were more focused on playing rather than monitoring the fire. The fire quickly gets out of control and burns a bunch of dead wood. The youngest of the boys disappears and they presume that he burned to death in the fire. The boys are very immature. They enjoy the loss of no adults and spend most of their time splashing and playing in the water. Ralph complains that nothing is getting done. They also fail in catching a pig, Jack the leader becomes more intent on catching a pig.An approaching ship passes by, but does not realize anyone is on the island because the rescue fire was out. Ralph rushes to the fire immediately only to find that Jack and the rest of the hunter's have caught their first pig. They gather around a fire and reenact the hunt. Ralph quickly blows the conch shell to call a meeting to restore order. At one of the meeting one of the \\"littluns\\" tells that he is haunted by the thought of a monster on the island. The older boys gather and tell each other to think logically and figure out where this monster would hide during the daytime. They come to some conclusion that he might live in the water.The boys that are responsible for watching the fire at night think they see a shadow of the beast, when they actually just saw the shadow of a dead parachutist, they rush back to the camp and tell everyone that they saw the beast. They organize a hunting party and go up the mountain, they see the shadow of the parachutist and run down the mountain. Jack criticizes Ralph of being a coward and says that he should be removed from power. The boys agree that they will never vote Ralph out of power. Jack runs down to the beach and tells all the hunter's to follow him. Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe. Simon falls upon the dead parachutist, and runs back to the beach to tell everyone. Before he can open his mouth he is trample and beaten to death. The boys saw the shadow of Simon and thought it was the beast and killed him.The next morning Jack's tribe of hunters attacks Ralph and Piggy. They steal Piggy's glasses and run back to their camp. Ralph and the boys from his tribe go to Jack's camp to try to reason with Jack. Jack order's that Sam and Eric be tied up, and one boy rolls a boulder down the mountain killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell. Ralph hides for the night, but in the morning Jack sends out a search party looking for him. As his hunters try to track him down, Jack sets a forest fire trying to smoke Ralph out of his hiding spot. Ralph is forced to the beach, and collapses in exhaustion. When he wakes up there is a naval officer standing over him. Ralph weeps when he feels that he is safe, but thinks about everything that has happened. The other boys reach the beach and also start to sob. The naval officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Regarded as one of the great novels of the twentieth century and a staple of high school and college English Lit courses, William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES is a gripping masterpiece, which gently glides the reader into the darkest depths of the human soul.It is rare to find a novel which is both beautifully written and a ripping good yarn, but this is both. Golding is a master craftsman of the language. His sentences and paragraphs are intricately designed; his metaphors evoke mood and mental imagery without stopping the flow of the narrative. And what a narrative it is, at that. Like Joseph Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS, it is a compelling glance into the destructiveness at the heart of humanity as it devours and consumes the finer instincts, all cloaked in the guise of a pulpy adventure story. The characters manage to be both symbolic and complex.There are many novels you probably avoided reading in tenth grade English that are overrated, pretentious psychobabble. This is not one of them. It is a page-turner that will haunt you long after you reach the ending."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book by William Golding is a haunting allegory about the nature of mankind and how our barbaric roots conflict with our newly found sense of civilization. I read this book in two days. Okay, so it's not a very long book, but still, considering I started reading it at about 11 pm each night, I was totally engrossed by this book. I didn't sleep the night I finished it. I couldn't get the story out of my mind. From the first word to the last sentence, this book holds your interest and keeps you on the edge of your proverbial seat. If you are looking for a book that will make you think, read this book. If you want to be entertained, read this book. Even if you don't, read this book. For pete's sake, just read this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is the highly symbolic story of a group of young boys left on a deserted island without parental supervision of any kind after evacuating England ahead of a nuclear attack. The crude body politic they initially form quickly devolves.This is not a book about survivalism. The boys find the island bountiful, providing an overabundance of fruit and, later, pig (probably an unrealistic abundance). It is rather a book about human interaction.Lord of the Flies is highly metaphorical and symbolic. It paints a frightening portrait of how quickly man can regress from the rule of law to his natural, Hobbesian roots, where life is \\"nasty, brutish, and short.\\" The great innovation of the modern nation-state is the discovery of a way to restrain the ability of those we choose to lead us to hurt us, something the boys are unable to do. The corrupting influence of power was a popular theme for the time, also used in Lord of the Rings and Animal Farm, among others (it was also a good time for speculative fiction).This thin novel is a quick, if not always easy, read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I started reading this book I was happy to look for adventure of a bunch of young kids/men stranded on an island without any support or knowledge of survival instincts. Then the story takes a turn by showing how human behavior creates anger, jealousy and hunger for control. The key of the book is how do people react when left to survive without controls, governments aka survival in nature.The writing style is smart, vivid and exceptionally detailed. The author describes every movement, colour, geography and person in detail.The plan is simple- put kids from various backgrounds in order to get a bag full of characters possible.Read this to realise how we end up behaving when there is no control and the dark side our human mind is capable off"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A great book. It is full of many suttle metaphores and a lot of action. I highly recomend it. Buy it. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This has to be one of the best books I have ever read, not only in school as a set text. We were so lucky to have decent books like this and 'Mockingbird' instead of the usual boring books with romantic storylines. William Golding is a true genius!! And he gets all of my respect. The story of the boys on the island is so sad and yet so true to life, and human nature. The tragedy is definately when Piggy dies. He was so intelligent and yet so unaccustomed to human ways and the real world. It was so sad. And I'm so glad that those left were found in the end."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel has an interesting view of human nature and its primal tendancies. The quality of writing and imagery is masked a little by over-usage of detail statements. The characters are complex and interesting, but the story could be told equally as effectively in 125 pages as it was in 202. In short: good book, worth buying."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This story is about a bunch of kids who get marooned on an island. There is only a few smart people, of course, and the rest savages. The book shows what will happen to a bunch of kids who have to strive for themselves. They thus form a government and it of course crashes. The kids are much too selfish to put up a fire signal to get help, thus they hunt and try to act like men in a true tribe. Yet all along, the lord who never actually apears, only once in an illusion, watches them: observes them, and acts as their silent wathcer, like their Lord. I give this book five stars becuase it pretty much shows how kids try to live on their own and what sinisterism they can obtain by living without authoirty."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I really liked this book.

I read it twice because i liked it so much."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book for school. The first time I tryed to read during the summer, I hated it. I thought it was boring, and kinda meaningless. Then school started and we had to read it for class. This time I really enjoyed the book. I actually understooded, I knew where the author was coming from. For those people who hate this book, I don't think you really understood its symbolism, and its real meaning. Then again, I could be wrong. BTW, the auther named the book &quot;Lord of the flies&quot; not entirly because of the pig 's head on a stick, it roughly translate as &quot;Devil&quot; in hebrew"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Several times during my childhood, I was left unsupervised with a group of boys in a swampy woodland for days. We ended up eating snakes, toads, insects and anything we could steal or terrorize from boys scout and National Guardsmen on training exercises. We also disintegrated into tribal savages like Golding describes in the Lord of the Flies. Between these interludes in the woods with the boy savages, I read this book (around age 10) and found it jibed with my reality. The words of the Lord of the Flies struck deep into me, for I knew that darkness well. Some believe the book overladen with &quot;humans are evil&quot; symbolism. Well, they are, and boys do revert to the lowest common denominator in the jungle, despite their best intentions."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Reading this as a school book I origionally dismissed this novel. However the heat from the desert island on which the group of stranded school children were deposited stayed throughout. Their sun bleached hair and sunburn added to the effect.There was a story within a story.One of survival of the children, what to eat how to catch it, all pragmatic aspects. The other is an underlying issue of human destruction of their environment on an island that once was pardise. I believe that some aspects of the symbolism have been materialised out of nothing, make what you will but I enjoyed that &quot;oh yeah thats linked with that&quot; part that you only get with a good book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is a classic. The topics that he covered in this book are amazing. I have read it two times now, and I have found even deeper meaning in it the second time around. It is great for any age, and the book grows with the reader. The moral of everyone having the devil in us all makes for a great discussion in comparisons with such books as Les Miserables. Even though there is some big refrence to Christianity, that doesn't have to be the main focus, so it won't make everyone feel uncomfortable. If you get the oppertunity, read it. Then after a couple of years, read it again."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The strong point of this novel is that even people's criticisms are actually good in the book. The great irony is that the boys are saved by a man going off to war. I don't think Golding is making the glossy general staement that people have attributed to him (we are all simply bloodthirsty savages at heart) but that behind every person lies the instinc of survival and of the true key point of the book, the hunt"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I must admit prejudice in my evaluation of this book; I completely disagree with the ideas behind Golding's fairytale. His metaphor is extremely narrow; English public school boys probably WOULD tear each other to bits if left unsupervised, but this says more of the British public school circle than it does of the human condition. I also don't trust the idea of our instinctual savagery, and the need for tightly structured hierarchies. Of course Golding shows that &quot;civilization&quot; doesn't eliminate violence and savagery; not in the boy's own island structure nor in sophisticated nation states. So, if you kill one person and it's murder, and if you kill 100,000 people it's foreign policy, which is better? I'm not sure that Golding really answers that question. However, he seems to say that our options are limited to this killing, either murder or war. Man is destructive. I disagree, so this book puts knots of exaspiration in my stomach. I don't believe we are doomed to cruelty; we all possess empathy, reason and creativity. The somewhat fascist undertones of this book, in perfect accord with our hierarchal society, bothers me. I wish there were other books in the school curriculum to balance out points of view in the classroom. This Hobbsian tale shows a point of view, but is not the whole truth of human nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In William Golding's allegorical novel &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; he exposes men and society as basically evil at heart and corrupt. Excellent symbolism and plot. A true classic!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book a year ago, but I still remember almost exactly what happened. The book is burned into my memory. That's how good it was. It's a tale of a boy growing up, and the evil in our society. We see how the boys decivilize during their stay on the island, and degenerate into savage groups. As in Jack London's &quot;The Call of the Wild,&quot; the characters revert to their natural instincts. In this case, the boys become savage group hunters, similar to eary humans thousands of years ago. This book is hard to understand; cryptic, but will give you a new view of the world."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I will first of all admit that the book is a trifle overweighted on the symbolism angle - notwithstanding, it remains a superb adventure, fable, morality tale and social examination. As for being put off by having read it at school, I can only assume that it was taught too early, or by a bad teacher - I stole my copy after the end of the school year and have been reading it ever since!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was quite captivated by Golding's portrayal of young boys without adult supervision. The psychological analysis and symbolism was concrete and accurate. I have heard there is a similar novel written about the actions of girls in a similar situation, yet I have not been able to find it - if anyone knows of such a novel, please contact me."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What a great book! Sure, it can be gory, somewhat odd, and even frightening, but the story is wonderful. If you think it's unrealistic, you either forgot what it was like to be a boy growing up or you are female. Young boys can be imaginative and insiteful, and they can be mean, cruel, and even a little sadistic. This book brims with themes and implications, almost EVERY LINE of the book displaying some theme or other. Here is a story of survival , of loyalty, of standing for what's right, of good vs. evil, and of the realities of a modern life. Yes, that's right. Not only does the boys' reversion to savagery hold implications of a world without law or order, but we also see that such a world is beyond so many of us. When they are rescued ---- boys once more, in just a mere glance."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"With no parents, teachers, or rules, is there really any question as to why the characters in Lord of the Flies by William Golding had no mercy? The story is about a group of English boys on their way to boarding school when their plane gets shot down in the middle of World War II and end up stranded on an island. They try to form a society and govern themselves, but not long after, the boys are having chaos for breakfast and anarchy for lunch. The book reminds me of the movie Thirteen, only the male version. In Thirteen, the main character goes to shocking lengths to befriend the most popular girl in school. Before her mother knows it, she is powerless to rescue her daughter from a whirlwind of drugs, sex and crime). They both, I find, are not shocking at all. This is the way people today are, to say you were shocked is saying your living your life blind. Ralph is your typical guy in high school who is unsure of himself and just watches the bully pick on the little kid. Jack on the other hand is the jock/bully who everyone \\"admires\\", whether it is in fear or respect. Simon is the artsy type. He is out of the box and in his won world. Piggy, a very intelligent boy would be your \\"nerd\\" who stands up for what he believes in. The Lord of the Flies is a well written book full of truth. When you read the story, don't be disgusted. Ask yourself \\"what would I do if I were twelve years old and stranded on an island?\\""},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What if you suddenly crash-landed on a deserted island, how would you survive? The book,\\" Lord of the Flies,\\" explores how the children of a plane crash survive on an island all by themselves, without adults to influence them, and how they manage to cope with the fact that they may never be rescued.One boy, Ralph, is chosen to be the leader of the band of castaways, to the dismay of the power hungry older boy named Jack, who becomes the leader of the hunters for the group. A fat, bespectacled boy named Piggy tries to hold the group together, and uses his intelligence to work through the problems the group encounters. Then there's Simon, a quiet, mysterious boy, who seems to see something about the island that no one else can.\\"Lord of the Flies\\" is an interesting read, with decent characters and an intelligent plot full of symbolism and metaphors. This book explores a darker side of the human mind, a side that is in all of us."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Beginning reading the book, I had debates over my own adjustment to the style, but Golding's attention to detail is astounding. Ultimately, as the novel progressed, the psychological details of this Darwinian nightmare unravel into a gorgeous tapestry about the death of innocence."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a classic work of art. It is so relevant today that it is hard to believe it is fifty years old. It depicts, in chilling detail, how civilization breaks down when a group of school boys, none over 12 years of age, are marooned on an island, with no adult supervision.It can be read as an allegory for adult society in which there is no responsible supervision, for example, when the government appoints people to head agencies who have no experience, like Brownie, or appoints people to agencies that the government wants to destroy, or when the government appoints a person to represent us in the UN and the person has said the UN should not exist. Does this sound familiar?However, this book first appeared in 1954. It is a work of art. It may be just an artistic description of some school boys slowly descending into a violent abyss of their own making.Either way, it is a disturbing book. It shows, clearly, how thin the veneer of civilization is, and what ugliness lies beneath that veneer.I have read this book twice and was disturbed both times. I think it is still relevant. And that relevance makes the book even more disturbing.An edition like this is a strong addition to any serious personal library."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the book Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, a plane crashes on a untouched island, and without adults, a group of boys will have to find a way to survive. The boys vary from the ages 10-15, this is important because the older boys control the group. The main character is basically the leader. His name is Ralph. Ralph is a very interesting character. He is smart, responsible, and he knows how to survive. Jack is one of the older boys too. Most of the conflict in the book is somehow is related to him. He is a great hunter and is very aggressive. Simon is the most responsible and is the smartest of the group. All of these characters play a big part in the book.The island plays a big part in there survival. It is filled with trees, fruits, and animals. The boys also speak of a beast. The island has a mountain where the boys create a flame that they hope will be spotted. In the book a place called Castle Rock is mentioned. It is an elevated place where a lot of important things happen. The island also has a lot of symbolic elements. It is where almost all of the symbolism is. Another important part is that the wild boar lives there, which is important for there survival.After reading the book, I thought it was thrilling and it had good elements that made it interesting. The elements of the story made it interesting which made me want to read on. The characters were twisted, and they always did something I didn't expect. Overall the book was good."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Imagine your plane crashed, on a deserted island and no one lived except for the children, they would have to hunt for their own food and learn how to hunt. Also they would have to learned to build there own shelter. In the book Lord of the Flies the main characters are, Ralph, Piggy, jack and roger. Have many qualities. That includes, responsibilities, aggressiveness, knowledge, and much more. William Golding, aloud the readers to be able to see whats going on in the setting, for the very deceive details.The author,(William Golding) use lots of details and symbolism. Like for an example, the island that the boys are on represents, change and difference kinds of challenges. Another one is piggy glasses, they symbolize, freedom and wisdom. Personaliy i liked the setting. That took place on the island, and when the boys got together on to plan out their actions.If you like adventures and risk taking books, then I recommend that you read this book. I thought it was a great book and I would probable read it again in the future if I get a chance. You should read it too and then you'll think the same way!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This epic classic is one of the best reads of my life, and I've read a lot of books. When William Golding sat down to write The Lord Of The Flies, he never imagined the words he put down would be what is know one of the most known book titles from kids as young as eighth grade (in some cases younger.)In this book kids from ages 6-13 years are stranded on an uncharted island. These boys have no adults; life is good right? Read the book and find out.I personally like a set of twins Sam and Eric. These two do everything together, from duties to relaxing to finishing each other's sentences. These actions earn the boys the name Samneric. These characters do what they're told and can have a good time doing almost anything, even chores.This book is, however, highly controversial. What I mean is this book is full of symbolism. Some believe it has a hidden theme based on the bible, with a Christ figure and a satanic representation. Others believe this book is a representation of loss of innocence. People have done incredibly in depth analysises of the book; unfortunately, Mr. Golding is dead, so if (and hopefully when) you read this book you'll find some symbolism and draw your own conclusion.Although the chances are slim, this could potentially happen, but as I said not likely. I would hope that with all that has happened since Golding's time some sort of adult would be found and would have been able to keep some order.So, all in all, this book is a must read page-turner with quite a few insane twists. Although I must warn, the ending in my opinion could be better, but that doesn't even scratch my overall opinion of the book, which was, in a word, excellent."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord Of The Flies by William Golding is a good book about a group of British school boys who are left isolated on and island, and eventually begin to lose their sanity. The island seems realistic but I think it lacks detail because I didn't feel like I was there. The book describes how the boys slowly drive themselves crazy from the idea of a \\"beast\\" being on the island.The book starts with the group of children choosing a leader among themselves and deciding on a bunch of laws to follow. I think that William Golding did a good job describing Ralph. I felt like I connected to him and I could understand why he did what he did. When Jack, is not chosen leader, he begins to follow his own rules and attracts many fellow boys to do also. As the story develops, Jack and his band form a completely separate \\"tribe\\". This is one of the reasons that I don't like Jack throughout the story.Through the story, innocent young children become crazy and un-controllable. William Golding teaches the lesson that even young people, however innocent in the beginning, can become insane as a result of a lack of authority and civilized people to guide them. I would recommend this book to people who like adventure stories or survivor stories."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding is about boys ages 8-16 that are in an airplane crash and become stranded on an island. They have to work together to survive, but instead, they fight. The theme of this book is to get along with others. William Golding shows the chaos of what can happen when you bicker or argue with other people.My favorite character in Lord of the Flies is Piggy. Piggy has really good ideas, but no one listens to him because he is fat. I could really relate to him because sometimes I have good ideas, but people shut me out. I also like him because he resembles someone from outside of the island who is not crazy.I enjoyed the author's writing style. He stresses details that are important to understanding the story. He also uses a lot of symbolism. You really have to search for it, but it's fun. For example, the fire represents rescue. The conch, also a big part of this story, symbolizes sanity and peace.While the ending of this book wasn't the greatest, I did like it. If you enjoy symbolism and a good story- read Lord of the Flies. I'm sure you'll love it too!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"An all time great novel.

At this platform the stranded boys have their first meeting; they declare Ralph the \`chief' or their leader to guide them through there days on the dreadful island. The runner up to the throne, Jack, is appointed hunter, to provide the inhabitants with meat. Ralph helps built shelters, and starts a fire so ships would see the smoke. The relationship between Ralph and Jack starts positive but slowly goes down hill. Jealously and anger between the two leaders eventually leads to a split of power between them. Now that there were two Chiefs and each Chief owns their own clan. Eventually everyone switches over to Jack's side of the island and betrayed Ralph. Jacks hatred for Ralph begins to push its limits. Jack wants Ralph to be no more, and with no grown-ups on the island to stop him, Jack...I guess you'll need to pick up the book to find out. You wouldn't be sorry."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I personally really enjoyed this book. I believe that it would appeal more to teenager than adults, but both would like it. It has a good beginning with the kids stranded on the island. The novel is a page turner and has interesting and unexpected twists throughout it. The main suspense is wanting to know if the boys are going to be rescued. There are many instances where the novel reminds me of real life today. I would recommend this book to everyone, especially teenagers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I personally think that \\"Lord Of the Flies\\" is an outstanding book. It's a captivating story, with an intruiging plot that holds your attention throughout the story. It's about a group of British kids that are trapped on an island after their plane crashes. All the kids come together as a group and decide that Ralph should be the leader of the island. Ralph, with the help of his friend Piggy, decides that the island needs to have rules and regualtions. Jack Merridew is mad that he isn't voted as chief and at first is ok with it, but as the story continues he turns against Ralph. Jack is a hunter and starts a society of hunters on the other side of the island. I am not going to say much more but the plot is very intense and violent with many examples of hatred, and also death.

These two boys names are Ralph and Jack. They have an election and Ralph wins and is elected chief. He appoints Jack to the hunters ( him and his choir). These two argue about everything whether to gather food, make shelter, or hunt pigs. The one who is always on Ralph's side is Piggy and the one who is always on Jack's side is Roger. The one who is in the middle is Simon he is the one who is on neither side. Another thing is they are always worried about some beastie and the only two who knows there is no beastie is Simon and Piggy. About midway through the book Jack decides he is not going to play anymore and takes him and his savages off to start a new government. This new government ends up killing a pig and having a feast they invite all the good people (Ralph, Piggy, Sam, and Eric) to join them. They end going and they have a little savage dance after they eat. Simon isn't there because he has just found out that the man in the parachute who they think is the beastie is actually just a dead man. When Simon comes down the mountain trying to show them there is no beastie they turn on him and think he is the beast because they are so wrapped up in this savage dance. They end up killing Simon but now most of them are not worried about the beastie because they think that they killed the beastie. Later on the savages raid the other camp for Piggy's glasses so they can have a fire. Ralph's tribe goes to the other tribe to try and get the glasses back and Roger kills Piggy with a huge boulder. After Piggy is killed the savages catch Sam, Eric, and Ralph and tie them up and torture them Sam and Eric give up and join the savages while Ralph escapes. Jack wants Ralph so bad that they decide to go form eats to west all the way across the island they start to walk and Roger finds him Ralph kills Roger and starts running then he hides again and is almost no found until he screams then he takes off running he runs into and officer and the officer thinks they are playing a game then they get rescued and that is where the book ends. So in conclusion this book is a great book and I think it you should read it it's not only about a loss of innocence but also about religious allegory and capacity for Good .vs. Evil.By: Willie Wilson"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!\\" Who would have thought when they read this that it was little twelve year old boys screaming this about a friend of theirs? Twelve year old boy savages hunting the only reason left on a deserted island where there is no adult help for the poor, helpless hunted. The only question that needs to be answered is whether it was in their nature to be evil, or were they raised in a bad environment and society made them that way? This question is answered in the classic tale Lord of the Flies by William Golding.William Golding joined the Royal Navy when World War II broke out. For five years he was involved in naval matters finishing his naval career as a lieutenant in command of a rocket ship. He had seen action against battleships, submarines and aircraft, and had participated in the Walcheren and D-Day operations. Today he is famous for his novel Lord of the Flies and its many references to human nature.During World War II in an attempt to get away from the war a group of English schoolboys are plane wrecked on a deserted island only to find that there is no escape of war. They don't mean for this to happen, they first try to cooperate, attempting to gather food, make shelters, and maintain fire signals to be rescued. They even elect a leader, Ralph, to oversee everything, who has an intelligent sidekick to help guide him to do the right things. But like all societies, this one has its rebels who would rather swim, play, and hunt the island's wild pigs. Soon Ralph's rules are being ignored and challenged by his rival, Jack. Jack starts his own tribe of wild painted savages and as more boys join his band, any civilization deteriorates until some boys are even being hunted.\\"Ralph saw it first, and watched till the intentness of his gaze drew all eyes that way. Then the creature stepped from mirage on to clear sand, and they saw that the darkness was not all shadow but mostly clothing. The creature was a party of boys, marching approximately in step in two parallel lines and dressed in strangely eccentric clothing.\\" Not only is the language extremely descriptive, but this passage, found in the first chapter of the book, already foreshadows the beast on the island. The group of boys end up being Jack and his choir group, which from the beginning is portrayed as a creature, or beast for that is what they become.Golding's book is continuously foreshadowing what will happen, and it is only when you look closely that you see exactly how inevitable it was that Jack and his choir would be the \\"evil\\" tribe. \\"Roger led the way straight through the castles, kicking them over, burying the flowers, scattering the chosen stones. Maurice followed, laughing, and added to the destruction... Only Percival began to whimper with an eyeful of sand and Maurice hurried away.\\" Maurice and Roger, part of Jack's group, are already testing their limits on how far they can go without getting in trouble. There are no adults on the island, no one to stop them from harming each other and they slowly start realizing that, and get worse and worse in their treatment of each other so they don't even feel guilty for anything they have done.One of the most enjoyable aspects of this book is the characters. You know them, they may even have characteristics that you recognize as your own. Ralph, marked out from the beginning by his \\"size, and attractive appearance\\" is most likely one of those kids in school who get everything they want because of their looks. A born leader who isn't necessarily the smartest, but strives to do the right thing, but doesn't always know what that is. He has to constantly be reminded of his confidante, Piggy. Piggy is constantly picked on, and called \\"Fatty\\" or \\"Piggy.\\" We don't even know his real name, but he is known by the sad, pathetic nickname he told everyone in the beginning. Never taken seriously, he would be known as the sad outsider who didn't have many friends, intelligent, and a bookworm. If he was listened to, maybe they would have fared better, but we will never know since everyone is judged on appearance in this book. Finally, there is Jack, a true bully, commanding and teasing so everyone knows who the true leader is.Because we can relate, we can even understand why certain things happen because we are familiar with the teasing, and bullying that takes place. It helps us understand what happens to these boys, and become even more aware that it is happening right now. It is happening in school, the workplace, against other races, Iraq, and this book is to show us just how bad it is. Human nature, are we naturally evil, or is it society that makes us the way we are. According to Lord of the Flies it is the way we are born, but it is up to you to decide."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a very interesting novel. It is thrilling and full of suspense. The novel is about some boys stranded in an island and becoming savages. When I finished the novel I couldn't stop thinking about it. I kept on thinking of how some of the boys survived. They had what they needed to survive, a signal, hunters for food, and shelters. They had no adults around to take care of them. Some of them were trying really hard to get allong and follow the rules that they had made for themselfs. But in a story there is always someone who doesn't like to go with the rules. Later on the boys become savages and fight against each other. This novel made me understand how important it is to have an adult around and what their knowledge can bring. I really enjoyed this novel and I know that anyone can enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of the most brilliantly disturbing and terribly intriguing books I've ever read. Golding displays a gift of potraying darkness reminiscent of Conrad and even Euripides. The symbolism he uses is masterful. Very few writers would even think to use literal translations of Greek. Golding makes it the basis for an entire novel. The devil is in you and me, and Golding portrays this better than anybody else."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After a plane full of schoolchildren escaping the horrors of post-atomic age Europe crash on a remote, hungle island, a series of debates, alliances, counteralliances, and hiearchies are established to create a rule of law and standards. However, once fear and psychological symbolism enters the picture, all is changes and this budding society of big-uns and little-uns, ranging from 6-12 year olds becomes encapsulated by an air of sadistic fog.Centering around the three main characters of Ralph, the elected conch-wielding leader, Piggy, the smart logical analytical scientist in the making, and Jack the hunter-gatherer adventurer full of blood-gutting passionate zeil. With these forceful characters in tow a series of events sets off a power-struggle that eventually yields to the emotional, non-rational, jumpy aspect of the human flesh in the name of Jack and his paint covered warriors gaining logistical control of the Island.After two viscious and violent deaths set off by stressful paronoia centered around the chances of getting rescued, the necessity to hunt for survival, mysterious forces and animals inhabiting the island (actually a dead human crashed by parachute), and the need to have a source of fire (i.e. Piggy's glasses), the death of Simon, who became possessed by the Lord of the Flies, an analogy to the dark side of human's dementia, he is killed in a frenzy after taking cover and protection inside the parachute layer. Afterwards, once Piggy seeks to reclaim his stolen glasses he is killed by Roger, a devious mischief maker.In the end, they are saved by a captain whose astonished when they admit to the death of two of their peers. Just as the Heart of Darkness revealed the dark forces unleashed by economic and resourceful greed, the Lord of the Flies showcases how this could come about from attention hording 12 years olds seeking to assert their status as leader and autocratic figure."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It has been years since I read this book but I remember that it is the book I hold the most emotional bond with. The characters touched the deepest recesses of my heart and held on. The strugles that Golding incorporates into this book are remarkable. They are realistic in the way that kids would possible go to such an extreme if a situation of isolation cropped up. I still want to burn the book, not out of hatred to the book, but out of anger toward Sam(or whoever it was I can't remember) who killed Piggy. I believe that it is a sign of a good book, when you WANT to destroy the book, not out of distaste with the writing or the idea, but out of distaste of the characters in the book, out of such a strong passion that you want to see the heroes enemies fail and not see the heroes fall. And Golding, with an excellent book does exactly that."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was forced to read this book in my 10th grade English class. I read the first chapter and knew I wasn't going to like the rest of the book. Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, has a very very deep side to it beyond just the story.

At times, while reading this book I felt that I had to almost force myself to keep going. It's not that I felt bored by the story so much as couldn't get into it. However, I gave this book four stars because when I got to the very end I was greatly moved. I don't know why but I got very emotional and burst into tears. I then felt rewarded and knew that this book was much more than what I thought it was.I also saw the black and white film from the 1960's and would highly recommend it to anyone over the age of 14. It's better than the book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Somehow I missed this book through grade school and high school, and am just now reading it for the first time, following a degree in literature. It is easy to see why teachers love it so much: the symbolism and thematic sense are simple and easily accessible. Like Of Mice and Men and To Kill a Mockingbird, it is an easy introduction into digging more out of a book than just a good story. And, also like those books, the story is good enough to keep kids -- and adults-- reading.So does it hold any appeal for an adult, used to digging around in Joyce or Faulkner? Well, to be honest, To Kill a Mockingbird is still one of my favorite books, and sometimes it's nice when you don't have to try too hard. In this book, an experienced eye can pretty much see what's going to happen from the very beginning, and then what is left is to sit back and enjoy the ride. And it is a pretty good ride, a pretty ripping little bloody story.I have some issues with the basic thematic material, wondering how and why (or even if) Golding really believes that grownups or law and society or really anything else really do tame the savage beast that is allowed reign on the island. When the soldier shows up at the end, is it really over? If I had the time, talent, and permission, it would be intriguing to write a sequel -- in which Jack and Ralph go the same boarding school and must deal with what happened on the island -- and, in the end, find that there is as much savagery living within the structures of civilization as there ever was on the island.I actually listened to this book, on tape, rather than reading it. I was fortunate enough to find a copy read by the author himself, with a short commentary by Mr. Golding at the end of every chapter. Very fun, and recommended. (...)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I would recommend this book. Early on, I was hoping there was something more to the story than just lost boys on an island by themselves. Once I realized that the basic story was just boys fending for themselves, I enjoyed it more. It's not an easy book to get through because we can't get too close to the main characters Ralph and Jack. We know by the end, Jack and his &quot;hunters&quot; have gone too far, but somehow I never felt the panic or emotion that Ralph and Piggy probably did. But the story is fascinating just on the merits of human nature. Everyone should take that away after finishing this story - people can be broken down into basic personality elements."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is among the finest literary works of the twentieth century. Comparable to Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; it gives the reader a glimpse into the dark side of human nature. Golding's novel is perhaps even more frightening than Conrad's, in that he uses children characters to accomplish this.No other literary work rouses the same seemingly contradictory feelings as this one - at the same time an animosity towards the snobbish civilization that bred the marooned boys and a yearning for the return of its constrictive, protective norms. An admiration of the instinctive ability of the children to pursue their needs for food, leadership, and rescue and a revulsion at what these needs become.These and the countless other emotions raised by Golding's novel make it one the most revealing, and consequently chilling, of our time."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is an important book of what happens in a society when there are no rules or any guide lines to follow. Ever since the boys were placed on the island they were destined to fail at creating their own perfect environment. The setting they are in starts out as a good fun environment to them but by all of the boys hunger for power it turns them against eachother and turns this so called \\"good\\" island, into a \\"bad\\" island.Jack is a representation of evil by how he thirsts for blood and meat as a opposed to being rescued. He would let the fire go out which is their only chance for survival just to cut open a pig. Ralph represents good by trying to create order, shelter and a way to be rescued. Jacks group takes over the island creating the human motivation for evil and hunting. Ralph being the only one left his motivation is forced into surviving as opposed to creating order. The whole island turns to chaos when just one person takes control. This person represents the devil figure and he takes down everyone on the whole island except for Ralph. This book shows how important rules and order are in a society today. It also shows how human motivation can completely take over the whole human body and let barbaric things happen that would not happen in a normal oderly society today."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I liked this book a lot because it was funny and had good word choice.

I would give this book 2 stars beacause i thought the book was confusing and boring in some parts. I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a classic work of art. It depicts, in chilling detail, how civilization breaks down when a group of school boys, none over 12 years of age, are marooned on an island, with no adult supervision.It can be read as an allegory for adult society in which there is no responsible supervision, for example, when the government appoints people to head agencies who have no experience, like Brownie, or appoints people to agencies that the government wants to destroy, or when the government appoints a person to represent us in the UN and the person has said the UN should not exist. Does this sound familiar?However, this book first appeared in 1954. It is a work of art. It may be just an artistic description of some school boys slowly descending into a violent abyss of their own making.Either way, it is a disturbing book. It shows, clearly, how thin the veneer of civilization is, and what ugliness lies beneath that veneer.I have read this book twice and was disturbed both times. I think it is still relevant. And that relevance makes the book even more disturbing."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies written By William Golding was an interesting and enjoyable novel. This book is a great book to read especially in an english class because its fun for open discussions, in some way it can all tie into your own life. This book as well has many symbols that represent objects and charecters as well as life and childhood experiences . It shows us how much we need other people in our lives and we need adults. It also shows how we take things for granted with our every day life and how it is to get them taken away and have to live with out them for a period of time. I give this book 4 starts its a great book !"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I was in eighth grade, I loved reading \\"Lord of the Flies\\". Two college degrees and a lot of time later, I am not sure what I was thinking. What I saw in the book then, I can not find now. Coming from an era in which literature had a greater market, this book achieved notoriety. Released today, I suspect this book might be a failure.A plane crash leaves an undetermined number of boys on an island to fend for themselves. The idea that the children must live independent from adults is an interesting premise. While the story itself is interesting, it is difficult to identify with any of the characters. Ralph, the original leader of the group, is weak and a poor leader. His lack of focus and self-loathing make him hard to empathize with. Jack, the second leader and founder of the hunters/savages, is a megalomanical monster. More than anything, he needs a good old fashioned beating from his father. The most sympathetic character is Piggy, the obese and asthmatic voice of reason. Unfortauntely, the other boys would rather mock him than listen to him. When Piggy dies, I found myself wishing that the rest of the boys would starve to death, never being rescued. Unfortunately, the boys are rescued. Despite irrational fears and squabbles for power, the worst of the bunch are rescued while two other boys die cruel deaths.Perhaps this book is made for children to appreciate their parents. This would explain why I liked the book as a child. Unfortunately, the innocence of children throwing spears at each other has left me. Now I only wonder how much therapy these poor kids needed to get past this episode in their lives. It is still a good book, but your level of enjoyment is dependent upon your perspective. The child in me gave it five stars, while as an adult I give it three stars. Average: 4 stars."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Believe it or not, I never read this book in high school, which seems to be when most people have read it. Lord of the Flies describes in detail the horrific exploits of a group of young boys who make an alarming transition from civilized to barbaric when they suddenly find themselves stranded on an island with no adults. Ralph is declared chief, and quickly determines that their main goal should be to keep a large fire burning so that passing ships will see the smoke and rescue them. There is a power struggle between Ralph and Jack, who is head of the hunters and obsessed with killing the pigs on the island. Jack finally wins and the majority of the boys decide to follow him, abandoning the efforts of the fire.There were spots in which I found myself re-reading, trying to understand scenes being described. This book is written in the view of a young boy so the reader needs to understand that as a youth, his view of the world is somewhat limited; thus forcing the reader to imagine what the youth is describing with limited terms. There are many passages that require some adult interpretation and imagination. After adjusting to this style of writing, I became thoroughly absorbed by the story, finding my heart beating quickly near the end as I sympathized with Ralph and his efforts to remain civilized."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"For a highschool book project the only thing that matters is the lenght of the book, &quot;the shorter the better.&quot; This novel is what they say, &quot;short and sweet.&quot; I picked up this novel with no good intentions only to find out this is one of my favorite novels I have ever read! William Gerald Golding created a master peice when he wrote &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot; This book has made me think beyond any normal person would think, I asked myself what would I have done on that island? Or what tribe would I have joined? Several questoins that will always be left unanswered.The boy's are flying home from military school and their plane crashes into the ocean. Only to find out that no adults have survived. They now have to live and depend on eachother to survive as hopes of ever seeing home descends dramatically. Now all eyes look upon the oldest to survive.The main character Ralph is a great leader, he's smart whitted has very good commmon sense and is a nice guy to the others. Ralph tries day in and day out to get him and the others off the island. Tension builds as more and more rebel from Ralph's orders and create a new tribe. I thought Golding did a great job with adding &quot;spice&quot; into this novel. Heat rises between the two tribes as the satanic Jack (the leader of the other tribe) gets so agressive death rises upon the kids.From the steller descriptions of the atmosphere to getting up close and personal with the kids, I think that this book deserves a 4 out of 5 only because the ending left me with a lot of unanswered questions.I highly recomend this book to any who likes thrills, adventure, humor or to someone who just wants a quick read.

One boy Ralph was appointed the leader while they have Jack as the head of the hunters and Simon as the head of the explorers. In the time of their stay on the island they hunt wild pigs, play games, go for swims in the lagoon, and try to keep their spirits up. While they are there they always kept a signal fire going in hope to be rescued. After many weeks on the island problems start brewing and feuds between boys come into play, which cause diversities.One event in the book is when one of the boys Simon goes to investigate something that all the boys thought to be a monster, which Simon discovers is really not. When Simon comes to tell the other boys they attack him and kill him because they thought he was the monster emerging form the jungle.This book was very interesting and kept a good pace.

As everyone must know, the book depicts a group of schoolboys marooned on a tropical island, where in the absence of an overbearing state they soon fall into the \\"nasty, brutish, and short\\" existence predicted by Thomas Hobbes and many other political philosophers.This is a wonderful premise for a novel, but Golding's treatment of it is pedestrian and there is little here that is surprising or entertaining. On the first page, we meet a fat boy with glasses. He's obviously doomed. On the fourth page, we read that another boy has \\"a mildness about his mouth and eyes that proclaimed no devil.\\" So we know he's not going to be at the top of the food chain, either.

Along with being such an awesome book, this novel teaches an important lesson. Have you ever wondered what would happen if there were no adults around? Well, this book is sort of an example of what can happen. When there are no adults and no laws around, kids of all ages can start to act 'aggresive'. Starting gangs, and over all doing things kids would not do when adults are around. So, over all this novel not only teaches us but 'shows' us what happens in a care-free lifestyle with no laws and adults. Ok, now back to the book. Ralph, (the main character) finds himself and others plane-wrecked. After meeting some of the other plane-wrecked boys, everyone finds out that there is no adults. Most people go and are not very active about helping eachother. Instead most kids are interested in food, fun and themselves. Only about one kid, Piggy, cares about their lives and safety.

Anyone who reads will be interested on how Ralphs group tries to do whatever they can to resist the clutches of Jack's and Jack's group's aggressiveness goes from hurting to killing!

Although William Gerald Golding wrote this worthwhile astonishing book it made no imapct to my opinion. The book was very well presented and had touching moments but lacked the realism that books have to maintain. Its moments of exitement were short lived and really weren't that exciting to begin with. All in all it was a hell of a book to those who actually like reading books. To tell the truth I hardly remember what the book was about."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"God this was terrible.A group of children are marooned on a deserted island and must survive on their own. We see the rise and fall of their society as order is achieved; power corrupts the strongest of the group and the weakest members are dismissed or destroyed and finally chaos rules.Despite my dislike of this book, I'll admit it is a very true commentary on society. The powerful abuse those weaker than them; how quickly rules become obsolete when they become inconvenient; the set roles of people in society (the chubby guy with glasses can never be as powerful as the cool, good-looking guy).If you are not being forced to read this for school, please don't do it!

I have not reread it in the twenty years since, but it has remained vividly in my memory. I feel the greatest merit of the book is its richness of potential interpretations.A favourite of my own is an anti-communitarian reading in which Golding demonstrates the peril in the way Ralph conciliates Jack after his defeat in the leadership ballot: \`The Choir [the distinct cultural minority] is yours, of course, ... they can be ... hunters'. The result is that Simon, a choir member, is given to the hunters as a sacrifice, when, had he been protected in the pursuit of his individual ends, he would have served society better by being able to announce his discovery of the nature of the beast, freeing the boys from the terror that played its part in pushing them towards barbarism.Another ironic light can be seen in the passage in which Ralph dogmatically insists on the importance of maintaining a fire, but cannot remember why. He has to be reminded by Piggy, that it is a signal for rescue. When considered against the nuclear war background, this is a haunting reminder of the nuclear scientists who chose to work on the Manhattan Project to secure a nuclear bomb as a deterrent against a nuclear Third Reich, but became so absorbed in the means that they omitted to reevaluate them periodically against the ends."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think the book wasn't believable enough to relate it to anyones life. Yes, it does have its points about life, but all in all it isn't realistic. I think the author's(William Golding) purpose for writing this book was to state the theme that &quot;there is a need for civilization and rules.&quot; I do agree with him. The book's high points are the events that happen when there is no civilization or rules. Murder, theft, and violence are all products of no civilization, and that is shown in the book. The best literary element in this book is the characters. Golding described his characters to the max. You knew what a character was thinking when he said something or did something. The good characters were so innocent and pure. While, on the hand, the evil characters were some of the worst people I've ever read about. The reader also loved to hate the evil ones, they do things that get on your last nerve. I don't think this book is believable. In the book, the children have to deal with events and situations that a thirty year old man would have trouble trying to solve. Children of the age of twelve or younger break into groups because of who stole the toy or the video game, not about how they should live or whether or not a childs schedule fits their lifestyle. Bottom line is that the book was good but has it's flaws."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golden's Lord of the Flies is a classic. When my 13 year-old grandson said he was reading it in school, I ordered it on my kindle so we could read and discuss together.There is a certain naivet&eacute; in Golden's, writing style. Perhaps it is the British to American language nuance or possibly, it is his mastery of writing that presents the essence of the story with naivet&eacute;, for indeed, in the beginning, the boys are innocent, only becoming more savage as the book progresses and the leaders (Ralph and Jack) strive for order and then control.I find it interesting to read this story as an adult. As a youth, I recall it being an decent story of survival among the elements as well as each other. As an adult, I can step back and see how the story depicts the evolution of 'man'hood and politics teeming with greed and lust for power. I do wonder where the story would have taken us if it had been young girls who found themselves on an uncharted island-now there's a story to be told."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a novel written by William Golding, a renowned (now dead) British-born writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1983. He also won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1980. Lord of the Flies is of course a classic, a famous novel written by a war-hero. Golding saw the bloodshed spilled in Normandy at D-day when the allied forces invaded Wehrmacht-occupied France. I believe that Golding took with him several of his experiences in the violent war that was World War 2 when he wrote Lord of the Flies. The plot of the novel can be described as a literary version of In the Hall of the Mountain King, the situation that the main person (Ralph) is in gets worse and worse for every page in the book and the dance keeps on getting more and more intense.Lord of the Flies is actually a really scary book and if you read the lines of the book over and over again you will see that the book is indeed a recipe for evil acts. I am no christian but you will find that all the Seven Deadly Sins are in the book. Envy of powerful Ralph, pride of hunting, wrath of killing, greed and power, gluttony of meat, acedia: Not caring about the state of the environment (fire, rescuers etc.) and a lack of women (lust)."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"[This is an old review, lost in the amazonian jungle, now reposted at the request of the Lord of the Gadflies.]The two boys we meet on the first page of \\"Lord of the Flies\\", Ralph and Piggy, are as freshly minted as Adam in the Garden or the earth/ice gods of Greek and Norse mythology. Born full-formed, they are pre-modern, utterly unsurprised by their own existence. They are no more plausible as 12-year-old boys than the usual totemic first humans of \\"creation myths\\" from cultures around the world. Plausibility is not the objective of myth; moral instruction is, and \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is plainly intended as a morality tale illustrative of human nature, which is depicted as innately savage, held in check only by authoritarian social structures and above all by \\"rules\\".Reading \\"Lord of the Flies\\" as a version of Genesis does make the story clearer, though I make no claim that such clarity was William Golding's intention. But: A) they're in a garden paradise; B) \`Woman' has not yet been created; C) fratricide, the Cain and Abel story, is central; D) Yahweh, in the form of a Grown-Up British naval officer, makes his judgmental appearance in the end.\\"Lord of the Flies\\" can also be read as science-fiction. Most critics have taken it as an apocalyptic parable, an \`end of the world' scenario, with the boys as the only visible survivors of a world war. End of humankind, beginning of humankind, take your choice! Of course, without girls, without Eve, humankind wouldn't amount to much. If, indeed, the boys were being transported to the island, or to some other custodial location, the reader will have to puzzle out the survivalists' intent. If, on the other hand, these boys -- all British but of mixed ages -- were on a flight somewhere and were stranded on the island by a crash, the questions brim up faster than the tide. Why didn't any of them know where, why, how, or what? On a plane of the size Golding could have imagined, wouldn't they have at least noticed each other while boarding? The \`creation myth' reading eliminates some of those questions; the boys popped into existence on the island without real-time antecedents, even though they were created with the illusion of prior-life memories.Implausibility in the cause of plot development is one of the constant weaknesses of second-rate science fiction. \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" is riddled with implausibilities small and large. My guess is that William Golding had less than no experience with the outdoors, other than English playing fields. Let's get persnickety for a moment: 1) The boys start a fire INSTANTLY with sunlight through the lens of Piggy's glasses; Hah! I'd like to see that done! 2) The naked or nearly naked boys, with their tender English feet, scamper over coral and volcanic rocks all a-jumble, and through palm and bramble thickets, at the speed of thought on the typewriter keys; Golding had clearly never attempted hiking off-path in his life! 3) The island is straight out of Disneyland! If it's big enough to support a population of wild hogs, to have running streams of fresh water, and to feature a peak as high as described, then the boys COULD NOT possibly cover the territory they do in the time they're allotted, any more than Jack Bauer could drive from edge to edge of Los Angeles during a commercial break! If the island is as small as it has to be for the final \`hunt' to make sense, then it's too small for any other item of the story to compute. There are also some ecological illogicalities, the strangest of all being the presence of those pigs without any history of human settlement. Honestly, as a narrative of \`survival' in a hostile or indifferent environment, \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is less realistic than \\"The Hatchet\\", Gary Paulsen's classic for young readers.In short, William Golding knew absolutely NOTHING about nature! And knowing nothing about Nature, how can his depiction of Human Nature be considered meaningful?That's the burning question for me, in reading this rather childish portrayal of the innate bestiality -- the \\"original sin\\" -- of our species. Frankly, I think \\"The Lord of the Flies' is fatally dated; it's a specimen of the mindset of the year it was published, 1954, at the beginning of the Great Fear of nuclear destruction. It dates from an era when the implications of evolution were just beginning to dawn on middle-class literary Joes like Golding, but long before any combination of ethology and evolutionary psychology had begun to probe the roots of social-ethical behavior.Is it still worth reading? Yeah, it's kinda fun. Does it have depths of insight in the human dilemma? None that I can take seriously. Should it be a standard reading choice for school children of any particular age, as it has been? Is it actually a book intended for \\"young readers\\"? I'll have to leave those questions for teachers to consider."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you haven't already done, stop everything you're doing and read this book.

The book is one of my favorite books of all time and I was very excited that Golding himself was the one who was reading the story. After listening to the cds myself, however, I was a bit reluctant to have my students listen to any of them. Golding was a brilliant writer, but he was also a terrible reader. He reads in a very dull and rather monotone voice with hardly any inflection. Surprisingly, my students really enjoyed listening to the chapters we listened to in class (I think that's because it cut down on the reading they actually were supposed to do themselves). Also, at the end of the book Golding has about a four minute piece where he explains how the idea for LORD OF THE FLIES came about and where he talks about the major themes of the novel. I don't recommend this audio book for anyone who wants to listen to the book themselves; you're better off trying to find a reading done by someone else.

This book has an interesting concept. A plane full of boys,literally, boys, crashes on an island. The pilot is dead, so there isabsolutely no adult supervision. Seeing this opportunity, the boys try toplot out their stay on the island, in hopes of rescue. Ralph is chosen asthe chief, which basically gives him the power of calling the shots.Ralph was the most logical out of all the boys, so it was a good decision.Ralph wasn't the only one with leadership qualities. Jack is ahunter, and that's all he wants to do on the island; he doesn't want toput in his time to get rescued. But the boys soon realize that theyweren't very willing to work together.

Jack is also aleader in his own sense, but isn't willing to cooperate with others whodon't agree with his tactics. Piggy may be a coward, but he is a truefriend, until the end.

It is so realistic and scary, because it is totally clear in its tactics and themes all at the same time! The characters in this novel realize by the end that humanity and goodness in the human heart does not exist. And that civility and propriety are simply facades created by the restraints of a general will in society. The characters, by the end, all face up to the darkness of human nature. What sets them apart, however, is how they react to this knowledge. Jack and his followers deal with it by killing those who are about to tell them the truth about themselves-that they are out of control and that the beast of decay, destruction, insanity, chaos and paranoia has taken over their souls and has made them as dark and evil as he is. Ralph, on the other hand, denies it right up until he is being hunted like an animal, and then accepts it with tears and sobs of grief for \\"the end of innocence, the darkness of a man's heart, and the fall through the air of the true, wise friend called Piggy.\\" In short, this story takes us into a place that we never want to go, and tells us things that we don't want to believe about ourselves."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book last year (grade ten), because I was forced to read it for school. But, unlike all the other books they made us read, I ended up loving this one.The story is essentially a parody of Ballantyne's The Coral Island, which I read when I was much younger, and hated for exactly the same reasons Golding seems to have hated it when he decided to write Lord of the Flies. After reading books like The Coral Island, it's easy to understand the statement the author is making about British society, which is very amusing from a young Canadian perspective (weren't the British silly?).The book is very clever, amusing and moving. And it's not even very long, so it doesn't get boring before getting to the point.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who isn't overly squeamish. (It does involve certain acts of violence and cruelty, which tend to be the most important parts.)However, though it isn't necessary, I would recommend reading The Coral Island before Lord of the Flies, in order to understand and enjoy this book to it's fullest."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When a plane carrying a bunch of school boys crashes into an uninhabited Island, the pilot is killed and the young boys are left to fend for themselves. Immediately two leaders arise. The democrat (Ralph) and the dictator (Jack), the traits that the boys portray and the way all of the boys on the island treat each other is very much a microcosm of the society and world of America and Nazi Germany in WWII. Another bit of symbolism is with the Bible and the idea of the character Simon as a Christ figure. He is the prophet throughout the book. He warns the boys that the beast they all fear on the island is really the inherant evil of man within them, not something you can hunt and kill. He confronts the lord of the flies (a pigs head on a stick), and though he is threatened, he goes back to the boys to warn them that the beast is really them. He gives his life to preach this truth. Also the comparison of Jack with the serpant, he lures the boys away with promises of fun times an food, but he really leads them into sins like murder and greed. I think that this is a great literary classic., and has much to teach and understand in it. No matter wich way you take it this is a must read for all classic literature lovers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This year when I was handed The Lord of the Flies I remember giving a mental groan. Just what I need, another half hour of homework added to my very busy schedule. And to make matters worse my satanic English teacher was going to make us, the students teach the book. Well it turns out that the Lord of the Flies was not just another half hour of homework. It was insight into the dregs of human nature, the secret thoughts that we pretend not to think. It basically places a group of boys onto an idyllic island, adds a few pigs, some firewood, a pair of glasses, a conch, a parachutist and a generous dose of fear and savagery inherent to all humans, and documents what happens. It is a deceptively simple storyline that makes the reader examine him/herself more closely than s/he otherwise would. On the journey important questions are raised,and in the quest for answers to them I learned fundamentally important facts about myself in this period of teenage rebellion. What is survival worth? What is the cost of human advancement? How is it that our society we created is the only thing protecting us from are inherent savagery? Would I kill someone in that situation? Who am I?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After Lord of the Flies was originally released, Golding openly discussed his novel, and stated (paraphrased) that it was all nice and good that the children were rescued, but who will rescue the adults? Golding's comment, in so few words, sums up the whole novel eloquently. The novel truly is about the evil that lurks in people naturally, and that if society is not strong enough, chaos and primitive anarchy will result. In essence, we all need to be rescued. Golding's view is quite different that that of J.J Rousseau, who feels that there existed a noble savage, and that society is to blame for the exisiting problems. A very interesting read, especially the symbolism of the three main characters of Jack, Ralh, and Piggy as Freud's Id, Ego, and Super Ego. Also the character Simon is rather intriguing, as is the fate of Ralph, Simon, and Piggy at the hands of the savages. My question is: Did it matter that they were children, or would adults in the same situation reacted the same? Ponder it..."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Many people hate the books they read in high school, claiming that the language or subject matter is too stilted, pretentious, or just plain boring. THE LORD OF THE FLIES is none of them. Not only are the themes brilliant and stimulating, but Mr. Golding has dumbfounding mastery of the English language. Despite the fact that Mr. Golding deals with heavy, academic themes, his tone is never pretentious, and it is quite easy to read. Even for someone who is not a &quot;literary luminary,&quot; the lyricism and sheer beauty of Mr. Golding's language will have anyone spellbound. He has complete mastery over his craft. The book has an intoxicating magic, just like the forces of the id Mr. Golding depicts in his dense work.

I think this book is a classic example of what is true about ourselves only we are afraid to admit it. It shows the protective bubble society builds around our children, we close our eyes in hope of believing we live in that perfect world we all dream about. But in reality, the true nature in humans tear down that wall when it is given the chance and the inhuman creature in us all comes out. The unbelievable amount of symbolizm reflects something evil in all of us.

I've read reviews that twitter on about the psychology of young males and so on, as if adults - and women, for that matter - would act any differently. I don't think so. We see events like those that occur in Lord Of The Flies every day. In many ways, it can be read as a study in power. We have Ralph, who does not seek power - is perhaps not truly suited to it - but has it thrust upon him. Piggy, who has the intelligence to lead well, but not the public appeal. And Jack, who wants power purely for power's sake. He sees it as his birthright, and even though he recognises his own failings, will not except anyone else as leader above himself. Ralph, it turns out, has the makings of a good leader, but it is the Might of Jack that crushes the Right of Piggy and Ralph, to the detriment of the entire community. Sounds much like the day-to-day politics of almost every Western country, doesn't it? As I said, some people see Lord of the Flies as an abstract study of the psychology of young males in an extreme situation. I see it as an example of everyday life in the history of mankind."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of the best books I ever read, if not the best.

Humans? Or animals? Or savages? What's grown-ups going to think? Going off--hunting pigs--letting fires out--and now!\\"If we consider that in this novel there is not a feminine figure I can argue that the human being (after the nuclear conflict) is almost destined to disappear because the female is a crucial part of the society not only as a synonymous of reproduction but mainly as the most rational and intelligent part of the humanity (See Piggy and Jack).\\"The Conch\\" is synonimous of democracy made of condivisible and established a priori made of rules but is also extremely fragile.In my opinion \\"The Beast\\" is a radiography of our souls which is localized somewhere inside our minds, after a series of facts it will emerge violently the animal side of our personality.CheersIP"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In William Golding's novel The Lord of the Flies, a group of twelve year old boys are stranded on an island in the midst of a war. Golding has chosen the perfect setting and age group to illustrate his point. By using twelve year old boys instead of grown men, he is able to better explore the human tendency towards cruelty (as these twelve year olds do not have civilization fully ingrained into their natural instincts). The allegorical nature of the novel worked in Golding's favor; the reader clearly understands that Golding believes that humans are not born pure and moral -these traits are learned over a long period of time.Because Golding meant the novel to be allegorical, it is not very realistic. The characters Ralph, Piggy, and Jack seem to be rather flat, as we know next to nothing about them. Also, these children barely mention missing their families or their old lives. In fact, most of them readily abandon it without a second thought to explore their inner savage. The island the boys are stranded on also happens to have plenty of fruit; the boys' overwhelming desire for meat, especially at such a young age, seems out of place. The reader must employ some pretty serious suspension of belief while reading this novel. Ultimately however, these traits helped contribute to the novel's strong and incredibly complex symbolism which leaves the reader to ponder over the true nature of human behavior."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I started reading this, a young friend of mine looked at the cover and groaned. \\"I had to read that in high school,\\" he said. Lucky him!This is the classic tale about group-think; what happens when you a group of boys are left stranded without anyone to guide their behavior? The best and the worst of human behavior comes to the surface. What made the copy I read most interesting was the comments made by the author about why he wrote about boys, and how he came up with the story line.Now, to go back to my young friend and beat up on him for complaining ... ! I wish I'd read this book when I was in high school."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"You can always think, \\"Oh what a enjoyable thing to do,\\" with most adventure books. Not with this one. When a group of boys crashes on an island they are supposed to take this opportunity to make a dream society. In Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, that definitely does not happen. Instead, kids turn savage and no one can tell good from evil.During World War II, a group of boys' plane crashes on an island. Only the boys survive. Everything seems ideal - there are no adults around and there appears to be enough food and water. But what happens when all the food and water runs out? The boys decide to have an election on the leadership of their tribe. It so happens that a boy named Ralph gets elected and appoints his opponent Jack to be the leader of the hunters. But then Jack wants more. He wants to be the leader. He takes all the boys (except Ralph, Samneric, and Piggy) and turns them into savages. Jack and his co-leader Roger think they are doing good for the boys who want to have fun, but then the signal fire goes out. The hope of a rescue is gone. Now Jack and Roger candidly pursue Ralph, Piggy and Samneric. What will happen if one of them gets captured?I think that the two main points of Lord of the Flies are firstly, that being evil is easier than being is good. When you are evil your conscience goes away - you don't feel bad for people you hurt. The only feeling you have left is for yourself and then sometimes you don't know that you hurt people. When you are good it is possible to feel for others. Secondly, I think that William Golding is trying to make a point that an evil society can't last. Sure, it can form easily, but it can't last. This is because evil is an all wanting thing. If you are evil you probably will try to get to the top by force while other people are doing the same thing. Then every bit of structure falls to bits and pieces."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It is every young boy's dream- being left on a coral island with no parents or grownups to tell them what to do. It all begins quite nicely with order and with Ralph as the elected chief. Rules are created and jobs are divided amongst the boys. But things tip into chaos very quickly when a second anarchical faction rises up among the boys. They quickly descend into savagery and Ralph and his friend Piggy are the lone representatives of reason and law. Human nature shows its most sinister side and all hell breaks loose. There is a mysterious 'beastie' inhabiting the island which provokes fear in all the boys, big and small. But the beastie is really themselves and how they behave towards each other when they throw law and order to the wind. It is the ugliness inside all of their hearts which they have allowed to run free. This book was definitely an eye opener for the dark side of human nature and makes you think if this is what would happen if the world suddenly turned into a similarly lawless place."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies inspired vigorous debate in my high school English class, and the Peter Brook film version certainly did the book justice. It's interesting sometimes to turn to a piece of literature that you know already and experience it as an audiobook. In this case, I didn't see the Peter Brook film as I listened, nor did I have the same response to the book that I had as a student. This was a completely fresh take on a classic that remains controversial in its assertion that a society built and populated by mankind is destined to fail because innate human weakness will triumph over higher notions. It's a chilling view, and I, for one, can't prove that Golding was wrong. We have only faith in human goodness to keep anarchy from prevailing. Is that faith only possible when one can afford it?Lord of the Flies"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is beautifully written. Some parts of his book are like poetry the way he describes some scenery or some emotion. I enjoyed this book immensely. Leave an island stranded with a bunch of boy growing and on the verge of manhood you can see how man will intend to mean well. But free will and the feel of power and control one can lose sight of the original goal and turn for the worst. You can see how evil men gain power, by fear and promise of better. It was fast paced and book I had trouble putting down. Excellent read if you want to read in to double meanings."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book when I was in my late teens, and once I started it I couldn't put it down. The action of the boys on the island is riveting and highly suspenseful. Alliances are formed, the group divides into two gangs, each trying to outdo the other. It's inevitable that something terrible is going to happen, caused by one group trying to wrest supreme leadership from the other. When that something terrible did happen, I was shocked . . . but I recognized that the entire book was leading toward what happened. I think this is an exceptionally well-imagined book, and an exceptionally well-plotted one. If your read this book, I suspect its story will stay with you forever. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I purchased this for my son as part of his summer reading.

While Ralph has good intentions with forming a civilization and have everyone working together, but not everyone wants that perfect life. The civilians feel that while they're there, why don't they have fun. On the other spectrum, savagery is outright terrible for numerous reasons. First, there are no rules and anything goes, which could end in many mistakes or injuries. In addition, you could kill people by being erratic, and not actually assessing the situation first. Golding wants to stress the different concepts and viewpoints that many children have.Golding was a teacher at Bishop Wordsworth's School until he got a few of his novels published. Such as Lord of the Flies, The Inheritors, Pincher Martin, and Free Fall. During World War II, Golding served in the Royal Navy, and played a key role in the take down of one of Germany's strongest ships.In my opinion, William Golding not only accomplished his goal, but also brought a more extensive look as to what could really happen while stranded on a deserted island. Complete isolation transformed preppy English students into savages solely concerned with their own self-preservation. The different aspects and comparisons between the false sense of civilization and the complete negativity of savagery are displayed prominently between the complete juxtaposition of Ralph and Jack. An example of Ralph's stressed mentality of civilization was shown when the kids were out trying to have fun, he barked at them to \\"get back to work.\\" On the other hand, Jack's savagery was shown when he and his gang ended up killing Piggy and Simon.One of the book's strengths was that it demonstrated exactly how children act in real life. This is one of the book's greatest strengths because it brought all of the characters to life in a relatable way. The point of this book seemed to be the most personal to me, since I have seen those things in school. One of the book's biggest faults was that it fails to convey to the reader what repercussions Jack and his crew has to face for killing two innocent kids."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I taught this book in my sophomore English class. I started each unit with a \\"free-for-all\\" day, an entire class period in which I said nothing, gave no instructions, and wore a sign that read \\"I'm closed for repairs.\\" I did this with ten different classes and each time chaos ensued. As soon as students realized I was present but not really there, they tested the limits with what they could and could not do. Since I told myself that I would only break character if a student's well-being was at stake, the students quikly realized they could get away with a lot. Leaders emerged and some kids tried to be somewhat productive, but the outcome was always dismal and disturbing. One time all the desks were piled into one heap as if they were going to be a part of one giant bonfire. This was always an interesting introduction to the book since the students quickly made the connections when they started reading the book. I am a very positive person by nature and tend to see the best in people, so some of the truths in this book are hard for me to acknowledge. However, Golding hits us with the reality of our hearts smack dab between the eyes. This book is a fascinating read that will force you to look closely within your own heart while also reminding you to be a little more cautious when trusting other people's intentions."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The plot of LORD OF THE FLIES goes something like this. During the middle of WWII, a British airplane full of male English schoolchildren is shot done over the Pacific. Upon reaching shore the survivors realize that all the adults died in the crash. The group of boys, aging in range from 6-12, bands together to survive on the island until they can be rescued. The tribe holds an assembly and elects a chief, a bright young man named Ralph. Ralph is a democratic leader and does everything he can to keep things together. He is joined in his efforts by Jack, the lead singer of a group of choir boys who turns the choir into a group of hunters; Piggy, an extremely intelligent boy who is chubby and wears glasses; and Simon, an eccentric young lad who suffers from fainting spells and seems capable of touching the spiritual world. Piggy and Jack don't get along at all. But Ralph and Jack begin things as friends. Things go alright for awhile, but there is a darkness on the island that everyone can feel. As the days pass into weeks, tension develops between Ralph and Jack. In his ambition to feed the tribe with meet, Jack slowly falls under the spell of darkness and becomes filled with pride. He eventually splits the tribe in two. Both pigs and people become slaughtered as civilization falls apart in a world of immoral and unethical chaos.LORD OF THE FLIES is one of my favorite books of all time. I first read it when I was a junior in high school and was deeply impressed by the wonderful story. The story is full of vivid images that become frozen in one's mind.Besides just being a great story, the novel can be read on a variety of levels. For instance, there is the conflict of man versus nature; civilization versus anarchy; democratic principles versus dictatorship. The book could be read as merely a psychological treatise examining the various states of the human mind. Or it can be read as a spiritual metaphor, illustrating the depravity of man outside of God's grace.Besides THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, LORD OF THE FLIES is perhaps the most influential book of the mid-20th Century. The book wasn't well received upon it's initial release, but was \\"discovered\\" in the 1960s by college students. Since that time it has become a bestseller and a modern classic. It is highly recommended and one of the few books that I believe every American should be familiar with. Beware the Beast!This edition of LORD OF THE FLIES includes an introduction by E.M. Forster, a selection of postnotes following the essay, and a group of selected critical analysis of the work."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I picked this book up for 50 cents at a thrift store. I had no idea what it was about as I have never been required to read it. I only recognized the title. Having now finished it, I can say it has been one of the most thought provoking stories I have ever read. While many have reasons to regard this as a depressing yarn of our humanity, I find myself uplifted by the message and the symbolism found throughout the novel.The story follows the adventures of a band of British boys who are marooned on an island. At first the children seem much like the lost boys of Neverland, but the world in which they live is far more real and unforgiving. The boy with the fair colored hair named Ralph is appointed the leader and with the aid of his faithful sidekick Piggy, he attempts to maintain order among the multitude of boys. What begins as simple fun on the island quickly becomes a nightmare as Ralph begins to realize that the scariest things don't come from the outside, but from within. At the end of the story all childlike innocence is lost forever.The symbolism and parallels to our time were amazing. William Golding had this to say in regards to the book's theme:\\"The theme is an attempt to trace the defects of society back to the defects of human nature. The moral is that the shape of a society must depend on the ethical nature of the individual and not on any political system however apparently logical or respectable. The whole book is symbolic in nature except the rescue in the end where adult life appears, dignified and capable, but in reality enmeshed in the same evil as the symbolic life of the children on the island. The officer, having interrupted a man-hunt, prepares to take the children off the island in a cruiser which will presently be hunting its enemy in the same implacable way. And who will rescue the adult and his cruiser?\\"While this message is among the most obvious, there are several other subtleties that can be found within the tale. The following are some of the main symbols:The conch: An effective representation of order and society's sophistication.The glasses: The glasses symbolize the gradual deterioration of society. Notice as the glasses get damaged so does the boy's organization.The beast: 1) The irrational fears we all harbor. 2) The inner evil within humanity. 3) The idols of society.Ralph & Jack: Ralph is the head of democracy while Jack represents that of anarchic rule.Just in case you missed them, there are several other symbols which are worth looking up. Wikipedia currently has a good article as well as some other sites. Run a search online and you'll find plenty of interesting interpretations. Many of the symbols can be interpreted as Christian, but make of them what you will. Observing these will give you a greater appreciation for the story and not leave you wondering if it's some senseless tragedy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Since a George Orwell reference is obviously required here, I read 'Animal Farm' directly before Lord of the Flies. And I was foolish enough to think that Animal farm is a great book! It can hardly stand on all four legs when measuring up to Lord of the Flies.Just as 'Animal Farm' is a parody of the Russian Revolution, 'Lord of the Flies' is more of a parable for mankind than an inspiration for 'Hatchet'. Every (major) character is a symbol of some aspect of human nature. And what is a literal translation of \\"Beelzebub?\\" Not devil, as you might suspect -- \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"And if the Lord of the Flies is the Devil, Simon is Christ, or pure good -- the only boy brave enough to discover what the beast really is, the only one...crazy enough to understand it, and the one who would be sacrificed by all for trying to spread the words of the Lord of the Flies.No, I did not read this book for class, thank God, or else I would most likely hate it just for that reason. I despise hearing teachers read aloud, I don't know why, and their stupid assignments (What would you do if you were trapped on an island? What would you bring?) completely miss the entire point of the book. This is not a survival story!My edition of Lord of the Flies was printed in the seventies,and it is falling apart (I found it in my dad's study in the basement). The scotch-taped cover is blank white, except for the title and a simple sketch of the head and arms of a boy, head bent like a baby, clutching his hair in anguish. He appears to be covered in blood. Is it Ralph at the beginning of Chapter 11 (you'll see what I mean)? Is it a struggling, uncertain Jack?Lord of the Flies is definitely not a survival story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The novel THE LORD OF THE FLIES focuses on the defects of society and their relationship with the defects of human nature. The story begins when about fifteen prep shool boys are stranded on a Utopia-like paradise island after their plane crashes. They immediately try to set up a social system like any modern-world people would. Through democracy(a vote) they crown an attractive, intelligent boy named Ralph as leader. They crown a wild, power-hungry boy named Jack and a mellow, calm, an most importantly peaceful boy named Simon as his assistant-leaders. As the novel progresses Jack, who is also the leader of the choir(the group of boys who represent the military) becomes very violent, power-hungry and mutinous and attempts several times to overthrow Ralph before finally leaving the group of boys to form a tribe of his own. This split is what drives the book forward into the amazingly complex and symbolic novel that it is. It is through this split that Golding tries to explain the main theme of his novel. This theme being of course that the defects of society can be traced back only to the defects of human nature and that shape of a society depends upon the ethical nature of the creatures that inhabit it not anything else no matter how perfect or logical it appears. With this theme set in place Golding then begins to use complex symbolism such as the symbol of the sow, who represents the human conciense,and Piggy who's glasses represent the sane, accurate view and who himself represents the sane voice of society. It is through these characterizations that Goldings novel becomes the writing of a genius. If you are a psychologyst who hasn't read this book-READ IT! If you're a person interested in the study of society read this book! Thanks, Nick McCulloch,15"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book in 6th grade, as part of an \\"advanced\\" program. I wish I hadn't read it quite that early; I might have enjoyed it more. I found it hard to get past the graphic descriptions of blood and gore and to the meat of the story. I do suggest it, however; it seemed like an interesting book. (Being a 6th grade girl, I wasn't so into the \\"blood and gore, more and more\\" thing.)It does contain some disturbing subject matter, so it's probably not for kids. (Mature 8th graders and above would be my recommendation.) All in all, though, Golding describes what happens when society falls apart very vividly, and portrays the savageness of humanity gone wrong very well."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A group of young schoolchildren (all male) are evacuated from Britain in the wake of a nuclear war. As it turns out, their airplane has crashed onto an uninhabited island, with the result that there are no adult survivors to be found. In the opening scenes, children begin to slowly emerge from the forest and converge on the beach at the summons of the book's main character Ralph. As they are now thrust together in this new environment, it becomes apparent that a new sort of social order is going to be necessary. What follows for the length of the book is an elaborate working out of this (attempted) democratic style of social order.After an initial confrontation of two groups on the beach (one led by Ralph, the other led by Jack), Ralph is elected as leader. Early on, we see that Ralph's interests tend to be &quot;group&quot; oriented. His concern is with rescue, and with keeping the others focused on this objective through the maintenance of a signal fire. We see shadows in Jack however, that are more temporal, concerned with the hungry rumble in his stomach. And here we sense the beginnings of conflict, and the age-old fact looming to remind us that, even in democracy we need to recognize submission to elected leadership.In a pivotal chapter (ch.5) one of the children declares &quot;We're drifting and things are going rotten. At home there was always a grown-up.&quot; The significance here is that, by filling his island with castaway children (rather than adults) Golding allows us to consider more aspects of innate or instinctual human nature than if it had been otherwise. Children are raw. If this island were inhabited by castaway &quot;grown-ups&quot; the results and conclusions they came to would be conditioned by all of the ingenuity, resourcefulness, and maturity with which they'd have dealt with previous struggles and needs. Socially, they would have been able to draw upon the results (good or bad) of past decisions made in the clash and clang of more mature inclinations and inhibitions. But children are not afforded this perspective of experience. Golding populates his island with children because he wants to emphasize the full range of possibilities that are INNATE in the human condition, typified in this case by Ralph's tears on the very last page. Tears, we are told, which he wept &quot;for the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart.&quot;With the frenzied killing of Simon in ch.9 comes the real disintegration; a rapid descent into moral anarchy. Ralph is the only one who dares to say it... &quot;That was murder.&quot; He has the keenest sense of the mob mentality that will inevitably run roughshod over the individual conscience. Earlier than any of the others he understands their own capacity for evil when he says to Piggy, &quot;I'm frightened. Of us.&quot;I had the heartrate of a chased fox in the last chapter... you will too. And when the question was flung out at the end &quot;Who's boss here?&quot;... Ralph's loud cry of &quot;I am&quot; rang through my very soul. Those two words signify the triumph of perception over ignorance.The lasting value of the book is its ability to pose the question &quot;What if I were thrust into a similar situation?&quot; Which character would I most resemble... with whom do I most identify? How is it then, that we in fact, do behave? What if?...This story speaks to any overly optimistic answer to that question when we remember that the entire reason these children found themselves on this island in the first place, was that they were fleeing a nuclear war that &quot;grown-ups&quot; had started."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was an excellent book which teaches a hard, but important lesson about human nature. When I read this book I thought it was a well thought out book with plenty of action, suspense, and disturbing turns that keeps you hooked like a horror movie or rollercoaster. Golding made a literary master piece when he wrote this story and I recommend it to anyone without a queezy stomach.The book is basically about a group of British school boys who gets ship wrecked on a deserted island, and over time the kids stop being British school boys and become vicious savages. The main character Ralph was a leader that wanted law and order. But as the kids revert to savages Jack becomes the leader and under him the kids do horrible and aweful things. Which eventually lead to the end of two children's lives. I really liked Golding's use of symbolism, such as the conch representing law and order or the Lord of the Flies representing the devil, this book is full with symbolism. The book has human turn to beast, the very thing they fear throughout the book.[...]The idea that humanity can have a dark side is very important to the growth of any kid. If we can learn that we have these instincts and there are sometimes consequences if you follow them. Then maybe we can become better at controlling them. Its also enjoyable to read if you are the type that like being scared"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I first read Lord of the Flies during an English Literature class I hated it. I thought that it was dry, boring and more than a little irritating. Then when I reread it more than 10 times over the course of two years and studied every single character and happenstance in depth, I began to appreciate the scope and vision of this literary masterpiece. There is no question that Golding has written one of the greatest novels in the history of time.The Lord of the Flies is at first glance a simple story of a group of boys stranded on an island who get carried away and grow \\"wild\\". Yet upon a second glance we see that it is truly a tale of \\"the end of innocence\\" and \\"the darkness of man's heart\\" (found on the last page as Ralph grieves). Golding explicitly illustrates the primeval power of human nature, a surging, uncontrollable force that let loose from its bindings of society and order, and laws, can run rampant and revert to the way it was in the beginning: complete chaos.Golding masterfully uses metaphors and symbolism throughout the book. A few important examples include the fat boy, Piggy, ridiculed by so many of the boys on the island, is depicted as \\"the voice of reason\\", while Simon, a shy and insightful boy, is depicted in a saint-like manner, a crusader for peace, a Jesus-like character who possesses the only means to bring revelation to the boys. Early on in the book, the boys find the conch, a fragile symbol of societal law and order.We eventually find that Piggy is killed, crushing the voice of reason, as is Simon, crushing hope and goodness, and the conch is smashed, relieving the small society of law and order. With all these three things gone, then darkness rages throughout the island. And who is responsible for the destruction of those three important symbols? None other than Jack, the totalitarian ringleader of his island faction, a Hitler-like representative of corruptness, greed, domination, and overall a person totally given over to the dark side of human nature.Those are just a few of the symbols that are introduced in Golding's book, throughout the novel there are a plethora of many more that require an inquisitive mind to unlock their secrets and achieve a higher level of understand of the constant battle of our existence. This is without a doubt a masterpiece. Golding has created a work of fiction that is not just suited for a younger generation of readers but also for an older generation. At any age, his darkly compelling story is enough to provoke the deepest of thoughts and introspective self-reexamination."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Stranded on an island alone as a twelve year old; how would you survive?

The kids in the book represent how mankind would be without any rules or restictions. It shows how as a society we could not function without the presence of a formal government. The boys that get stranded on the island, quickly forget about the laws that they used to abide by. They become savages on this island and soon violience becomes an everyday occurance. The kids would of continued their savage behavior if not for the interference from the outside wolrd. Symbolism is a big part of this book. Most ideas in this book should not be taken literally. The island that the kids landed on represents the world. The conch represents law and democracy. The conch is the only thing that all the kids listen to and follow. When ever they hear it they always meet. The \\"beast\\" represents the darkside within everyone. The beast does not actually exist. It is just the kids excuse for violence and death. This book exposes human nature and how we would act if not for the laws that we are forced to follow. When the stronger kids see that they can get power, they do anything to achieve it. They do not care if they have to kill oposing forces. Overall I enjoyed this book because it made you think why we need a central government that tells us what to do.

William Golding does a fine job of not only explaining conflict between multiple people, but also conflicts in ones' self.This adventure story follows a group of boys through a fight for survival, both with each other and the land. Personally, I think this story has many individual issues to keep the reader occupied while the one major theme occurs, which is perseverence.

Even reading it isn't enough it is a book that really makes you think and understand human nature in new ways. It is a disturbing vision that could easily happen. This book flows very well and will really blow you away. It is not very long but just an incredibal novel.

The tale of Ralph and his boys is so real that it is horrifying. Golding has a way of seeing how things would really happen without society and government. He places a group of all boys on a deserted island to fend for themselves. being on an island, the boys have no way of escaping. At first the boys develop rules and a sort of loose society, but then when jack get his hunters to join him so they can hunt and have fun, everything falls apart. Jack and his hunters turn savage and eventually burn the whole island. Golding portrays mans natural state as being savage rather than human as we know it. He suggests that if left alone, man will regress into the animals that we once were. Jack and his hunters actually stalk the pigs on all fours like animals. They paint there faces and when they kill pig, they dance and chant. No high school student can understand the reality of our true nature until they read lord of the flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is a deep, complex book that can be read at many levels. If the book is read at an elementary level, it is merely an adventure story, but at the upper levels and college level, it is a satire that grips the reader and illustrates the reality about human nature. The story is set during World War II, where a plane carrying young British children crashes on a remote island. The children initially try to organize themselves, as you would expect highly civilized, British children to do. But then, some of these children realize that they are in complete control, that there are no adults on the island to monitor what they are doing, and this is when the primitive human nature starts to take over. They start with killing pigs and eating them half raw, blood dripping everywhere, and they end up killing three innocent children until they were rescued by none other than a cutter, which just goes to show the warring, disgusting, and primitive nature of humans that they have no control over. Golding uses this novel to introduce to us our basic and primitive instincts that emerge in the absence of civilization. He wants to show us that man is born into sin and he is a fallen creature by nature.A special part of the story is the symbols. The Conch that Ralph uses to call the others is seen as a symbol of authority. Whoever has the conch is the leader, and when the conch is destroyed in a tussle, it signifies Jack's victory; civilization is out. The forest on the island itself becomes a symbol of the location of darkness and evil. There are so many literary features to this novel that it makes it a joy to read. Easily one of the best books I've ever read.-David Brehm"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book, Lord of the Flies, by William Golding is a highly symbolic book based in the 1960's, about a group of pre-teenage boys from Britain, who's plane crashes onto an uncharted island during a nuclear war. As the book progresses, you seemingly endure the same disagreements, hardships, and means of survival that the boys do. While this book has points where the children are able to compromise and put up with one another, the majority of the reading is that of the boys and their constant disputes and violent actions toward one another.There are four main characters in the book, Ralph, Jack, Simon, and Piggy, who all have symbolic meanings. Ralph is the leader elected by the boys. Jack is a self centered, arrogant, and whiney kid, who wants things to go exactly as he wants them, and turns to violence when they don't. Simon is the only person in the book who is genuinely good, fearless, and accepts people the way they are. And, Piggy is an intelligent misfit, who uses common sense and logic in his thinking and reasoning.When the book commences, the boys are simply innocent children, who know nothing outside of their everyday home life. The boys quickly realize that in order to survive, they must acquire the skills and knowledge that are essential to live. Ralph, for example, realizes the importance of a signal fire and shelter, whereas Jack feels that hunting is top priority. Due to the constant fighting, the boys eventually segregate into two groups, and battle one another in a \\"survival of the fittest\\" type mind set. In the remainder of the book, the boys continue to battle with one another, which in turn leads to the final outcome.On a scale from 1 to 5, (1 being the worst), I would rate this book a 3. I feel that the book is a great tool for the classroom, but is not one that I would choose to read independently. This fictional story is educational in the sense that is it highly symbolic and has numerous literary elements, but is not the type of genre that I prefer. I do feel however, that it was an extremely well written book, that makes you think on a totally different level than normal. It causes you to \\"read between the lines\\" and dig deeper to find the hidden symbolic meanings that Golding strategically wrote about. I recommend this book to teachers for classroom use, and to anyone who would like to take on an extremely challenging and highly symbolic book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I've read this book twice (almost completely) and love everything about it. The way Golding set it up innocently using young boys as a warning to the entire world they better watch out, the concept is not so far fetched.The book starts simply enough, stranded boys on a deserted island where they must learn how to survive or perish. First the initial shock of where and how and why passes and soon enough you see the boys imitating their civilized upbringing by creating their own set of rules and laws, establishing a hierarchy in order to survive. A marvelous concept considering they are on a stranded island with no adults, no one telling them they can't play; possibly showing the boys are capable of reason and adapting despite their age and maturity.The book reads fast and has a message for the reader, and for anyone willing to listen, honestly. Upon devouring the words I hadn't read in over ten years from the first time, I realized a lot was missed the first time around and that might be the point. Don't take things for granted because it just may end up flipping on you and you are left holding the short end of the stick. I think Golding did have a message and I truly wonder if people understood it.As stated in the title, I love this book. It is a true &quot;classic&quot; and a must read for anyone. I do question why 14 and 15 year-olds must read it, for at that age I didn't understand or care for the topic. The second time around though, I did understand and welcome the topic. Every page left me wanting another, praying these kids understand before it's too late. Unfortunately, there is an emotional connection between me and this book keeping me from picking it up again. Sometimes fiction imitates life too much and at the point in the book where Piggy and Ralph go searching for Piggy's glasses, I learned two planes slammed into the World Trade Towers. What a time and place for symbology.Nevertheless, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is an excellent book, maybe one of these years I'll pick it up again after the emotional ties to it are a bit more removed, but I feel everyone should read it at least once."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I have watched \\"horror\\" movies that scared me less than this book did. Equal parts \\"Robinson Caruso\\" and \\"Children of the Corn,\\" \\"Lord of the Flies\\" by William Golding explores our human nature in a way not seen before.Stranded on a uninhabited island, a group of young English boys are left to survive without the influence of an adult. Chaos slowly materializes as the boys gradually lose track of their main goal: to be rescued. Nighttime comes to sybmolize fear and death as a mysterious \\"beast\\" rears its ugly head. Ralph and Piggy struggle to remain \\"civilized\\" while Jack and others begin to be absorbed by their animalistic urges.One thing that stood out to me was Golding's use of imagery. From the tiniest details of the island to almost palpable tension that devolops on the island, Golding does a magnificent job of portraying it all.However, the aspect of this book that makes it outstanding is the psychology behind the story. As the children begin to fully realize that there are no adults to give them guidance, a darkness falls over them. Long term survival becomes secondary to the immediate need to have \\"fun.\\" The children evolve from being hunted to being vicious hunters.I highly recommend this as both a good story and as a psychological study. I believe it could be an invaluable guide for high school students leaving home for the first time and experiencing a sense of freedom that can parallel that of the boys in this novel. Even if you are well past that stage, it's worth reading to get an understanding of what people might be experiencing."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This classic tale has stood the test of time not only because it is beautifully written, but because it takes a revealing look at basic human nature, both good and bad. Golding uses the circumstance of teenage boys marooned on a tropical island by a plane crash to illustrate in exciting detail how some react to conflict and adversity. The flawed &quot;society&quot; the boys develop in their quest for survival is a microcosm of our modern civilized world. Lessons and questions abound in his masterful prose--without preaching or pretense.This book is much more than just a story; it is art. It's one those pieces of literature that add to culture and foment introspection in young readers. In a small way, the world is a better place because of Lord of the Flies. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I didn't paticularly enjoy Lord of the Flies, but I must admit, it was fairly interesting... Lord of the Flies is a novel about a bunch of young boys deserted on an island with no adults or the presence of society, and all the complications that go with that. The whole book is a fight between right and wrong, order and chaos, and intellect and instinct-- Golding was trying to show just how much evil people have hidden inside covered by society, or in other words, that the only reason we ALL aren't savages is because society is always telling us we shouldn't be... A very interesting thought, one that I do in a way stand behind, but the actual PLOT and STORY of Lord of the Flies disappointed me, so I don't believe you should take the time to read the entire book; just maybe the afterword written by Golding."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"While the outside world is destroying itself in World War III, a group of pre-teen boys mimics the destruction of civilization in microcosm. They have a leader who can't get people to cooperate, they prove to be a people who are ultimately more interested in sport (hunting) and religion/superstition (the beast) than rescue, and who hate, torment, and eventually kill the only intellectual among them. They reject the law (symbolized by the beautiful conch the leader sounded to call meetings) in favor of rule by violence, and they take a blood-thirsty new leader -- who used to be head boy in a choir!So who's the Lord of the Flies? One of the boys sees him in the decaying, flyblown head of a dead hog. He sees a god of death, destruction, and decay who lives in all of us and who, given the opportunity, breaks free and destroys much of what makes life beautiful. It lives in us all -- great and small -- and we all contain the seeds of our own destruction."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Admittedly, it has been nearly a decade since I read &quot;Lord,&quot; and at the time I enjoyed it, even though I was too young to understand what was being said. The fact is that, at the time, I thought the book lagged at times, which is deadly to a casual young reader, as I was. When I think about what I remember of the book now, its kind of mysogynistic. I recommend it, marginally, though I plan to buy a new copy (my old one went the way of Piggy) and give it another go as an adult. I would suggest &quot;Animal Farm&quot; over this, if the symbolic or allegorical content is what you are looking for. Or, if you like this kind of stuff and dont mind reading some non-fiction, you might considder looking up the Stanford prison experiment (the event, not the band)."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I bought this book to use for my next book report, thinking,&quot;Why must we always read boring 'classics'?&quot; This one certainly wasn't dull! It was about a group of British schoolboys who were plane-wrecked on an uninhabited island. Ralph,a &quot;bigun&quot;,tried to lead and create a semblance of civilization,with the corpulent,wise Piggy as his assistant. It didn't work for long. One boy,Jack,rebelled and gathered up his own band of painted savages. There were horrible casualties(I won't say who). &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is scarier than any horror novel I've ever read, because the events in it are feasible. Government and rules merely veil the evil in every person. We must try to further suppress this force with love so the human race doesn't suffer the same fate as these British boys. It may sound corny,but to love takes more strength than painting ourselves as savages. Back to the book itself. It was very deep and made me lose some of my innocence. Reading it was a life-changing experience. I read it avidly,eager to see what would happen next. The end made me breathe a sigh of relief. I reccomend this book to mature,brave readers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A very good book. A little depressing but interesting and faithful to human psychology. A very good description of what could happen to a group of human beings without the demands of civilization,"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Some have derided Lord of the Flies for not being overly descriptive, but I would say that it works this way. One doesn't need to have too much detail elaborated on in order to understand the trust that developed between Ralph and Piggy when Ralph promises to give his glasses back. Some have objected to the violence, but that violence is necessary in order to examine the dangers of irresponsibility. The symbolism of the animal's skull as the \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is itself perfectly punctuated so that you feel as if it's really there when Simon communicates with it as he slowly grows lethargic. Part of this novel's appeal is the different interpretations of it. Some have said that its about the need for society, but society is nothing but a collection of individuals. Others have said that it's about the need for government, but government is itself force and Jack rather than Ralph exemplifies that reality of those in positions of government. Others have said that it's about the concept of Original Sin, but then how do you explain Ralph, Piggy, and Simon, all of whom are good guys. If anything, my favorite interpretation is that its about the potential for evil in all human beings and that only when we don't acknowledge it then we descend into savagery. Notice the fact that Simon sought to express human beings' inherent flaw, yet was laughed at for suggesting that the beast was inside them."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a harshly realistic adventure about a group of boys who are stranded on a secluded island. These boys are alone, with no adults and no rules. So it is up to them to survive. The boys separate into groups, and the fight for dominance begins.I didn't think that a scary adventure story would frighten me, however, the details in Lord of the Flies are gruesome and horrible. The outcome of this story is savage and upsetting, however, it is also mesmerizing and I recommend it to anyone who is bored with whatever they're reading now."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read the book Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, and I thought that the main character Ralph was a very interesting character.When the boys landed on the island because their plane crashed, all of the boys came together to form a group. And Ralph really wanted to be the leader of the group. This was the motives that he had to make a result from. And he would not stop until he had reached his goal. He had to be the leader of the group to settle down.In the book, the kids kind of go crazy, because there isn't much food or anything like that, and everybody wants to be the leader, which makes Ralph's job a lot harder. The one thing he has to do to become the leader of the group, is to help everyone settle down and tell them what they have to do to survive all alone. He will do this to prove that he is trustworthy enough to be the leader.Towards the middle of the book and through the end, Ralph does become the main leader, because he starts making rules to follow. But everyone is still telling each other what to do, making his goal kind of half-come true.This is what I think Ralph's goals were and what he did to solve them and have a good result!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies tells the story of a group of boys (pre-teens and younger) who become stranded on an island with no adult supervision.

The novel itself is fairly simple, but it leaves much to be discussed and/or mulled over. Many people think that the ending is \\"cheap\\" or \\"gimmicky,\\" but I think that it was the only ending that could have worked so effectively.Anyway, I recommend this to anyone, whether or not you need a book for class or for leisure."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What would you do trapped on an island with no adult supervision and no way out?

These young boys are shown things that many of us have never seen and that we will never see. They escaped Europe because of a war and their plane crashed so they ended up on an island, no one knowing who or where they were. The boys are afraid of a \\"monster\\" but in the many reflections of symbolism in this book, they are the monster. They boys start out being civilized and end out becoming savages. The idea of an utopian society is seen throughout the book. The boys first believe that the world will be great, a world without parents, adults or teachers to scold. They thought that the world would be so much better on the island. It shows that the utopian society does not work and will eventually become corrupted.The end of the book takes an interesting turn and will suprise everyone who has ever read it. It is defidently a book to read for all ages."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book Lord of the Flies is a book about how we really get to take a closer look at peoples interactions with each other. Golding writes of a group of boys who were stranded on an unknown island and how the boys work differently on how to survive. Their human nature and true personalities are exposed after spending some time on the island. The boys break off into two different groups for the remainder of their story. The leaders of the groups were Jack and Ralph. Their groups were also known as the \\"bounty hunters\\" for Jacks group and \\"fire inhibited\\" for Ralph's group. Jack's group is thought to just want to kill and eat and then they repeat. Ralph's group wants to keep a fire going so hopefully someone near might spot them.The Lord of the Flies is an excellent example of how we might actually act when the rules of society are taken away. I think this particular book is a pessimistic novel. Even though Ralph's hope of survial brings assurance and optimism, Jack's group discourages our hopeful thoughts when they become like savages. Jack's inhumane acts exudes at its highest when it is pure darkness and all he could think about was killing the pig. The story turns when Simon got in the middle of the savages but the boys thought Jack was the pig and forced themselves upon him until his flesh had met their mouths. They decided he wasn't palatable and they just left him lying there to rot. In certain situations, especially when it depends on your survival or life to death, your true self becomes more visible.I enjoyed reading this book even though it seemed pessimistic. I thought it was interesting to look at how some might act expecially in closed-in situations which Lord of the Flies provided. Lord of the Flies definity helped broaden my thoughts and horizons on how to look at certain situations or why a person might act a certain way. It was easy to read and I recommend it for teenagers to read. I would rate the book a four out of five so it was definitely worth the time of sitting down and reading it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is really good especially since at my age you can relate to some of the characters. Everyone knows a Ralph or Jack in their life. What I liked about his book is how Golding can make the island a symbol of how the world is. Also he makes symbols of all these important things so once you actually read it carefully you get the real meaning of the book which is how mankind is actually is. What I didnt like about the book was that it only had boys. It seems like if males can only survive or if they're more better than females. I would recommend this book to anyone in high school or older but mainly to high school age students since this is a book that makes you relate to all the characters in the book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I cannot even use words to explain the sheer beauty of Golding's writing.

I usually do not enjoys books in class as much as I do books I read on my own, simply because I did not chose them and I feel as though I am being forced to read them. The Lord of the Flies is more fascinating than any book I could ever pick for myself. The words are strong enough to lift a house. My eyes were stuck to every words Golding described with such thouroughness. The words are more thick with detail than one's eyes could every see.

The book starts out with the boys already on the island. The main character, Ralph, finds a conch shell, which plays a major roll in the book, take the conch and blows on to make a loud sound that calls everyone together. Once they are all there they decided that they needed a leader and since Ralph had the shell all the little kids voted for him. The other runner in that competition was Jack, the leader of an older set of boys and the only person on the island with a knife. Ralph gave Jack and his boys the job of hunting. Another person on the island is Piggy, a heavyset boy with asthma and glasses, a very essential part of their survival. Over time some of the little kid go crazy and run away to be savages. Eventually every one leaves Ralph and he is hunted like a dog.Here are some things that were good and bad about this book. The plot seems basic at first, boys stuck on island have to survive, but then it goes deeper with mysterious creatures, hallucinations and murders. Since it had a good plot it keeps you reading. The vocabulary is another superior factor of the book. The vocabulary gives you a thorough picture in your mind of the island and it inhibiters. Also the book was only 200 pages long so it's an easy read. A not so good feature about this book is it graphic images. At some points it got so disgusting I had to stop reading and go do something else. In additional the ending was predicting. I'm not going to tell about the ending. Over all I would give this book an eight out of ten for the reasons above. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes an alternative to the basic survival story.

Lord of the Flies dealt with changes that the boys (representing society in general) underwent as they gradually adapted to the isolated freedom from society (society's adaptation to the times). Three main characters depicted different effects on certain individuals under those circumstances.Jack Merridew began as the arrogant and self-righteous leader of a choir. The freedom of the island allowed him to further develop the darker side of his personality as the Chief of a savage tribe.Ralph, a &quot;fair haired boy&quot; started as a self-assured boy whose confidence in himself came from the acceptance of his peers. At first, his reliance upon Piggy for advice helped him maintain an orderly society. As the story progressed, it became apparent that the boys' desire for an orderly society fell wayside as the totalitarian Jack took control.Piggy was an educated boy who had grown up as an outcast. Due to his academic childhood, he was more mature than the others and retained his civilized behavior. But his experiences on the island gave him a more realistic understanding of the cruelty possessed by some people.The transition from civilized beings to a barbaric tribe illustrates Golding's view on society in his time. He believed that if we are not careful, we could revert back less sophisticated times and become animals again."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel is a novel that is in the same category as Animal Farm by George Orwell and Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck.

At first, there is food for everyone, all the boys are equal and happy, enjoying the tropical climate, swimming in the lagoons, and mainly their freedom from adults. But conflict between jack and Ralph is soon aroused, and the tribe splits into two. The two tribes become rivals untill all that is left of Ralphs tribe has gone to jacks side, and what is left is Ralph and Piggy. Soon, the schoolboys are haunted by the vision of a huge beast living in the caves of the island, and this fear provokes the schoolboys to become like savage-like animals, killing and toruring the boys who disobey their leader, Jack. Piggy tries to persuade the boys to come back to reality, and to depart from their aim to destroy the &quot;beast&quot; which they have invisioned, but the boys are too anarchiac to listen. Many surprises and deaths come in this book, and I higly recomend it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was asked to read this book, and I thought the title was interesting. Well, I was wrong. The only good part was the last chapter!!! Here is a basic synopsis of the book: A bunch of boys are stranded on an Island. They know how they got there, an airplane. None of them know each other (unless they went to school with others), yet they were all on the same plane. The pilot did not survive. Some of the boys become obssessed with killing while others are obssessed with being rescued. Kids die and a few turn cannibalistic. I won' t tell you the end, but there is absolutely no point in reading this book unless you like being bored out of your mind when reading. By the way, the title has relatively nothing to do with the book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book for literiture class I hated it. my teacher rattled on about the symbolizm in this book.It was so boring and kinda gory.Plus no girls, wasnt they susposed to repopulate the world after nuclear war so not possible wih only boys. The one thing i found interesting was how they acted like wild animals after they had been on the island a while.that was kinda cool.But it was to confusing"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a teen entering the 9th grade at private school, I was instructed to read this book by the school. I, of course, read the book, but did so with pain. This is not a long book, but not short either. It took me about a week just to read all 208 pages. I was unimpressed by the topic of this book, several young British boys stuck on an island, and in my opinion, this author was in la-la land when he wrote the book. Although this is just my opinion, it was agreed on by my father, who read a small ammount while he waited for me at an appointment. If you love fantasy stories about people on deserted islands that try to form a government and fail, then resort to killing each other, this is definately the book for you. This is not a book I would recommend for those my age, 14, at all. I will say, however, that the ending reflected the main idea of the story and was excellent. The book was still difficult to read and I hope this review will warn you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"While I was reading this incredibly violent novel I could hardly bear to go on. I couldn't wait to finish it. Not because of the fabulousness of the book but because I couldn't wait to put the book down; it was so dumb. Unfortunately I was forced to finish the whole thing for English class. I'm glad the whole &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; topic is over. I've given several reviews on this book but since none of them came out I'm making one again---so I can tell everyone to be cautious and not to buy this book. No---that may be a little too harsh. I think this book is very uninteresting for most teens so I don't reccomend this book to be read by kids in the 16 and below age range. I suppose it's bearable---for someone who actually enjoys reading books, like myself. But this would be utter hell for those who despise reading. The whole thing is just so wrong. Too many descriptions, extremely wrong moral/point or whatever, way too violent, and I agree that W. Golding also failed to mention who was saying what sometimes, as the reader from Houston said. I don't agree though that the ending was good. It's like, there's this bunch of British boys stranded on a little island. Then they start getting all violent and drifting farther and farther away from their normal, civilized selves. They form into two groups---the good group, with Ralph, and the bad group (also known as the tribe) with Jack---and fight over the silliest things. In the end two characters no longer exist---they've been killed by some of the boys. After all that senseless stuff all that happens is that a cruiser comes and rescues them and the whole nightmare is over. I mean, stupid or what?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is one of the few books in my elite \\"bounce\\" category -- it bounced off the wall when I finished it. I am aware of all the praise that has been heaped upon this book. This is one of the times at which I must find myself unable to really even comprehend the reasoning (if any) that goes on in the minds of those who have handed out the awards._Lord of the Flies_ is, we are told, a novel about human beings and their nature. It's a shame we see so few human beings in the book. Golding seems to see savagery as the natural and instinctive state of humanity, a position that's logically untenable (if this was the \\"natural\\" way, exactly how did we acquire civilization at all, let alone keep it long enough to develop the printing press necessary to spread such [negativity]?)Ignoring the stated literary intent, the book is on the surface the story of shipwrecked children trying to survive, a la Robinson Crusoe and Mysterious Island. However, in this aspect it also fails miserably, with characters not even covering the gamut of behavior one would suspect from children (at least some would have tried making a boat, one would think; while the exact time Lord of the Flies takes place is indeterminate, Kon-Tiki had sailed from Peru to Polynesia in 1947, something the character Piggy, at least, would probably have known), and with one of the most important parts of a survival story -- the survival science -- being gotten dismally wrong. This is most notable in having the NEARSIGHTED Piggy's glasses be used to start a fire, and it's one of the least excusable; even if Golding himself wasn't nearsighted, one would think he'd have one or two acquaintances whose glasses he could borrow for a second to test the idea.Admittedly, Golding has an excellent grasp of the language and uses it well. The book is well-written in a technical sense. Yet it fails utterly on both its major levels, failing to convince me of its major thesis on human behavior, and wrecking the suspension of disbelief in its overt plotline.I was personally quite aware of the potential savage nature of young people -- I was one of the bullied types -- yet the level of cynicism necessary to accept Lord of the Flies' ideas never came to me. I think Golding misses an essential streak of optimism that exists in young people, a willingness to try things and a dedication to survive that explains the fact that we're still a civilized species instead of a scattered group of savages barely above the flint-chipping level."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I hate this book. It was by far the worst book ever. The book could easaly be 10 pages but it was like 300 pages. The book was so slow. The book had to much detail, I had no idea you could have too much detail.I would never recommend this book to anyone. My little tip to the auther is to never write another book. I would rather read cifford the dog.The whole plot of the story is the same as \\"Lost\\" so that is kind of cool. The book was with kids so it made the book more intresting but not by much. I felt reading this book is a punishment. So don't read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was shocked by this book and dont think that it deservs the accolades that has been given.

With the flies, and the Christian symbols. (&quot;Lord&quot;. Get it?) And that Bill Golding, he's so arch. It's no wonder they gave him the Noble Prize. My girlfriend read this one and that other with the island and the lobster, and the other one, with the apes, like that one movie, and she thought they were just the best.

Ralph and Jack are arguing and the littleuns just swim and play never help with anything. Jack is starting paint his face with different colors while he hunts. Then he kills a pig.

Ralph, a boy elected the leader of a group of boys who were stranded on this island, has to solve problems for them. Conflicts between the characters of this book will keep a potential reader of this good novel will keep a reader wanting to read on until they finish the book. This is what happened to me when I was reading this classic novel by William Golding. Lord of the Flies is a good book for middle school students because to an elementary reader the book just wouldn't make sense. I recommend this book for potential readers and buyers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a compelling book. It's both scary and heartbreaking as well as beautifully poetic at moments.The language is dense at times. Golding is one of those authors that takes extreme effort packing meaning and evocation in each word. Sometimes it's an effort to read them, but it's ultimately well worth the effort.A must-read about the horror and fragile beauty inherent in being a member of the human race.If you enjoy reading &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; I highly recommend Stephen King's excellent new book, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; which uses &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; as a sort of departure point for an impressive coming-of-age story set against the Vietnam war."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a story about mankind's inherent brutality. I read this book in 1992 when I was in Grade 11. (Not because I had to, I should add.) I saw the 1963 film first and this made me read the book. A group of English schoolboys trapped on an island slowly turn into a horde of savages. Part of the reason I read this book was in case it did become set reading for our English class. It turned out to be an unnecessary exercise but I enjoyed the book anyway. I actually envied the kids who had to read it the following year for English. Listening to them complain that it's boring or that they didn't understand it. (My class read &quot;1984&quot;, another book I can recommend.) Avoid seeing the woeful 1990 film version of the novel. Most of the original story is blatantly missing."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After reading a few comments, yes, I do agree that this book might be too difficult for the teenagers. But I would recommend it to everyone having to deal with the boys (and girls) of that age. The book brings an insight into the teenager's life, it's fears and emotions. Excellent read!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a menacing look at the true nature of man, or the author's idea of it. I found it an unbelievably shallow look at the human spirit. Just thinking of this book at night keeps me from getting a good nights sleep. I think Golding's work is overly unsensitive, although it makes you think about yourself and what you would do in that situation. If you would do the same hideous things that the boys wind up resulting to."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"no real review here"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book entitled Lord of the Flies, written by William Golding, is an excellent story of a group of boys from Europe whose plane is shot down during a flight over the ocean during World War II. The story entails the deep physical, mental, and social struggles of a group of young boys on a deserted island. The struggle of survival among the boys of the island revolves on partial cooperation. They have to build shelter and find food. Also they're in constant disagreement that eventually splits them into two groups, one to keep the signal fire going, the other sees the need to hunt. All had a common fear, fear of the beast. The beast represents the unknown; the unknown is especially frightening to those who are younger and are losing touch with civilization.All the children on the island have a common goal, at least in the back of their minds, which is to get off the island and be rescued. In the end all the boys, Ralph (the most charismatic character in the story), Simon(the intellignet, prophet-like figure), Jack (the power-hungry, savage-like, and irresponsible child), Piggy (the highly intelligent, pudgy, little boy ), Roger (the small and dirty boy who represents pure evil), Sam and Eric (young twins who always do everything together) each get off the island in one way or another.The pace of this story is easy reading but it does get slow at some points. The style used in writing this book is very detailed about descriptions, understandable but kind of slow. This was a good book recommended for readers of all ages because it is an adventorous story that teaches us about the need for rules and cooperation in an uncivilized environment."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is an amazing story. Willian Golding must have been a very smart man to write such an original book. In this story, a group of British boys are stranded on an Island with no adults. Ralph, their chosen leader has high hopes of rescue, and realizes the strong importance of a continous signalling fire. He tries to keep the other boys under control with rules but like all little kids, they want to play and have fun. There are very few boys who accept their responsibilities. When a chance of rescue is destroyed because of the signal fire not being watched, Ralph becomes angry with the other boys, particularly the hunters, lead by a boy named Jack, who took the fire watchers with him to hunt some wild boars inhabiting the Island. Before long, Jack becomes frustrated with Ralph for trying to run things and makes his own group of hunters called the &quot;tribe&quot;. Ralph is left with his fat friend Piggy who is not respected in the least by the other boys, two twins; Sam and Eric, and some very little boys who aren't interested in helping. For one reason or another Ralph ends up alone against the hunters and the story ends with the tribe in a vigorous pursuit after Ralph. I am only fifteen, but I was able to appreciate every aspect of this book. Lord of the Flies is full of symbolism, and if you like that sort of thing, or even if you don't you'll love this book. I was going to write William Golding and tell him how much I appreciated his book, but he passed away three years ago. I'm sure I'll read this book many times in the future and I've been encouraging my friends to read it. It's just a great book"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I normally loved the books I was assigned to read in my English classes, and never understood why so many other people were complaining about and trashing on the great books we were reading (probably because they hated anything they had to read and I've been reading since the age of three). But not this book. I just found it boring and unrealistic, slow to get into and then still slow once I'd gotten into it. The icing on the cake for me in my dislike of this book was when my ninth grade English teacher (who does this with this, her favourite book, for all of the classes she's had before and since mine, which was 1994-95) gave us a little lesson on the symbolism of this book.I don't have a problem with symbols or allegory in a book, and thank God I've forgotten most of the symbols in this book (and in the other books she taught us). It's interesting to realise, for example, that the conch symbolises order, but how is that going to give you some sort of epiphany while reading the book? And everything in this book is a symbol-Piggy's glasses, some kid's scar, the obnoxiously-termed \\"littluns,\\" the conch, fire, Simon, the decapitated head of the pig, you name it. Could we be any less subtle? I, like most of the other students who had this woman for English, regardless of our respective religions, had no problem with the fact that Simon is supposed to represent Jesus, but the way our teacher presented this information made the Biblical account of Jesus's life and crucifixion seem like (no pun intended) the Gospel truth, telling it to us as though that's exactly how it happened, based on nothing but the Biblical account and not any opinions by scholars which might challenge the old view. Her little lesson broke the Establishment Clause, and every time I see this book, I think back with revulsion and anger to that uncomfortable May day when she gave us that religious sermon in a public school.Getting back to the book, it's incredibly unrealistic how these well-bred English schoolboys, none of them over the age of twelve, devolve into savage, unreasonable, wild, uncontrollable, murderous, unrestrained beasts after maybe two or three weeks on this island. It's one thing for a sadist like Roger or a bully like Jack to go that way, but all of these boys, so quickly forgetting their high-class upbringings and education, losing hope of being rescued that soon and turning to setting fires and allegorically raping sows? Maybe if they were older, or maybe if twenty years or so had passed, then it would seem believable for them to descend into animal madness due to being stranded on an island. All humans have these primal base instincts within, but surely they're not brought to the surface after so short a period of time! They should have still been sending signal fires, making shelters, and looking for fruit and water sources by the time the deus ex machina ending rolls around, not chasing one another around wearing pig's blood on their faces, brandishing spears, ghoulishly chanting \\"Kill the pig! Spill her blood!,\\" talking to decapitated pig's heads, thinking the bogeyman is after them, and all while an out of control fire is raging on their island paradise. Things don't happen that way.This would have made a more believable story had the events taken place over maybe ten or twenty years, not two or three weeks, so we could see a natural and realistic progression from proper British schoolboys to wild marauding savages. They're skipping a lot of steps in between."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's classic Lord of the Flies should be mandatory reading for everyone. The book shows a lot about human nature, in its purest form; childhood. The book appears simple; a story of boys stranded on an island searching for ways to subsist but is really much more than that-- it is a vast commentary on us as humans and on our actual savage nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you are going to read one book this summer... read this. This packed with hidden double meanings and awesome realism, it can be strangely haunting at times. The breakdown of order and how it affects the boys psyche makes this a truly provocative book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"On one level, this book is a wonderfully entertaining and, I hesitate to say it ... &quot;gripping&quot; account of children that get marooned on an island. It has all the elements of a strong story, one that catches you up and keeps you up late at night. On a more important level, however, Lord of the Flies is quite simply the best book about war that I have ever read. It exposes war not as horrifying, or terrible, but as patently ridiculous and non-sensical. The perfect book: extremely fun, and intellectually engaging."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought that the themes and the symbols in this book were awesome. Very well done. If the book was only themese and symbols I'd give it a 5 star rating. Unfortunately, the book has a long way to go before I can give it even 4. My main problem with the book is that I do not like Golding's writing style. I think he put too much description in the wrong places. I also wish that Golding would have gone into more detail with Simon's character. If I didn't have to read it for school I probably would not have finished the book, but I am glad that I did. I really did enjoy the messages that the book sent."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It is amazing that so many young readers can not see the parallel between this book and the killings and maimings in some American schools today.

Piggy symbolises the intellectual and concious mind. This book is a reminder of how thin the line is between humanity as conciousness and barbarism"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Other reviewers have been harsh on this novel in general; in my view it was an intriguing look into the unfolding of society among a group of marooned boys while at the same time remaining an exciting adventure story. Golding's illustrative style fit the plot well, and his statement about war, evil, and the human psyche is clear. Add this one to your repertoire if you know what's good for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"People are can do the most horrible deeds. History is littered with the refuge of human's greed, lust for power, and blood. From Caligula to Richard the Lionheart's slaughter of Muslims to the Vikings to the Nazis and the holocaust to Rwanda to Jonesboro, man is capable of the worst. Civilization is thin and fragile. This book shows the extreme of society erased and humans unleashed. But this isn't pessimism, just realism. How many of the kids try to create a good society? Doesn't the example of Simon (an obvious Christ figure) show hope? When the bad and lawless or the tyrants threaten a good society, doesn't that society take up arms and war against? Like the allies against Nazi Germany? The truth is even kids are capable of murdering viciously, recent national headlines prove that, but these kids like everybody are capabale of love and civilization."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When we are young, we are unstable. We are like you protoplasm. Very unstable and full of energy. To stabilize there has to be something there keeping you stable. This is where your parents come into affect. Your parents are the glue that keeps you in order and provides that barrier that keeps you in line. But in the book, Lord of the Flies, that barrier is removed leaving fragile children to fend for themselves and provide order. Something of which children have no knowledge what so ever. In his book Lord of the Flies, William Golding seems to captivate anarchy among a small collection of children. But also a feeling of gradual decesent into insanity. A feeling that of which belongs in the twilight zone. Along with his use of symbols to try to bring order to the book. If you look deeper this book is a metaphor for the monarchy of England. Where one group (the weaker one with Paul as their leader)is weaker but its led by the true leader is representative of the people of England and the leader is the Queen. The other group is representative of parliament, a stronger group with a leader who is really listened to. But you might see it differently depending on your situation. Even though, the main theme stays the same. Without order there is only death and madness."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I initially read this book because in the back it said it was compared to Catcher in the Rye, one of my favorite books and as I expected, it did not disappoint one bit.

As they're faced with the tasks of making shelters, and finding food they learn another problem. What if they aren't alone? This book truly tests the capabilities of children and what they can handle when alone. It forces them to learn how to fend for themselves in the scary world of today.Although I usually don't enjoy adventure or action books a lot like this type of book, I really enjoyed it. The language in which the book is written captivates the reader, and draws you into the story line. I could never stop imagining that I was one of those children faced with the troubles that they were faced with. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of The Fies is a must read story that i would reccomend to anyone.

Great reading material."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's book of classic woe and hardship, the book tells of a group of young boys who are stranded on a deserted island. With no adults there with them they have to find the strength inside of them to survive on their own. The book starts off great with the boys getting along and learning how to work together, until they start to get power hungry. Ralph is voted to be chief of the group but you see the inner battle of how to rule, the side of hunting and playing and enjoying the stay at the island with out parents, or watching and tending the fire to get rescued. While Ralph is dealing with this another one of the boys wants to be chief and decides that hunting and playing is the way to go, he wants Ralph out of leadership and that is where the struggle begins. The fighting between the two boys brings out the evil in all the boys on the island. The book is the tale of the evil that mankind carries around, unknowingly, with them. It tells of the evil in all of us. Can society live and survive being good? Or does this inner evil take over? This book does a marvelous job telling of that."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book Lord of the Flies, written by William Golding is a very well written book. The genre of the book is historical fiction. The setting of the book is on an uncharted island during the WorldWarII era. the book is mainly about a couple of schoolboys who crash landed on an uncharted island that they are stranded on without any adults. I think that the theme of the book was to show that society cannot run correctly because of the natural, sinful nature of man. Some of the main characters are Piggy, Ralph, and Jack. Piggy and Ralph first meet when they wake up next to each other after the landing. Piggy is a chubby, little bossy kid, while Ralph on the other hand is a mellow, relaxed cool kid. They call together all of the kids that are on the island and they meet a boy named Jack. Jack is a stuck up kind of kid, who is a prefect at his school and a captain of his choir class. While the short lived bond of Piggy and Ralph's friendship grows weaker. Jack and Ralph, who are both the leaders, seem to get along very well. Piggy and Ralph were the two friends, but when a person like Jack shows up, a more strong, leader-like and Ralph-like kid is up to be Ralph's friend, Ralph quickly ignores Piggy and makes Jack his new friend. But as Jack and Ralph's friendship grows the contest for leadership grows even more. Even though the kids voted Ralph as cheif, Jack is starting to show that he could be even a better cheif. I believe this because all Ralph has ever cared for is be keep a fire going and keep the hope of being rescued alive. While Jack, a more ferocious boy, focuses on staying alive most of the time and loves to hunt for the hard to get meat. I think that this book is best recommended for older teenagers because most of the words in this are very hard to understand and there are some violence in the book. The book, Lord of the Flies, is a very interesting book. Even though it has some very confusing words and hard to understand material, it should be given a try."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read the book and then saw the movie. The movie was all right but like any movie it didn't do the book justice. The book was much more descriptive and kept you on the edge of your seat. I enjoyed reading about the different boys and the roles they took on being stranded on a deserted island together. Instead of banding together they ultimatly end up in 2 groups against each other because of 2 headstrong individuals. And of course, instead of getting along, the boys had to find one poor boy to still make fun of. The book sparks different feelings throughtout the book and the author does a great job hitting just the right feelings at just the right time."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of The Flies is a wonderful novel filled with deceit, mystery, and violence.

The symbolism in this book is so deep and meaningful that you have to read over and over agin to really understand what the author was trying to display. This is an ingenious novel and I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is displayed as a remarkable novel. The plot shows suspense, adventure, and thrills. As the novel slowly uncovers itself, each of the character's inside personality also slowly reveals. The novel shows the extent of action, humans would show for survival and the wide and vague diverse personalities different people contain within.Once the reader picks up the book, they would be enthralled in the novel and would feel trapped within. The words are used so intensely that the reader will often feel as if they are part of the story. This novel is beautifully written and the plot is presented in a unique manner.&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is a rather tragic and frightening novel. The protagonist goes through never-ending adventures for the hope of survival, and the antagonist does whatever it takes to get rid of the protagonist and would go far beyond imagination. Even though the protagonist was a static character, unfortunately, the antagonist is thought to be a dynamic character that turns evil through a twist of fate."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is an excellent book with many different symbolic refrecences. This book has a very interesting story line following relatable characters and it is enthralling to read. The symbolism actually works unlike many other similair faliures. There are many things going on that stay in your subconscious mind but make an impact on how you read the book. This is a literary masterpiece and I highly recommend it. It is Golding's finest work and one of the greatest literary pieces every written. This book deserves great praise for it's excellence."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Some boys are abandened on an Island paradise , it is heaven . At first anyway .

Jack is a great dictator so this works marvolusly . Jack does not like everyone though , he is mean to piggy as piggy is weak , he has asma and glasses . Jack feels no sympathy whatsoever towards piggy though . Soon Jack lures the boys away from Ralph and piggy and simon ( the democracy ) to his group of wild savages . If the boys have no leader , and when Ralph starts to nag like a parent the follow the one they see as strong even if the morals are wrong . Alot like how the germans followed hitlar long ago . The inocence these children had is dead when they start getting exited about killing , they have nothing to do on the island so getting exited about killing makes them want to do it more . They end up complete savages and when they are all hyped up after a dance at a feast and simon appears out of the dark the group of savages all pounce on him &quot; they were no words just the sound of claws and teeth tearing flesh &quot; .

The actual fact that they had killed people , and it could have been them too . Ralph thinks and &quot; weeped for the end of innocence and for dear wise friend Piggy &quot; . I agree totally that the point of this is exploring the boundary beetween human reason and animal instinct . This was written when a war was on though so the author thought evry one , when put in the cercumstances would be that violent and savage . It may not be so . This was written to make people think very deeply about reason and how awful people can be when in a horrible situation like that of in lord of the flies . And by the way if your wondering what the lord of the flies is , its a dead pigs head on a stick which the children gave to &quot;the beast &quot; as a sactafice , it later in the book tells Simon that there is no beast , they are the beast basically . And simon who had the intellect and understanding of the savagery and the beast now had the laguage to express and describe it to the others , when he found this out he ran to the others to tell them . Unfortunatly &quot;the beast and evil in the children&quot; got to him first ."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the flies is a book that potrays authority and symbolizm. However,the book dramatizes violence the author william Golding gives us a distinct description of how violent society could be without rules and leadrship. Other than the violence I believe this book was over all pretty good. Also sme of the themes of the story are beievable such as the stting of the killing of the sow which describes the young teen-age boys violenty taking the life of a mother pig I would also like to thank my teacher Mrs. zingaro for recomending this book to our class."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The author's purpose for writing this book is to send a message to the readers.

It just takes a lot to bring it out, some more than others. I do agree with the author, I believe that there is a little violence in everyone also. Out of all the literary elements, I think the author handled characterization the best. He made every character symbolize something. He even gave them names that had literal meanings, which were actually what each character stood for. Golding shows excellent characterization skills, in this classic. I think this book is believable. This can easily happen, and probably has happened in real life. I don't know if the level of violence would be so extreme. It is hard to tell because I have never witnessed a situation, in which somebody would have so much fear, that they would become that violent. If I could, I wouldn't change the book much at all. Maybe I would change the ending a little bit, in the sense of who died, and who didn't. I would've probably added some more characters also. One more thing I would've done is create a game, or form of entertainment that the boys invented, and frequently enjoyed on the island."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought that this was a very good book for everybody from average everyday readers to collage professors. The average day reader would read this book and see the action and the drama. They would see the fights emerging between Jack and Ralph and they would have fun reading about the pig hunts. Then when they where done they would put it down and go on with their life. They would not however see the more intricate ideas of this book such as theme and symbolism. That is why this is such a good book, it draws in people from all diffrent walks of life. I am just a Sophmore reader from North Gwinnett High School. When I read this book for the first time I just saw the plain old black and white script but then when I started to research it more I saw so much more then that. I understood what Mr. Golding was trying to say. So whether you want to read this book or research it I gurantee that you will like it.

I think that the author of this book had in mind what he was doing. The most action packed parts were when two of the main characters were killed. The rivalry that goes on in this story is somewhat serious when you have yong boys being cannibals. The things I didn't like was the length and some of the wording. The outcome really was a knowing situation. You knew that most likely they were going to be saved. The things I liked were when he had the characters express their feelings in a unusal and weird way.

Golding began this work with this question in mind, and arrived at the conclusion that man is indeed inherently evil. In between, however, he illustrated how evil outlasts good, how innocence is so easily destroyed, and how the struggle for power can corrupt even the most innocent- children. This is a powerful work that speaks of the stupidity of humans, and how little the struggle for power really means (illustrated at the very end of the book).

While i did enjoy the basic storyline, Lord of the Flies was written in a way that i found extremely confusing and basically uninteresting. The parts of it that i acctually understood weren't so bad though.In the start of the novel, a lot of young boys find themselves trapped on an island with no adults. In the first few days that they are there they elect a leader, set up rules, and get an organized camp going. They seem to be used to having rules and regualtions, and no one objects to this. There are some important main characters in this book. Ralph is the civilized, rational figure who is elected cheif in the beginning. He knows what needs to be done to get rescued, and throuout the book he is focused on that. Then there is Jack, who turns out to be the &quot;bad guy&quot;. He wants to be the cheif, and he really isn't interested in doing productive things, he wants to hunt instead. Piggy is the wise figure in this novel. His ideas always are the obviously correct thing to do, but because he is somewhat of a nerd, no one really listens to him and most of what he says is shot down.Throuought this book civilization goes down the drain. Jack eventually breaks off from the rest of the group with his hunters, and soon enough all the boys except for the little ones, Piggy and Ralph join his tribe to feast, dance and have fun.The conch, the shell that symbolized organization and power in the start of the novel, is smashed into thousands of pieces, which shows us that the morals and society of the boys has completely died. The beast, which all the boys are afraid of, symbolizes the fear that we all have of the unknown. It seemed that every word in Lord of the Flies had some deep hidden meaning, which i felt made the book tedious and confusing. Yes, it is a good book, but would i read it again? No."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"Lord of the Flies\\" by Steven Golding has been applauded by students, teachers and critics alike decade after decade. Infamous for it's profound symbolism, I believe \\"Lord of the Flies\\" gives readers a chance to take a step back and look at similar aspects of their own society with a critical eye.Set on an unknown island off the coast of England, a band of military-school bound boys find themselves stranded after a fatal plane crash, killing all accompanied adults, the plot of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" begins. Although generation after generation have taken \\"Lord of the Flies\\" for it's keen representation, I believe that most readers have also denied themselves half of the story, which Golding also brilliantly creates.Through reading and re-reading this thrilling novel, I have found that Golding not only creates a symbolic microcosm, but also puts forth so much realism and almost stereotypic attributes within his characters and makes each one almost real. I believe that the actual story that \\"Lord of the Flies\\" gives it's readers more than one can see at first glance. Each predominant character (i.e.- the protagonist, Ralph and his group of antagonists, Jack, Piggy and Simon) plays off one another to make a plot of it's own.Remember this, future readers; look at all aspects of this novel, you may find more than you bargained for"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I felt that this book was really well thought of in the first place. The idea is to have a few boys from a far away military camp crash in the middle of no where. They would have to survive on there own. Even Ralph the one who has the toughest time out of all the boys trying to be the leader but some retaliating must have been hard to come up with. Piggy the less suited for the tragedy was in need for help with after all of the harassment. The name piggy explains it all. Even before the disaster. Jack, the biggest savage of them all, was the most unhelpful. Between all of the fights and Piggies tragic ending, he was the one who caused the most problems. Even when they went hunting for Ralph he was the one with the blood thirsty eyes. The littleuns had problems all of the time being scared and all. The twins samneric must have been very horrified when the saw the (BEAST) or the dead man in the parachute. All of the sightings of the beast made the suspense even more. The rummaging through the forest in search of the beast all turned out to be rubbish. The ending of the book in my opinion was a rushing finish so I had no chance to enjoy it. I would recommend this book to all because it was touching in away and to all the kids it would be fun to have a shelter on a deserted island with no parents."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's The Lord of The Flies drastically starts out with about 13 kids stranded on a deserted island. these kids were recently in a Air plane crash going back from a school.They are stuck on a tropical Island .

It takes the cliched story of a plane wrecked group on a remote island and turns it into a thought provoking story of morals and reality. It starts with a plane crash on a remote island in which all of the children, which are boys from English Military Schools, live and (of coarse) al lof the adults die. Which creates a problem within an even bigger problem. The boys now have to to create a way to live on this island without the help and supervision of adults.So we start the book with Ralph and Piggy finding the conch, a symbolic shell that they use to summon the other boys and as a moderater. So they summon the other boys and they create their own rules and they vote Ralph as the leader. They decide that their only hope in being rescued is if they make a fire and a passing ship sees the smoke. Early on they realize that they need to create a form of life just as the adults would.But they aren't so lucky. As you would expect there are people who want to just have fun and go against Ralph. And the boy who sparks all of this is Jack. Throughout he is striving to become the leader. He is feels that hunting and getting meat is the number one priority. On the other hand Piggy and Ralph know that being rescued and staying together is the main priority. This of coarse caused Ralph to fude with Jack. This part of the book is the part that causes the whole thing to fall apart. I think that thisa is one of the things in the book that keeps me wanting to read it. It creates a real competitive feel to it and it makes you wonder when their angry climax.One of the events that causes a separation between Ralphs group and Jack's group is the time when Jack and his hunters are supposed to be watching the fire but they decide to go hunting instead. The fire goes out and of coarse right at that moment a ship goes by. Ralph naturally atacks Jack and causes them to become rivals to a greater extent.There are parts that make this book out to be a savage murderous tale. Two of the boys Piggy and Simon get murdered by the other boys. SImon in a accident where the boys get scared and think he is the beast. And Piggy is murdered when some of the boys get angry with him and drop a rock on his head. Although these deaths areunexpected they are needed to create the whole thing to just feel more crazy and makes you think afterwards about how their families will feel when they find out their children got killed but all the others lived.But i think that the major flaw in this book for me was the ending. It ended with the boys all running after Ralph trying to kill him and then being saved. I agree that it causes you to think at the end of the book about what will happen. But i think that it should have either told more of what happened when they got back or they shouldn't have been rescued. i agree though that it did leave you thinking which gives you a chance to create your own thoguht on it.This book makes you think about all of the things that you would be forced to give up if you were in there situation. As piggy says &quot;We did everything that grown ups would do. Why didn't it work?&quot; I think that even if the boys were replaced by adults it would still be the same, maybe a little tiny bit more civilized but not much.Over all this book gives you an adventure like no other, that is real and that you can relate to. It keeps you wondering how you would act in their situation and that is the most interesting part of this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the flies shows perfectly the dynamics of a group of military schoolboys. Changing as the line of command deteriorates. When they are put on the island after a plane crash. At first they follow reason make a signal fire collect food make shelter so that if there is a storm they will have somewhere to go. The two main powers are Ralph and jack. Ralph seems to the others to be a constricting adult. He pressures them to work and collect fruit tend to the fire instead of running around and playing games on the beach or hunting pigs to eat. Jack is the solution to this he offers a separate tribe to join instead. They paint their faces hide in wait of pigs and develop strategies to track them down. Eventually tempted by the new power most of the boys move over to jacks tribe because they are sick of work and want meat instead of fruit to eat. When there are only a few left with Ralph. Ralph and piggy try to confront the lack of interest in getting rescued also piggy needs his glasses back. There is a scene where piggy gets a rock dropped on him and Ralph fights with jack. As a spear glances off his side Ralph turns and runs to hide in a thick thorn bush the next day when they hunt him. His friends who were forced into the other tribe betray him and before he can be smoked out, he breaks their ranks. Later he hides under another bush in a shadow but Rodger finds him. As they chase Ralph shelters are bursting into flame.The ending leaves you hanging you don't really know what is going to happen I didn't really like that though you do get to just make it up yourself. They kill each other. Piggy Simon and one other a boy with a mark on his face goes missing early on. As soon as the navel officer is on the beach they just stop forget that they are all savages or perhaps they remember that killing is wrong and they should have been organized. With the words&quot; what have you been doing?&quot; they all change. Also the torture of am and Eric with spears into joining the tribe and leaving Ralph by himself.The whole book Ralph and Jack are fighting each other this seems to be more of the storyline then the obvious one of boys being stuck on an island and what they do. It Seems that its the fight between their morals and hope on being rescued. Ralph gets his hope from piggy and Jack to help ease the pain of never being rescued starts the tribe of hunters. Then he can take out his pain on tracking the pigs and learning the art of hunting.Lastly Simon talking to a pigs head is just plain weird and i can understand why they take it out of the book for the movie except that this is the only reason that the book is called lord of the flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's Lord of the Flies is a great book.

It is full of symbolism and it has been said to be many things, such as allegories on things as varied as Christianity to Psychology.

Humans have qualities which put us above the rest, but if we stray from our systems then we become nothing more than animals ourselves. (basically a lesson I learned)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was a well-written book, chock-full of symbolism and motifs and themes. However, some of the prose I disliked, and the plot skipped weeks at a time. The setting of the story is an idyllic island. The island is marred, however, by the arrival of a plane of boys that crashes on the island, who were being carried away from wartime Britain. The story probably occurs sometime during World War II. The incident that incites the conflict between Ralph and Jack, the characters who represent pragmatic leadership versus violent evil, is the vote for chief of the island. Jack loses bitterly to Ralph, his only support being his own reluctant choir (he is head choirboy). Ralph, ever the eager diplomat, awards Jack the choir as his to command. Jack declares the choir the hunters, which foreshadows how they will begin to hunt Ralph. The tribe, though, is still firmly behind Ralph and his belief in democracy and rules.The book progresses into the essential conflict between Ralph and Jack, as several deaths fuel the fire. The book is essentially a social allegory, a comment on the untamable brutality of humankind.The savagery of this book makes some shocking points about human brutality, and forces the reader to look inward and see some of that brutality in herself. The reader must have patience to adjust to the writing style, but the allegory about the inescapable violence of humanity is powerful and disturbing. Overall reading this book is rewarding."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'm sure this review won't get any &quot;helpful&quot; votes, but here are my thoughts. Somehow, this book wasn't required reading in any of my high school or college classes, so I had no idea what it was about when I picked it up (on a flight on my honeymoon, no less). I thought it was a great read. I'm not one to get into allegorical type books or story lines, but this one was good. The author did a great job of presenting a microcosm of the best and worst sides of human behavior, or so I thought. I thought the final page ended the book perfectly. The kids get rescued from completely destroying themselves by adults, who are in fact part of a much larger world/society/culture trying to, well, destroy each other. Perfect ending."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I've heard people talk about how unrealistic this book is.

I'm sure a lot of readers say, &quot;If it were me on that island, things would've worked.&quot; That's even sadder than the teacher thing. If presented with the situation, we'd ALL be savages. Every single one of us. It's just mankind's nature. There's no problem with embracing one's nature, contrary to popular belief. Anywho, this book is not only exciting, insightful, gritty, and realistic, it's also very truthful. Read this book and see for yourself.

What if it was to happen to you? Would you know what to do to survive? Lord of the Flies by William Golding brings Golding's moral philosophy into an intriguing story of a group of boys crash landing on a deserted island. As the boys attempt to survive, new problems arise from the lack of society that force the boys back to the clutches of their natural instincts.A group of British schoolboys crash land on an uninhabited island somewhere in the ocean. With the only adult on the plane being killed in the crash, the two oldest of the boys, Ralph and Jack, begin a power struggle to be the leader of the boys. Ralph begins his life on the island by trying to incorporate a democracy within the group of boys. The boys then vote for a leader and they almost unanimously choose Ralph. The boys show their wish for society by making some rules to abide by. From the moment Ralph was voted leader, Jack was always his rival, whether he showed it or not. To show his strength, Jack starts a group of hunters that savagely kill the wild pigs on the island. The younger children of the island have their own problem, dealing with the fear of \\"The Beastie\\" supposedly a giant snake this imaginary beast develops into a creature that all of the boys' fear. Little do they know how the once imaginary beast would affect their lives. After Ralph confronts Jack about his hunters acting savagely Jack is enraged and orders a re-vote for leader. Once again, Ralph is voted leader again and Jack leaves the tribe to form his own group. To add to the conflict between them, the rest of the boys split off into two groups following either Ralph or Jack as their leader. To the reader this starts off as being a childish game, but when children start getting killed it evolves into a deadly struggle for power between the groups.This book is taught in almost every school system in the country giving a new perspective of human nature with its immense amount of symbolism throughout it. Depending on how you look at it the book can be broken down into different kinds of symbolism including human civilization, Freudian Psychology, and a religious allegory. As a reader, I personally saw the book as a vision of human civilization in which the island is a microcosm of the world. The main characters each represent an aspect of human society including human virtues, violence, civilization, intellect, and peace. Aside from the characters, key objects in the story also represent something on a higher term. In one reading it may not be possible to catch every symbol within the book, which may encourage you to read it more than once.Everyone who reads this book should be able to find a way to relate it to the world today. One of the best things about this book is that the way someone interprets the symbols is different from the next person. The general audience of this book is high school students who were forced to read it for an assignment, I being one of them. But I believe this book can be enjoyable to anyone of almost any age if they have an open mind. In my opinion, one of the main reasons why a student wouldn't like this book would be because they were forced to read it, and didn't really read deeply to discover all of the hidden meanings. But if you are open minded and enjoy a good book I suggest reading the adventurous eye-opening book, Lord of the Flies by William Golding.Golding, William. Lord of the Flies.

It may seem that it doesn't make a lot of sense at first but once you understand it is really quite good. Before the book begins a plane, with a group of young school kids, crashes in the middle of the ocean near an island. This has already occurred before the book begins. The book begins with a kid walking around the island trying to figure out were he is. His name is Ralph. He is an important kid in the book. While he is walking he finds another kid whose name is Piggy. Piggy and Ralph are two of the main characters.Ralph and Piggy realize that they are on an island with no adults. Ralph decides that for them to have the best chances of survival they must find all of the people on the island. To do this he uses a conch shell to make a noise. The noise calls all of the kids towards him. There are several groups of kids and even a boys choir that comes to the meeting. The conch shell represents power and leadership to the kids. The kids form a working relationship and they live with each other for a while. Then something drastically changes.This is a great book about how kids can take leadership and power. They were very organized while doing this but they still found a few set backs on their way. It also demonstrated how people can become very savage. This is one of my favorite books that I have read. I would recommend The Lord of the Flies to anyone that enjoys reading adventure and suspense novels."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's Lord of the Flies is a very well written novel set on a desert island during war times. This novel faces many issues that include growing up and maturity, working together, lost innocence, survival, and instinct. All of these themes are tackled by a group of schoolboys whose plane has been shot down during a war. The description of the condition of the boys and the island scene is very vivid. I was able to form a mental picture of the scenes easily. Left to fend for themselves, the boys go through many experiences to survive. Through these many grueling experiences, they must learn to hunt, cooperate with one another, fight for power among the group, and learn to adjust to living in the wild alone, without protection. In this book, the savage instinct of humans is portrayed, at times becoming a bit too graphic for me. However, all humans have instincts, therefore it was necessary to show these savage instincts to receive the full effects of being alone in the wild fending for yourself. I liked how the boys in this novel, through their ups and downs, learned to work together to make their own kind of civilization, which fit their needs accordingly. I would recommend this book for people of any age who enjoy novels that entail survival, which was the main theme of this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this was a well thought out and over all interesting book. it shows more than just how the boys manage to survive out in the wilderness all alone. it also shows how society treats one another and that we put our own selves first all of the time without taking the time out of our busy schedules to help someone in need. There are also a lot of symbols in the book that represent more than they actually stand for in the story. This was a book that was 'short sweet and to the point' with a bit of grossness that might make your skin crawl."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This seemingly short book about a group of boys marooned in an island has more to it than simple adventures. It does not only shows how each boy (of varying ages) responds to his predicament, but also deals with man's nature & the society through symbolisms.It is inate in us to differentiate good & evil, & this characteristic is further strengthened by the society's norms. Ralph represents our logical side which is continuously governed by reason (\\"Piggy\\"). Both Ralph & Piggy embody our continuous search for civilization & order. However, also inate in us, is a brewing desire to do what we really want, no matter how unjustly or incorrect it is. Jack portrays this aggressive behavior.In an ideal environment, it is common for men to have desires but these can only be manifested & carried it out if they comply with society's set rules. However, this is not the usual case. The catastrophe faced by the boys only magnifies society's imperfections. These ills cannot be easily cured on a superficial level. The success or breakdown in society can all be traced to man's inner stability."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I have read this book 4 times, and it gets more and more excting each time i read it. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good, short adventure. This book is one of the more intresting picees of litteratre I have read. This book is full of symbols relating to todays culture, and i thank my english teacher for making me read this book a 4th time. This book deserves a place on everybody's shelf!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies by William Golding wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I thought that the idea of the book was very good and the theme was well thought out, but i don't think it was well written. Some parts could have been better, but it was interesting. Somethings I disliked were that there were only boys on the island and no girls. If there were girls I think the story would have been different. I also didn't like how Piggy died. I think the book would have had a better ending if Piggy stayed alive.Some things that i liked about the book were most of it was realistic. The schoolboys made rules for themselves, and there became two sides. I liked how the characters were described and how the meanings of their names mathed their actual names."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is about a group of boys whose plane is shot down on a deserted island. They are also the only survivors on the whole plane. This novel takes place in the late 1990's. The boys our forced to live on their own, and do whatever is possible to keep them alive. Obviously, everything isn't working out just the way they would have liked it to, and they have to face many troubles along the way. Later on in the book, the boys end up turning on each other. I enjoyed reading how they interacted in such a tough situation. I could never image what I would do in that type of situation, and hearing how other people reacted was neat. Nobody would ever think something like this could happen, and very few people would be able to survive living alone on a deserted island. It shows the reality of a true human society because people really are selfish and cruel and will do anything to look out for themselves. It really makes you think about human instincts. Soon after, when you are under the pressure of survival you will end up emotionally breaking down, and doing what is best for you, and only you. I think this book would be most suitable for a teenage, adventurous boy. Lord of the Flies is one of those books that keeps you wondering what will happen to the boys next, and you keep on reading. Because of its intriguing plot of survival of a young crowd, the book was hard to put down."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding was a great book that took some time to develop. I at first thought that this book would not keep my attention. As I read on I became more and more interested in this book. The idea of having a group of children varying in age stranded on an island was very fascinating. I didn't know how they would react to this situation they were placed in and that's part of the reason this book kept my interest.At first the kids thought it was fun not having any adult supervision. The boys agree to work together with Ralph trying to maintain order by assigning various chores such as keeping a signal fire going that they started with piggy's glasses and gathering food. However, the chores stop being done and their society breaks down. This reaches its peak when Ralph sees a ship in the distance and the signal fire is out. The hunting boys were supposed to keep it going and before Ralph can scold them they come back with a kill. This turns the kid's loyalty toward Jack. I thought this was the most interesting part of this book. I enjoyed how it showed the struggle in society between order and lack of it. As jack gains power among the boys, Ralph finds himself suddenly being hunted by his former friends. These kids turned savages show no remorse when they kill one of their own with there bare hands and teeth. I found it very compelling how these civilized kids can suddenly deliberately want to kill one of there former friends. However, the reason I gave this book a three out of five was the ending. There was great action throughout the book and then it suddenly ends just by Ralph running out of the jungle to see a British Naval Officer.This books characters exemplify three distinct aspects of human nature. Jack shows mans roots in his primitive behavior. He opts to hunt and be free, shirking the duties that could ultimately rescue him. Ralph's character shows the desire of man to be civilized yet be free and wild as well. He wants to be rescued but at other times is intrigued by the hunt and wild side of human nature. He shows his desire to be rescued by trying to keep order and have chores. Oppositely, he is overwhelmed by the hunt and ultimately kills his friend in the fatal attack on the beach. Finally, Piggy is on the opposite spectrum from Jack. He is constantly reminding the others of the proper way to act and mentions adult's behavior as an example. These characters represent the constant struggles that live inside mankind in everyday life.In conclusion, this was a great book to read. The plot was exciting with the exception of the mundane ending. It is a book that can be read on many levels and with characters that represent struggles that continuously plague the human mind. I gave this book a three out of five and would recommend others to check it out."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Critique of Lord of the Flies written by William Golding in 1954. Lord of the Flies is about a group of young English boys whose planes crashes onto a remote island. Throughout the novel the boys gradually changed from civilized English boys to small savages that need to survive. The author used many metaphors and Imagery to describe the situations and places on the island. All the places in the island where described very well for example when Ralph first used the conch to call the other boys. The author says, \\"Ralph pursed his lips and squirted air into the shell, which emitted a low, farting noise\\"(Golding 15). That line tells the reader exactly how he blew the conch and he described how he put his lips on it and what sound it made. He uses very descriptive words in that line and the reader feels like they are standing right next too them. The authors metaphors are also another good use of litery technique it in the book. William Golding also uses alliteration in this next example. This quote is when Jack is ready to hunt the beast. \\"He gave a wild whoop and leapt down to the pale sand\\"(Golding 52). \\"Wild whoop\\" would be alliteration and could also be considered onomapeia. The \\"pale sand\\" is a metaphor because it described what the sand looked like. William Golding used many literary techniques in this book, which make the book more interesting and fun to read. Lord of the Flies by William Golding was very interesting and fun too read. I liked how the author described many aspects of the island and the creatures that lived on it. The book was very detailed so I always knew what was going on, because it felt like I was right there. I enjoyed reading Lord of the Flies because it was very interesting. It described so many things that I could imagine being next to one of the characters. Lord of The Flies proved to be a great adventure novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read adventure novels and people who enjoy a novel with a good ending.Works Citied1.) Golding, William. Lord of the Flies.

Well, I think that symbolism is based on your own opinion. We don't know that the author meant to have this particular thing represent this particular idea. When you get to the story itself, the first four chapters and the last four chapters are worth a read. However, everything in between I found to be very boring and you find yourself having to stop and re-read certain things because you forget what is happening; there is no action to help keep you up to speed.Just FYI, I didn't have to read this book for school. I read it in my spare time. From what I understand, those who must read it for school have a far lower opinion of this novel, but I don't know that for a fact."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies begins in complete chaos. A group of young boys are stranded on a tropical island after their military school plane was shot down. All the adults onboard were killed, so the boys were completely alone. Even without the supervision and direction of parents to help them, the boys try to get organized. The pick a leader, establish a set of &quot;laws&quot; for the island, and make plans for their survival.Throughout the book, there is one boy who is rediculed at every chance, and only one boy tries to defend him. There is a constant battle for power between the boys named Ralph, who is sensible and only concerned with getting rescued, and the boy called Jack, who is a savage and only thinks of hunting pigs and having fun. After heated arguments that split the boys in two, raids by the hunters that destroy Ralph's shelter and his only chance of making fire, and the murder of two boys by Jack's tribe, the battle escalates to a the whole island going up in flames while the hunters try to flush out their prey... Ralph.Golding uses a lot of desciption to make you feel as though this could actually happen. He creates a realistic microcosm (a little &quot;world&quot; that represents a bigger world), with a government and a trouble-maker, that shows what humans resort to in times of desperation. The climax of the book is a good surprise, but it ends too quickly without enough explaination to understand it easily. I enjoyed the story, but Golding repeats things too much, and I didn't even like those parts when I read them the first time. Jack talks about hunting too much, Ralph talks about keeping the fire going too much, and I hate the song the hunters sing. It repeats killing the beast and spilling its blood over and over, and they sing it all the time. Without these annoying repeats and the short boring periods spred throughout the book, I would say that the Lord of the Flies is a great story (but it is not written like one.)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book I found took a while to get into but had a good way of starting. I love the plot and how everything turns out at the end. The story starts of well but soon enough the children become scared because of the &quot;beast&quot;.The group is split into two. Ralph and Piggy end up by themselves and Jack and his tribe become a bit obbsessed with the beast. They are the hunters and almost become to caught up in being standed on the island and fending for themselves.They go to far and end up doing things that are quite shocking for anyone espeshally children. The group become to over the top and they end up just not caring about their old friends anymore.One of the main points in the book is the fire. They decide to make a fire and keep it going so that passing planes nad ships would be able to find them. When the fire is left to go out and a plane passes the island Ralph and Jack have the fight that almost leads to jacks death.The tribe and jack and piggy are always stealing and fighting and even when people get hurt and things are getting out of control. Alot of the book is very sad and it just shows you what could happen if people did get stranded on the island. Toward the end things are going crazy and before they find adults theey almost burn down the island trying to find Ralph.When the children suddenly become in contact with adults at the end again they act as if they have woken up from a very long dream. They start crying and everything hits them that has happened in the last few weeks. They tried to act like adults and make rules but things definatly didint go as smooth as im sure all of them wanted."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After The Lord of the Flies I had lots of mixed feelings. This book had its good and bad points. There were a few times when i got really into the book, but a lot of points where i found myself dozing off or just not paying attention to a single word i read on the page.I really liked the begging of the book. It seemed like this could have possibly happen. The kids on the island formed a small society and create a form of government and a system like I believe anyone stranded on the island would be.As the book progressed i became more and more less interested in the book. The author wrote a lot of the same ideas over and over like jacks going on and on about hunting. GET THE IDEA, CAN WE GET ON WITH THE REST OF THE STORY!After a while i lost the sense of the characters actions being realistic. Jack forms a tribe that splits off of the rest of the kids. His tribe seems to be based on hunting and spilling blood. They start singing &quot;KILL THE BEAST! CUT HIS THROAT! SPILL HIS BLOOD!&quot; Which is the most random thing i can ever imagine anyone doing.Golding in my mind never actually explains how the kids survive. The kids just live you don't really hear about how they find the fruit or the water. None of the kids ever complains (except about mean over and over...) about things like sunburns or lack of food being cold, things you would expect from a bunch of young kids trapped on a tropical island in the middle of nowhere.Even though Golding does not address the main points in my mind, the points he does address he does very well. Ralph has a strong will to get rescued and him and piggy seem to be the only ones that are actually trying to get rescued. But Golding creates this beast that started out as just a nightmare into the kids killing each other because they are so paranoid. I wonder how the kids ever became so violent and bloodthirsty.All in all i didn't like the book. But for people who like a very fantastic and random story in no way could be true; you might like it. If you are looking to read a serious book about survival in the wild i suggest hatchet which is very good in describing the way a boy learns to live (emphasis on the learns). He does not just run around and kill things like the kids in LOTF."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read Lord of the Flies knowing it's a classic and for the most part I thought it was pretty good. It details the story of young boys stranded on an island after a plane crash. At first, the primary character of the novel, Ralph, heads the dictatorship that begins, but as time passes, Ralph comes to blow with Jack. Where Ralph sees the boys' primary concern being signaling a passing ship for help, Jack is concerned with hunting. So, two groups emerge with Ralph and Jack as the leaders. After that, some very dramatic and interesting happenings take place as the reader sees savagery and visciousness develop amongst the boys.The only real problem I had with the story was the lack of explanation about the boys. The novel starts after the plane crash has taken place and the author never offers an explanation for who these boys are or where they were going. Also, I found it somewhat unrealistic the way in which the boys seemed to get along so well on their own. They didn't seem nearly as frightened as I'd imagine boys would be in their place in reality.Overall, I say this book is worth reading if you're interested. It's not too long and has a pretty good story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was amazed to find that so many people gave this book a bad review! It takes an amazing look at humanity, and our cruel primal nature. Anyone would start to turn on their friends after being stuck on an island, especially when everyone is fighting for power and leadership! That is the way of nature.Humans may be the &quot;superior being&quot;, but we are all animals inside. We all have the primal feelings, and once we are taken out of civilized culture, our true nature begins to shine through. That is exactly what Golding explains and symbolizes in this breath-taking story.Anyone who gave this a bad review either does not comprehend the story and situation, or they are to wrapped up in the idea that humans are \\"too good\\" to turn cannibalistic or become murderers. Young BOYS, especially, have a certain \\"macho\\" aura, and they all have the obsessive need of being a leader. Those saying that this is \\"unrealistic\\" obviously have not had or been around children. There is nothing as simple or as cruel as a child."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The author, in writing about a group of plane-wrecked children's struggle to survive on an island, has elegantly revealed the structure and workings of the human psyche.

However, it is not based on either of the movies, the music has been soley adapted and composed based on the original novel. So call it, if you will, a novel score. It sticks to much more of the primal and savage feelings that the book displays. It also dives much deeper into the emotions and behaviors or the characters than any film ever could.

I felt there were quite a few changes the author could have made to the story. There was a lot of symbolism and many British terms I didn't understand, making the book a little confusing at times. I also disagree with how Golding killed off the littlun with the birthmark, Simon, and Piggy. I thought there was just something wrong about killing off three young children in such a violent manner but I also think it was needed to make a very strong point about how you may think that you know a person but on the inside they could be someone totally different.There were some good aspects of the book. I liked the way the author described the environment the boys were in. It was very thorough and it gives you a good understanding of the conditions they are living in and a good mental image with out going into too much detail. I also thought it was interesting how Golding divided the boys into two separate societies. I felt it demonstrated the two sides of society very well. It shows that on the surface society seems organized and well-governed but sometimes underneath it all people can be savage, cruel, and sadistic to one another.Overall I felt that this book was well written and unlike most books I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading and understands symbolism."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies takes place on a small deserted island where a plane full of young boys has crashed. It is about the obstacles that the boys overcome on this island without adults, and how their different characters and ideas clash. The main characters are Ralph, Jack and Piggy. Ralph is the appointed leader who is constantly challenged by Jack who believes he is important because he was the choir leader at school. Piggy is unaccepted by everyone except Ralph who sees Piggy's intelligence. This book is about how a group of boys behave with no adults and no rules.A significant moment in this book is in the first chapter when Ralph blows the conch shell and all of the boys come to him. This moment shows the power of the conch shell and the power it gives to someone who blows it. This is important because power and power struggles are definitely apparent in this book.I would recommend Lord of the Flies to people who enjoy books about children trying to survive without any adults. Also people who like to read books which show some of the extremes humans can go when there is no one in control. I would suggest people who don't like graphic descriptions of violence not to read some scenes in this book. I personally found the book to be a bit of a slow read, and sometimes the descriptions got really long, thus making the book rather boring.I feel that the author, William Golding, of Lord of the Flies is a good author. Because he uses so much description of the boys, the island, and of the boys' actions it is very easy to visualize what is happening. Also he writes in such a way that it makes the book seem real, like this really happened. Lord of the Flies is a very well written book. For me the mark of a good writer is making it possible for me, the reader, to connect to the book, and characters. So I feel that Lord of the Flies is very well written."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies begins with an airplane crash. The plane was carrying boys from a British school. The boys find themselves on a deserted island without any adults. A boy by the name Ralph is chosen as the chief, and Jack gets jealous. Jack leads the boys that were a choir and they are elected as the hunters. The small children are given the name \\"littluns,\\" and don't usually do any work at all. Sam and Eric, the twins, work at the top of the mountain to keep a fire going in case of a boat or plane passing by. Piggy, an outcast of the group, is useful in only the fact that he has glasses that are used to light the fire. Rumors of a beast on the island spread. One night, a pilot parachutes onto the island and dies on impact. Sam and Eric assume that it is the Beast, and frighten the boys with their story. Jack, who is starving for power at this point, decides to lead the boys to another part of the island to begin a tribe. Ralph and Piggy remain in the shelters. Jack's hunters go from boys to animals- smearing paint on their faces and hunting. Jack and the hunters tie up a boy, Wilfred, for no apparent reason. Simon, a boy of good sense, realizes that the Beast is only a dead pilot and frantically runs to tell Jack and the others. They think that the Beast has posessed Simon and kill him. Piggy and Ralph take part in this, but they cannot figure out why they did so. Eventually another boy is killed and a couple are captured. Ralph tries to hide from Jack and the hunters. Finally, a naval ship comes to rescue the boys, but Ralph cries as they leave the island because he knows that the boys have lost their innocence.This book displays a good sense of what society can be today. Although people may seem civilized, we are to some extent barbaric in the ways we live. Many are hungry for power and money when, really, these are not essential to life in any form. The search for an idol in the story was mostly to give the boys something to do. It is unfortunate that even today, as innocent as it may seem, people have created idols. They are being deceived. If people could realize that survival on Earth is only possible through accepting Christ and having a relationship with God, then they would not be so deceived. This book was a good lesson in how our lives can turn messy if we don't follow instructions and rules set before us."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book has a great plot, a group of shipwrecked boys gone wild, killing multiple people. I liked the book except for one major part, the book was Extremely descriptive. Whole pages would be devoted to describing the island scenery before anything actually happened."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A group of English schoolboys, while being evacuated from England during World War II, fall out of a crashing airplane. They land on a tropical island devoid of adults and start their own society. So begins Lord of the Flies, by William Golding.There are three main characters in this book: Ralph, Piggy, and Jack. Ralph is strong and sensible. He is confident that they will be rescued and meanwhile works to make the island a better place. Piggy is obese and a social outcast. However, he is very wise and tries to advise Ralph, because Ralph is his only friend. Ralph&#65533;s archenemy, Jack, is bossy. He grows a love for hunting and violence.Right after the crash landing on the island, Ralph finds a conch shell and blows on it, gathering all the boys on the island. He decides there should be an election to determine a chief of the island. Ralph represents democracy. He gets elected chief, and does his best to make sure that everyone is equal. Ralph starts a fire on a mountain with Piggy&#65533;s eyeglasses, hoping that passing ships will see a smoke signal. Shelters are built on the shore and food is plentiful. The boys are enchanted by the idea of their own world that they control.But inevitably, disturbing events start to occur. A boy sees a &#65533;snake thing&#65533; in the woods and other see monsters. This gets everyone frightened. Soon a mission is started to find and kill the &#65533;beast.&#65533;Later, after Jack kills a pig, he develops a love for hunting. With an army of boys he starts hunting for pigs. They invent a game in which they form a circle. Another boy comes into the middle of the circle, and the boys on the outside beat him, chanting, &#65533;Kill the pig! Cut her throat! Spill her blood!&#65533; Several boys are injured as a result of this violent ritual.Jack also becomes very rebellious against Ralph and his leadership. For one, Jack is apathetic about the fire on the mountain. He doesn&#65533;t see that the fire is the only way to be rescued. Jack represents totalitarianism and dictator ship.Despite being very creative and original, the book has some weaknesses. For one, it paints a very pessimistic view of mankind. It implies that kids are not inherently innocent, but instead evil when deprived of law and order. Lord of the Flies can also get boring at times. Hunting for pigs, keeping the fire going, finding the beast: these themes reappear so many times it feels repetitive. Too much description also causes the book to be monotonous at times. However, the thrilling climax more than makes up for these minor weaknesses.Golding&#65533;s writing style is usually both interesting and engaging. It offers insight into what would happen to &#65533;innocent&#65533; children when in a world of their own, without parents and authority. In the end, everything turns out fine, but only after an exciting chase and battle. On the surface, Lord of the Flies is an adventure story about boys trapped on a tropical island. But if you look deeper, it is a parable about the true nature of people."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's Lord of the Flies is written about kids marooned in an island and how they survive.This book is very thrilling and interesting the readers what is going to happen next. The story's beginning is that English kids are cast away in the coral island because of the plane crash. They choose Ralph as a chief and start building own community to survive and to be rescued. They explore the island and hunt a pig for food and make a fire as a SOS signal. The community is working at first. But little by little the community is being broken up. Finally some kids pick Jack as a leader and form the other community. When I read this book, I felt how difficult to keep people together. It's not easy to satisfy all people in a community, even people can communicate each other. There is always a conflict we cannot solve by talking between people. And the other thing I found is that happy thing doesn't always happen in a life. Some scenes, like Piggy's death, might be disgusting. But the life is usually full of disasters. We have to accept those things. I learned we should not live in a dream world. A bad thing can happen anytime. And it is important whether we can overcome it. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord Of the Flies is a good book, but graphic.

Without being too cynical or anything, this book has just one major problem in my humble opinion: for those of us who could really give a hoot about botany, this guy writes far too much junk about what the trees and bushes and such look like. All throughout the book I found myself saying, &quot;Okay, they're on a deserted island with lots of trees, bushes! I get it already!

While it might have some important messages and symbolism, it is all buried too deep between the lines. It projects the problems of society onto a group of boys plane wrecked on an abandoned island; in the beginning they all attempt to survive and use the resources that are available, but as they continue to be marooned on the island, their little society becomes corrupted as they become violent and manipulative. The multiple plots, many characters, and headache-inducing descriptions all made this book tedious and unpleasant to read, especially since I had to do so unwillingly for school. I found the fact that the author had to use symbolism for every point he wanted to make, such as the boys turning into monsters, and the pig's skull, got really tiring and boring to read. While this book is considered a classic and I suppose it has its relevancy after all these years, I would not reccomend wasting your time on it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the flies is an amazing book. It is a survivol book because the plane evacuating some students got shot down in the middle of a war. the students get sranded on a small Island and it is up to them to survie."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Have you ever thought about being stranded on an island with a bunch of other boys? Well that's exactly what happens to the main character named Ralph in the book Lord of the Flies. Lord of the Flies is a realistic fiction chapter book written by William Golding. The plot of the story is fairly simple, a bunch of boys get stranded on an island and try to get rescued and not lose their minds. The main characters in the story are Ralph, Jack and Piggy. The boy named Ralph is the character the whole story is basically built around. The boy named Jack is the bad guy in the story. Jack and Ralph start out finding each ok but then start to have problems later in the story. Piggy is probably the smartest out of all the boys. Piggy has asthma and is overweight so he can't do that much manual labor. I personally think that Piggy is the best character in the story. In Lord of the Flies there are beasts and caves and wild bore hunts. The story has a lot of adventure and savageness to it.I really liked Lord of the Flies. I think this story really expresses the point that we need grownups to keep children in place. I've always liked realistic fiction books. They usually have a lot of action and adventure. Lord of the Flies has a lot of action and adventure in it. So if you enjoy books like that I think you should read Lord of the Flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book The Lord of the Flies by William Golding is an exciting novel about plane crash that leaves only boys on a desert island. The boys on the island start civilized and organized, but quickly break away from civility and erupt into chaos. Golding offers highly developed characters such as the main character Ralph; he starts out as the chief of the boys. He is a suitable leader, and he represents what is right and logical. Another boy who becomes his adviser is piggy. He is not respected on the island, but Ralph sees that he is actually very wise and values his ideas. The antagonist of the book is jack, who you will learn to hate throughout the book, at first he seems like a simple bully, but as innocence is lost form the island he turns into a controlling dictator.What is so interesting about this book is the spontaneous events that keep you interested. Right when the book starts to get slow at some times, Golding introduces a new struggle or something new on the island. The theme of this book is the loss of innocence of the boys. At the beginning are an organized democracy, when times get harder on the island the boys could go as far as murder just for the pure bloodlust of it. It shows that when boys have no supervision or adults implanting good morals on them they start wondering how much they can get away with. Golding shows that society on the island it not responsible enough to plan for the future and instead they just give into simple wants. This is allegorical for Freud's theory of Id, ego, and superego. The boys lead on the island, lead by jack are the id. They only follow simple wants and do not look at the bigger picture, This proves harmful because a group of boys without w set of rules and only governed by simple wants turns into savagery.The Lord of the Flies is more than just another survival story; it had a much deeper meaning. One of he characters in the story is a perfect example of a Christ figure, he represents what is innocent and pure, but he passes along with the presence of innocence on the island.William Golding does a wonderful job of supplying very distinct images on the island. His writing style changes throughout the book from calm and orderly to chaos and complete anarchy. He supplies very tense moments and exciting events on the island. He doesn't get too much in details with the character's emotions, he doesn't go out and say them. He has a way of showing the characters emotions through their actions towards other characters.I suggest this book to anyone who will enjoy a thrilling plotline. This is a very suitable book for young adults around 9th and 10th grade. This book is also very intriguing for any guy. Girls can enjoy it, but I think that it was more aimed towards guys. It teaches good moral lessons about how order is necessary to survive and we a nothing but savages without it. The Lord of the Flies is an excellent piece of literature that will be read for many years to come."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was fortunate to read this book in the 8th grade, it explained all the social interactions of Junior High School. Unfortunately many people never get past Junior High society. The popularity of Survivor has demonstrated this, the weak, the different, and the above average are rejected by the collective might of the average and mediocre. No dissent or thought is encouraged or permitted. An elite few determine what is correct and acceptable. Here is the social model of Liberalism, Socialism, and Communism, you are free to say whatever you want, as long as you agree with them. Personal attacks replace any debate on issues. It is no wonder this book is no longer used in public schools, it raises to many embarrassing issues."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In this enticing novel, Golding illustrates the effects of society--or lack of it--on our human nature. He argues that human beings in a society need set of collective guidelines to keep order and prevent chaos.Golding uses thoughtful symbols on the island to enhance his book. The conch is the symbol of order in society. Just landing on the island, the boys first used the conch to assemble and to speak, eventually, however, they got rid of it, and chaos started to reign.Besides the use of sophisticated symbols, Golding assembles very thoughtful characters to form his plot. Simon's encounter with the pig's head makes him the Messiah archetype, or the rational being on the Island who alone discovers the spuriousness of the Beast. Beside his parallel encounter of the devil in the wilderness, Simon is the ultimate sacrifice who gets killed by his evil friends. Ralph is the primary representative of order, civilization, and productive leadership in the novel. While most of the other boys initially are concerned with playing, having fun, and avoiding work, Ralph sets about building huts and thinking of ways to maximize their chances of being rescued. Jack is the novel's primary representative of the instinct of savagery, violence, and the desire for power, making him the antithesis of Ralph.I personally learned a lot about group work from this novel. Personal themes that I found important were: staying focused on your goals and take your responsibility seriously. In the novel, the goals of the boys started shifting, from lightening a fire to be rescued, to killing the Beast and chasing a wild dream of their imagination. Because the boys digressed from their supposed roles on the island, and instead roamed the island hunting and searching for the Beast, they turned into savages and delayed their rescue. Also responsibility is a huge lesson in the novel. When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire--which had been the hunters' responsibility to maintain--has burned out. Jack and his followers not only ruined their own chances of being rescued but their friends' as well. To be successful in a group project, as a whole we must focus on our goals and not get distracted. In addition, each person might do their responsibility well because other group members are counting on them.Overall I thought Golding's novel had strong themes with great usage of symbolism."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Was it Ronald Reagan who said, in effect, that man is always one generation away from barbarism, with the necessity of civilizing each generation anew? Well, if it wasn't Reagan, then it was someone else, because I didn't come up with it myself. The thin line between civilized man and the barbaric has proven to be rich material for a number of writers. But there is a reason LORD OF THE FLIES, William Golding's classic about a group of boys stranded on an island, stands out.By focusing on children, Golding is able to use the characters in the book to maximum effect. As the young have not yet been fully socialized, their devolution into barbarism, as happens when the group of boys splinters and they turn on one another, is more effective. And each boy can play an archetype, Ralph the symbol of civilization and order, Piggy representing man's intellect that has allowed him to evolve from the brute to the gentleman, Jack the killer in the core of each of us, with a degree of realism that would seem more stiff and artificial if these were adults.Golding realized that the push into savagery need not be a hard one, and little clues are sprinkled throughout the text symbolizing this. Jack was the head of a choir group, bringing to mind sounds of harmony, and symbolizing the religious and its black letter rules against killing. Yet it is Jack who immediately rebels against the authority of the group and the order it represents, going off first to do the killing of animals, then forming a rival authority that shows an equal disregard for human life. Even his name - Jack. Like that other Jack of British fame - the Ripper. The kiln of British society fails to completely purge man of his cruel nature.The most potent symbol, though, is the beast that the boys believe inhabits the island. It does. But that beast is within themselves, as even a casual reader could deduce.Finally, when the boys are rescued, the man who finds them cannot help but ask, incredulously, that they are British, right? Britain was seen as the height of a civilized society, not like those savages in the lands of its mighty empire. But, oh, how short that distance really is. That the rescuer is an officer with the British Navy, not only a symbol of a great power, but the force which kept world order through its policing of the seas, heightens the effect still more.THE LORD OF THE FLIES did not become a classic simply by being assigned to high school students year after year. It is a worthwhile read at any age."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"great book, great storyi've seen the movie way too many times to be surprised by anything in the book, but i've always wanted read itto think the book is far fetched or impossible is stupidity, the book is right on the money, thats what makes it so scary, in todays world, a plane load of schoolboys stranded on a island would do much, much worse to each other for survival and control"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of those I wish I'd read earlier in life - but there it was on vacation with me and I couldn't put it down.

Read this!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies By William Golding: Book ReviewBy: Conlan MuellerThe author of Lord of the Flies, William Golding, has many ways of showing the meaning of the book. The terrible human quality that man has, turning savage, doing anything for his own survival, in times of great crisis. Golding shows this point in many ways. He uses a variety of metaphors throughout the story. Golding also bluntly shows this in the book. Golding was born in Cornwall, England in 1911. Lord of the Flies was William Golding's first novel out of many, published in 1954. Peter Brooke made a movie, The Lord of the Flies in 1963. After The Lord of the Flies Golding wrote a variety of novels, essays, and plays. He also won the \\"Booker Prize\\" for one of his novels, Rites of Passage. William Golding lived eighty-two years and died in 1993. Golding does a great job of demonstrating his point of the tale, using school children representing mankind. One of the great ways he does so is with a simple conch shell that represents so much. In the beginning, the children use the conch shell to call a meeting, staying civilized. This is why when the shell shatters it is such a beautiful metaphor for all hopes of civilization being shattered and crushed at the same time. A different approach that Golding takes to simply represent this point is just stating that the children turned into a tribe of savages. Just using the word tribe throughout the story to talk about the group of children is a simple yet effective way that Golding establishes his point. The novel, Lord of the Flies has various strengths and weaknesses. One strength in this book is the use of many brilliant physical and psychological metaphors throughout the story. Though I couldn't establish many weaknesses of this book, I do think that William Golding could have elaborated a little bit more on the background and future of the children of the island. That is just my view though. Overall I believe that Lord of the Flies is beautifully written and does a wonderful job of illustrating this terrible characteristic of mankind."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Imagine, your on an island with only your peers, no adult supervision, no rules, many would call it a paradise, but when you emotions are pushed to the extreme, will you be able to survive. Golding asks this very same question in his novel \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"Set during WWII, a group of schoolboys are on their way home from school when their plane is shot down. The boys soon learn that they are stranded on an island with no adults. Many consider it a vacation, a break from their lives once ruled by strict headmasters and parents. The boys are able to start their own tribe with only a few rules. The tribe is ruled by one chief chosen by the boys.As the novel progresses many of the boys are stricken by talk of the \\"beastie.\\" Their tribe starts to divide between the boys who want to hunt and have fun,savages, and the boys who want to put forth most of their efforts into being rescued. The savages slowly start to loose of sense of their old lives, they begin to worship the \\"beastie.\\" They begin to have sacrifices for their god. Through the rest of the novel you slowly start to see how the human nature can be so easily tainted and how quickly we can loose sense of all things that make us human.This is a very well written book, it use of symbolism provides a deep meaning and moral to the story.It is and easy read,only about 200 pages. I would recommend this book to someone with an 8th grade reading level or above. It does have some suggestive themes that some may find inappropriate. If you are looking for a book about the evils of human nature or just a book full of excitement this would be a good one to pick up.*Written for my 10th grade English Class by C.R.K."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Aside: I've been reading Lord ofthe Flies at the same time I'vebeen reading The Shopaholic Tiesthe Knot.

But what I always want in a book review is a description of the binding, so here it is. The Classics of Modern Literature Series has done an excellent job in printing handsome modern classics, including 'The Godfather' and 'The Once and Future King'. This book has no dust jacket, the colors and lettering are printed on to the cover. I find this preferable, because dust jackets are a bit of a hassle. There is no lengthy introduction, and the last page of the book that has writing on it is the last page of the novel itself. So this book is very straightforward. It does have a bar code printed on the bottom of the back cover, which may not bother some, but I don't like it. Other than that though, I don't see how they could have done a much better publishing job. This is a great edition of a great novel."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The novel shows that there is an evil side inside man and how important rules and laws are to the human society, without them humans would just be animals. This is very important, history should not be repeated. Anarchy sounds nice, but humans need restrictions to prevent chaos. Golding wants the reader to realize human nature and accept it, that we NEED the rules.However, the reading can be at times difficult because time skips around and you don't really no when everything is happening and how long the boys have been stuck at the island. Ralph (the natural leader), Jack(helpful at first but then becomes the animal represented in all of us), and Piggy(the brains) are the main characters. Ralph and Piggy are the continuing forces of logic in the group, they hope that society will save them, the adults will come, they will be home, and everything will be all right.Ultimately the reason that their society fails is not because of the fire, the conch, or the logical Piggy's death; but because of the animal that resides in every human. In the end when the naval officer comes, he comes not because of the structured fire that Piggy wanted to create but by Jack's massive fire that was going to be used on Ralph. The savagery of the island led them to be saved. The line between savagery and civilization is thin. All the events that led to their rescue, show the increasing brutality of a person. The conch that symbolizes law and order breaks, Piggy dies, and Jack gives in to his animal nature faster than any on the island. Their society fails because of the restrained beast that is man who was only released on the island."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Why this book is mentioned so often. it is the type of book that strikes you during the read, but more importantly, it i a book yull think backto more often than you'll at first realize. it's an easy read, and a great one at that. definitely recommend."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies, by William GoldingIf you read any other review of this book, you'll find pages and pages of thematic analyses--this book just lends itself so well to such things! However, I hate analyzing books. It seems to take some of the magic out of the trick; I'm still amazed at the skill of the artist, but I no longer have that feeling of awe--I could do it if I practiced enough!This coming-of-age-like story revolves around a group of British boys who are evacuated from some place (it doesn't say where) by plane. Unfortunately, their plane goes down on an island, killing their pilot (the only adult amongst them). The boy who is our guide for most of the story finds a conch and blows it, causing all the stranded survivors to gather.Once the gathering is accomplished, Jack, who had been the leader of a choir, declares himself leader of all of them. The boys don't like this and so hold a vote, voting Ralph (our guide) into the position of Chief (interestingly, it's because he looks like a leader...not for any other better reason). Jack doesn't much like this, but he goes along with the group's decision, for a while.Piggy, the \\"scientist\\" of the group convinces them that the best bet for rescue is to build a fire and keep it going at all times. Ralph concurs, and so they start building shelters and set up a signal fire. Jack decides they need meat and heads into the forest to hunt. Finally finding pigs, he pulls off the fire-tenders to help him take down the animal.Of course, that's the moment when a boat appears in the distance. Ralph sees it, and looks to see if their smoke is visible. Finding it's not, he tears through the forest and catches Jack and his \\"Hunters\\" celebrating their kill. He chastens the lot of them, further widening the gap between himself and Jack.Their civility devolves further from there resulting in further falls from grace, up to and including murder. In fact, they're about to kill Ralph when a Navy Clipper shows up to rescue them.If I were to use a 5 star rating system, I would give this book 6 stars. It's just an amazing look at how society could devolve into chaos; perhaps not the only way, or perhaps it's not even certain that society would devolve, but definitely a believable account. It's almost like a post-apocalyptic story.As an added benefit, this book has been the target of all kinds of hatred, being banned from schools several times since it was written--I did mention the children committing murder, right?Memorable Quote:The tide was coming in and there was only a narrow strip of firm beach between the water and the white, stumbling stuff near the palm terrace. Ralph chose the firm path because he needed to think, and only here could he allow his feet to move without having to watch them. Suddenly, pacing by the water, he was overcome with astonishment. He found himself understanding the wearisomeness of this life, where every path was an improvisation and a considerable part of one's waking life was spent watching one's feet...He lost himself in a maze of thoughts that were rendered vague by his lack of words to express them.For more book reviews like this, please visit[...]"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was an exciting and adventurous fiction novel. It completely demonstrated a unique and interesting plot. School boys are forced to live by themselves because a plane crashed on an island. There are so many ideas that could be thought of with this one situation. The author created this situation and developed it into a made up society of kids who try to work together but end up turning against one another. It is a totally realistic way of describing this rare, fictitious occasion. I liked how there was an unexpected twist of Simons death after he realizes that there is no beast and that the beast is a fear within everyone. Ralph showed many leadership qualities as he instructed everyone to do the right thing and maintain their signal for help. Jack is entirely against him and wants to hunt to stay alive instead of follow Ralph's commands. This creates the dysfunction among the boys which is the worst thing that could happen. I could tell at the beginning that Piggy a target since he was previously picked on and was portrayed as fat. He is later killed by the other tribe. I thought the end was somewhat predictable. I had a sense that they would be saved sooner or later. The officer ends up coming to their rescue."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i found the book to be very true to the nature of humans. children especially. i was disturbed by the killings of course. and i found myself daydreaming a lot about how girls would have behaved in the same situation. i didnt see anyone being beaten to death in my daydream. a lot of fights. but no beatings. maybe wishful thinking. i would have liked (spoiler alert) the ending to extend to them being on the ship. but it was a good ending just the same. i was confused as to what on earth the title meant. it seemed like it was aimed at the boys being flies.duh. but after getting further into the book it didnt fit because no one was really in charge. then it turned into being about a pigs head? maybe i will have to think longer on it since i just finished the book. not something u will want to read or have read by kids though. it is dark"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you haven't read it, you've heard of it and that's because the book is brilliant. It was chosen quite a few years ago to be included in the literary canon of most secondary schools, pushing its influence even further. William Golding presents a spectacular, terrifying view of humanity in this novel. A group of young boys, the only survivors of a plane crash, end up on a deserted island that has very few resources, but enough to survive. They begin their struggle to survive by thinking about rescue and democracy and capability, but it soon degenerates to rival factions, abuse, violence, and tribalism.Piggy, one of the main characters of the story, and Ralph's right-hand man never has an official name other than \\"Piggy\\". Typical of young boys, they find the weakest of the group and exploit and make fun of the individual. Piggy wears glasses, has asthma, and is overweight. He can do little to help work, but he is quite smart. Though Ralph tends to make fun of him just as much as some of the other boys, he seems to recognize that Piggy has a pretty good grasp of reality, putting him one step above the virtually useless \\"littluns\\". So since Ralph has nerve and Piggy has brains they become leaders. Piggy is more so in the background, whispering advice, while Ralph speaks up and demands. Unfortunately for Piggy, he is too shy and too scared of authority to do much else than be used.Simon, perhaps the most interesting character in the book, is perceptive, creative, intelligent and helpful. He adheres to a place of peace and rest: a garden of Eden inside the wilderness of the jungle that has grown on the island. He understands that the beast the children live in fear of is themselves. When he suffers from heat stroke and watches a pig's head transform before his eyes (Hell enters his garden) we might also discover that he suffers from more. He has a good head on his shoulders and is capable of higher level thought, even if he can't articulate it. He is the silent voice of reason. He is a martyr, facing the beast of the air and letting it loose, but the beast is still within the children and he knows it. All martyrs suffer, and Simon must do just that.There is a wonderful sense of hubris in Golding's work. There is this overarching thought process, other than Piggy and Simon who are the general outsiders, in the beginning of the book that everything will be just fine and that they, since they are English, can tackle any task and work it to their advantage. Advantages are gained, but at the price of what else? Can we really call them advantages?He also presents a great psychological presentation of what fear can do to children. Though, after reading the book several times, it is quite clear that this is not a child's condition, it is a human condition. Fear can foster creativity. The children quickly adapt to their surroundings and begin the process of regimenting jobs, building shelters, etc. Unfortunately, they lose sight of these goals rather quickly because darkness and imagination produce abominations, making fear smolder. Most of the time our fears are unfounded and are simply tricks of the imagination, but there is something very real on the island that these children, or humans, can and should fear: each other.Through the process of losing humanity the children get lost to themselves, becoming more and more tribal. The conch, a shell used to call meetings and to designate who speaks, is the representation of democracy. It, of course, loses its power as humanity begins to wane and disappear. A combination of fun and serious games turns to play that doesn't last long and fear that lasts much longer. They soon forget what fire can stand for other than a destructive force, bringing them further and further into the recesses of the tribal mind.Jack is the main reason there is a degeneration of democracy, order, and rationality. He is a very strong character, but his tenacity and leadership go horribly awry. He becomes leader of the hunting party, and though they are initially unsuccessful, he celebrates such destructive things as a a red badge of courage after a hunt. A small cut shows that he is tough and he becomes capable of hunting the pigs efficiently, while also making him bloodthirsty and vicious. His mental distancing becomes physical. He breaks away from Ralph. They break into factions and Jack's group centers around a more chaotic riot mentality instead of the rational mentality needed to survive other than the next ten minutes. Survival and butchery overcome the need to be rescued.Jack is, frankly, blown out of proportion and perhaps that is why Golding chose children instead of men. Men might feel more rational, but children are imaginative and deadly. Games can soon escalate to fights in a backyard, so why not something worse on a deserted island with no adults to break up the violence? Jack's irrationality is exemplified by the fact that he purposefully chases after and kills female pigs. Hunters don't, usually, hunt females because females are the backbone for keeping a population of a creature alive. By killing females it demonstrates that he is reckless and only wants to suit personal needs in the immediate future and not the long term. Golding was also aware that the killing of a female by a bunch of male hunters becomes a rape: sexual and primal. Jack is, in essence, killing the tenderness of a mother to make himself tougher.Ralph is not exempt from this mentality. He eventually, also, degenerates to survive. Though he keeps some rationality as he does so. Not wanting to give too much away for those of you who have not read it is key here so I will not say more.This books is not just a novel about survival but an in depth look at humanity. Just because the characters are children does not make it any less real to adults. It can be applied across the entire spectrum. We, as humans, are divided into factions, into communities. Some are seen as weak and timid, others are seen as aggressive and domineering. Unfortunately, in the grand scheme of life, there is no rescue for us. What would we do if we were trapped in these situations? How would we fight oppression? How would we balance our lives and keep sane?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I didn't purchase this book for myself, but for my high school son. He'll be reading it in his English class this year & I wanted him to have the opportunity to read it any time he wanted, instead of only in class with copies that cannot be checked out. He thinks it's overkill, but I'm glad I did it because now I get to read it again too! I haven't read it since I was middle school age and it still doesn't fail to fascinate and entertain."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book Lord of the Flies by William Golding was very good. The title is talking about boys who get stranded on an island and find a monster named the Lord of the Flies. The setting of the novel is on an island in 1954. The protagonist of the story, and my favorite character, was definitely Piggy. He was always trying to solve problems and be nice. The antagonist can be lot of different characters, but I think it was Jack. He was always trying to take control. I didn't like him. All of the characters were very believable and very interesting. This book is about boys who get trapped on an island. They try to work together and survive, but a beast roams the island they are on. The boys have to stop the beast, but even harder than that they have to try to work together. The rising action was when they found out the beast was real. The climax was when the boys started to fight.You found out about the boys in the story when they have their fist meeting. The writing described every little thing the boys did. The story is trying to be kind to one another is hard when also trying to run a town. The author is saying that you should not try to take control. You should let everyone have a say. I liked this book and would recommend it to lots of people. If you can get passed the blood you will love it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"My favorite chapter in this book would definitely be the first chapter when the kids are introduced on the island. There was this one kid that everyone had called piggy. To me that is the funniest thing in the world. I don't know why but the humiliation of another kid is extremely hilarious. It may seem cruel but to me it's funny. I would have to say that this book was definitely for the older more mature kids, like high school kids. All in all I would have to say that even with the kid getting humiliated I dislike this book with a passion it is way to boring and just when you think it's going to get good the book disappoints you and I don't think that is a very good book for the serious reader"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I first picked up this book, I was expecting a masterpiece-a work of outstanding literature. After all, I had only heard great things about it. However, I was extremely disappointed once I ventured on to read past the first chapter. Slowly, I progressed onward, making my way through endless descriptions, multiple plots, and enough symbolism to make my head ache. I think Mr.Golding should have remembered that not ONLY are themes important to keep the reader's interest, but PLOT is too. This book is an excellent example of how someone can get so lost in the hidden meaning of their words, they forget what they're trying to SAY in the first place. Not only are their problems with the actual structure of the book, but also in the language used. There is a wide variety of slang used, which is, for the most part, chiefly British! I found myself rereading sentences more than two times just to understand what was being said. By half-way through the book, I actually wanted to stop and start reading something else. Also, throughout the book, Mr.Golding leaves off on one note and starts a completely different series of events. By the end of the book there are so many plots going on, it gets old trying to follow which one is going on at the moment. So, in summary, if you want to read a book which has multiple plots, too much symbolism, and descriptions to put you to sleep, then Lord of the Flies is for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book exists to support the author's opinion that man is brutish and destructive.this was written well before clinical studies of violance, child abuse, the effects of peer pressure, etc. it reflects the basic christain view that man is vile.itis obvious that golding never considers that by the time any of these boys has spent time in their families and then in the prep school, any natural impulse has been thoroughly ground out bysocial standards. these boys are as affected by all they psychological influences as adults, with fewer methods to deal with them.of course they revert to so-called savagery--it's what they experienced at their school. of course there are no intelligent responses, we aren't trained to use intelligent response.the book is a polemic of the conservative christian--man is vile and must be controlled or he will become a savage.nurture has no place.i find it a completely annoying book, presenting an unrealistic result."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Here is an extremely typical example of the book:\\"There were only a few more yards of stony ground and then the two sides of the island came almost together so that one expected a peak of headland. But instead of this a narrow ledge of rock, a few yards wide and perhaps fifteen long, continued the island out into the sea. There lay another of those pieces of pink squareness that underlay the structure of the island. This side of the castle, perhaps a hundred feet high, was the pink bastion they had seen from the mountain-top. The rock of the cliff was split and the top littered with great lumps that seemed to totter.\\"Is it just me, or is writing like this exceedingly dull and boring? The plot of the book one can simplify into a seven or eight page summary, but the rest is too painful to read. Even if you look at Sparknotes, you find zero mention about any of the 90% of the book which is dull and descriptive, and it just focuses on the 10% which is the meat of the story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is not as described.

Do not buy this if you want a nice hardcover edition."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It's great ordering a book, and the book was good, but the delivery took so long that I had to go to the bookstore and get it for my daughters class anyway, so it was really a waste. Shouldn't take over two weeks to get a book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After all I had heard and read about Golding's Lord of the Flies I was expecting a novel story, not a Rbinson Crusoe cliche, or at least some good writing/language, but what I got was a story that could have been conjured up by my 11 year old kid: lots of repetition (the conch, the glasses, the beast, the fire)and not what one could term an erudite piece of writing. How this book gets onto college lists is beyond me. Are we actually meant to interpret/understand the vague imagery, if that's what it is? Boring. Unfortuantely this is my first Golding book, and I'm afraid it will be my last... for some time at least."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I picked up this book when someone had mentioned they were required to read it in school as children. This book is about the end of innocence and the heart of darkness. Ok, before you get scared away by the two phrases I just mentioned, let me explain. So without even reading the book, you probably know it's about a bunch of English schoolboys who get stranded on an island and are forced to survive without the supervision of adults. This book is supposed to be full of symbolisms; each character and animal represent some idea or entity in society. The end of innocence I mentioned begins with the slaughter of a pig for food. The heart of darkness comes when the leader of the hunting tribe loses his mental stability and decides to hunt for more than just pig.It's actually a very short story (208 pages), and the dialogue is very simplistic. I found the author's descriptions of the jungle, beach, lagoon, and mountain to be quite boring. (You'll also notice that I said schoolboys in the last paragraph; there are no girls in this story. There is no underlying love story. There is no humor. There is no excitement whatsoever.)To be honest, I don't like this book. Even less so as required reading for school kids. To not interpret the symbolisms would be to leave the book as a plotless story. Yet to interpret it would mean exposing children to the horrors of savagery, abuse and survival.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3 (You can put as much interpretation as you want in the &quot;symbolisms&quot; of this book, but I'm too lazy to let my mind wander in search of a deeper meaning.)E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)A (Action) - 0.5 (You really can't get excited over a bunch of schoolboys and a few pigs.)P (Plot) - 2 (Boys get stranded, boys form a society, boys survive and wait for rescue.)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"all most everyone says that this is one of the best books ever written.i disagree completely.the book is about a group of young kids who are stranded on an island after the plane they are on crashes.the kids survive by making their own rules and selecting a leader among themselves.the boys want to be the leader and they soon become enemies.its not that great like a lot of people claim.thats my opinion."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; was not exactly a &quot;feel good&quot; book. If you like profound, dark, and symbolic literature, this is a great book for you. But if you can't sit through many pages of overly detailed description, I don't reccomend this book. I enjoyed the characters, their dialouge and thoughts, but the lengthy descriptions of the island were too much, and took away from the action of the story. I think the minds and personalities of the characters were protrayed realistically, but some of their actions were not. The violence that occured in the story most likely wouldn't have happened in real life. The sequences in which Jack tries to find Ralph towards the end of the book was very overdone. The changes that took place so quickly in some of the characters were exaggerated also.I did like the beginning of this book and enjoyed the characters, especially Simon, but I thought it was carried too far later on. It started out, it seemed, as a harmless adventure book but turned into a deep, thought-provoking tale. If you can handle the exaggerations and boring descriptions, this book wouldn't be that bad. But if you're looking for a book with a crisp story line and reasonably fast paced action, &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; wouldn't be it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I didnt like this book.It was very boring and slow.I think that the book was very slow.The book was not good I would not read it again.I dont recommend this book to you.But you can read it if you want to.I am think that the rating is a 1.

All it is is an outlet for an author's deranged sybolism. The story is stupid and at the same time, pointlessly graphic. If you want to read a good book, read Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. It is a very good book. Golding, in a vain effort to make people understand his sideways point of view, wrote a parody of 1940's British society. Who really gives a crud? I don't. All in all, please, please, please don't read this horrible, awful, stupid, pointless, terrible book that is a great waste of time. Also, William Robert Gording can suck my big white paperback version of his novel through a straw."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This allegorical novel fails to deliver to its acclaim. I had to read this for school, I barely got through the first few pages. It wasn't very realistic--little kids on an island to survive by themselves? The characters were not very much likable, besides Ralph, the others were barbaric, avarice and savage. The plot was hackneyed--I mean how many stories have there been about people who land on an island in the middle of no where and try to survive? I wouldn't reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"At a time when the baby boomer's were yet to exist, WW2 was happening.

The only time that it caught my eye was when they first got stuck on the island and when they got off. So basically,in the middle of this book, i wasn't listening. This book had alot of realism and creativity that was probably the highest point of this book. If I would have to pick a leader for them i wouldn't have picked any of them because they all act like animals. And the events that took place like for one when they thought that Simon was the beast, that was just dumb to me. I also gave it one star because it didn't deserve anyting better than that.The friendship between Ralph and Piggy was odd. Another thing that was odd was these kids had the urge to kill one another. At the beginning of this book, I asked myself,&quot;How did all these kids survive but not one adult did?&quot; I think the book would have been a whole lot better if they had about 2 or 3 adults to keep the kids from talking about that ridiculous beast. The Lord Of The Flies I read for an sophmore english class. But the books that I read my freshman year like, Of Mice and Men, Romeo and Juliet, and To Kill a Mockingbird, those were good books and better books than Lord of The Flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is the worst book I ever read. From the first time I read it 40 years ago, I could not imagine why it had not been banned. The viewpoint of mankind presented is so degraded and ugly that it should be.

Flies was excruciatingly dull, and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible, and the characters under developed.

It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought Lord of the Flies was okay, but it wasn't the greatest book ever written. I felt there were quite a few changes the author could have made to the story. First of all I didn't like the way the book used so much symbolism. This, along with many British terms I didn't understand, made it very confusing. I also didn't like how the author killed off the littlun with the birthmark, Simon, and Piggy. I thought there was just something wrong about killing off three young children.There were some good aspects of the book. First of all I liked the way the author described the environment the boys were in. It was very thorough. I also thought it was good how the author divided the boys into two seperate societies. I felt it demonstrated the two sides of society very well. It demonstrated that on the surface society seems organized and well-governed. But sometimes underneath it all people can be savage, cruel, and sadistic to each other.Overall I felt that this book was okay. But I wouldn't recomend it to most people and probably wouldn't read it again."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is a \\"scary\\" story because it's possible - it shows how people behave when under extreme stresses. Morals and ethics are luxuries of Civilization and are quickly shed when you are hungry, cold and miserable. Too bad author was overly influenced by Freud, but other than that the story is fascinating.We tell our kids, \\"There's no such thing as Monsters!\\" The truth is, the Monsters do exist inside of us. The sooner we realize that, the better chance we have at keeping them under self-control. As for kids, the same applies - unless you prefer letting the criminal justice system teach them to control their \\"inner monsters.\\""},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"My Thoughts on \\"Lord Of The Flies\\" Is that it brings so much insight and can help us understand ourselves better. The story is so great; it shows how nature and man can combine together and accomplish good or evil. Golding brings these kids on this island where they will have to face many challenges and fight with life and death.He brings mankind and civilization together and makes the island like a war against nature. My opinion is when he creates the plots and description of the story he describes the characters and the island and the plots so well. I like how he makes the story like giving us a sigh of the world we live in today on how the world can be so cruel and evil but the outcome of it can be very good.

Obviously not...you probably haven't heard of the social nature of groups in distress situations or distribution of responsibility. I'm guessing that you have no idea about anything, really. I say this because the themes in this book are not too complex. LOTF covers the basic arguments of human nature that have been explored in the 20th/21st century...but, you were born in a cave so you missed all of that. In conclusion, don't talk unless you have something somewhat intelligent to say."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies by William Golding is an intriguing novel that shows the behavior of young British boys' as they struggle to live on their own on a deserted Island. Golding helps illustrate the thin line between civility and sanity. He illustrates this by showing the behaviors of the boys stranded on the island as they lose their sanity and start to kill one another.Golding starts the novel by introducing the main character, Ralph, as he is swimming and looking for other survivors from the plane crash. Ralph meets a young boy named Piggy and they start to look for other young boys. Eventually they find a conch and Ralph blows it to call all the boys that are on the island. Once all of the children arrive they have a meeting and choose a leader. Ralph was chosen as the leader. When Ralph was chosen as a leader, a boy named Jack starts to rebel against this decision and he gets some of the boys to join in on his rebellion. As the story starts to be more developed, Jack and his followers start to disobey all the rules and then eventually create their own tribe. As Jack's tribe becomes more uncivilized, they start to torture and kill some of the boys from the Ralph's tribe.William Golding shows how even the most innocent children can become uncivilized and dangerous due to the lack of authority, government, and other forms of guidance for a child. I would really recommend this book because it is a very interesting and worthwhile book to read. It will help you understand the need for authority."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a true classic story of a downed aircraft full of boys apparently during a time of war. The boys, of all ages, some how survive and are spread over the Island. The story essentially pits two leaders against each other as no adults survive. There is a distinction between good and evil as the hero Ralph finds a shell and uses it as a horn that attracts all the boys on the island. The shell along with his intellectual yet near sighted friend cruelly nick named Piggy provide him a pedestal of leadership. His chief rival is a leader of a uniformed choir named Jack who commands the group as if it was a Para-military unit. As the search for food becomes more necessary beyond fruit, Jack leads his group on the wild hunt for wild pigs. Success leads to meat for the boys and a power base for Jack as he creates a police unit with his hunters acting as warriors. On top of the fracture among this isolated society is the discovery of a \\"beast\\" on the island, which is actually the remains of a dead pilot still strapped to his parachute. The sighting of this moving but unidentified object in the hills and darkness causes a panic among the boys. This provides a power vacuum for Jack as he takes more control and attempts to undermine the more rational Ralph and Piggy. Piggy is very symbolic not only as the intellect for the group but a source of power in his own right since his glasses help make the fire; however, among his enemies his glasses are more appreciated then his well thought ideas. In between this struggle is the young boy Simon who is almost visionary and fearless in the dark who carries an insight into what is happening on the island and eventually has a clearer perception of what the \\"beast\\" truly is. Eventually there is a violent coup as Jack and his warriors unseat Ralph and take away Piggy's glasses in a heartless control of fire. This escalates to a more severe collision as the warriors and Jack become more ruthless and the desire for power contribute to almost shocking level of violence. The island setting serves as a microcosm of society where rational thought and democratic leadership that is unprotected becomes a victim of a totalitarian adversary that uses intimidation and violence to create its own form of government while making the former leaders suffer violent consequences. At the end, Goldman puts it all in perspective when at the climax of the brutal hunt for Ralph, a rescue team arrives of bright British uniforms causing the boys to all stop and contemplate what they have all done. A book that the young will never forget particularly as one becomes older and you can see the pattern in many governments in many parts of the world today where raw power and self indulgence sometimes conquers what is right and rational."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The time, 1940. The place, an idyllic island setting somewhere in the Atlantic. England transports a plane load of prim and proper, school boys away from the horrors of a European War. The plane crashes and the boys are left stranded on a tropical island without adult supervision. William Golding' novel allows viewers to observe the transformation of even the most well behaved children when left to their own devices. Innocent at first, the boys contrive a make-shift hierarchy based on English society and parental mores. Soon however, a subtle inclination allows the more aggressive side of human nature to evolve and a split divides the once tranquil group. What follows is the natural tendency of mankind to revert to a more primitive and prurient structure resulting in animal dominance, religious fears and murder. Disturbing in it's accusations and terrifying in it's imaginary, the Black and white version is definitely a superb classic by any standard. Brief nudity. ****"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This stroy is haunting,disturbing, and wonderful. The characters in the story are realistic. We have probably all met the arrogant Jack, the thoughtful Piggy and Ralph who is trying to be a fair and poopular leader. The book is full of symbolism most characters, objects, and events have a symbolic message. Although at first the story seems unrealistic you are soon able to see how if people you knew were together without a guide or role model they would easily begin to kill each other. Teenage boys killing each other is the same as war."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book when I was fourteen, for a summer assignment. Upon reading it, we were to write a four or five page essay describing three events or examples of symbolism that appeared somewhere in the book. After finishing it, I could barely choose which three things to write about; nearly everything in Lord of The Flies is symbolic and meaningful.Golding has set up a perfectly accurate representation to show to us 'how to trace the defects of human society back to the defects of human nature'. Sure, a lot of the students in my class didn't like the book at all, because of the long descriptions, outdated dialouge, ect., but I think if you're slightly intelligent you should be able to look past the things you don't necessarily like and into the true meaning of the novel, which tells us as much about our society as Ralph's."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"On the surface, this novel is a story of survival on a desert island, but it goes so much deeper. It delves into the duality of mankind, the evil within us all, and the power of savagery when the restraints of civilization are no longer present. The main character is Ralph, a British schoolboy, who finds himself on a desert island with his new friend, Piggy, and other boys who survived a plane crash on the island. Each character is a symbol and the \\"loss of innocence\\" genre novel follows the boys' lives on the island and chronicles their descent into savagery. Ralph sees the importance of order which is relevant through his demand for smoke in order to be rescued, and his blowing of the conch, a symbol for civilization. Jack and Roger both represent evil and savagery, while Piggy represents clear-sightedness and intelligence. Simon, the archetypal \\"Christ figure,\\" is the visionary who never gets to explain the TRUE beast to the group of boys. If you want a cute story about life on the island of Paradise, an easy to read, surface level novel- don't read Lord of the Flies. If you truly understand the underlying meanings, you will be appalled with the darkness of man and you'll see the degree of evil that lack of civilization uncovers by the end of the book. Overall, an amazing piece of literature!!!! FIVE STARS! Thanks to Mr. Vasile for the opportunity to read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book The Lord of the Flies was an exceptional book though there were a few vacant areas where the plot needed to be moved along faster and more eventful. The book takes place on a deserted island out in the middle of nowhere after a plane carrying some young boys crashes into the sea and the survivors are forced to take refuge on the island. After many days of frightening events dealing with being alone on the island, one boy named Jack, turns into a savage and persuades the rest of the group to leave Ralph, who is the one in charge, to join his wild ways. Many horrible events take place that embed disturbing images in your head throughout the story. It is a unique way for teaching the readers exactly how brutal and harsh being stranded alone on an island with no special form of government or order of any kind could be. The story portrays many real-life aspects about the struggles for power and leadership that the boys go through on the island. It greatly outlines the conflicts between two boys, Ralph and Jack, who are constantly competing for total control over the group. With no grown-ups around, the boys are forced to deal with the harsh reality by themselves. This experience in itself will change the lives of the boys forever.This book is a great reading experience for aspiring readers who are into adventure novels. The Lord of the Flies gives off a dark and mysterious tale that is greatly expressed in detail. The emotions and actions of these boys were greatly presented in the writing in order to give full aspect of what is happening. Overall, we would recommend reading this novel because it is a wonderfully original story that takes your mind into a totally different world of thought. Also, if you are interested in dark, disturbing stories, this book would be an excellent choice because you never know what bizarre events are going to happen to them next."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i was made to read this book for sophomore high school english. the cover made me interested, and so i was openminded when i started this book. the plot is incredibly intense and extremely symbolic (as my teacher drilled into us all the bible references, i started to pick up on them by myself). i would recommend this to anyone who is interested in symbolism, the primal breakdown of mankind, and the thrill of reality. the ending had an unexpected, unpleasant twist, it wasn't what i had wanted it to be, but well, nothing is perfect. this book is definitely a classic and has been read by millions. if not to buy this book, i would certainly suggest reading it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"At this moment, while I'm writing this review there were 632 reviews more, so, why to write another? Just because I have just reread the novel and I feel the necessity to share some ideas. First, although only three boys die out of many (we never know exactly how many boys live in the island)this novel is about &quot;horror&quot; just as it is in The Heart of Darkness by Conrad. Second, all characters are male characters. That is very important in the novel, I think. Try to speculate about the same novel, the same island, the same problems faced by the boys but mixed with female characters. In that case you could go to the extremes: a love story or a double horror story. Third, if you have read Blindness by Saramago you will find many curious and interesting similitudes. Put a group of persons under extreme conditions (boys abandoned on an island or a whole country infected by a new kind of blindness) and you will have the perfect situation for the surgement of &quot;the beast&quot;, that thing so inmersed into human soul that is always trying to get out of the cage of &quot;civilization&quot;.

The answer give a group of British schoolboys on a lonely island: they create a society determined of cruelty. The moral of the thought provoking book is that all the bad is caused by the bad in the human himself. the theory of baal-zebub. It's a story full of surprises and easy to read. I can't recommend it to everybody, it's interesting but not great."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a story, which leads the readers deep into a boys mind during the time of World War II. Golding's book starts out with a group of boys from Britain who are shot down from their plane and is stranded on an island. What these boys do not notice is there is a &quot;best&quot; on the island. This beast is known as fear and the greatness in evil. Golding wanted to illustrate in this novel the dark side of human nature and make the point that each member of humankind has this dark side. Golding uses the boys' fear of a mythical beast to illustrate their assumption that evil arises from external forces rather than from them-selves. This fearsome beast initially takes form in their imaginations as a snake-type animal that disguises itself as jungle vines; later, they consider the possibility of a creature that rises from the sea or the more hazy body of a ghost. When they spot the dead paratrooper who has landed on the mountain, the boys feel sure that they have proof of a beast's existence. In fact, a beast does roam the island, but not in the form, the boys imagine."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book in high school almost 20 years ago - what vivid memories I still have!!! Golding does a great job of taking the reader through evolution of the group...from the beginning when they work together to the end where they have broken into smaller groups working against each other. The power struggles, the turf wars, and insight into human nature...great book!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It's a true look into the sad ways of all mankind. A story of several young boys trapped on a desert island with no adults to control things. In the beginning the boys want to be organized and stay together, but they also want to have fun. After all, this island is their paradise, no adults, and no rules. Soon, their fun turns to chaos and murderous insanity, and the boys are split into two groups: those who want order and rules, and those who are crazed and just want to have fun. It's a sad book about the end of innocence, but beautifully and truthfully written."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think the authors purpose for writing this story was to show that all people are born naturally evil, and with fear. I don't agree with the author because I don't think everyone is born evil. The literary element that I think Golding handled best was the characters. He must of done alot of research on them. The names and the characterists fit well with the story. I think the book was believable because it handles fear, and every child goes through some sort of fear. This fear that they had made the story what it is. I really didn't expect the book to end the way it did. It was a really boring ending. Its like he didn't give the ending any thought, or he ran out of time."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a high school student, I was indeed forced to read this book. However, I found this book to be absolutely amazing. It was one of my favorite books. Golding has a way with words. His cynicism in the book helps make the book even more inticing. I don't understand how anyone could dislike this book. It deserves 5 stars all around and nothing less."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It seems like, at some point before writing this novel, Golding had asked himself: &quot;How much has the human race changed, morally speaking, since the prehistoric times?&quot; &quot;What would happen if a bunch of children, from an advanced society, got stranded on a deserted island and had to reproduce society?&quot;. So, after a plane crash, only children survive in a remote island. As they struggle to survive, we are witnesses to the undoing of civilization, once some of them, especially Jack, realize that the institutions, strictures and constraints of society are gone. And what we read is certainly frightening: deep inside, we still are savage creatures, bent on getting power and domination over the rest of us. Only Ralph and Piggy keep their will to bring about cooperation and collaboration, as the indispensable way to survival. But the rest won't listen: what they want is to swim and hunt, to play and to fight. The voices of civilization and peace will not only be ignored: they will be denounced and punished. Savagery will triumph over peacefulness. That society will have to start all over again, trodding the path from utmost savagery to civilization. This is not a political or a sociological novel, it is a fable. But something I learned or reinforced from reading it, is that the central beliefs and institutions of our civilization are not to be taken for granted. They need to be constantly nurtured, reinforced and reformed. For our basic instincts are still there, and exactly the way they were thousands of years ago. So, this novel is thrilling, fun to read, and interesting to think about."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the flies is one of the finest ezamples of a frightening world created without a lot of razzmatazz and jargon but only a singular and savage imagery . It speakes about a group of boys who are stranded on an Island after a plane crash. Ralph the leader,Jack the fanatic, Piggy the moderator and simon the simpleton are the principal characters. The author delves deep into human psyche through the means of an adolescent mind.Ralph and Jack are caught in a battle of supremacy while all around them there is the shadow of a certain beast.Ralph builds shelters and keeps a fire going to attract ships ,while Jack hunts pigs for food. Jack slowly gains control of group and he is tranformed from a choir boy to a hunter. He and his gang slaughter a pig and offer its head to the beast. the The beast turns out to be nothing but a rotting corpse. Simon figures this out and runs to inform the others . He gets killed in a stampede of animal frenzy by the boys. Meanwhile Jack steals piggys glasses and Ralph can no longer keep the fire going. In the ensuing battle piggy gets killed and Jack starts hunting Ralph like a pig. The killing of Simon and the hunting of Ralph is spoken in a powerful and poignant way. The story ends on a note of irony with a sailor finding Ralph and assuming that he must be playing with his friends."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"My favorite character was Piggy, a big kid who was really nice and a big heart and Ralph who was the leader but was having problems with some of the kids on the island. I didn't like Jack who was the leader of the chorus. He was cold, haunted and rude. He was the one who killed two of the other characters in the story. Then there was Simon. He was a hard worker but was too young to be leader, even though he would have made a better leader than any of the others. This story did not seem realistic to me because it's not likely that kids would actually survive on an island. I would recommend this story to kids who like action packed novels."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you want a book with diversity this is the one to choose.

A 12-year-old by the name of ralph is elected leader and together they must combat starvation, dehydration and disease."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The lLord of the Flies is a great book. It is a book that should be used in every school, because is shows a great struggle for survival on a deserted island with basicly nothing."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this novel as part of my tenth grade curriculum. After reading the book I hated it. The gruesom details of the evil that is hidden in all of us was absolutely startling to me. I was then assigned to write an essay on Human Nature and I realized that this novel had so many hidden meanings about life, and death that I fell in love with it. Just the fact that so many different emotions were touched by reading this novel made me appreciate the real value of the book. So if you have to read this...take it for more than just words in print. Also a review that points out hidden meanings, and symbolism will help you understand it better."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I've read this novel 3 times, and each time I notice something new. Golding does an amazing job of digging deep into te souls of all the students trapped on te island. His use of symbolism and forshadowing is uncanny. I definately recommend you read this novel."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In this book, the results of being away from civilization and stranded point to the conclusion that ther is a high capacity of evil and sadism in human beings. The powerful message on the flaws and ironies of society and the human nature and the damage performed on nature make this book definitely worth reading. However, it coudn't fall in my list of most treasured book; because the purpose of this novel wasn't to please the reader but give an insight on the pains and reality of the truth. My personal reaction to this story was pure amazement and a new insight to the tendencies of ourselves."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding has written an interesting story about behavior changes in boys stranded on an island. But I found that much of the behaviors hard to believe from the relatively short amount of time spent there. His views, however, are well taken. This is a good read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel is a haunting sign of the evil within all of humanity. This dark side of ourselves surfaces as external checks are removed, thus, causing chaos in a consequence free environment. These boys are essentially placed in the Garden of Eden, yet they are dissatisfied with what they have. The root of all evil is greed, and this is demonstrated through Jack and Roger, who attempt to control everyone else. It is sad that the young boys living on this island are transformed into vile savages without any sense of conscience. Prior to my enrollment in AP English, I did not realize the importance of rules in a socitey. I now know that without &quot;external checks&quot;, our lives would turn into chaos as well. This book is very scary. It made me cry. It mad me extremely mad. I wanted to burn it! Yet, it taught me so much...maybe a little too much about human nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is great!! I have never read it, but I'm sure it's a swell book. My girlfriend has read it, and she said she liked Little House on the Prairie better, but I say no. No I say. She will not remain my girlfriend much longer if she doesnt shape up. I like William Golding very much!, maybe too much. But it doesnt change the fact that Laura Ingle Wilder is a communist in the third world. I recommend this book to anyone who has hot steamy fantasies about good 'ole Will. I know Will, personally. And we had something going, until he died of Lou Gherig's disease. I know he would be proud of me, god knows Greta is. Well, I have to go 'cuz uncle Eugene is callin' from the barn. howdy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was incredible. I'll agree with some of the other reviewers who said this is a very difficult book to read. I'm 13 myself, and I had to read parts over before I got the message underneath. Most people will hate this book at first because they don't understand what it's trying to convey. The book isn't just about a bunch of boys on an island, it's about democracy and order degrading into anarchy. All in all, the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Again another book tagged as an \\"enduring classic\\" is, to be blunt, a disspointment, and at many times a horrible bore. I myself do not really appreciate the writing stlye of Golding. It seemed to me all of his quotes ended like this-- This was very frustrating to read, giving me the feeling more was to be said, but was never written, often bringing me off track while i was reading trying to wonder what the character was trying to say and i would realize i had read a page or 2 and had not the slightest clue of what i read. Another problem that i found within this book was the sheer number of unimportant characters the continually are mentioned. Characters with no background or character development are often named, making me feel as though i missed something, again taking me off track of my reading. Overall the story itself has an interesting idea, in my opinion, this interesting story is quite frankly ruined by the poor quality of Golding's writing. A frustrating read, filled with obscure as well as obvious symbollism, I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Sometimes you just happen upon a book that just draws you in and becomes an important part of your bookshelf. This happened with Lord of the Flies. I'm normally one who steers away from literature in the 'classics' section at Borders, as it gives me memories of bad books that we've all been forced to read in high school (then again, maybe I'm just to young too appreciate The Awakening or Mainstreet... ) I just happened to randomly pick this book off the shelf and start reading while I was waiting for a friend to find something. By the time she came back, I was so engaged in the first chapter that I bought it. I enjoyed it...it's the type of book that you can ponder about afterwards and it's not a boring read (*cough*Lord of the Rings*cough*). In fact, I ALMOST enjoyed writing a paper about it senior year! If you'd like to read something unique, disturbing, and thought provoking, then this something you should read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I first read this novel some years ago in junior high, and it remains one of the few to which I continue to return and re-read. And each time it offers new meanings and insights. Part of its charm derives from the fact that it can be appreciated on so many different levels, however hackneyed it may be to suggest so. It can be read through and enjoyed as an adventure story, full of drama and suspense. But, of course, it is much, much more, and this is why it is such a wonderful piece of literature.Lord of the Flies is best known, probably, for its symbolism, and as one critic has opined, it is a symbolism that works. Each element, each symbol, operates individually, independently, but also interlocks with everything else in the book--not simply the other symbols but also the characters, the setting, the theme--from which it draws its deepest meaning. The conch, the platform, Piggy&#65533;s specs, the pig&#65533;s head, the island itself--they all fit beautifully and memorably together, along with Golding&#65533;s stunning descriptions of places, characters, and events, to create the picture of a society corrupted by flaws in its constitutive human beings. It richly deserves its reputation as a classic."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book opened my eyes to the wonderful world of classic literature. If my mind were erased and I could only keep one memory it would be the lessons taught by this book. Golding wrote a masterpiece. I was forced to read this book 2 years ago when I was in 10th grade. Being the highschool slacker that I was I kept to my sparknotes. One night I actually got the responsibilty to pick up the book and start reading it. I finished it that night, I could not put it down. I researched all the symbolism in that book. Now every essay I write I use Lord of the Flies. This book is incredible. I urge everyone to not only read it, but study it. This book is so powerful it turned a highschool slacker into a English major!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book, while trying to simulate a society of youths thrown together in unusual circumstances, is simply too far-fetched to work. the psychological component would not be present without a string of huge coincidences that cannot be taken seriously (im talking about the parachuter on the top of the mountain, among others). i continually found myself comparing lotf to animal farm by george orwell, another &quot;simulated society&quot; novel. the latter is by far more convincing, even if its main characters are nothing but common barnyard animals."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, takes place on an island with no adult supervision. Stuck on this island is a group of boys; most of them turn to hunting and killing (This group is led by Jack Merridew), and the two others (named Piggy and Ralph) stick to rules and trying to be rescued. Essentially, this quote: \\"Which is better- to have rules and agree, or to hunt and kill?\\" (164) covers the theme of this book. I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, the ending and theme of this book leave the reader thinking. On the other hand, the majority of the book is not very exciting.The theme and ending of the Lord of the Flies were what kept my interest. The quote: \\"Which is better- to have rules and agree, or to hunt and kill?\\" is one that cannot be answered easily. It was very interesting how the boys dealt with the question, and how most of them leaned toward the hunting and killing aspect of survival.However, despite the fact that the idea of the book is interesting, it is very slow moving. There is a lot of description of events, which makes the book uninteresting. One example is when they are describing what will happen with the fire which they keep going to catch the eye of a ship that could rescue them. There is a lot of dialogue and description that could be done without. For example, when Piggy and Ralph find out that Jack let the fire go out, there are two pages of description of their reaction.Some of the characters are also underdeveloped. One character, Simon, plays an important role in the book, yet he only appears a few times. He is the one who discovers the Lord of the Flies. Still, he is barely described, and the reader does not get a good enough sense of his personality. This lack of description also makes the reader care less about these characters, so, the scenes that they're in seem less important. I even had to re-read the part about the Lord of the Flies, because since I didn't think Simon was very important, I didn't pay too much attention to that scene.Additionally, the book skips around. Simon, for example, leaves the group to search for the beast (which is the Lord of the Flies). It goes back and forth between Simon and the Lord of the Flies interacting, and the rest of the boys discussing what to do with the conch. This takes emphasis off of this important part, and it is also confusing. I had to re-read a few parts.The end of the book was sort of worth wile. It was simply a nice ending, and nice is exactly the word that explains it; it wasn't exciting, happy, sad, etc., just plain nice. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy symbolism, detail, and adventure stories. I would not recommend this to someone who is looking for some leisure reading. It is fairly complicated, and un-exciting. I chose to read this book because I heard that it was an outstanding classic. However, after reading it, I have found otherwise."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i thought this book was [bad]. at first but then I loved it. the plot starts off slow but then get very deep. this book is great it causes you to ask yourself what would I do. a quicker beginning would of helped the book a lot"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"For educational purposes in my high school, i was forced to read this book.

The imagery is marvelous, and though some might complain of myriad tangents, I find them fantastic in adding to the mystic of the island. Being only 13, you might think me simply waxing effusively having finished my first book longer than 100 pages. I am not. I am waxing effusively having finished my first truly chilling 'novel'. I put 'novel' in quotes because I believe this book to be the hardcore basis of reality. You are thinking DUH! but I don't think it's that obvious.

A group of young boys crash on an island, and one thing becomes clear immediately: only one can be the leader. I think this competition between two factions is accurate and exciting. The struggle becomes so fierce towards the end of the book, it got my adrenaline flowing just reading it. I don't think the book has to constantly be interpretted as 'democracy vs. anarchy' or in terms of decent society vs. brutal savagery. The book can be simpler than that if you, as the reader, want it to be. Just a note: I think the most important character was Simon. Keep an eye on him as you read, I haven't quite figured him out yet."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is great. I also watched the movie. A nice plot."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Themes are the fundamental concepts addressed an explored in any literary work. William Golding writes this novel with the theme of conflict consistant throughout the story. It is the same conflict that all human beings experience everyday. The conflict between two impulses: the instinct to live by rules, act peacefully, follow the moral commands, and value the good of the group versus the instinct to selfishly satisfy your own desires, act violently to gain control, and enforce your will on others in your group. One is devoted to values that promote order, and the other is devoted to values that threaten order. Throughout the novel, the conflict between good and evil is the driving force on human beings by the civilization. He states that when people are left to do what they chose, they are more likely to become cruel, wild and evil.Another literary devise used by Golding in The Lord of the Flies is that of symbolism. Symbols are objects, characters, figures or colors used to represent abstract ideas or concepts. One of the symbols is the conch shell. It is one of the first things that they find on the island and they use it to summon the boys together. The shell became a sign of civilization. It was used to control the meeting the boys held, the boy who holds the shell is given the right to speak. As evil takes the shell looses its power among the boys.One of the most important symbols in the novel is the imaginary beast, which frightens all of the boys. All of the boys are afraid of the beast, this symbolizes the fear that each one of us has inside of us. As the boys become more and more evil and against civilization the more their belief in the beast grow stronger.Another symbol is The Lord of The Flies. The Lord of The Flies is the bloody sow's head that Jack beats with a stick in the forest as an offering to the beast. This symbol becomes more important when Simon confronts it in the glades and it speaks to him, telling him that evil lies in every human being. The Lord of he Flies becomes a symbol for evil or the devil and Simon represents Christ. It symbolizes the natural instinct of power and the cruelty that takes over.The characters and objectives in The Lord of The Flies represtents the novel's main theme or ideas. Every element of The Lord of The Flies becomes meaningful to the exploration of conflict."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book my junior year, and I couldn't believe how real it seemed. It's obvious Golding put alot of thought into it. The book was written to show the dark side of man (or the beast, as he calls it) and does its job well. Highly recomended!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book I read was the Lord of the Flies. I thought it was a really good book. It had a very good hook. The plot was great too. Ralph is the protagonist of the novel who at first is overjoyed to be on a tropical island free from adult restraints. To express hisexcitement, he stands on his head, foreshadowing the topsy-turvy nature of things to come. By nature, he is an innocent, mild-tempered boy who accepts leadership when it is thrust on him. He uses a conch shell to mildly show his authority. He thinks of building shelters to protect them and a signal fire for their rescue. He befriends Piggy, the fat boy that receives taunts and teases from the other boy, and learns to rely on Piggy's intellectual reasoning. Jack Merridew is Ralph's antagonist in the novel. When he is first seen on the island, he is leading a group of choirboys, who are dressed in strange uniform and march military style. It is a foreshadowing of Ralph's authoritarian and dictatorial leadership at the end of the novel. During the novel, Jack is in constant conflict with Ralph, because he feels he should be the leader. There were some very interesting things in this book that kept me interested. When they found the dead parachuter it really got my attention because I thought it was the lord of the flies. When piggy gets killed with the rock it made me mad but I survived. When Simon came running back to tell the other boys what he discovered and they all killed him it was depressing. There was so much death and hate in this book. I really see how it stood for the real life situations. This book is one of the best ones I have ever read. I am especially glad I read it because it was assigned to me to read one of the years before but I never read it. I never used to read books for school. I am so glad I read this book, it is one of the best books I have ever read. And I had to read it really fast."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book \\"Lord of the Flies\\" was confusing at the start, but as it progressed it got better as the story unfolded. The book was about a bunch of boys stranded on a island after a their plane crashed. As the story gets going a group of the boys become savage with out rules to go by. Many of the boys die, but some are saved in the end of the book. I only recommended this book to someone who doesn't mind demonic behavior or violence otherwise don't read this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is about a group of boys that are stranded on an island without any adults. They form a society with Ralph, one of the boys, as their group leader. While on the island, they want to be rescued, but until then, they hunt pig and hold assemblies. The story is about the struggle to keep order on the island.A significant event in the story is when Piggy and Ralph find a conch shell in the water. It allowed order to start on the island. This was because people were able to talk when they held the conch. It was also used to call assemblies.We think that the author is a good writer. His discriptions are very detailed. That allowed us to keep interest in the story. The author seems to be a credible source of what he has written, because he was in WWII, which was the time in which the book took place.We would definitely reccommend this book because it is different from most books we have previously read. It takes the reader back to the time when children always dreamed of having no adults around to tell them what to do. We also always kept reading because we wanted to know what would happen next. It is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This past year I taught in a rural school, so I had the opportunity to choose what literature I wanted my students to read. I had 3 eighth grade boys, and chose to have them read this novel. The boys loved it, but on the other hand, we read most of it together in a group, because some of the wording was a little 'over their heads'. All in all, I find this to be one of the greatest classics ever written, and would suggest handing it to any young adult that's looking for a little enlightenment and a great read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It is remarkable what we humans can bear in order to adapt.It is true that the essence of the book can be abstracted and applied equally well to a lot of situations in the world today. However, I think it is necessary to point out that neither of the 'bands' of boys can judged: they simply adapted.Perhaps what makes the reader uncomfortable is the fact that, in the end, there simply is no tendency towards order, discipline or any other such cherished of our values. If left to ourselves, we have the tendency to self-destruction.Seen as a system, the boys were all adapting, to the place and to themselves at the same time. This implied redefining most of the values they previously had.The end is deeply sad because the one boy representing our precious modern values is the one chased and marginated.It is fascinating how Golding can tell us a story through the eyes of a bunch of boys, and at the same time be very precise and barely crude about the very subtle changes which they all had to suffer to be able to adapt.This book remainds me a lot of the movie Das Experiment. In the beginning, you have 20 healthy guys just brought from the street, fresh, with the same values and the same attitude. They all were called to simulate a prison, so one half (the 'healthier' half) plays the part of the guards, and the other half become the inmates. Then the forces start to act on each group, and each group begins to change in order to adapt, in order to 'stabilize' the system, according to their own perspective. In the end, they all change, and definitely not for the best. The game is death serious towards the end.It is a sad conclusion. But it is also remarkable the order and relative stability we have accomplished in our society, with our institutions and values; it is a strange and very fragile balance between the rules and values we have created, and the very things which we are instinctively compelled to do."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book because a Canadian student friend insisted. She apparently had it as part of her high school curricullum. I was not disappointed! I saw so much of modern life expressed through the eyes and actions of these primitive boys as they try to bring man's order to their society through ritual, then shunning, and ultimately, the well-intentioned persecution of those outside the group. It's too bad that more people can't guage their own actions from these themes of classic literature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"My opinion of the book is that i didnt like it as much and that it didnt pull me in to want to keep reading it.If you like action and like story lines where theres a fight for survival than you would probably enjoy Lord of the Flies.In the story you will see a group of kids that are stranded on a island and theres problems and many adventures that take place and if u want to find out more you'll have to read it for yourself.I wouldn't recommend this book because it wasn't exciting as much and i wanted to stop reading it becasue it was a waste of time for me.This is my opinion for my point of veiw of the book but its up tp you and hope you mgiht enjoy it or not."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"the symbolism in this book explodes off the page. so much so that i spent 3 weeks reading it, not because it was long, but because i didn't want to miss anything."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I loved this book. It explores social interactions between young males, and the limits of the conscience. The ending was shocking... be prepared for an exciting story! (This is middle school reading)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The dark, indistict and yet highly suggestive cover of the Riverhead edition (1997, introduced by E.M. Forster)peopled with its shady, human-like silhouettes and snaps of muted color, provides a better glimpse than any other edition of an important theme of the novel--illusion, and its power to become real in the minds of those possessed by fear. Chimera.I think this theme is as important now, as it has ever been, perhaps more so considering the recent fears in the most powerful nation on Earth. With fear and vulnerability gripping America, the world has turned from being an oyster to a threat. People are frightened by the stories churned out by their media. There is anger, feelings of extreme vulnerability in the face of the invisible. Leaders fan the breezes of these highly charged feelings to create monsters lurking on the fringes of stable, rational society, ready to tear it up. Democracy, in the face of such invisible, powerful threats, can seem altogether too inadequate and fragile. Another response--a more powerful one--is needed. Force, the erosion or elimination of democratic rights, the tightening of controls. And of course, hunting down the beast. To ensure that all this is accepted by the very people who have the most to lose, a leader maintains the illusion of dark, evil forces bent on the destruction of a nation. And so on....Think of Jack and his tribe...then think how it all came about.Simon is the first to see that there is nothing to fear on the island, but the children themselves , with all their fears of the dark. Think of the littl'uns, missing the comfort, security and reassurance of adults, their parents. They cry at night, they see snakes twisting about in the jungle-fire (in reality the burning vines waving about as they are being consumed by the flames)and mistake their nightmares for the real thing. Jack capitalizes on their fear, while at first being afraid himself. He is a young child after all, which is easy to forget.Right from the start Golding works in images of how the island paradise has the potential to be turned into something sinister and deadly. We hear the \\"witch-like\\" call of a bird, see the \\"skull-like\\" coconuts strewn under the trees. Is it all really there? It takes the active imagination of the human mind to turn trees, coconuts, birds and the jungle into something awful. Something that can kill. Our confidence that what we can apprehend \\"reality\\" directly through our senses is put into question, for it is always through an interpreting mind that our sense perceptions are filtered. Our terrified minds \\"see\\" snakes, moving shadows...\\"hear\\" witches shrieking in the forest, our bodies \\"feel\\" the cold touch of a creature crawling over us...and we react according to how we understand our sensations.The lyrical prose of the novel helps us experience what the boys do through connotation, metaphor, simile. This is what literary language does best: offers us experience, rather than information. Golding, being the brilliantly suggestive writer that he is, does just that. He offers us images, illusions in the shape of lengthy, highly detailed and descriptive scenes, which make very real a dream-like, unreal experience. Simon's experience of the butterflies dancing is just one example of this. In the same chapter, a storm is moving up. Or is it a storm? Golding uses the image of a great battle brewing, with the added image of \\"drums rolling\\". Rather than being a natural occurrence, the storm is presented to us as a powerful army preparing to unleash itself on the small, isolated island. The army is put there by a human mind. And it becomes very real for both Simon and for the reader. By personalizing Nature,(which is how the children experience the island) we tend ascribe to it intentions and purpose. In this way, the storm becomes menacing and seems to focus on the children, forcing them to cower in their flimsy huts when it trummels the island.And that brings me to the next point about illusion and reality. Not only are the boys creating reality, so is the reader for him or herself, by recreating through the words on the page a surrogate experience. Some reviewers mistake the words on the page for referring to a reality that they never lived. This is not to say that they are naive enough to believe that the novel is based on real-life, but they write as if there is some truth-value to the details. This is the conduit metaphor that Bruce Pirie writes about in _Teaching High School English_, which powerfully drives the reading and interpretation of much literature. What is missed is that stories, whether spoken or written, are always constructed affairs. And that pertains to any story, including our own descriptions of ourselves. We are not giving \\"reality\\" of our true self when we tell someone about who we are: we are presenting a version that we believe to be accurate and true. What gets left out is the amount of selecting of perceived personal attributes that go into the description of our self (the unique, single \\"self\\" being another illusion of Western society...how many \\"selves\\", do you construct and present to the world every day?).Does Golding not wish us to consider how the use of language constructs the very reality that it is supposed to refer to? His very skill in getting readers to describe Jack, Ralph and the others on the island as though they were real and to live the children's experiences may attest to this to.... as well as a history of High Schools reading literature in a realist tradition.Anyway, enjoy the novel...or the illusion of directly living another's experiences. Plenty to enjoy there."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The novel Lord of the Flies written by William Golding is astonishingly well made with details of what it is like to live and survive without government and rules/society. Ralph, 13 year old protagonist who led a normal life; his life hit a tragic down spiral when he was in a plane with his Boy Scout troop heading on a tour of tropical islands. Their plane failed to fly and crashed into the ocean with no adult survivors. Ralph encounters many conflicts such as person vs. person, as in the time when he and Jack fought with closed fists until one of them gets hurt person vs. nature, like the time when the raging hurricane whips through their island and destroys everything in it's path and lastly person vs. self, when Ralph doubts himself and is stressing his decisions. Many of the camp members turn against him and go out on their own, it is up to Ralph to stay alive and help his companions, but can he tame a lawless beast like the hunters?I found this novel flawless and exhilarating; William Golding did a truly great job on this awesome novel. The author made me feel Ralph's pain and also made me feel Jack's anger. It made me feel as if I was one of the boys in the group, choosing which side to take, the hunters or Ralph. I felt the joy the hunters had when they killed their first pig, and their fear when they encountered the beast. I found myself reasoning with the hunter's plans but saw the point of Ralph's logic to stick together. I felt the shocking thunder and the clash of waves during the hurricane and felt the adrenaline rushing through my body. Even though all of these things were great I also saw some flaws in the book. I felt as if the wild pig detail was kind of weird; how that in the middle of the ocean on a deserted tropical island there would be pigs, other than that one detail I felt the book was magnificent."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In eighth grade, we had a big list of books to choose from...we had to read one for a grade. Up till then, I had picked all the books with accessible Cliffs Notes, this time I picked The Lord of the Flies. This is the book that seriously got me to believe that reading is not a waste of time and effort. It was absolutely amazing and it connected with the primal instincts of man and corruption. The concept of it appealed to me as an eighth grader, a friend described it as...&quot;a group of boys are on an island, they form groups and start killing each other...&quot; As far as I was concerned, this was better than Anna Karenina or all that other Literature stuff they make you read. Two years later, I picked it up again. Older and more understanding, I understood the concept Golding was trying to convey. It is amazing. It bares the instinct and nature of man in a vivid harsh way. This was the first book I read without Cliffs Notes and I truly appreciated it.

I thought this book deserved all five stars because of the deepness in the meaning. It portrays all sorts of societies. It shows how when rules are taken away from mankind there is a total chaos.

The story is about a bunch of boys who gets stranded on an island. There are two main characters, Jack and Ralph. Jack represents the savage in all men, and Ralph repressents the civilized in us. The savages hunt all day and kill whoever does not agree with them. The thing I liked about the book is how they described their way of life on the island.

Exciting and mind catching through the whole entire book. Some may find disturbing but it really makes you think"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book caught me pleasantly off-guard. For the first half of the story, I found myself interested in the story of young boys on an island trying to survive on their own. As the group gathers on the otherwise deserted island, they begin to form a basic society. Leaders quickly arise, and responsibilities are divided. However, things begin to degenerate as duties become neglected, a power struggle arises, and some of the society decide not to follow the rules. The book's symbolism soon becomes apparent, and the story of boys on an island becomes a commentary into society in general.Golding does a superior job of using symbolism effectively. The symbols are subtle and yet unmistakeable. I found myself staying up late one night finishing the last few pages, and I've found myself yearning to read it over and over."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's Lord of the Flies keeps your interest from the beginning to the end, from the crash to the rescue. Throughout the book, problems for the boys revolve around the concepts of man vs. man and man vs. nature more often than not. Most of the boys which have come from big cities are not used to killing their own food let alone fighting for their lives on a secluded island without any contact with the &quot;outside world.&quot; After reading this novel Ralph, Piggy, Jack and the rest of the boys are not only characters in a book, but figures which become part of you life. Although the book deals with the lives of younger people, it is definitely a book for all ages."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the FliesLord of the Flies is a classic book, written by William Golding. It takes place about 50 years ago on a deserted island during the heart of World War II. It starts off when a group of boys are on a plane and they crash on a deserted island when they get shot down. They were escaping the fictional atomic bomb in England. As the boys all come together in a group, they find that there are no adults on the island and they elect a 12 year old boy, Ralph, as chief. The boys explore the island and find that there are animals and fruit to eat. After the boys settle in, they make huts on the beach which become extremely useful in the future. One day while the boys were holding a meeting, a young child, about 7, said that he saw a gigantic 'beast', as he called it. It was not taken seriously. After that meeting, the boys have two encounters with the beast and the little boy was never seen again. Jack Merridew, leader of the hunters, (a group that they formed to find food), soon leads his group to become extremely barbaric. After getting tired of listening to Ralph's orders, he forms his own tribe and by the end of the story, the remaining members of his group had gone to his tribe. One day while Jack's tribe was out hunting, they killed one of the pigs they saw and hung its head on a tree trunk as an offering to the beast. As Simon, one of the boys, looks at it, the pig's head, full of flies, begins to talk. The pig says that he is the Lord of the Flies and that they must be careful not to overstay their welcome on the island. Simon is so scared that he faints and gets carried off to sea. Later on, through a war, between Jack's tribe and Ralph himself, Ralph passes out from exhaustion. When he wakes up he's greeted by a naval officer on the beach who saw their signal fire and came to get them. Two main losses however were of Piggy, Ralph's best friend on the island, and Simon one of the friends to the younger kids. My favorite character in the book was Piggy. Piggy is an overweight, nearsighted little boy. He lives with his aunt because both his parents were killed when he was young. He is one of the first people on the island to be noticed by Ralph. Piggy also has asthma. Because of this and his lack of being active, he is often made fun of and not taken seriously at meetings. He is loyal to Ralph throughout the whole story until he gets killed at the end. Piggy at the beginning seems a little bit obnoxious. He acts like a 'mama's boy' who would not do anything without confirming it with an adult. He continuously asks Ralph if there are any adults on an island because they give Piggy a sense of security. The reader learns to feel bad for him however because he now has no family and everybody is treating him like dirt. The people that make fun of him though do get put through pain, later in the story. At the end of the story, Piggy is well respected by the reader and Ralph, no one else. Piggy has given a lot to the boys in the story like his glasses for starting fires and giving his thoughts regardless of what other people thought of him. Ralph really cares about Piggy because he was the most loyal person to him in the story. Piggy tries to follow Ralph's rules and go by what he says, but when the two of them are the only ones left that are not in Jack's tribe, Piggy treats Ralph strictly as a friend. If I had to rate this book on a scale of 1-10 I would give it a 9. The book had a remarkable story line, which pushes the reader to keep reading. The characters were completely different and it added a silent war to the story because each character's personality was completely different and was trying to override the other. Some parts, however, were very hard to understand and they required me to reread them. There was a lot of symbolism and figurative language in the story and made the plot very hard to find but when you did, the work was worthwhile."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book in my 9th Grade English Honors class, and couldn't wait to get it over with!

Now, for summer reading I am having to read To Kill a Mockingbird and it is pretty good! Not even comparible to Lord of the Flies! To sum it up in one word, YUCK!!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I find it difficult to fully express my opinions about this book, which I finished last night. On the one hand, it was extremely exciting and fast paced in its general plot and description, and this made it fun to read. On the other hand, it was full of dark, ominous, foreboding, and at times downright terrifying symbolism. I am normally not a big fan of excessive symbolism, and this book had more than I had ever encountered. This alone would not make me dislike a book though. I found myself genuinely loathing the savages, and this, while it drew me into the book, also made me hate reading it. I coulnd't shake the feeling that something terrible was going to happen, and when it did the feeling didn't go away. All things considered, I certainly feel that this book is superbly written and does a wonderful job of conveying its message. However, I coulnd't stand the fact that the message was basically that humans are inherently evil. I couldn't disagree more, and while I may be labeled a deluded optimist, I can't bring myself to believe that some schoolboys on a desert island would end up killing each other. I found the thought most disturbing and depressing, and that was my overall impression of the book.All in all, this was a wonderfully done book with a clearly conveyed message, and I am glad that I read it. However, I disagreed with the message, and found the book to be quite disturbing. My review couln't be much more mixed up, could it? I would suggest that you read this book, but be prepared to be shocked and detested."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I really liked Lord of the Flies(I liked even more when I found out that one of the Simpsons episodes were inspired from it). I read this book late last year...it is about an all-boys scout getting into an airplane crash and getting stranded on a deserted island--with no adults supervising them. First few days work out so-so but then it starts turning into cave-manism(if that's a word) and then later on canabalism(almost). This book really teaches a lesson, about people, how they really are.

I enjoyed it somewhat.It is a good plot concept in general, with lots of opportunity for analysis and psychological scrutiny. However, oftentimes I had a difficult time believing that the characters were children, because they seemed to behave a little too adult for their age. The writing was a bit verbose for my tastes, although not excessively so. Because of this, it didn't suck me into it's world entirely, and it wasn't something that I was very enthusiastic about finishing, except to find out how it ends.Overall, this is worth reading if you have any curiosity about it, but it may take some determination to get through it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I gotta say, I loved this book. Leaving all the school reviews behind of foreshadowing and such, I really could associated with all the main characters and see it through thier eyes (except Simon, not much of a mystic myself).

The story starts on an island where a plane crash of young British boys had occured. The sorty takes the reader through the horrors of how these boys had to work together to survive and what struggles they went through with each other. William Golding did a good job of showing how much different people are and what different goals people have. &quot;Loard Of The Flies&quot; was a quick read for me yet it still made me impatient because the charactures kept repeating themselves. Ralf, a leader in the book, would always say &quot;we need to keep the fire going.&quot; Jack, another leader, would always say &quot;we need to hunt.&quot; Sure the book needed to state this so we could get to know the characters but we didn't need to read these quotes every five minutes This book was very similar to &quot;Animal Farm,&quot; except it used people instead of animals. I saw lots of similarites in the two books and how power can get into the wrong hands. Some people like to abuse their powers and these two books show that really well. I think people who like to read about government would like this book because it relates to how a country is ran. Willam Golding did a good job of using description in which he described every little detail, whether it was a person, the island, or what the boys were doing. &quot;The Bushes crashed ahead of them. Boys flung themsleves wildly from the pig track and scrabbled in the creepers,screaming.&quot; This is just one of the many quotes where William Golding uses vivid details.

And apparently much to my surprise some people aren't able to appreciate this masterpiece. And masterpiece it is. It is one of the greatest novels of the Twentieth Century, rivaled only by The Great Gatsby and Catcher in the Rye. What should be examined is whether the book would ever receive a mediocre reading once given appropriate discussion of the symbolism and implications for society and the inherent evil in an unmanaged civilization. This is a book that on the surface might appear gory, pessimistic, and blah. But that's most likely derived from a shallow and effortless reading of the text.Like The Great Gatsby, this is a text that should be read on a regular basis to re-live the youthful pleasures of reading."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is definetly one of the best books I have read.

Instead of telling everyone the ending and ruining it for them how about you give a basic setting instead?

The problem lies with the deeper meanings revealed in the book. There are just to many of them..therefore it is really easy to get things confused. The way the author describes the characters is lacking information. For example, why is the boy Jack who only wants to hunt...so jealous of Ralph who only wants to get home, there must be more him that would justify his actions. The description of the &quot;BEAST&quot; is very hard to understand...was there one or not? Some parts of the plot, (it was so hard to see where everything was going) were long and irrelevant to the story, such as the long, dragged out descriptions of the island itself. The ending is the worst part about it...it ended so abruptly one minute there is a man hunt and suddenly there are the rescuers. If you want to think alot about a book ...then this is the one for you. As for those who must read it for school...I suggest getting it from the library than actually buying a copy at the bookstore.

The book is about a group of boys who try to survive on a isolated island after a plane-crash. It is interesting so see the relationships between the boys, how they immediately take up different positions. At their fist meeting one boy, Jack, is chosen as the leader. Rules are made and accepted by every one. In the beginning everything was organized. Young and old boys are working together and everything is fine. But then their friendship begins to fail. One boy who they call Piggy becomes the outsider. Another boy who's name is Jack, who from the beginning also wanted to be the leader, starts to take over more and more. One day the group splits up and Jack forms his own group with completely different rules. Nothing is working on the island anymore and it runs out of control. One night something terrible happens, and it's then when Ralph understands that it's only the beginning. The rules which they all decided from the beginning don't exist any longer. Then Ralph becomes alone, against everyone else...I thought the book was kind of good, but not as good as I had expected it to be, because it's so popular. It is written with describing sentences that makes it easy to imagine the environment and how they think. The language is easy to understand, since the author writes as the children think. But yet the text is deep and the book made me think. The subject that Golding has chosen is unusual, but good. It doesn't only tell us about the boys on the island, but wants to show that power isn't only a positive thing and can lead to something else, much worse.From Karin, 15 years"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's perception of the kids' innate evil to most people was obsurd, but no one knows and that's what he thought.

It didn't age well. I think we need far more to shock us today and so much of the significance is lost. A great book, in its time and context, no doubt."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"At first glance, this book can seem like yet another schoolboy adventure story. In truth, when read without instruction, Lord of the Flies can be boring and tedious. However, it is entirely necessary for one to look rather deeply beyond the surface in order to grasp the full meaning and depth of this tale. In fact, I wouldn't quite call this book an adventure story- it is more about pure survival. A group of English schoolboys are stranded on an island during the next world war after their plane crashes. A boy named Ralph becomes the chief, while the head choir boy, Jack, leads the group of hunters as Ralph is guided by the wisdom of the unappreciated and taunted Piggy. Also on the island is the epileptic SImon, who becomes somewhat of a mystic and becomes the first boy to truly understand the darkness that has overtaken the rest of the boys. Golding's story is fraught with metaphors and hidden messages. The entire book is a sort of allegory to Freud's makeup of the human mind, with certain boys coming to represent the Id, Ego, and Superego. Instead of becoming a fun, parent-free island, the boys are overtaken by their most primitive urges (the Id) and become ruthless, killing savages, particularly Jack and his friend Roger. Only a few boys appear to retain their sanity, but then death by the boys' hands comes to the island. The story becomes a Darwinian nightmare. I was enthralled by this tale of savagery and heartlessness, and felt that Golding's representation of the darkness of man's heart was both honest and striking. It is no wonder that this book is required reading for many schools across the country."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book is about a plane crashing leaving a bunch of kids stuck on an island. They are celebrating their independence at first but after a while their chance of being rescued is slim. Day to day, they create their own laws and rules to somewhat form their own government. The moral of the book is the importance of the government and how it regulates the rules and laws.I would recommend this book because its very suspenseful and leaves you guessing. The Morals and values can relate to my life and may relate to yours too. The value of the government is often taken for granted as we don't follow the Laws/Rules. The book teaches the importance of how you should follow the laws and to not be a menace in society."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"The Lord Of The Flies\\" is an exciting adventure yarn that memorably delves into the problem of free will versus social order. Unlike most such literary explorations, we learn here that free will may not be all that great after all, or a confining social order all that bad.A plane crashes in a tropical island, leaving a large but unorganized group of pre-teen boys the only survivors. A boy named Ralph takes charge by virtue of a vote, and for a while the boys work reasonably as a team to facilitate their rescue. But dark forces are at work from within and without, and soon the social order the boys came in with is displaced by brutality and murder.A familiar subject of parody on such shows as \\"South Park\\" and \\"The Simpsons\\", \\"Lord Of The Flies\\" was itself written as something of a parody of the English children's novel \\"The Coral Island\\". In \\"The Coral Island\\", a boy named Ralph and his two friends find themselves on a desert island and display sufficiency and daring before their eventual rescue. Here there is no such sufficiency, and only a negative kind of daring. Neither boy nor nature is of a kind to play by the rules, perhaps author William Golding's point when he presented this in 1954 after having served in the Royal Navy during World War II.Ralph may be our hero, but Golding points out he's not much of a leader. Ralph, he writes, \\"would treat the day's decisions as though he were playing chess. The only trouble was that he would never be a very good chess player.\\"Ralph's brain trust, a kid with the unfortunate nickname \\"Piggy\\", is arguably no help, full of whiny hall-monitor admonishments and rather lazy besides. Also an ally is the insightful but rather moony Simon, a bit of a lone wolf. About the only boy who really seems up to the task of taking charge here is a choir leader named Jack, a natural-born hunter who rallies the others with talk of painting their faces and having fun.Of course, Jack's the bad guy, but after a few readings I can almost imagine this story being told by Jack in an alternate version as a sort of parable of free-living youngsters shaking off the adult wanna-bes in their midst to get in tune with their wild sides. Never mind the fact that some of them, like the sadistic Roger, are more in need of a sedative.Though the book is dark, it is neither oppressive nor boring. High schoolers should take heart - there are much duller books you can be reading than this. If you are like me, you may even find the novel electrifying in the way it keys in upon the hardness of growing up. The beasties Ralph and the others live in fear of may be fantasy, but bullies are real, and few books depict that sad rite of passage as well as this one.Great writing, too. Each chapter has a fully realized sense all its own, and Golding's depiction of the island and its natural, chaotic beauty make for some memorable passages: \\"The assembly looked with him, considered the vast stretches of water, the high sea beyond, unknown indigo of infinite possibility, heard silently the sough and whisper from the reef.\\" The natural world does at times seem to be a menacing force as described by Golding.\\"Lord Of The Flies\\" was a favorite of mine in high school, and remains so nearly 30 years later. It doesn't get old; it just draws you in a little deeper each time."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Thanks a lot for fast delivery; the book arrived 4 days from order date regardless of \\"estmated date.\\""},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a really good book.

It is also a great study on human nature. It is the perfect example on why anarchy can not work. Human nature does not allow a society without hierachy to function. It all falls apart in the end. Also when one reads the book, one can also get a lot of pop culture references to the book like the conch, and piggy. The Simpsons has a funny rendition of the novel as well.

The type of person that I think that would like the book the most is the adventurous type.I think the purpose for writing the book was to show that without authority, there would be total chaos. I agree with the message because when the kids got used to not having a parental figure around they did what they wanted. The element that was handled best was the climax because of how detailed he explained every thing that was going on. This book was very believable because you're always hearing about people getting into plane crashes and they were standed on an island for a long period of time and they had to use a lot of survival skills.The book was less than perfect because in the middle of action Golding jumps to something totally different.

At first I didn't like it but when everything started happening I really started to enjoy the book. My teacher also made the book very fun to read becasue she put alot of energy into it. The more energy you use to read the book the better it is. The only thing I disagreed with in the book was that Ralph was the leader. I thought with the help of Ralph,Piggy would have been the best leader because he was the smartest one in the group. I also think Golding did a good job writing this book. He used alot of themes that are in society today,and made me think what if something like that could happen, what would it be like. Trust me if you read this book you will be very impressed. One Love and Peace Out!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding is writing this book so he can send out a message. The message is there is evil inside everyone. I do not agree with this message because Simon was pure good. The literary element I think he used best is symbolism because he used it alot. I think this book is very believable because there is evil in some boys, and those boys will do crazy things. There is only one thing I don't like about this book. I think Jack or Roger should of die or really get hurt."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding was trying to say that there is evil in everyone. I do agree on this theme becuase I don't think everyone is &quot;good&quot;. I believe everyone does something that is evil. Although, some people have it in them more than others. I think the author used a lot of description which made it really boring. He also used too much violence, which in my opinion, only made it worse. I think this can happen to anyone who is in a plane crash. Being in this situatuion can get your mind crazy and make you do weird things, like the boys did. If it was me who wrote the book, I would use less description becuase is made it boring. I would also make it less vioent."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's purpose for writing this story was he meant to send a message out to the readers. He wanted to let us know what it would be like to be free without rules and authority. I think Golding handled setting and symbolism best out of all the literary elements in the book. He described the island so good it makes you visualize what it looks like. Golding also used lots of symbolism helping to explain why certain things happened in the story. Golding wanted to show how young boys would react to being alone and in charge of themselves. It is a good book and enjoyable..I encourage you to read it if you like semi adventure and realism."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In this novel I think that the author purpose for writing this book was to state that all people are born naturally evil.I don't agree with the author though.I think that the people are changed into evil and not born into it.

Yes I think this looks was believable.I so becaue everything that happened to them can happen to someone we know or someone we love. I don't think that there was ways the book was less than perfect.If I was a writer I would just make it more suspenseful to make people want to read the book.Thats how I would fix the flaw. stix"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was a very good book. We read it in class one day and I started to get sick. We were on Chapter 4 and then I went home. I was sick a whole week, so I know that I missed out on an immense amount of reading. So I got an idea one morning. I told my mom to go buy me the book. She went and purchased it and I begin to catch up on my reading. I really enjoyed this book. I encourage my friends to read this. It was very inspiring. My teacher said that scientists believe that it was based on a true story, but he said they do not have enough evidence to prove that it really happened. In my opinion, I think it couldn't have happened because everyone knew where the boys were traveling to and when the boys came up missing, they could have retraced their route and went back looking for them. This is my review of the book. I attend St. Andrews Middle School and I read this in an AAP Young Literature Class. Now at my age, this book would be considered to a little to old, but I understood it quite well.Audra Williams"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"Lord of the Flies\\" smells really sweet and as a fan of anything that is able to translate complex issues into simple ways I found Golding's work here to be incredibly great! It's really interesting to me about just how great classics like this one have the ability to reach the reader at various maturity levels allowing one to glean treasures through repeated reading over the years with each visit revealing even greater insights that may have been missed during prior visits. This to me is the definition of a literary masterpiece.Although I didn't have the privilege of reading this book in school as the powers that were at the time decided that for my year the books we had to study/read were Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\" and H. G. Wells' \\"The History of Mr. Polly\\" I can easily see why for many other students this classic has been selected having just read it decades after my GCE \\"O\\" Level Literature paper. I can see many similarities between this book and Orwell's satirical masterpiece as both provide very good lessons about human behaviour under extenuating circumstances and about how the concept of \\"original sin\\" as originally described by Augustine in the 4th century B.C. is so close to the surface for humans and how conscious effort has to be made to guard against the ease of descending into animal savagery. Golding shows us why law and order/governance is absolutely necessary while Orwell shows us how the wrong kind of governance can also be undesirable. Just like \\"Animal Farm\\" this classic can be read at a number of levels and still be enjoyed from the very superficial adventure tale to the various deeper levels of complexity that you could care to dig into and hence extract the optimal degree of utility from your reading enjoyment. Elements from this novel reminded me of Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" as well although I feel Golding's work to be a lot easier read in terms of ability to extract the author's intended message. Golding's ideas live on and continue to capture the imagination in various guises such as in television e.g. \\"Lost\\" or even comedy in the movies e.g. \\"The Simpsons\\" remember \\"Emperor\\" Moe?This 50th Anniversary Edition hardcover version is also a treat coming in an attractive dustcover with raised gold print for the title and a few illustrations scattered within the text at the start of chapters as well as a section: \\"Notes On Lord of the Flies\\" comprising of an essay as well as another section: \\"Lord of the Flies: Selected Highlights of Critical Analysis\\" with contributions from various critics not forgetting the introduction by E. M. Forster. I also liked the rough-edged pages and the font sized for comfortable reading.An excellent classic that rewards repeated reading regardless of your age group given a worthy 50th Anniversary binding makes this a worthy addition to any library.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Not only is this book expertly written with an intriguing story line, it also contains vivid imagery and symbolism throughout. The book represents the very animalistic qualities of human nature and the settings in which it can be brought about. The novel is full of subtle symbolism, from Piggy's glasses, to the fire itself, and has an adventurous plot that is sure to keep the pages turning. The books central ideas and messages are conveyed accuratley and interestingly and do not disappoint. This book is a must read for all and is sure to become a favorite for those who embark on Golding's journey."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Mahmoud SarhanLord of the FliesWhat would happen if authority disappeared, people could do as they pleased and could fulfill their desires? CHAOS!! A recent example of the 2003 blackout in New York will suffice as citizens pillaged and raided stores stealing valuable and causing destruction. A more detailed example of lack of authority occurs in Lord of the Flies by William Golding, a thriller to say the least, takes the audience on an exciting adventure through the gates of social construction. Golding creates a world of chaos and freedom when a group of British school boys become stranded on a desert island. A struggle between the \\"rational\\" the fire-watchers and the \\"irrational\\" the hunters creates a whole new idea of complete freedom and independence. The boys split into two groups until the hunters lose all humanity and begin to hunt down the fire- watchers. The unusual plot makes the book a great read as Golding takes us into a possibly realistic situation revealing the human necessity of rules and boundaries. Lack of social control is a great theme in this book as wants and temptations cause selfishness and separation. I recommend this book to high teenagers and above allowing the readers to retain the full experience and meaning of the novel along with the ample symbolism and irony that occurs in Lord of the Flies. Golding is able to successfully show the fragility of civilization and what is needed to keep people in control. The major consensus that this book is an allegory of World War II makes sense as barbarism and war take place of cooperation and friendship."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I ordered this audio CD as an accommodation (academic support) for a special education student.

Which is better, law and rescue, or hunting and breaking things up?\\" (p. 162). Published in 1954, this amazing piece of work illustrates society and society's reaction to isolation apart from law. The knowledgeable Piggy, one of the many characters in the novel The Lord of the Flies, articulated this quote. This novel shows a group of young boys stranded on an island after their plane was shot down and the pilot killed. All by themselves, the juvenile, vigorous boys are trying to get off the island and get home ... or are they? Selfishness and a lust for power undermine the aim for rescue. While a few of the boys are working hard to obtain liberation from the atoll, several are obsessed with the thought of acquiring supremacy and relishing in the freedom and separation from their previous normal, boring lives with rules and adults.This story, furthermore, examines the hearts and motivations of mankind. The message is that deep down inside of us as humans is a bent toward evil. The author, William Golding, presents this point by demonstrating that when there is no one around to enforce law, evil comes out of the boys and, consequently, causes much mayhem and destruction. \\"The beast struggled forward, broke the ring and fell over the steep edge of the rock to the sand by the water. At once the crowd surged after it, poured down the rock, leapt on to the beast, screamed, struck, bit, tore. There were no words, and no movements but the tearing of teeth and claws\\" (p. 136). This quote shows how brutal and savage the boys have become. They strike with a mob mentality mistaking one of their own for the \\"beast.\\" Earlier in the novel, this very character makes a prophetic statement about the beast while addressing the group: \\"What I mean is ... maybe it's only us\\" (p. 77). He is saying that the beast, whatever it is, is the evil within themselves.Lord of the Flies is an exciting and riveting story that captures your heart. Some critics say the book ends rather abruptly, but others feel strongly that the ending is consistent with the author's purpose. The reader is left with a sense of contrast where instant law and order replaces chaos. Rich imagery and symbolism are discovered throughout the book and personal introspection is promoted. The book also causes the reader to take a deeper look at and analyze the true condition of the heart and soul of man and the role of society in maintaining morality. Lord of the Flies is an American classic and is written by the brilliant author William Golding. This timeless masterpiece should be read over and over again by every generation."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I really liked this book because it was so different.

The seemingly simple plot covers a world of intriguing themes and symbols. The diverse characters shape the storyline while at the same time represent ideas and concepts with deeper meanings. All should enjoy this marvelous novel.The book begins when a group of English schoolboys are stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific. A terrible storm causes their doomed plane to crash and with no adult supervision, the boys run wild. Initially, they elect a chief and call group meetings to discuss important things to do such as building shelters and maintaining a signal fire. However, as the boys bask in the joy of their new found freedom and find no limits to hold them back or adults to punish them for misbehaving, they begin their fall from the heights of civilization and order to the depths of chaos.In the novel, written after World War II, Golding portrays his views on society through symbolism and themes in the novel. One of the themes explores the nature of evil. The boys become very afraid of a beast that they are sure exists on the island. One of the boys, Simon, however, suggests that perhaps the evil is within them and not in the form of a beast. As the boys become more malicious in their acts toward each other, they undergo a terrible experience in which they lose their childhood innocence. They are no longer the good little boys who arrived on the island. Golding also makes a point about civilization and savagery. Towards the end of the novel, the boys signify that they have left civilization behind by smearing blood on their faces as war paint and making animal sacrifices. In addition to themes, symbols are widely used in the novel. The boys use a conch to call group meetings where each boy can voice his own opinion without interruption. The shattering of the conch signifies that the boys have lost their last shred of civility. By using symbols and themes to express his ideas, Golding has created a spectacular novel.Although the characters are only boys, they represent mature concepts. Ralph is the elected chief of the boys and is the image of kindness; he represents democracy. However, although his kindness is what gets him elected it is also his undoing. Jack is Ralph's opposite, using the boys' fear to govern them as a tyrannous dictator when order crumbles. Simon is quiet and spiritual; he is the one who realizes that the supposed \\"beast\\" on the island exists only in the boys' imaginations, and that the evil lies within the boys themselves. The scientist among the boys, logical Piggy, is the backbone of civilization. He helps Ralph make decisions as chief and is his loyal friend. A sullen, mysterious figure, Roger is probably the most feared of all the boys. He has no conscience, and without adults to administer punishment, Roger knows no limit to his horrific acts. By presenting the readers with these characters, Golding enhances his work significantly.Lord of the Flies is a stunning book that you should definitely read. All the elements of the novel hold the reader in a tight grasp all the way to the end. The themes and symbols are delightful to contemplate and certainly open one's mind. Golding's characters are very realistic and easy to believe. Readers aged thirteen and older should read this novel by all means."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Flies that Plague Us All\\"The most influential novel... since Salinger's Catcher in the Rye.\\" - Time William Golding's amazing novel, Lord of the Flies, is a thoughtful allegory that should be read and pondered by all people.

As a result many people read it at an age where they are filleting its pages for 'symbols' to be reprocessed in exam answers, and sniggering at innuendos such as blowing the conch.All of which is a shame, as Lord of the Flies articulates a theme of the innate savage just under the surface of civilized man. A trope that has spawned a thousand imitators in films and books since, but Golding's novel was probably the first. Beginning as a deceptively simple fable about some well educated British schoolboys stranded on an island after a plane crash, the allegorical story traces their descent into frenzied barbarisim.Golding himself was a schoolmaster for a number of years, and he knows exactly what boys are like. If they are not strictly regulated and controlled, chaos is the inevitable result."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I listened to this book during my commute to and from work, and was impressed that the reading was done by the author. Though he did not make the characters sound any different (so at times it was difficult to tell who was speaking), this was tempered by the fact that his accent fit the story quite well and his comments before and after the reading were particularly insightful. The story itself focuses on the most basic characteristics of the human race, and the struggles that result between those various characteristics.

There were two parts in particular, two of the main events, that as I was reading I literally felt sick to my stomach and had tears in my eyes. This book is really quite disturbing and I realise now that really it was a big ask to get a bunch of 15-year-olds to read and watch this and perhaps if my memory was better I could tell you why it didn't affect me like it has today but alas I cannot but I must say I also wonder why not, maybe it was just too disturbing and I blocked it, who knows?

I would say that Golding's message to this story, during World War II, makes a symbolic point that every male/female has the sinful nature inside themselves, and that if there is no order in us, then we become savages just like these boys on this lost island that are misbehaving and are uncivilized. The colors and items used in this story symbolically were the conch shell, the pigs, black, white, red, the speckles (glasses), and the island. Overall these symbols represented savagery, leadership, life, death, and isolation. People that are into historical fiction and suspenseful views should read this book because everything Golding displays in this book makes great quality of symbolism and has a great climax to this book. In my opinion, I loved reading this book because it felt like as if I were in the story and I actually learn a lot about how \\"civilized\\" people become \\"savages\\".

Golding presents an intriguing premise and utilises provoking themes of savagery versus civilization, but he writes in such an uninspired and drawn-out manner that it's extremely difficult to truly absorb oneself into the narrative. Every character was flat and unlikeable in at least one way; the only one that came close to gaining my interest was one I pitied, and I deeply dislike piteous characters.I am female, and I have usually never minded any lack of prominent female roles in books or films. The way Golding uses the female here, though, is half-baked and somewhat insulting. As well, while I don't mind symbolism if it's varied and carefully used, there is only really one large symbolic theme in this book, and I found it rather elementary and fumbled.I don't mind gore either -- among my favourite books is All Quiet on the Western Front, and despite its skewered view, one of my favourites movies is the hyperrealistic Black Hawk Down -- but the gore here has almost no emotional value at all and simply disgusts.The closing paragraphs are the only parts that came close to being interesting, if just for the symbolic contrast it provided. Even then, however, because Golding for me had built no tension or suspense whatsoever up to it, it merely showed how silly the entire affair and its participants were, and almost made me laugh despite the apparent gravity that was involved.It may have been all the enthusiasm around it from other readers, but even so, William Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is one of the worst &quot;good&quot; books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the book Lord of the Flies, the author William Golding shows the reader what it would be like to be stranded on a deserted island. This book is for thinkers that like peering into the savage part of our nature. Besides, it's about seriously messed up half naked British boys. This book has a great plot because it's about a bunch of psychotic kids killing others. This book was extremely intersting and had great symbolism. I gave this book 4 stars because it was a really good book but not the best."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Now before I start let me just say that this book is not a bad book, just an overrated oneThis is an O.K although it bored me when i read it in High School, I wondered why we just couldn't have read \\"Return of the Native\\" or something better, I don't know why it is on required reading lists nor why it was made into two movies. I guess when you pick apart every syllable and say it means something profound then it does. As for a plot that means anything or charecters that make the slightest bit of sense well lets just forget that.At best you have a harrowing tale about kids being trapped on an island losing their identify here the become a mycocausum for different types of society.

It was a favorite for most of the students in my class so I decided to give the novel another try and I'm glad I did...I read this book a second time very quickly as I was intrigued by everything that went on in LOTF and I learned a valuable lesson in that if you don't come together in a time of need you will suffer and also that we sometimes fear what will happen and fear to help others so we are classified as &quot;beasts&quot; I found something valuable the second time I read this novel rather than the first go around...Do read this book..I think you will enjoy it and get a lot from it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was A book of choice I had chose for a book report in my histoy class.

But I did however, like the description of the platform, with the green water and reflection on the plam leaves. But They way he described the kids,i don't know their faces, and that whole skinny dipping scene and that they're all boys on the island- the way he kept descripbeing them, every detail of there looks- sounded kind of quer to me.--I'm sorry, no offense.

Ralph &quot;the boy with fair hair&quot; is made chief instantly as the others prefere his easy going ways to the angry and arrogant Jack . As time goes on Ralph has no one keeping to the rules , only simon is helping . Jack hunts and starts getting more people to agree with him at the fact that he should have been the leader . Jack is a great dictator so this works marvolusly . Jack does not like everyone though , he is mean to piggy as piggy is weak , he has asma and glasses . Jack feels no sympathy whatsoever towards piggy though . Soon Jack lures the boys away from Ralph and piggy and simon ( the democracy ) to his group of wild savages . If the boys have no leader , and when Ralph starts to nag like a parent the follow the one they see as strong even if the morals are wrong . Alot like how the germans followed hitlar long ago . The inocence these children had is dead when they start getting exited about killing , they have nothing to do on the island so getting exited about killing makes them want to do it more . They end up complete savages and when they are all hyped up after a dance at a feast and simon appears out of the dark the group of savages all pounce on him &quot; they were no words just the sound of claws and teeth tearing flesh &quot; . The children later hunt Ralph and Ralph does not know what hes done so wrong to be hunted , the fact is he is different and so if someone standed out they would be hunted or killed then and there . Ralph is the innocence and reason in the island so was piggy and simon they all still had a concience . The others were won over by savagery . At the end when they are all faced with what the most important thing was and they had forgotten it , rescue . They all think about what they have just done . The actual fact that they had killed people , and it could have been them too . Ralph thinks and &quot; weeped for the end of innocence and for dear wise friend Piggy &quot; . I agree totally that the point of this is exploring the boundary beetween human reason and animal instinct . This was written when a war was on though so the author thought evry one , when put in the cercumstances would be that violent and savage . It may not be so . This was written to make people think very deeply about reason and how awful people can be when in a horrible situation like that of in lord of the flies . And by the way if your wondering what the lord of the flies is , its a dead pigs head on a stick which the children gave to &quot;the beast &quot; as a sactafice , it later in the book tells Simon that there is no beast , they are the beast basically . And simon who had the intellect and understanding of the savagery and the beast now had the laguage to express and describe it to the others , when he found this out he ran to the others to tell them . Unfortunatly &quot;the beast and evil in the children&quot; got to him first ."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's Lord Of The Flies begins with a plane crash on an island somewhere in the ocean. A group of boys ranging in age survived and have no adult supervision. The children learn to survive, yet one boy always disagrees with their choosen leader Ralph. Jack, the boy that sees a need to disagree, starts his own hunting tribe. These boys become savages and do what they want to at any given time. The message to human kind is hidden behind a story about boys surviving, but it is revealed by the use of symbolism and that is why this book is fun to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was not very interesting at all.

It had excitement, adventure, and more. I think that it is great summer reading, especially if you like those reality TV shows, because it somewhat reminds you of those."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In my opinion Golding's reasons for writing this book are to show that there is an inner beast in everyone. I agree with his message because there is a point in everyone's day, or life that their true beast comes out. The best literary elements that Golding uses were foreshadowing and symbolism. He uses symbolism the best in the way he used Piggy's glasses to reveal a sign of vision. Not just eye-sight but the sight of seeing things clearly. Piggy was the only one on the island that had a clear vision of life and he was also able to see that rules are needed in life for things to work out and for there not to be any serious conflicts. L.O.F. is a very realistic book because if any number of people were stranded on an island without any rules there would be absolute chaos. People would be power hungry like Jack. There would be a few people that thought that rules were neccessary to survive, like Piggy.They would eventually turn into worrying about themselves, and getting only what they need to survive in life. I think the book could have had a better ending. A reader from LBHS (Long Branch High School)!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am 14 years old and loved this book. I have read many books and liked and hates some. But this book I loved!! When my friends and family told me about it it made me sick to think of KIDS killing each other. Once I read it I loved it. Golding really understood that kids will only want to have fun. I recomend this to anyone who likes to read and to anyone over 13 years old. Most teenagers thought it was stupied, but you got to remeber that, that is how life is, there is good and bad people, most peoples like the bad people because they make life seem easyer.

The ending is classic and I knew the ending from the start. This book is really amazing. It's SO simple, yet the real meaning behind it is complexed and shows how our own mortal sin looks beautiful but leads to destruction. The fears of the island are their own fears. They each describe it to what THAT individual person fears.

About the story, it is about a bunch of kids and they got into a wreck, and they all landed on an island. They all spilt up and went their different ways. The main characters are, Ralph, Jake, Simon, and Piggy. Ralph took the little boys known as the &quot;Littluns&quot;.

The stark symbolism is chilling and unparalled. One caution though, do not read this novel if you do not appreciate or understand symbolism. THIS NOVEL CAN NOT BE READ AT SURFACE LEVEL! This book is not to be read by young students who have not had exposure to interpreting plot lines and symbolism.After completing the novel I was spellbound and thought about nothing else but its chilling implications. It is one of the most provacative novels in existence.

It's extremely well written but William Golding didn't just produce a beautifully written novel, he produced a frightening view of the human race which I know I will never forget. The book's impressive characters convey to the reader an amazingly powerful message about good and evil. The book is also a true page turner, an exciting adventure story that spirals toward a spectacular ending. The author also portays the island on which the story takes place so well that while the reader is flipping pages constantly, to see what comes next, he will find himself transported to this unknown island in the middle of the sea. Personally I am extremely impressed that Golding can portray so many of the problems in the human race with just, &quot;kids being kids,&quot; but he did accomplish it. This tour de force tale of society is highly recommended, although be warned you'll never see the world the same way again."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was a wonderful book.

Their plane has crashed and the lads from 6 to 12 are left alone amid the roar of the surf, the cries of the jungle and the indifference of the universe.Ralph emerges as the leader. He is a fair haired English schoolboy. He meets Piggy a myopic boy who refers to his asthma, bad eyes and Auntie back home in England. Soon these two boys are joined by several others who have survived the crash. A leader named Jack Merridew emerges as a challenger to the leadership position.Jack becomes a pig hunter leading the majority of boys into the jungle to slaughter pigs. They murder Piggy and Simon. The groups fears beasties and a monster who supposedly lives in the Castle Rock part of the island. Readers learn that a parachutist has landed on the island and been killed by the fall. This pilot's body has become decayed and repulsive as it is caught in the treetops waving back and forth in the tropical breeze. The boys are finally rescued by the Royal Navy who are themselves involved in warfare against their fellow human beings.We have had a glimpse of the sinful and destructive dark side of human nature. The veneer of civilization has been pryed open as innocent schoolboys have reverted to savagery and murder.The novel is a parable of nature grown savage tooth and nail in a Darwinian struggle for survival. In Freudian terms Jack is the id;, Ralph the ego; Piggy the superego. When Piggy loses his glasses and life to the savagery of the boys we see the intellectual and rational nature of humankind destroyed by mindless savagery. The Lord of the Flies is a pig which has been horribly butchered with its rotting head placed on the top of a sharp pole. \\"Beezelbub\\" is \\"Lord of the Flies\\" in Hebrew and is a synonym for the Devil.Lord of the Flies has been read in high school classes for years. It is not a nice story. Instead it is a very graphic novel manifesting man's inhumanity to man and the danger of savagery breaking through the rules of society.Both Joseph Conrad and William Golding force us to look into the heart of darkness. One of the classics of post World War II English fiction."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was awesome. I couldn't stop reading it. It was about surviving on an island and finding more people. So I'm going to write a review. Here is what the book is about.Two boys, Ralph and Piggy were alone on an island, so they thought. When they went to the beach, they found a conch. Since Piggy didn't want to blow it Ralph blew and more kids came. Since there were more kids, some people wanted the leader to be a kid named Jack and some people wanted Ralph to be leader. They took a vote and Ralph was leader.One day, they went to a rock and climbed it. Ralph and Jack and a kid named Roger came with them. Then, they went down. They then decide to split in to two groups but they would still stay in touch. They then walked back to their base.Another day, Jack's group stole Piggy's glasses and he got mad and told them to give them back. They said no. Then, they invaded (invaded what?). Later, a guy on a boat came to bring them back home. He asked if any were dead. Ralph said two. They took them and they never went back to the island.They got rescued. Most stories like this; at the end they get rescued. I always predict that and I'm always right. This book should be read by kids. It's a great book. The font is a little small but I still liked it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In my seventh grade English class we have just finished reading a great book called Lord of the Flies by William Golding. He wrote this book with unbelievable description which would either catch your eye or put you to sleep in class. For me, it was more like putting myself to sleep. That doesn't mean it wasn't a good book, I just think it was in my opinion a book more for adults. Besides the description the plot was well written. I enjoyed how he used Piggy to get the theme across.Mr. Golding put lots of thought into the book when writing description. From describing the ocean blue all the way to describing Piggy's looks and attitudes. Examples of this can be found throughout the book, literally there is no page without description. A description on a tree could even go on for 3 pages. Personally, that was what lost my interest. An example I found was on page 169 where it says \\"The twins watched anxiously and Piggy sat expressionless behind the luminous wall of his myopia.\\" This shoes both the scenery and Piggy's attitude which is stubborn. This shows his stubbornness because the author says he was sitting expressionless which is usually what I do when I'm frustrated. Another good description Golding had was on page 158 where it says \\"The air was heavy with unspoken knowledge.\\" This is showing the tension between Piggy and the other people on the island who are not listening to him.I enjoyed how he used Piggy to get the theme across because of the way he left Piggy there, just open. I can compare Piggy to an unlocked door that people just walk by, they will never know what they have just missed. That is what happened to Piggy they didn't expect anything from him just because of his obesity and judged him just by that which is plain wrong. Just because it is wrong many people do it in present day, it must just be a natural judgment. But really, Piggy is a smart kid. In my opinion I believe that they would have gotten off the island if they just let Piggy be leader or at least do more work. In my opinion the theme was \\"Use what you have, don't make assumptions, and you always have something.\\" That is the first thing they did when they saw Piggy make fun of him. They let that fly past their heads and assumed he wouldn't help. Really he was their key to success and knowledge. They always had him there but just left him hanging.So if you are thinking about buying this book or not, I would say go ahead. Anyways, the most you have to lose is a few dollars. Maybe if you don't like description then just don't even bother, but if you adore description then defiantly try this book. You will finish it and realize that book really wasn't that bad after all."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I don't understand some of these reviews. \\"Twas alright\\", \\"book was OK\\"! I was stunned when I first read this book 50 years ago! Where have our morals gone? This book is so pertinent to this day. With the banks receiving the taxpayer's, money then continuing to abuse the public. This is moral? This is OK? There is so much in this story to absorb to think about, to move one to action. I guess might makes right these days. This story is \\"alright\\"? It's \\"OK\\". Where are we going as a species?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I enjoyed reading Lord of the Flies by William Golding. It was a very well written novel. Although I believe the beginning started really slow and did not grab my attention right a way, but as I kept going the book became more and more interesting. Golding sure knows how to make a huge plot flow and was able to create a huge conflict for the story. The conflict in the end teaches some very valuable life lessons for the reader and the characters.Golding expressed each character extremely well. Each character was unique. The only characters that were very similar were the twins, but they were like one character rather than two characters. The four main characters Ralph, Piggy, Simon, and Jack all add to the story. Ralph is the elected leader and he believes very much in keeping order and government. Ralph also wishes to be rescued and builds a signal fire. (Which becomes a source of many future disputes) Jack is Ralph's opposite because he just wishes to hunt, have fun, and is tremendously power hungry. Piggy is the kid who everyone picks on, the misfit, but he very logical and applies sense to the tough situation they are in. Simon rarely does anything wrong. He is always there to help Ralph, but is sort of a loner compared to the rest of the schoolboys.In the beginning, a group of schoolboys are stranded on an uncharted island and are forced to fend for themselves. At first they try to run a form of government. Which is considerably hard when no adults are there to enforce the rules and as result chaos breaks out. When the boys were thrust into this sort of situation it caused them to grow and mature very rapid. None of them will leave the island the same boy they came to the island as. It shows the dark side of reality and forces us to except the truth is that even the most innocent will fall to evil one day. (Simon) As the boys were taken off the island at the end they all left behind one thing, their innocence.After reading Lord of the Flies by William Golding I say that it was a great book. I highly recommend it and if you are contemplating putting it down DO NOT it only gets better as it goes on!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was actually pretty anxious to read this book when my English teacher introduced it to our class.

Just read the darn thing if you have not."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is, without doubt, one of the greatest tributes to literature and human nature ever. Golding craftily weaves symbolism and other literary devices into the plot to make a stunning novel. Not only did this book change my life, but it has given me a different way in which to perceive others. Some may find it sickening, some may find it boring, some may find it confusing; I found it beautiful. Some people may not like it because Golding is saying something about human nature that they do not want to hear, but truth is truth. The themes are extraordinary and the symbolism complements the plot and themes perfectly."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies, depicts a spine tingling tale of man's willingness to return to his primitive ways. In this book, a plane crash results in several young British boys being stranded on a deserted island. Throughout this tale , a boy named Ralph tries to lead the band of boys. He does so by trying to maintain a civilized society. However, many of the boys begin to stray and began to return to man's savage ways. This band of savages has a leader named Jack. Jack's ways completely go against all of Ralph's ideas and morals. As a result, a conflict occurs between Ralph's goodness and Jack's evil. In the end, we see that even the most civilized man does return to his savage ways when he is backed into a corner. Golding uses a lot of symbolism throughout this intriguing tale. Thus, he is able to keep the reader intrigued by not only the suspenseful plot but the underling meanings as well. Lord of the Flies is by far one of the best books I have ever reader. I highly recommend this book to any reader who is looking for a great suspenseful adventure story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is a good book for anyone in High School to read. I enjoyed it and I think that others my age would also enjoy the book. Even though this book is not something that I would have chosen for myself to read I am glad that I got the opportunity to do so. The Lord of the Flies is a very good example of how people can go from being civilized to being savages in just a matter of time. It gives us an idea of what life would be like if we didn't have rules and regulations. It also shows that even though you sometimes wish that you could just get away from all of the adults and do whatever you want things don't always turn out the way that you expect them to. I think that The Lord of the Flies was a very good book and I would recommend it too anyone looking for an adventurous book filled with many unexpected twists."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Over all I feel Lord of the Flies is one of the most terrifying and intriguing books i have ever read. After devastating plane crash, Ralph tries to bring order and work habits into effect. All he can get from the other boys is fun and games. Although they seemed fun, they soon destroyed the group and caused havoc. Golding set a perfect scene for this type of book, a deserted island with only the jungle as sources of food and shelter. This would be a hard task to manage if your an adult, but he had the oldest boy being around twelve. The boys are forced into separation from the beginning. Even though they stay together in shelters and work, they are separated by their beliefs and are bound to act out on it. Ralph, with Piggy's help, try to keep the group of boys together. No matter what they say, Jack always seems to have something better to say or do. In the end, Golding shows that if people are placed into a society with no rules, nothing good could come of this."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is more than just a story of a group of young Brittish school boys who are trapped on a tropical island together. This book discribes, in part, a journey that every human takes. This journey is a journey of the discovery of ones own morals, character, and compassion. Golding shows us that without rules and authority, man will abandon the comfort of society and regress into barbarianism. Ralph seems to be the symbol of the child in all of us. Though ignorant and naive, Ralph reminds us all what it is like to unconditionaly trusting and co-dependent on others. At a time when laws seem hypocritical and society seems counterproductive, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; reminds us why we even bother with civilization. My favorite character by far is Simon. Simon was weighted down with the knowledge of what was to come and he was unable to convince his friends that he was telling the truth. To me, Piggy represents the person that society and civilization was made to protect. I think these types of stuggles go on continuously in human society. These struggles are only reflections of our inner struggles between our super-egos and our ids. The final question that I got from this book was this, is it better to hide behind the rules of society as Ralph, Simon, and Piggy did, or is it better to hide behind a mask of anyonimity as Jack and Roger did? Like a great paradox, in the end no one really knows the answer for sure. I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought this book was one of the best ever written. I put it up there with Animal Farm. It was such a cool book. I would reccommend it to anyone who likes survival stories with actual conflicts. A very good book!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book 12 years ago in high school, and it remains one of the most affecting novels I have ever read. I'd put it in my top 10."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A reviewer wrote that the fact that most of the boys turned into savages was unrealistic. On the contrary, I thiunk it was the most ingenious and realistic part of the novel. The premise that makes them turn a bunch of stuck-up, snotty British prep school kids turn into savages is one that's also been preached by Freud, Darwin, and Anthony Burgess (the author of A Clockwork Orange, another great novel). It goes as follows: human beings are simply highly evolved animals. Although we may be much smarter than dogs, monkeys, or lions, we have the same animal instincts and tendencies that they have. Also, contrary to what religion may tell you, we're both with no sense of right or wrong. Some of us, such as Ralph and Piggy, as we grow older and develop free will, develop a sense of right and wrong. However, in the case of many others, such as Jack and Roger, who seemed harmless at the begining of the novel, no moral sense of right and wrong is ever developed, even though the given is usually unaware of this. The only reason that the such people are &quot;kept in line&quot; is because society trains them that way. Thus, when the barriers of society are gone, their amoral animal nature returns, as shown in Lord of the Flies. This book proved that Golding was both an excellent weriter and a brilliant thinker."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read Lord of the Flies for a class report a few weeks ago. Despite all of the bad reviews from others who had to read the book in high school, I didn't believe it was that bad. Yes, it was a bit over-descriptive, but many famous works are the same way. It is the only way for the author to help visualize the scenery. Some complain that it was confusing and jumped around too much, this isn't true in any way. One good point made earlier was the lack of reality. Children don't become savages in a matter of weeks, it would take at least a year. Overall, I would have to rate this book 4 stars due to lack of reality."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies adds a fresh perspective and new insight to philosophy's age-old discourse on the constant war between the rational and the physical. Hauntingly, Golding's prediction for 20th century adolescents, left to their own unsupervised (and uncivilized) self-determination applies to society at large as well as the individual. As Golding addresses the passionate struggles that are played out on the island and within the minds of the main characters, he challenges his audience to reflect on their own human nature as they try to identify with any of the characters--none of whom are overly endearing.Would I honestly be strong enough to stand alone against a group of peers, or would I too get caught up in the excitement of the anarchy and surrender to the thrill of the hunt. What would you do?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a very realistic book, this is probably be what society would be like with no laws or restraints. The violence, panicking, and irresponsibility. It can be disturbing, but I'm glad I read it. The hunters sometimes are so obsessed with killing and blood, they take things too far. This book is NOT for the squeamish, but I recommend it to anyone else."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this novel for a school project and I thought it was great because it reflected us humans.To me I thought that this can truly happen if we are put into an environment like that of Lord of the Flies.It sort of unleashes our natural behavior.We were descended from primates so I do beleive we all have this trait inside of us yet we are in this civilized nature in which we are tamed.This is the first book I read from Golding but I would love to read more."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE READING THIS BOOK! Lord of the Flies is an allegory. For those of you who do not know what an allegorical novel is, it is a story with two meanings- to entertain and to teach or suggest ideas about human nature or society. Yes, Lord of the Flies is about naked boys running around and becoming savage, but it is also about fear and evil and how these two things emerge in our society. So, before you start to read it and call it &quot;retarded&quot;, realize that golding was trying to get across a much deeper, philisophical message. His observations about human nature are represented in the actions of the boys. Yes, read it to b eentertained, but also read it to come to realizations about our world and nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"At first I didn't think that Lord of Flies was going to be very interesting, but it was. The book has a lot of symbolismin it. Ralph portrays the leader, someone who wants to keep the peace, where as Jack is the overpowering &quot;mind-warping&quot; leader. He, in history, could be related with Hitler. Piggy, who is never listened to because of his appereance and size, could represent what society does to overweight people. Simon is the Saint in the book who tries to find truth where there is no logic. If you think about it, Jesus was crucified and died for the sins of others. Simon died for the sins of the boys who lost all rationality. This book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"a group of boys in a military school got stranded on a island trying to survive by working together. they made a leader and had different groups doing different things.one of the boys didn't like it so he started his own tribe and he was like an enemy.the other group have to try to cooperate with them so it could work out. i like this book because it s like the real world, everyone have to try to get along"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In a word, that sums up this book. What happens to a handful of children torn from bounds of civility and put on a desert island? They have to start figuring out a way of surviving, of keeping their cool, and of getting their priorities right. Is that what happens?? Read this excellent novel (unjustly chastised by many school kids due to the obliged reading of it.)and find out. This book, in a nutshell, shows how children who do not yet know what &quot;to be independent&quot; means,have to learn it forcefully. Without the watchful eye of a parent, or an elderly, things might start heading for disaster, and they do.... Bravo, Golding!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was a very interesting book and had a nice, well though up plot, but was very unrealistic, especially when they all chanted about &quot;kill the beast, spill his blood&quot; and it was very depressing at the end. I don't think this would really happen in real life. We are not that stupid."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's novel parallels the imbrace of Dawin's idea of survival of the fittest in WWII. Hitler belived that the German race was superior to the rest of the population. With this belief he felt justified in killing millions of people. The natzis belived that the &quot;weak&quot; must die. Jack adopted this belief and hunted Ralf like he would a pig. Just as man relized the savagry he can perform after WWII, Ralf &quot;wept for the end of innocence&quot;. He relized that man was the lord of death and destruction. Anyone who wrote that this was an unrealistic novel abviously forgot their history. They should think about man's destructive potential and not take civilization for granet."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A book of little boys who are trapped and turn on one another, good story line but where was the story. The story is told from a view that all mankind will resort back to animal ways unless &quot;properly guided&quot;, without any possibilities that it could turn out good in the end. True the boys had their fears about the &quot;unknown&quot; but mankind is not only motivated by these thoughts and this is the underlining message of the book. If you do read this book just keep in mind that we as a society are still capable of reasoning without having to resort to violence."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book two years ago for a grade 10 English class, and have not had the chance to reread it, but I do remember it well. The premise is not especially exciting initially, but it becomes a living parable of terror.I find it interesting that the author used boys as his subjects rather than little girls, or both. But would this have changed the outcome? That is something you must decide for yourself. Also, when finally &quot;saved&quot;, the naval officer is confused as to what the boys are doing exactly, and yet Ralph knows exactly. Perhaps children are not as intellectually inferior as we are assumed to be.Though chilling, I highly recommend this book, as it gives a startling clear view of broken society. It's pessimistic, but perhaps, all too realistic."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"On completion of reading this book I felt that it was unfinished. I went through so much struggle with these young boys only to have someone come save them from themselves. I felt that this book promoted a socialistic ideas; portraying the metaphor that humans cannot rule themselves, they need the government (or in this case, adults) to come save them. What a disapointment! I found Lord of the Flies to be extremely irritating to read. I might have to read it again when I'm older like others have recommended. This book is worth reading, but be ready to have the hair on the back of your neck stand up!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is about a group English's boys that landed on an island.

It is a tale of a group of English boys that are stranded on a deserted island. They realize that they must work together and cooperate to stay alive. This is much easier said than done. They are more worried about who's in charge, than they are anything else. There is a constant battle for control through the whole book. Because of this battle some boys lose their lives, and others just lose their friends. They slowly begin to turn savage and fighting becomes the most important thing. The book portrays what we all have to look forward to, if our society doesn't start making some changes."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I found the novel to be a chilling look into what people would come to with out a society.

One of the problems was that there were too many minor incidents occurring at once, such as the fire going out, Ralph and Jack arguing, and Piggy complaining about other people talking when someone has the conch. I also thought the characters didn't seem very realistic. I felt that they didn't think and act like kids in real life would. How many 15 year olds honestly think there are beasts and ghost things in the world? Overall, it was a decent book to read, but one that I would not hurry back to the library to read again."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the book, I have mixed feelings. The first thing that I feel towards this book is that I don't like it. I thought it was more of a boy's type book that was really hard for me to understand. I thought it was very confusing and complicated. As I continued to read the book, it began to make more sense. As you read it, you learn what the main concept is of the book. The main concept is that if you live for awhile without someone watching over you, you begin to become a savage. This is especially bad for young boys. Then I began to like the book a little bit. I liked it because it taught a valuable lesson to the readers and to the boys that were on the island. It taught them that to survive you have to work together as a team. It also teaches the readers how cruel the world can be. This is an okay book once you look at the whole picture."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"90% of this book's readers (including me) read it in high school. I'm the only one in my class that loves it. This book is for thinkers that like peering into the savage part of our nature. Besides, it's about seriously messed up, angsty, half naked British boys! The bast parts are the confrontations between Ralph and Jack and watching the tumbling transformation of all the boys. It leaves the reader yearning to know what happens after the ending (which in itself is a brilliant passage of irony)Woe to Simon!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a story about sverel young boys who were stranded on an island with no adults. The story tells about how they developed leaders and routine for their lives. It was a well written book, although sometimes it was hard to follow.

It was a wonderful story on adventure and survival."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Have you ever had to fight for your own survival? In Lord of the Flies by William Golding, a group of kids crash on a deserted island with no adult in sight. The kids choose a leader, Ralph, who fights for the survival of the group.I felt this book was slow in getting to the turning point in the plot. When I did reach that point it changed so drastically it left me puzzled. Reading this book was a chore. I struggled to keep myself interested through every chapter. The characters behaviors kept changing and it made the storyline hard to follow. I do not recommend this book to readers who crave exciting and interesting plots.-Tim Fox"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I first read and reviewed this book when I was 10 years old. I didn't understand any of the symbolism and I just thought that Golding was a sicko who was writing about kids acting unrealisticly savage and brutal, and he used way too many weird English words. I just recently was assigned to read this book in my sophmore English class and I now really enjoy the book. I think that this book is incredibly deep and thought provoking and can only be enjoyed if you are open trying to understand the underlying themes. This novel brilliantly explores human nature and the effect of civilization on people. Lord of the Flies is a great read and I highly reccomend it to everyone. If you didn't like the book the first time, chances are you didn't understand it; I suggest reading it over again with an open mind."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was required to read this book in my Honors Literature class. The book started off as somewhat interesting and grew boring, then interesting again.

And now, looking back, I think that this is one of the most profound books I have read this year. The use of symbolism is incredible and the book has amazing depth...or maybe I just had a fabulous teacher. :)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"All too often, I am put off by Nobel prize winning books because they are too dense for me. Or simply because I cannot connect with the characters portrayed in them. I also partially subscribe to the notion that 'A classic is something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read'.Not true for this one: it transcends all barriers (for me at least).The plot is a remarkably interesting, the characters well defined and the ending delicious.To add more usefulness to this review: some other books that I like are - Of Mice and Men, All Quiet on the Western Front, Animal Farm, A Brave New World, The Catcher in the Rye. So, if you like any of these books, you might like The Lord of the Flies too."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The novel Lord of the Flies by William Golding, published by The Berkley Publishing Group (1954) is an action filled book about some schoolboys' struggle for survival after their plane went down on a deserted island.After the boys are stranded on the island it becomes evident that surviving will be like no other task they have ever undertaken. They learn to fend for themselves by trapping and killing animals, building shelters with branches and by learning how to use their surroundings in the quest for survival. From the very beginning there is tension over who is the leader. It comes down to which candidate has more appealing priorities, playing and hunting all-day or trying to get rescued by keeping a fire alive. While in the hunt for food the boys become total savages, to the extent where they even wage war against each other.In my eyes the message is that there is a savage in all of us and it comes out the minute we are faced with extreme hardships. The author does not only use the actions of the boys to show the changes that have occurred, but he also uses visual imagery to show their physical changes. For example, in the beginning of the book the boys are well-dressed clean-cut shorthaired boys; however, by the end of the book they are dirty, longhaired animals. Also, to add to their already dirty look, the boys paint their faces to camouflage themselves when they go hunting. The way the boys changed in appearance reflects how they're losing their civilized upbringing.In my opinion the novel Lord of the Flies was a great book especially for children around my age because it is easy for us to identify with what the kids in the book are going through. Even though I found this novel very exciting and engaging, I would never hope to be put in such a position as the boys in the story were."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's Lord of the Flies is an excellent book, despite my first impression that it was extremely sadistic and gory. By the time I was nearing the end of the book, I could not put it down. Golding's literary genius allowed him to incorporate several important symbols, interesting characters, and relevant themes into a relatively short book. The story is suspenseful at times and is always interesting. I wish Golding were still alive so he could write a sequel about the boys' lives after leaving the island."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding mercilessly shows Homo \\"Sapiens\\" as it is. Savage,cruel,bent on his most elemental instincts. Jack is the beast who'll overwhwelm all our civil nature, because savagery is inborn in every one of us.

I have to say this book was a good book for people who like adventures. Golding used really wonderful symbolism and outstanding irony. It makes you think one way but it ends totally different. His purpose of writing this book was to tell us about themes. One of the themes you notice in the begining of the book is the Loss of Innocence. He shows this theme through the killing of the sow. Golding also handled the climax real well. This book was believable becouse at the same time the book took place when there was a war going on.

The really amazing thing about the book is that it is about a bunch of school boys, and as you begin the story, you realize and accept this fact. But as the story progessed, I found myself not seeing them as children anymore, but as adults..caught up in a life and death struggle for survival, and their sanity. This revelation comes at you startlingly at the end of the book. ( Don't worry, I won't ruin it for you!). Although it is at times hard to follow, because it is told through the eyes of children (I never did fully figure out what &quot;creepers&quot; are!). it is a wonderful read, and one I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"You will not feel good reading this book.

The speed of their decline into savagery shocked me... surely they had been trained well by then. How could they discard their taught social characteristics so easily? What also left an impression on me was Ralph... at the first of the book he was pliant to the whims of the mob, pleasure-seeking and immature. By the end he is a leader who laments the loss of innocence and reason. I guess, though I don't usually like books with so much description of the foliage, the reason it is such a worthy book is that I will remember it...

A group of English schoolboys survive a plane crash in a post- nuclear world, to find themselves on a lush, tropical island, with no apparent dangers and even better-no adults! Sounds idyllic: no rules, no punishment, no judgment for bizarre behavior. Nor anyone to take responsibility for the &quot;littleuns.&quot;But social dynamics quickly emerge, as human nature is released from 12 years of training. Thoughtful Ralph is voted Chief, with bespectacled Piggy his second in command. The right to speak in council is formalized by the possession of &quot;the Conch&quot; shell. Is it human nature to require rules and ritual? Their critical need, of course, is to maintain a signal fire (especially the smoke) to attract a passing ship. For if there is no Hope of rescue, what will happen to this mini outbost of Britian; will they &quot;go native?&quot;Rivalry increases as Jack--leader of the choir boys turned hunters--challenges Ralph's authority, gradually luring many boys to his tribe which offers disguises and promotes violence. Will Ralph realize that he needs to rely on both Piggy's logic and Simon's insight? Could a boy's game disintegrate so quickly into murder? Can Fear evolve into a hideous primitive religion? Is it necessary to create a god of sorts? A gripping tale of the immortal struggle between man's baser instincts and centuries of socialization. A grim must-read for all thinking adults, Lord of the Flies offers great adventure for kids. This is Not a CHILDREN's Classic."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Within Lord of the Flies 208 pages is a harrowing tale of the intrinsic evil present in humans. Before reading the novel I was a staunch believer that humans are intrinsically good; however, Lord of the Flies questioned my stubborn belief, and although I still believe that humans are inherently good, I am now aware of the opposing arguements and their validity . Lord of the Flies accomplishes such a potent message because we can all relate to the derelicted school boys. We can all relate to Piggy, the one ostracized boy because at times we too are ostracized. By using such familiar themes Golding accomplishes what so few authors have done before: He affected my life... He actually changed a view that I have. I took something away from Lord of the Flies... I learned something. Even though Lord of the Flies can be read as entertainment, it is also a book that one can take something away from. You can share Golding's insight. That is the mark of a good book. Goldings 208 pages have done what Hobbes' entire corpus has failed to do: change my stance."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I read this in seventh grade, I thought that it was one of the most boring books I'd ever read.

Lo and behold, everyone on the show was rave about the book, and they were constantly talking about all of the symbolism. I caught some of it during my first read, but I decided that I was missing something. So I read it again, this time with Cliff's Notes.This really is a great book, if you're having trouble reading it, do what I did and grab a study guide, it'll pay off enormously."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is a fantastically written tale of a group of English school boys whose plane is shot down during an atomic attack. They end up on an uninhabited desert island where they are faced with what seems like a perfect situation to them - NO ADULTS!At the beginning, the situation is paradise to them, until they realize that they might be there longer than they thought. They have to learn how to survive.Ralph, the story's protagonist, decides that they should be logical and set up shelters. Ralph is a smart boy in that he is thinking about the good of everyone. Sometimes though, even Ralph does give in to the primitive desires of man and joins the celebration after a successful pig hunt.Piggy, an overweight, nearsighted, asthmatic, serves as the well meaning reminder of what they &quot;should&quot; be doing. Ralph befriends him, even when no one else will listen to him or take him seriously. Piggy's glasses or &quot;specs&quot; prove to be very useful and are a very meaningful symbol of society: the maintenence and breakdown thereof, in the story.Then there's Jack, the leader of a choir of boys from his school. His character eventually serves as an antagonist for Ralph and a symbol of man's primal desires for survival. He provides meat for the group and uses it as a powerful luring agent to get some boys to join his &quot;tribe&quot;.Simon is another character you should be familiar with. My personal favorite as he turns out to be the wisest and most spiritual (not necessarily &quot;religious&quot;) of the entire lot of boys. Simon, prone to fainting spells brought on by epilepsy, is never taken seriously by any of the boys, including Ralph or Piggy. His spiritual nature leaves him far beyond the others' realm of understanding.There are two unfortunate, but dare I say - necessary, deaths in the book but I won't give that part away. I say &quot;necessary&quot; but only on a symbolic level. Once you discover what the characters meant symbolically to the story, you will know what I mean.The ending goes through two extremes. It gets you right into the action in a wonderfully descriptive chase scene which almost makes you feel like the one who is being chased and then takes you right out forcing you to become an objective observer of the scene.Terrific writing, fantastic symbolism and an overall great story.

Golding's argument is that the durability of evil in human society is directly attributable to the evil within human character. This echoes the idea of original sin in the Bible. Golding novel is also a masterpiece of suspence and horror. I first read it when I was fourteen, and I just re-read it, twenty years later. The novel's impact still resonates powerfully.

I think the things people have come up with as symbolism in this book are absurb. Comparisons to Conrad should not be taken seriously. I think it has more of the aspects of a political novel. It pokes fun at how democracy's choose their leader and at fascist governments, tyrants, and at pagan rulers. This novel also shows the humans need of some type of spiritual beliefs. Golding intended this as both a slightly symbloic novel and an adventure story. The happy ending is a testament to that. Clearly not deserving of a spot in the top 100 books of the century (at least not in the top 20) it is still a good effort by golding and a book for lovers of implied ideas. The poor plot and impossible keeps it from being great."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the best books i have ever read it is well written and exicitin"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"On the surface, Lord of the Flies looks like a normal adventure story about young boys. Yet when one further delves into the novel and reachs its core, one relaizes the true intent of Lord of the Flies. It paints a portrait of the slow dissintegration of a reckless society. At first,the society of grade-school boys had assemblies, discussed their plans in a responsible manner, and formed a cycle of getting things done on the deserted island. Yet the gradual destruction of the society showed by the symbolism of Piggy's glasses slowly crumbling.Lord of the Flies shows how the absence of rational thinking leads to an apocalyptic end.

When they are conscious again the boys find out that there parents died and only the kids were alive. They attempt to gather food and they learn how to survive. They show a lot of strength trying to survive almost without any modern technology. They called up a meeting and they learned skills how to survive.I liked this book because it is a very interesting book about the survival skills.

It is probably the greatest book I've ever read, and here's why. I was absolutely fascinated with the characters. They were all so interesting and they always had me expecting something. They all had their own theme. The book is full of themes and mostly each character represents one of the &quot;presidents&quot; of the theme. For example:Ralph is a leader in the book. He represents democracy in an anarchy based society. This is just one of many examples of theme used in the book. Another thing that was important to the book was the setting. The setting always played a special part in the book whether it give rest to the reader in between tense moments, or provide a source of imagination in the action packed parts. The plot was very believable even though it was a fiction book. I would reccomend this book to anyone over the age of 15. It has a very deep meaning and may not be understood with the mind that hasn't been exposed to some of the things in this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the last books my class was to read in English in our senior year, William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is considered by many a classic, but it as more of a haunting portrait of the loss of innocence and the degredation of humanity. The story revolves around the Cold War, a nuclear war has begun and the children of England have been evacuated in airplanes. One of the planes crashes on a tropical island. At first, the children are led by Ralph, who calls assemblies by blowing on his conch, his fat but wise friend Piggy, and the seemingly flat out weird but helpful Simon. But when Jack, a hunter of the wild pigs on the island, challenges Ralph's rule, chaos ensues, and this tropical paradise becomes a living hell for Ralph, Piggy, and Simon. Golding's sense of symbolism makes the book work, from the very beginning we know Ralph is the good guy and Jack is the unprecidented evil in the making. Even the title of the book is an example of symbolism; when Simon encounters \\"The Lord of the Flies\\", we see this (the title is the definition of Beelzebub, which is Hebrew for Satan), but its up in the air whether Simon had a sixth sense or if he was just crazy when he encountered \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" (Simon as well symbolizes Christ, he helped the younger children, gathered food, and built the huts along with the fact he was tempted to join Jack's crew). Undoubtadly one of the best books I have ever had to read for school, William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is an essential read for everyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a great read for anyone who questions the need for rules in society. Golding uses a group of boys stranded on a desolate island to portray life without enforced order and civility. The boys represent many different types of people in society. My favorite characters are Piggy, Simon, and Ralph. Piggy is the intelligent, fat boy with asthma and glasses. Simon is the sensitive, shy boy who shares his meat and helps the younger children get fruit. Ralph is the chief of the boys who struggles with reality and responsibility. He must face his antagonist, Jack, who is a power-hungry boy obsessed with hunting. It is captivating to follow the steady conversion of the boys from sensibility to savagery. Golding makes a profound statement about society through his character development and vivid descriptions of the boys' daily activities. Lord of the Flies is full of suspense, surprises, and meaningful messages. It sheds a whole new light on the neccessity of civility and rules."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a very good novel of a survival tail that turns into a look at the working of a closed off socity.

The other boys, lead by stubborn Jack, wanted to hunt and kill.

Is it not human nature to rule and survive? Can the boys be blamed for losing their heads, especially under the conditions that they were in?This book was beautifully written, yet lacked absolute depth.

Such an introduction will often sour the reader's interest; deflate their desire to pursue a discourse with the fragile reality the author has set up. To those who enjoyed it the text can sometimes grow to take on a biblical veracity, spawning a cult of appreciation by the more pretentious of the youngsters who feel as though they'd accomplished something by getting something out of it. This is the perception of Lord of the Flies today . . .When I was assigned to read this book in school for some reason I decided to skip it. Who cares, I think I got a B on the test, and we moved on to Of Mice and Men or Death of A Salesman. Nevertheless, I found myself searching out this book again years into the future, possibly inquiring into the past over something I felt I'd missed.The result? A strong, swift book, sometimes beautifully written. On occasion a point is overexplained into the discussions and mired by the efforts of young boys speaking with an Oxford Graduate Student dialect. In other words, it sometimes gets pretty dull. The unreality of their speech is irrelevent, mostly, if only because Golding usually uses this technique to explain much of what is going on. It is a fine book among a long list of fine books about isolation, exile, lonliness, acceptance, faith, hope and civilization. If the book hadn't been so overwhelmingly sub-referenced I likely would have never picked it up and missed out on an enjoyable and profound--but perhaps getting tired as you begin to age--interesting little book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Let's cut to the chase-- when was the last time that you read such a gripping novel?Sure, such graphic unraveling of humanity is *unnerving*. It is creepy. I do not love this book, but it speaks to me, and it carries the terror that we should all possess in our hearts.We do not always carry this terror because we could not face it everyday and retain our sanity.This novel is compelling because it speaks to the savagery within us all."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book helped sculpt my approach to life.

I had heard references to it here and there, but never quite knew what they meant until I read it. I must say, this book is a deep down excellent read. You can see it in two perspectives. One, you can read it without any symbolism, and see a cool story, or look at it and take a exhaustive symbolism look and find a much cooler story. Golding is a perfect author in this story and the characters are far ore then what they are. This book features things that you wouldn't expect 6-12 or so year olds of doing. Such as canabalism, and even murder, as well as attempt of murder. It features not only a sick psychological perspective, but also some really light sci-fi."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is extraordinary in recreating the images and trial of Jesus Christ. Lord of the flies is the best book written for high schoolers because they can totally identify with the relationship between Jack and Ralph. The theme of this book is the classic good verses evil, in an interesting, believable way."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is brilliant, of that there is no doubt. It's painfully realistic, and I have no doubt that events on Golding's little fictional Pacific island could have unfolded exactly the way he led them to unfold. But my sense is that he presents the ugliness on the island as a sort of inevitable side of human nature, and certainly if we look at the larger world, with all our wars, genocides, and general crimes, this might seem true.But here is what he misses, and totally misses: the only reason people behave so horribly to one another is that they were traumatized in their childhoods and have not resolved their traumas. The horrors on his fictional little island result from unresolved trauma, not from human nature.A brilliant prequel novel to Lord of the Flies would involve following the childhoods of the most troubled boys in the group, particularly Jack and Roger. Their narcissism, sadism, and sociopathy could not simply come out of nowhere. The reality is, kids like that are not born that way, and anyone who believes they were (the \\"bad seed\\" theory) is profoundly in denial. They were treated horribly, most commonly by their parents, and they were made that way. All the terrible things that came to pass in Lord of the Flies are acted out, metaphorical (and sometimes not-so-metaphorical) expressions of the terrible things that had been done to them.Golding missed this in a big way."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a powerful story about a group of English schoolboys who have survived a plane crash and are stranded on a deserted island. In the beginning it seems like the boys will have quite an awesome adventure--they are completely on their own with no adult supervision. One of the oldest boys, Ralph, attempts to get the others organized so that they will have food, shelter, and a rescue signal fire.Ralph's logical approach to survival is soon challenged by Jack, the novel's antagonist, who is also in charge of the hunting. His desire for total power is quickly evident as he and his followers become increasingly wild, barbaric, and cruel. Their cruelty extends beyond simply hunting animals for food. Soon they are hunting and killing each other.While I did not particularly enjoy reading this book, I believe that the way the different characters are developed is interesting. Each of the main characters seems to represent an aspect of human nature and society. For example, Ralph represents the civilizing instinct in human beings compared to savagery represented by Jack. Simon, who is shy and more sensitive than the others, seems to represent the natural goodness found in people. Roger represents exactly the opposite--he is sadistic and very cruel. I think my favorite character is Piggy, because he is a very logical thinker and smart. Because I found this character appealing, his murder was very disturbing to me.Actually, the entire story was disturbing. It was hard to imagine that the boys waging this \\"war\\" against each other were so young--the oldest was only twelve years old. It was interesting to me that the more violent the story got, the older the boys seemed. I think what I didn't like was the implication that humans are innately evil. Goodness was portrayed as an aspect of civilization. As civilization deteriorated throughout the story, cruelty and violence increased. It seemed more natural to be evil than to be good. The severed pig's head (named the Lord of the Flies) mounted on the stake in the forest seemed to represent that innate evil. Since I don't believe that humans are naturally cruel and violent, I found this book difficult to read. It is not a book I would recommend."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The treasured classic Lord Of The Flies takes its readers through a remarkable journey of a group of English boys stranded on an inhabited tropical island.

The eldest of the troop being only 11 or 12 years old, the children are left to fend for themselves, not knowing what to expect - would they ever be rescued? Would they ever see their parents again? The struggle to survive was not the only conflict the boys faced. It was a fairly large team, and political issues such as who is &quot;the leader&quot; comes into figure.

It is about a group of British boys who get stranded on an island. At first the boys have good intentions, but as time passes those intentions change and they break up into 2 groups the fire-watchers which are led by Ralph and the hunters led by Jack. Ralph who becomes good friends with Piggy thinks more about being rescued and setting up sort of a community. Jack and the hunters on the other hand think more about getting meat and themselves. This book not only tells an exciting adventure story, though, it also describes on a deeper level, the thin line between civility and insanity, and how young children can become insane without some amount of authority and discipline."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a great survival, adventure novel for those looking for that type of a book. At first, I wasn't sure if I was going to like this book or not. I was just going by what some of my classmates had said about it. It turns out they were right, and I loved this book. Golding was able to grab my attention right from the beginning of the novel and keep me interested all the way to the end.The first few characters that the author introduces you to are Ralph and Piggy. These two form a strong friendship after finding each other on the island. Their plane crashed on an island, and a group of young boys are the only survivors. Now, Ralph, Piggy, and Jack become the leaders of the other boys in order to survive. These normal boys turn into savages after they feel like they must fight for their food and lives. It is a great struggle for these boys all the way to the end.The authors use of imagery really made me feel like I was one of the boys lost on the island. I could picture everything that was happening to them. It is extremely scary to think that this could happen, and you feel much saddness for these boys stranded on the island.For those who love books with lots of adventure, Lord of the Flies is the book for you. You want to see these boys be rescued from their nightmare and that is what keeps you reading."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the novel \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" William Golding does a magnificent job of abandoning the reader on the island with the stranded boys as they struggle to survive, maintain order, and above all be rescued. At times, I felt so desperate to be saved and so utterly terrified by the thought of the impending disorder and absence of authority, that death seemed a better fate than continuing to exist in that place. The book often made me feel helpless and scared; I can only imagine the loneliness and despair Ralph endured. I wanted more than anything for him to be able to click his heels three times and get back to his safe world of horses and clean sheets.While the events surrounding the crash onto the island are unclear, one thing is for certain, this situation is the perfect set-up for a display of the true nature of man. The differences between Ralph and Jack are obvious, and those differences represent the various battling forces in today's society. Personally, I find the topic rather disturbing. The way the boys slowly transformed into savages--forgetting things like compassion, honesty, and trust, in their relentless hunt and lust for meat, deeply bothered me.I cannot say that I loved every second of this novel, mainly due to its subject matter, but Golding's imagery is fantastic and his characterization is wonderful. I don't believe that a better book could be written about this kind of topic. If only it had been about puppies and sunshine."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was a mystery to me as to what it was going to be about. I had to read the book in the 10th grade for school. But, as I started reading it, I loved it. This book is a great fictional survival book. The way the boys worked together at the beginning of the book was great, they were thrown into a world in which they had to survive on their own, and they did. They worked together amazingly and I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was very good. It gave me a new outlook on mankind and human nature. It shows how everyone has the ability to become hostile and savage like. Everything in the book represents something. I wish Golding would have written more about Ralph and the others AFTER they were rescued. It would be interesting to see if they learned anything! I think this is a good book; I recommend everyone to read it in order to know what man is really like."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was very different from any other book I have ever read. Before reading this book, I did not understand what an allegory was exactly. After realizing that it meant a story with two or more levels of meaning, I realized this book demonstrated that exactly. It is obvious that this book has remained a classic throughout the years, since it was published in 1959 and is still used throughout classrooms today. There was really nothing I disliked about this book. Lord of the Flies demonstrates a smaller world fueled by savagery, and controlled by democracy and human nature. It describes how humans can act as barbaric as animals when put into certain situations. It shows the relation between humans and animals and how similar they are. Reading a book like this one can only enlighten your perspective on the world around you, which gives you no reason to avoid reading it. This book stands for so much more than what it seems. When broken down into smaller pieces, you can really see Goldings focus on making the reader question the book, and see how closely it relates to modern civilization."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The lord of the flies is a very good book. I like the meaning of the book more than the story. It really makes you think. Everything you read has another meaning to it. For example the island they are on shows what is happening in the world. As they fall apart the world is too (the world is at nuclear war). The island is like a small version of the world or a \\"Microcosm\\". This book is not too long but is very difficult to understand. I found myself needing to read the chapters multiple times to understand them, but it is worth it.

I love how this book makes you think and relate situations and characters to those in your own life. at first glance this noval may seem like its not worth reading but dont judge a book by its cover.the only reason i gave this book a 4 instead of 5 is that it diddnt seem very realistic for example: the boys age i didnt think they were old enogh to even really comprehend what they had done,also there seemed to be no remorse for death.But that is easily forgotton because of the intensity of this great book .

The way Golding used symbolism was amazing and kept you thinking. Normally, I wouldn't have chosen this book myself, but I enjoyed it.

In the beginning they start out well-mannered and civilized under the leadership of the protagonist, Ralph. They build shelters, gather food, and keep watch over signal fires in hope of rescue. All this structure seems to fall apart when the antagonist, a red-headed \\"hunter\\" named Jack decides he is through with Ralph and his ways and wants to start his own tribe of hoodlums and savages. They leave all of their morals behind and succumb to human nature and the want of acceptance and power."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This isn't the only William Golding novel I've read, but it is by far the best. He uses outstanding dialect and language to portray the plight of a group of boys stranded on an island. However, the symbolic nature of this book transcends nearly everything else I've ever written. I orinally read this as a twelve year old not realizing what I was getting into. I recently re-read it as a twenty-eight year old, and its relevance to world events even today is astounding.This is a loose transition from Orwell's Animal farm, where the good guys become the bad guys in the end. It seems ironic how, at first, the boys cooperate because of their need and desire for structure and discipline. However, as the story unwinds, we find some of the boys wanting freedom. It is a freedom for which they have to fight, too. However, in the undertaking of that freedom, they end up becoming the oppressors.This is a brilliant story with few, if any, flaws. It is the history of the world in a nutshell. All we need to know about history is in this short book.

In Lord of the Flies, Golding tries to accurately portray human nature or at least as he saw it. The underlying theme of this novel is the idea of good vs. evil or order vs. chaos. The most notable struggle in the novel is between man and himself as the children fight with their instinct to live by rules against their instinct to act violently. The story begins when a group of English school boys become plane wrecked on a deserted island. In the beginning the group of stranded boys acts as one and cooperate well with eachother. They attempt to gather food, make shelters and signal fires, and anything else they can do just to survive. The novel's protagonist, Ralph, represents order and leadership. He steps forward as the leader and oversees their efforts to survive as well as maintain some amount of order and decency among the group. His sidekick, Piggy, is a chubby boy with glasses. His glasses represent the power of science and intellect. He also tries to help Ralph maintain order throughout the story. At first they manage establish some rules and some sense of order on the island. However, too many of the kids want to goof off and hunt animals rather than focus on survival or rescue.

The friendship between Ralph and piggy isn't just any ordinary friendship but more like one between a teen and a pet he has owned since he was a small boy.The rivalry between Ralph and jack on the other hand is like that of two rampaging behemoths who despise each other.I like this book because of the small amount of magical realism that was added to this book because i dont't like realism. I don't like this book because of the descriptive senseless violence in it and also because I think that of kids that ages were stuck on an island the last thing they would think about would be hunting and killing. I think that other people might enjoy this book when they read it becuause of the violence and action."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the flies is a book that has adventure and emotion. The conflict between Jack , Ralph, and piggy is a diaster waiting to happen! An example, of this would be,when Ralph exposes Jack , as he really is by saying &quot; you're a beast a swine and a blooy, bloody thief&quot;. Between Jack and Ralph were bad beore, but this is when everything exploded.The amity between Ralph and piggy is one of the strongest you would see in two people. It's similar to a bond between a small boy an dhis pet dog. It's great how they confided in each other and are able to trust in one another. You could tell Ralph starts respecting Piggy when he says &quot;better Piggy than fatty&quot;. From then on Ralph beganto listen to piggy.The only negative thing I would have to say about this book is the way the kids act on the island. I honestly don't think kids of that age would act like murderous savages.In conclusion I think book is good for most ages. I really think young people would like this book because it has action and adventure."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought Lord of the Flies was a great book in the way that it showed how man has so many faults and that it is very hard to stay sane with so many different people with different views from yours. I loved how the story slowly started to turn to chaos and the boys one by one turned against eachother. Plus I liked the violence that this story had in it. I actually like this book so much that I am going to get my own copy and read it again.There are also some bad things that I didn't like about this book, but what book doesn't have its mixture of bad and good parts. One of the bad things was that some parts where difficult to understand and I had to read them a few times to finally get them. Another fault was that I have heard so many of the same &quot;stranded on an island stories&quot; and after awhile it gets on your nerves. Other than these things this book was very deserving of the 4 stars that I gave it. I would recommend this book for everyone except children under 10 because of some of the violence and High school level word usage."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding cleverly selects a seemingly innocent group of young boys to examine the concept of innate evil and human endurance. On a literal level, this novel is simply a thriller in which a group of young private school boys find themselves stranded on a forsaken island. At first, everything seems to go well. The older boys form a community in order to mainatin order and ensure survival. Over time, however, differences in opinions and personalities causes a gradual breakdown of the community until many of the boys turn their backs on order and even humanity, resorting to savage behavior.The novel is Golding's exploration of why mankind resorts to savage and/or evil ways when faced with ruthless circumstances (WWII/Holcaust, etc.). It is an engaging examination of the thin line between good/evil, human/inhuman, as well as a good read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"First of all, let's get some things clear. There IS a &quot;deeper&quot; meaning to The Lord of the Flies. In fact, there are dozens. Second of all, Golding was an English schoolmaster who understood how children behaved. The idea that he was not qualified to write about children's behavior is ludicrous. One reviewer is partially correct when he states that children rarely attack each other. They rarely attack each other IN THE PRESENCE OF AUTHORITY. Finally, society could have developed with human nature the way that Golding presents it because human brains were developed to allow us to interact socially with other humans. Society would have then been made up of fifty to a hundred people, and authority would have been present, too.Having said all that, the only reason why you could not like this book is if you absolutely did not understand it. The Lord of the Flies might not have changed my life, but it really was a GREAT book. Its symbolism is poignant, clear, and powerful. The message the book gets across is wonderful.This dark, somewhat disturbing book is absolutely worth reading, and a copy belongs on the shelf of every serious reader. Each time I have read it I have come up with new meanings that I missed the previous time and it never gets old.If you know how to read it, it is definitely NOT boring. Be prepared for a wonderfully written, powerful book about the darker side of human nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is probably the most disturbing book I have ever read.

Chaos, fear, blood-bath. Written after WWII, and loaded with symbolism and comments about civilization and violence, the only criticism that really bugged me on the book is that there are no girls or females on the island; how can you realistically have a society, or critique mankind and exclude the other half?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is amazing. Some people says it's not realistic, people don't behave that way, it doesn't represent makind... Thousands of people are killed everyday around the world.

That is until this year when I was forced to read it again in order to teach it to my tenth-grade class. I had forgotten what a great read it is. As a teen, I missed out on so much that Golding had intended. Today--now that I'm a little older, a little better at understanding novels--I see so much more. The symbolism is wonderful, as is the book as whole. Plus: this is a beautiful edition and the E.M. Forster intro is brilliant.

A wonderful depiction by Golding of a group of teenage boys that are supposed to be &quot;civilized&quot; boarding-school students but turn wild and barbaric as a result of the harsh island environment that they are set in. This book provides a powerful representation of our own society, and how these animalistic natures all exist in the underlying shadows. Although the adult in his ship rescues the kids at the end, the point is made by Golding in the Epilogue that, even though the kids are rescued, who will rescue the adult?

It is disturbing and fascinating at the same time. Lord of the Flies is intriguing and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"There is a common theme to negative reviews of William Golding's classic meditation on power, anarchy, and human nature: They tend to come from disgruntled students forced to read the book for school. The complaints either suggest the book is too confusing and/or complicated -- far from the case; the narrative is very straightforward -- or that the book is implausible.But it's not.Rather than being implausible, what Lord of the Flies is, is disturbingly close to the mark when it comes to its look at our potential for evil and how quickly our tendency to exploit others rises to the fore when civilization is left behind.Still, who could blame them? They are struggling to understand themselves, and we expect them to absorb and understand what amounts to a rather dire essay on human nature? This is a harrowing tale about a group of lost youths, stranded and without guidance, whose fear and misunderstanding of the world (and each other) drive them to madness, and ultimately, murder ... far from a comfortable subject matter for young people still coming to understand their place in the world.Highly recommended as a short, cynical look into the human mind, and of the dangers that lie within us all."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is Golding's first and probably most famous novel, twice made into a film (in 1963 and 1990) and often required reading in high schools and in many college courses. Golding was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Literature. I found it surprising to learn that a number of reference books lists &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; as a science fiction novel! I later discovered that the first draft of the book had the boys fleeing from a nuclear holocaust at the start of the novel. Even in this final version there is a brief discussion of the &quot;bomb&quot; and about fighting &quot;Reds.&quot; In the novel, after a plane crashes on a deserted island, the surviving boys of a boys school try to set up a democratic society, waiting for rescue. At first, the boys cooperate and Ralph, with his friend \\"Piggy,\\" tries to maintain order. But, it fails and the boys &quot;evolve&quot; (or, devolve) back into savagery. It is only with the arrival of a shocked rescue officer does a semblance of civilization returns. The boys in the novel have the same names as the schoolboy heroes in R. M. Ballantyne's &quot;The Coral Island,&quot; published in 1858. But, Ballantyne's novel is &quot;naive optimism.&quot; Golding suggests that the evil is in each of us and that, left on our own, man will always have a tendency to revert to savagery. Is this really what underlies man's true nature? There is goodness and discipline in us and that is represented by Ralph. We just need more Ralphs.-----\\"Fancy thinking the Beast was something you could hunt and kill!\\" said the head. For a moment or two the forest and all the other dimly appreciated places echoes with the parody of laughter. \\"You knew, didn't you? I'm part of you? Close, close, close!

It not only captures the minds of readers of every age, but it states a point about human nature. I think Golding's point in writting this book is to tell show us that there is a &quot;beast&quot; in all of us. As young Simon so clearly states. I agree with him on this point because at one point and time we all can loose control and become &quot;savage&quot;. Golding was brilliant for using children to bring this point across, because so often we think of children as being the complete example of innocence. And I think as the years progress or situations change, we gradually loose our innocence. This book was great and I would recommend it for children and adults of all ages."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Which is not to say that girls won't enjoy this too, but when it was published in 1954, \`Lord of the Flies' was written in response to the standard literature targeted to boys. Golding was frustrated with the idealistic, happy-ending-every-time formula, particularly in one book called \`The Coral Reef'-there are several cutting references throughout \`Lord of the Flies' to this work. In \`Lord of the Flies,' Golding shows us what he feels would *really* happen if a group of boys were left alone on a deserted island. As the book progresses, we see the boys' attempts at maintaining a civilized society degenerating faster and faster.The plots and ideas introduced present many questions of the reader. How does a group of British schoolboys, growing up in what they consider the height of civility, turn so readily to savagery? How does the temptation of power make them forget their goal of rescue so quickly? How can they so easily dismiss acts of murder? And, as you read the last three pages and close the book, you wonder...how do they feel about the events that have taken place, afterwards?A better question than \\"how\\" is \\"why.\\" In the critical note included in the back of the book, there is a quote by Golding that states, in his own words, the theme of \`Lord of the Flies': \\"...an attempt to trace the defects of society back to the defects of human nature...the shape of a society must depend on the ethical nature of the individual and not on any political system however apparently logical or respectable.\\"Given the novel's endurance over time and countless praises by the critics, one would judge that Golding succeeded. As a reader, you must decided for yourself, but one thing is for sure: This definitely isn't the Hardy Boys, the popular (yet plastic) product of the Stratenmeyer syndicate that, while it has withstood time as well, can't be said to have had an impact on society. Whereas this novel was carefully crafted to be intense and thought provoking, unflinchingly real...not to mention graphic. As a final word of advice, don't hesitate to read this...but don't read it while eating. ^_^;"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In my opinion, Lord of the flies was on of the dullest books I have ever read. It started off slow and at times I found myself trying hard not to fall asleep. The plot was actually quite interesting, but William Golding wrote it in such a way, sometimes I couldn't understand exactly what was going on. His word choice left me scanning through a dictionary a majority of the book. Yet this book did contain some quite profound symbolism. The theme would have to be the best party of this novel, being it relates to the real world or the cruelties of the real world.Some of the scenes in this book are actually quite violent, and unrealistic being that the kids are so young. In fact, numerous times I became sick to my stomach. Some of the scenes were good and beautifully written but overall I felt most of it was superfluous ."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Don't buy the Cliff's Notes: read this book for yourself - you will enjoy it and remember it for the rest of your life. And if you watch a movie version, read the book first. The old black and white film version cast with British kids is a million times better than the more recent color version with American kids -- probably because American kids are *already* savage...they have no civilized habits to lose! :-)There is an incredible scene in the book where some older boys toss rocks at a younger boy who is playing in the water. The author notes the the older boys are careful not to throw the rocks too close to the younger boy: I believe he calls the protective perimeter thus formed the circle of civilization or something. Anyway, it's a great and important passage; look for it. It foreshadows all the madness to follow.Here's a suggestion for a term paper (it worked for me): The character named &quot;Piggy&quot; wears spectacles that he fastidiously cares for when the boys are first marrooned; however, the spectacles are slowly demolished step by step as the boys descend into savagery. By examining the condition of Piggy's spectacles, you can judge how bad things have gotten on the island."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I first read this book (in high school, but not as an assignment) I also read one or two standard critical commentaries and bought into their analyses as its meaning. They teach us that it is a melodrama with Ralph as the hero and Jack the villain. Pursued by Jack and his tribe, who are going to kill him, Ralph (and in fact all the surviving boys), are rescued at the last minute on a beach by a naval officer, attracted by the conflagration to which a large part of the island had been reduced. In the last phrase, we see &quot;the trim cruiser in the distance:&quot; a warship. I.e., there is no real rescue. They will only be transferred from microcosm to macrocosm. They will live awhile longer, but are destined to see destruction on a larger scale, for that is man's destiny.The novel describes the failure of a society; but there is something troubling in the conclusion that such is an inevitable fate, a natural trend, the playing out of man's truest self. One must ask, if this is man, how can we possibly &quot;weep&quot; with Ralph, &quot;for the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart?&quot; We can have no sense of how bad this is unless we have also a sense of something better. Can we fall without having first risen? From whence comes the standard against which we can call this denouement chaotic, evil, or in any way disagreeable?The customary interpretation suggests as Golding's message that, well, we just have to try to be civilized and keep our fingers crossed, maybe it'll work long enough for us to die a natural death. And when we're bullied, try to find the officer to protect us. Apres-moi, la deluge. Can this multi-layered and complex novel really have been crafted in the service of such a platitude? I liked the book then, and I like it now; but this sense of its begging the question nagged away-- from the first, I like to think-- behind the appreciation.Only years later would I stumble upon an article proposing an alternate interpretation. I regret that I did not photocopy it on the spot, for subsequent efforts to locate it have failed; evidently it has disappeared from the library. I read it at first with some distaste-- how dare this author say anything against the beautiful Ralph whom I had come to revere-- but in the end, I found it satisfying; and furthermore, it suggested something more insightful and practical than a bromide.In a nutshell: Ralph is not good, but Apollonian (fair-haired, first seen against the sun). Jack is not evil, but Dionysian (red-haired, dark-clad, the supreme singer). And &quot;it takes all kinds.&quot; The trouble begins when Ralph belittles and scolds Jack when he hunts for meat. Jack's apologia is simply, &quot;we needed meat&quot;: and that was a fact, as shown by the boys' hitherto fruitarian diet causing diahrrea. It was Ralph's responsibility, as the elected leader, to acknowledge, validate, and enlist even impulses and viewpoints which he might not understand or share-- but he could not see beyond his own. He alienated and denied a part of the community-- perhaps a part of human nature-- and things went downhill from there.This article was illustrated and supported by an abundance of details from the novel itself. Not all will be convinced by it, of course. But that a learned critic could find a meaning in the book which is so at variance from the conventional wisdom, and support it so well with details from the book itself, says something about the stature of the novel and its author. Less-than-great books do not sustain such ambiguity.It remains, of course, a minority-- perhaps a renegade-- thesis. But there is no doubt, as has been remarked by other critics, that Golding was dealing with ancient Greek as well as with Christian symbols and ideas. I speak as a Christian when I suggest that the neglect of the former is due to a caricature of the latter among many readers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"First of all, I will admit to a profound distaste for heavy-handed symbolism, and since this book is nothing but--well, profound distaste on my part was inevitable. Personally, by the time I've finished analyzing how Piggy's glasses symbolize human reason, the pig's head represents human evil, etc., the book has lost its impact for me and becomes pretentious.But that is not my main problem with this book. I find it frightening that so many people consider this book 'revealing' and a 'classic'. This seems to indicate that the message of this book has universal relevance for people. And this message is as follows: Humankind, homo sapiens, people as we know them, are intrinsically evil. Meaning, that deep down in our hearts we are nothing but wells of corrupt blackness, or as Conrad so aptly put it, hearts 'of darkness'. Anything good we do is a sham. We act a certain way only because civilization dictates it, but as soon as the rules of civilization no longer get us what we want, or they are no longer imposed on us, our natural tendency will be to fall into evil, our true, innermost nature.Garbage. I for one do not believe that human beings are intrinsically evil. Are they intrinsically good, then? Of course not. I am not advocating a world view based on naivete. Human beings have a natural tendency for both good and for evil. How much these tendencies influence a person's behavior is entirely up to him: he is not wholly at the mercy of his baser instincts. Even in 'Heart of Darkness', upon which Golding based this work, Marlowe faced the evil and did not succumb to it. These boys are given no choice, as evil is the only true reality. There is no way to fight it; one can either surrender to it, or run from it by way of civilization. To take an active stand against it is impossible.Even in 'Les Miserables' during the horrendous poverty and the barricades, where all of civilization is crumbling at its foundations and people are rotting because of it, there are glimpses into the beauty of humankind. Eponine, though sunk in squalor and darkness, finds redemption by saving Marius; this in contrast to her father, whose evil increases all the more. Jean Valjean sinks to the lowest level a human can sink to, yet there is hope for him; and because one person had faith in the good that was inside him, he, too found redemption. There is choice involved, and one can either strive for light, or fall into darkness. Maybe people like Golding because he unintentionally grants justification for the evil Man is capable of--after all, we can't help it. It's our nature. Therefore people need not bother to strive to become better than they are, to actualize the beauty within themselves. Humans have no inner beauty; it is imposed from outside to conceal the horror within.But there is more. And by not realizing that there is more, Golding sells everyone short."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think that Golding's purpose for writing this book was to show how innocence is lost and how we, as humans, cannot live in without any rules or authority. I certainly agree with his message because you reach a point in life where in one way or another you loose your innocence. I also agree with the fact that it is impossible to live without any rules or authority. The conch that Ralph used to gather everyone was a great literary element because it showed authority but at the same time it was fragile and white like Piggy. Personatly, I do not think this book is believable because it is not possible for only young boys to survive a plane crash and to live all by themselves on a deserted island. The part that I liked the least was the way Simon and Piggy died. I understand that Golding did it the way he did it to, show how the boys changed from the beggining of the story to the end of it. But I still think it was very cruel. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO PEOPLE ALL AGES BUT MOSTLY TEENS BECAUSE IT IS INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT THE LOST OF INNOCENCE..... :)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Vivid and mysterious Lord of the Flies is one of those uncommon books which is susceptible to several levels of interpretation and analysis. It has this characteristic because it deals honestly and profoundly with human beings under stress, and because its author, William Golding, has a sympathetic and intense vision of the problems facing modern man, the varied reactions of different types of people under similar conditions, and the internal tension experienced by human beings forced to face new a difficult situations. Through its portrayals of human beings and human problems, this novel illustrated important general principles of human behavior and human relations. Lord of the flies is a thought-provoking novel. The book describes in detail the horrific exploits of a band of young children who make a striking transition from civilized to barbaric. The Lord of the Flies commands a pessimistic outlook that seems to show that man is inherently tied to society, and without it, we would likely return to savagery. Symbolism played had also played an important role in the development of story. This narrative technique was used to give a significance to certain people or objects, which represent some other figure. The following table lists many of the examples of symbolism used throughout Golding's book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A British boy's choir and a handful of other boys are flying over an ocean in an aeroplane when it crashes onto an unihibited island.

However, the younger boys keep changing their minds on who they want as their leader, so they end up splitting into two hostile groups that are at war with each other. You can see the seriousness of the situation when the boys start getting killed off by their friends.I have compared this book to the government in the past. When there is little or no authority, the people tend to run amoc.However, this book is a great read. If you are looking for a deeper meaning in a book, it will be good for you.

The story begins when a group of British school boys crash on a tropical island. The only adult on the Island, the pilot, is dead. At the beginning of the book, a boy named Ralph finds a conch and blows it. Immediately the boys group into an assembly and choose Ralph as their leader. During the first part of the book, the boys strive for order and organization, but this soon starts to diminish. Ralph and his friends, Piggy and Simon, try to accomplish the task of building shelter on the island. They are alone doing this, for many of the boys are too young to help. Jack and his group go off hunting small pigs which populate the island. The disagreement about hunting causes great tension between Ralph and Jack during the book. As the book progresses, Jack's group forget their civilized ways, and there soon becomes a lack of order. Ralph and Piggy started a fire and it should be kept going at all times on a mountain on the island, so that they have a better chance of being rescued. They are unable to accomplish this task because many of the boys do not care about keeping the fire going and would rather go and play. Piggy's glasses are used for lighting fire and become an important symbol of power later in the book. Jack and his group, now known as &quot;the hunters&quot; become obsessed with hunting and killing pigs. To them, it is the most important task on the island. All the young children are preoccupied with the Beast, which they believe in as some kind of animal living on the island. During an assembly, Jack tries brings up the fact that Ralph isn't a good chief, because he can't hunt. Piggy and others are against the idea, but Jack is starting to become more and more savage and overpowering. Jack, Ralph and Simon attempt to kill the beast, in hopes of curing the little boys' worries. There is a violent storm on the island, in which Simon wanders down into a group of boys who are chanting and pretending to hunt. In all of the confusion and chaos, Simon is &quot;accidentally&quot; killed. In this part of the book, Jack decides that he is fed up with Ralph's leadership, and decides to start his own tribe. He invites any boys who wish to join him to come along. Jack's tribe becomes increasingly aggressive, and makes raid on the remaining boys' camp. By this time Sam, Eric, Ralph and Piggy are the only ones not in Jack's tribe. Sam and Eric are kidnapped by Jack's tribe, and Piggy is killed by Roger. Ralph hides in the forest nearby and Jack attempts to hunt him down. During the chaos the fire is neglected and eventually sets the whole island on fire. A naval cruiser sees the smoke from the raging island, and comes to the boys' rescue. Once the naval cruiser comes, and a officers comes out, the boys are ashamed of how they have become. I really enjoyed reading The Lord of the Flies and I would highly recommend it as a must read for anyone at any age. The story unfolds at a very good pace because it keeps the reader craving to know what will happen next. I feel that this story had a very strong introduction and conclusion, making it enjoyable to read. It almost felt like watching a thriller, when in reality they were just pages turning. Lastly, I give The Lord of the Flies four stars, because it is the type of book you can never get sick of."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"For english class we had to read Lord of the Flies by Golding.. It was an ok book... if you like adventure stories... personally i dont. however Goldings use of symbolizm is great. The book sickened me at certain parts. The descriptions were great but after reading an entire chapter and then some more descriptions, it gets sort of boring.

And he was right."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was a boring book. We found it hard to stay awake while reading it.

The way the boys on the island carried on about a &quot;beast&quot; that wasn't there, wasn't action enough fo me. I need more information on the characters themselves, to get really envolved in the book. The book doesn't describe the boys very well. I also don't agree with the author's view of humanity.

How could that be???? This is one of the worst books that I have ever read! The descriptions are meaningless and when the author do describes something he takes a page to describe something that should take 3 sentences at the most. I did not like the plot of this story and although it had an interesting idea I don't think the author did much with it. It is full of violence that is un-needed.

I think that the author is trying too hard to write a good book. There must have been a reason why this was out on the market for 5 years before anyone picked it up. The author tells you too much information in a short amount of time. He starts to talk about something and then just moves on to something else. He also leaves you hanging. He also uses way too many uncompleted sentences! Reading this book was a complete and total waste of my time!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A horrid, terrible book. From everyone that I have ever chatted to about this novel, they all share the same responses, and that is that William Goldings Lord of the Flies is simply not a good book. Human nature is evil and corrupt is about all this book goes into, and it is all written from a childs perspective, dull and flat. This book delves into the loss of innocence, but these children as soon as they are introduced appear haughty and arrogant and self-absorbed. And then, throughout the book, they go on and fight with one another due to their level of immaturity, and end up murdering one another. This book is not about human nature, it is about the immaturity of children. These children do not think throughout the entire book, and it just seems stupid and a pointless read. This book also offers no resolutions to this \\"problem\\". People can be evil. Look at all the wars throughout time, and the terrible things people can do to one another. We don't need a book to point this out. It is common sense. Golding has accomplished nothing, and many, many people agree."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding does not leave readers with any thinking space to ponder of the values he brought up in the book. Unlike Harper Lee, whose novel requires a certain level of intelligence to interpret and understand, this novel spits out the themes directly, leaving no space for imagination. Even the symbols are so simple and uninteresting.This book has such a cynical and pessimistic view of the world, that i totally disagree with. I believe that no child would cause such destruction as this, and no child would be like he described, a incarnate of Satan.It is a book with his own thinking. It may be good if one understands and agrees with his way of thinking.I don't."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book starts out easily, and anyone reading it could probably catch on pretty quickly. There has been a plane crash, and the only survivors are a number of British boys ages 4 to about 14. Soon after they realize that they are on an uninhabited island, and that they must rely on themselves to survive and to get rescued. Upon arriving at the island, they have a group meeting, and when Ralph is voted chief of the island, Jack is left as an also-ran. That's something what I liked about this novel, the whole idea of children being captive on an island, living of pigs and fruit, and trying to maintain a civilization with order and authority all by themselves.However, I am surprised that I actually finished this book. This book is beyond the most boring and dull book in the world. It seems as if William Golding spend weeks on each paragraph and dialogue just to sound so absolutely intellectual to the highest extent. From the looks of it, I'd say that he tried way too hard to impress his Oxford college friends. Unless if you are really into the symbolism or if you have a master's degree with an English major, then you would have been able to understand everything in this book. From every significant event, to every detail expressed about the children's actions or their surroundings, it is better to have Cliff Notes by your side if you wanted to catch every little segment of symbolism and importance."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"While this book was well written and created vivid pictures, I was disturbed by the the theme of this story. It was extremely odd and disgusting. After hearing that this book has recieved high ratings, I was very dissapointed with the warped ideas Golding used to express \\"human nature\\". I do not reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is one of the few books that have left an indelible mark on my being. What is presented to students across the country as a kids' adventure story is far from it. It is a timeless statement about the nature of human beings, who may fundamentally be innocent and civilized, but can quickly degenerate into adversarial brutes when they become free from the reins of authoritative supervision or isolated from collective notions of propriety. The chaos and terror that Golding so palpably illustrates results from Jack's pride and his ability to garner followers by appealing to their weakness during trying times. But perhaps this was only possible because of the lost--or killed--hope of rescue. This rescue was for a time the unifying and motivating vision that formed the basis of the children's activities on the island, and the eventual arrival of the rescuer is the moment of truth, when the depth of this tragedy is fathomed, and the aggression from Jack's camp becomes apparent to everybody. The novel is more than a chilling tale; it serves as a warning to us, who inhabit the island called 'Earth,' that if we allow our actions and egos to go unchecked, and if we lose hope in the future, then our fate will be dismal. It also exposes the precarious nature of civil order from beneath its veneer of stability. If we value order and harmony, then we need to appreciate that contravention of even simple standards of civility (e.g. speaking without the conch) may spell the beginning of societal decay. I would highly recommend (re)reading this book, because our society needs greater human consciousness."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of my favorite books ever. The story is awsome and it has a great message. Every one of the boys reminded me of someone I've met in my life. I've met people who are similur to Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Simon, Roger, Sam n Eric, and even some of the minor characters. I even found myself getting attached to some of the characters. I loved Simon, and just about every scene he was in I found myself thinking \\"Awe, you're so cute!\\" And I cried when I found out what was to happen to him. I felt bad for Piggy and I wanted to yell at the other boys to stop picking on him. I liked Ralph, he acted like a lot of twelve year old boys I know. Samneric cracked me up a few times. Jack also acted like a lot of twelve year olds I know. I even liked Roger, he made a good sadistic evil character, but I wouldn't want to be stuck in an elevator with him.Over all, I thought this was a great book. It had a powerful chilling message. There was a lot of symbolism, but not so much that it dragged the book down. And the author used the perfect amount of discription, enough so you get the feel of the envirnment, but not too much like taking ten pages to decribe a single leaf. I recommend this book to anyone.There are also two movies out on this book. If you plan to watch one, watch the 1963 version. It's in black and white but it follows the book. The 1990 version doesn't even feel like Lord of the Flies at times."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book captures the tension and anxiety of being a teenager among peers. Golding skillfully plays envy, rage, and fear off of one another both between and within the characters. The sense that none of the strife is warranted or deserved is set against the larger context of war at the end of the story. The reader is then left to cross the conceptual bridge between the micro and macro, and I suspect that many do not without the aid of a post-read analysis or critique.Peter Gamache, MBA, MLA, MPH"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is great, and I had fun reading this. However, like almost all books, the begining was quite boring. It didn't grasp my attention well at first, but at the end, it was interesting and vivid. There is some very slight violence in the book, and two people die. I wouldn't recommend this book to younger children, but for older children, this book is great."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was not one of the better books I have read. I felt that the book was a little too predictable. I was surprised that this was Golding's response to the evils he saw in WWII as a member of the Royal Navy, because I figured it would be more graphic or have been about the war, rather than the story of a group of English schoolboys whose plane is shot down on an island. At the beginning of the book when Ralph calls all the boys who survived the plane crash with the conch and they voted him leader over Jack, I could tell that the conflict of the story would be between these characters. I did not feel like Golding was able to get across his theme of the inner evil of mankind because of his character choice of a group of young boys. From personal experience I can tell you that almost all young boys are mischievous and have an evil side to them, but I don't feel that they are an accurate representation of all humans. However, I do feel that Golding used a lot of great symbolism in this novel with the use of Piggy's glasses as being able to see things for what they really are, and the use of the conch to represent power and order. Another interesting thing is Beelzebub, one of the fallen angels in Milton's Paradise Lost, translates to Lord of the Flies. For the theme of evil Golding was trying to use, this was a great title."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"There are three books that I could not live without: Ayn Rand's THE FOUNTHEAD, McCrae's THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD, and Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES. Don't misunderstand--these are not easy &quot;fun&quot; reads, but thought-provoking literature. FLIES is extremely disturbing; a portrait of society gone mad, though told in a small setting, on an island with boys. Still, the point is made. No, this is not your average summer read for the beach, but it should be read and studied. What a shame that we, as a society, haven't learned the valuable lessons Golding tried to teach us."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am definatly going to have to give this one 5 stars.

In the very beginning, the boys try to cooperate to find food, make shelter, and light a signal fire, therefore maximizing their chance of being rescued. They all elected Ralph as the leader since he seemed to know what to do to keep them alive. However, some of the boys become lazy, and would rather play and have fun instead of work. As Ralph's power and influence over the other boys begin to decrease, his antagonist, Jack rises with power. Jack was the leader of the group of boys responsible for hunting. But soon Jack and his group of boys become obsessively fond with hunting and is overcome by a sort of frenzy. Soon he begins to paint his face giving himself the look of a savage. Disgusted of Ralph's rules, Jack and his group of boys split from the rest of the group and move to another part of the island. Soon after, the situation becomes worse, and Jack's \\"tribe\\" are now hunting Ralph's group. The former instinct of civilization and order has become savagery, violence, and chaos.Almost all the characters and elements in this book symbolize something. This book is not just about a struggle for survival on a deserted island, it is about a conflict between two types of human nature that both exist in every individual. The first is to live by rules, act peacefully, and do things for a common good. The other is to act violently, obtain power through force, and to satisfy individual's immediate desires. These two characteristics can be seen in the two major characters Ralph and Jack. The main conflict to the whole story is civilization versus savagery. The lord of the flies is a sow's head impaled on a stick. The sow had been killed by Jack and his hunters and its head was meant to be an offering to the beast that all the little boys seem to think is living on this island. The lord of the flies is implying that there is evil in every human heart, and this is the major theme of this book.Overall, I thought that this was one of those books that would make you think about all the hidden themes and ideas expressed throughout the book. This book, I believe, is a book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Annotation: Set during World War II, two adolescents: Ralph and Piggy, find themselves as survivors of a plane crash on a deserted island. There are no grown ups to show them how to live, but they soon meet more children and band together. As problems unfold, Inherent evil takes over in this masterpiece of human psychology.Author Bio: William Golding was born in the village of St. Columb Minor in Cornwall. He started writing at the age of seven, but he didn't pursue it until after attending Brasenose College, in Oxford. His first book, which was no more than a collection of poems, was finished one year before getting his B.A. After graduation, he moved to London and wrote plays. He lived in a settlement house, but moved to Salisbury in 1939. He enlisted in the Royal Navy during WWII, and hated it. He called it \\"a waste of four years of my life.\\" After the war he returned to Salisbury with a dark view on humanity's processes. His first novel: The Lord Of the Flies was declined by 21 publishers, but when it did get published in 1954 it was an instant hit in England and a bestseller in America. After that he wrote The Inheritors (1955), PINCHER MARTIN (1956), FREE FALL (1959), THE SPIRE (1964), RITES OF PASSAGE (1980), THE PAPER MEN (1984), CLOSE QUARTERS (1987), FIRE DOWN BELOW (1989), and THE DOUBLE TONGUE, left in draft at his death, was published in 1995.Evaluation: I've heard many things about this book. That is the reason I decided to read it, and I must say, it lived up to every single expectation. The pessimistic view on human nature is frighteningly real, and it is portrayed through an entertaining adventure story with a group of children stranded on an island. My favorite character was Piggy because he was the rational character. He was the intelligent member of the democratic \\"tribe\\" on the island, and a tragic hero in the end. The Antagonist on the island was Jack. He started as a good-natured leader of the hunters. This physical job eventually brought out the inherent evil that Golding thought was in every human being. All hell breaks loose when the hunting tribe splits from the rational tribe, and they go on a pig hunt. This is, in my opinion, the best scene ever portrayed in a book. The haunting image of a skewered pig's head that represents the devil sticks in my mind whenever I think of the book. He takes the innocent life of Simon hours before the other children do. The end of the book is tragically ironic when the Navy man walks in on a childish manhunt, yet he is doing the same exact thing on his ship. An easy read, but unbelievable book. I give it 5 out of 5 stars, and it's now my favorite book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously.

I don't remember all the details of the book, but what I do remember is how depressed I was after I finished it. The book makes you realize that the world may seem good on the surface, but that it doesn't take much to release the dark side of most people. While that thought is disturbing, it's actually good to bring out in the open, because then you can guard against it. The book is fictional, but it contains some of the saddest truths about humanity. I'm not sure that common human decency always gets thrown out the window when the structure of civilization is removed, but the events of this book certainly do seem very pausible and realistic.On one level, this book is an exciting adventure story. I would recommend it for that alone. But on another level it is a commentary of the inner motives of individuals, and how those motives affect the entire group. This adds significantly to the book and makes me remember it fondly fifteen years later."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It's often a distinct pleasure to listen to an audio book read by the author, as the writer of a story can bring an added depth, a richness that eludes voice performers. Such is certainly the case with this reading by the incomparable Cornwallian William Golding, the recipient of the 1983 Nobel Prize for Literature.\\"Lord of the Flies\\" has become a contemporary classic since its publication in 1954. Who can forget this thrilling adventure of British school boys marooned on a tropical island? After their plane is wrecked on a deserted spot the boys must manage to survive.Initially, the boys use their only resources - themselves, as there is no adult supervision. They make their own rules and way of life. But camaraderie is short lived as some of the boys follow Jack who would rather swim and play, while others are drawn to Ralph as he attempts to bring about order and delegate responsibility.Throughout the years \\"Lord of the Flies\\" has been called a lesson in politics, a parable, and even a myth. Whatever the delineation it is timeless.William Golding recorded his tale in a London studio in 1976. We're fortunate it has been remastered and re-released for our listening pleasure today. It is not a recording to be played and tossed aside; it is one to hear over and over again.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am friendly with a judge who sits on criminal cases. When a young defendant comes into his court, this judge often requires that this book be read as a condition of the sentence. There is much symbolism in this book, such as the grinning sow's head (the Lord of the Flies), and the corpse of the parachutist. However, even if the symbolism is not clear, the horrors of people left to their own devices, without authority figures to guide them, is a potent theme of this book. Reason and civilized behavior, despite the best efforts of the lead characters Ralph and Piggy, steadily dissolve into savagry. The judge says that he has been moved and impressed by the essays that some of the young people have handed in to him after they read this book. I hope that young people, who may be tempted to follow the insensitive behavior of peers, may be affected by this book and follow the course of decent and civilized deportment."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"what doesn't this book have. action, adventure, excitement, war, it has everything. it's written in an easy to understand language (tho' that doesn't necessarily mean that you'll pick up on the symbolism that golding put into everything). and you definately get a totally different perception of the book as you get older (this is my third reading of it, and each time, i get something different from it). i think this should be required reading and that everyone should own a copy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Since a George Orwell reference is obviously required here, I read 'Animal Farm' directly before Lord of the Flies. And I was foolish enough to think that Animal farm is a great book! It can hardly stand on all four legs when measuring up to Lord of the Flies.Just as 'Animal Farm' is a parody of the Russian Revolution, 'Lord of the Flies' is more of a parable for mankind than an inspiration for 'Hatchet'. Every (major) character is a symbol of some aspect of human nature. And what is a literal translation of \\"Beelzebub?\\" Not devil, as you might suspect -- \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"And if the Lord of the Flies is the Devil, Simon is Christ, or pure good -- the only boy brave enough to discover what the beast really is, the only one...crazy enough to understand it, and the one who would be sacrificed by all for trying to spread the words of the Lord of the Flies.No, I did not read this book for class, thank God, or else I would most likely hate it just for that reason. I despise hearing teachers read aloud, I don't know why, and their stupid assignments (What would you do if you were trapped on an island? What would you bring?) completely miss the entire point of the book. This is not a survival story!My edition of Lord of the Flies was printed in the seventies,and it is falling apart (I found it in my dad's study in the basement). The scotch-taped cover is blank white, except for the title and a simple sketch of the head and arms of a boy, head bent like a baby, clutching his hair in anguish. He appears to be covered in blood. Is it Ralph at the beginning of Chapter 11 (you'll see what I mean)? Is it a struggling, uncertain Jack?Lord of the Flies is definitely not a survival story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a previous reviewer noted, _Lord of the Flies_ is a difficult book. There is a lot of symbolism, and the themes and ideas are abstract and become apparent only with deep thought. Yet the implications the author makes about human nature, about ideas we purport to hold so dearly - \\"civilization,\\" \\"democracy,\\" \\"morals\\" and \\"decency\\" - are worth the effort it takes to read and digest.The story line is simple enough - a plane of young boys crashes on a deserted island, and the kids must make the best of it. What ensues is a gradual, downward spiral into barbarism and authoritarianism.It is a brilliant book, making one wonder just how thin the line is between acting like an animal and giving in to our more atavistic side, or attempting to cooperate and behave in a \\"civilized\\" manner.Perhaps Freud (and Jung) got it right - inside each of us is the shadowy remnants of our more primitive ancestors, struggling to get out. We see it every day on the news: the violence in our communities and around the world. And as we sit in our comfortable homes, we have the audacity to wonder \\"how can this happen?\\" Perhaps Golding got it right when suggested that the Beast is within all of us. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It is impossible to encompass Lord of the Flies into a short review. Golding just says too much on too many different levels. The book is simply brilliant. First off, Lord of the Flies is an adventure story. A few British schoolboys are deserted on an island and must depend on themselves to survive to be rescued. The story is based on an earlier British classic, The Coral Island by R.M. Ballantyne. The simple adventure story is used to comment on humanity. Golding, much like Joseph Condrad, shows how civilation keeps humanity from lapsing into savagery. He presents the schoolboys' loss of innocence. Lord of the Flies is also a political treatise much like Animal Farm. Ralph represents a democracy, Jack is communism, and Piggy is the voice of wisdom which both tends to ignore. He traces political troubles back to individuals.Many people think of William Golding as too pessimistic about human nature. I do not think Golding was as pessimistic as many think. William Golding was unfortunate to see human at its worst during World War II, and I think he feared lapses. Lord of the Flies is his warning. His attempt to help man stay on the right course. Whether or not a person agrees to this and feels Golding was too cynical, it is impossible to not think of Lord of the Flies as one of the best-written books of the century. Golding encompasses so much into an simple, powerful narrative. The prose and images are beautiful even when grim. Lord of the Flies is certainly one of the great novels of literature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Anybody know what my title's about? Basically, this: In the battle between your impulsive, selfish side and your rational, moral side which would ultimately win?The plot of this novel is misleadingly simple. Some shipwrecked British lads must fend for themselves on an island while waiting to be rescued. Their only hope for returning to civilization is to keep a fire burning in the hope that a ship will see the smoke. A leader is chosen. The society is well organized and, intitially, works. Then the &quot;littlun's&quot; confess their superstitious fear of a mysterious &quot;beast&quot; lurking in the woods. Disputes concerning priorities and leadership divide the boys. Gradually, the wilderness in them all possesses them wholly. This is the tragedy in Golding's eyes. Everything natural is condemned, while things of intellect are placed on a pedestal.This book is nothing if not symbolic. Jack is selfish desires (Freud's &quot;Id&quot;)while Piggy is intellect (Freud's &quot;Superego&quot;). Piggy's glasses represent reason. Remmeber this when anything happens to them, and what Piggy is like without them. Ralph is Mr. Inbetween (AKA: Freud's &quot;Ego&quot;). He's the closest to you and me. The conch represents order in society.Pay close attention to the physical appearances of the characters as well. It indicates how well adapted they are to the island. The trick is that those most suited to the island are those most in tune with their instincts and animal desires. THey are the ones who give up on the fire. THey are the ones whom commit the injust acts. THey are the inhumane consequences of total submission to human desire."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding does a wonderful job of keeping this complex story at a reading level accessible to all respective age levels, although parents might want to think twice about letting more SENSITIVE children read the book. I say this because there are a number of scenes involving bloody fights or deaths and less experienced readers might find them disturbing. Overall, the book is great. It's a story of a small group of children marooned on a tropical island then forced to fend for themselves in its wild environment. As most of you probably know, a type of mutiny ensues, and the small band of miserable castaways breaks into two groups, one calling themselves &quot;the hunters&quot; led by a rugged and violent young man named Jack who thinks the most pressing responsibility he has as leader is to procure meat for his crew, and the smaller, nameless group led by the book's youthful father figure Ralph, who believes keeping a lighted signal fire atop a nearby mountain the most important island duty. The book flows nicely and keeps the reader's attention. It's a bit of a cautionary tale much like Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; or Huxley's &quot;Brave New World.&quot; The morals of the story are easily learned and hard to forget, but I'll let you figure them out on your own. If you're looking for something engaging to read, you won't go wrong buying this."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"Which is better-to have rules and agree, or to hunt and kill?\\" This thematic question is the basis of conflict in William Golding's Lord of the Flies. Golding's tale, set on a remote island, is a story of a group of British boys' survival from a shipwreck. The boys, aged from a mere six to twelve, must struggle to go on with their everyday lives, apart from all adults or authority. This separation from society creates this overall thematic conflict: the struggle between the civil and primal natures of man. This conflict is enacted beautifully in this fictional setting. There are an endless amount of symbolic insights that can be applied to this struggle in the heart of man, ranging from as simple as the conflict between good and evil, or order and disorder, to complex Biblical allusions. This symbolism proves to be essential to the effectiveness of the book, because it allows the reader to apply these symbolic ideas to himself. The struggle of the nature of man's heart is a simple yet interesting theme that contributes to the greatness of this novel. One of the most remarkable aspects of the book is the way in which Golding can bestow the characteristics of the differing natures of man's heart through young boys. The boys in his novel perfectly symbolize the complex instincts and emotions of adults without violating the simplicity of children. They speak with a child's vocabulary, think with a child's mind, and still can represent the complexity of mankind. This is certainly a commendable feat on part of the author. The pure adventure aspect of Lord of the Flies is remarkable as well. Golding conveys a thrilling adventure story to create his symbolism through. He expertly uses the tools of literature, especially foreshadowing and description, to achieve a beautifully scripted story of adventure and suspense. This element of having an eventful story line full of action is often absent in pieces with such quality of symbolism. It is difficult to achieve both of these purposes and still end up with a good novel. Lord of the Flies is an extremely easy book to understand, even with its endless depths of interior symbolism. It's length is quite concise, making it able to read in just a few sittings. It is short, simple, and still a classic: yet another commendable mention to Golding. Golding's ability to convey such a story in such a simple manner is quite amazing to me. The only possible foreseen problem in reading the book is the long time it takes to set up the story line. But this problem is soon overcome, for the set-up proves to be valuable to the suspense and foreshadowing aspects of the plot. Lord of the Flies is a beautifully written classic. Its spell-binding story and magnificent structure create a pleasing and worthwhile experience. Golding's novel teaches the reader of the natures of his own heart, giving this piece an educational standpoint. This book, along with Conrad's Heart of Darkness, has given me a deeper understanding of the desires and tendencies of man. This, I believe, is one of the main objectives of the book: to further question and achieve deeper understanding of ourselves and those around us. This message is an important one; trying to understand some of the complexities of humans is a wonderful gift of knowledge that proves itself useful in life. This knowledge never stops growing throughout our lives, and literary pieces such as this one help us to remember this quest for self-knowledge, and the love we all have for it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book back in high school, over 20 years ago. I make my children read it, even if it's not required for their English class. Since it stood out in my mind for over 20 years and I remember details of it, it's impact was extraordinary! I think that it affects men and young boys differently,stronger than women and young girls. I think it's one of the best books ever written."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Don't expect to read this book for entertainment value--it's too dark and disturbing. This book is basically a moral fable that illustrates the innate character flaws in human nature. In order to illustrate the point that human nature is inherently flawed, the author chooses to use young children stranded on a deserted island as his means to do so. Although the children start off with some standards and an attempt at civilization, the flaws in human nature ensure the group devolves into anarchy. The point is that civilization and morality take effort, they are not natural. This is an instructive and important book, if not a happy one."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book as an adult. It was not taught at the high school I went to, but I was always curious about this book. I actually listened to it on CD in my car and found myself wishing my hour-long commute was longer - I was that riveted! This book is a peak inside the human psyche - a lesson in what separates us from the animal kingdom - and what can send us back. I found myself fascinated, full of questions. Are we really only several rules away from being savages? Do we instinctively know this and that is why the majority of us live peaceably within society's \\"norms\\"? I love books that challenge me intellectually and make me ask questions that hopefully help me understand myself and others around me better, and \\"Lord of the Flies\\" definitely did that."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is great. It paints a picture of what happens to a group of people when survival is on the line. Insightful and intriguing, if not disgusting at times. HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is one of the best, sitting next to all the other William Golden books. When few boys fell on an island from an airplan that was blown up by an atom bomb, they fight their way all out the island to be saved.This book will keep you on your feet, with fights and thrilling mysteries that are sometimes not solved. This is one of the greatest book of all time that will lead pondering at all times."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This classic story entitled \\"Lord of the Flies\\" by William Golding about a group of school boys stranded on an island after their plane crashes shortly before the next world war is a fantastic character study of the human mind's descent into madness. It has been compared to Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and this comparison definitely holds its own.Once you begin reading, the richness of Golding's language and his numerous symbolic descriptions will make this page-turner very hard to put down. He describes the scenery in such vivid detail that you can honestly see the island in your mind's eye.Golding also touches on the inner struggle of the mass majority vs. the individual opinion. By the end of the book, this idea is easily understood. He also sets up arguments for rational vs. emotional reactions to situations, and the long-standing conflict that lies in morality vs. immorality.At the beginning of the novel, we meet Ralph, the main character who, in turn, meets \\"Piggy\\", an overweight, weak-willed child who is established as the voice of reason and rationality throughout the novel, despite being continually made fun of and disrespected.While trying to get a grip on their newfound reality, they discover a conch shell which becomes a symbol of order and control throughout the book. Knowing that they can't be the only children on the island, Ralph uses the shell to beckon any others. However, considering how the story unfolds, they might have been better off remaining isolated.Soon enough, groups of children appear before them and once everyone finally assembles, Ralph holds a meeting in which the children introduce themselves to each other and set up the initial rules of the island. Ralph is elected the leader at first but it is clear that another child named Jack will inevitably become his rival, as his is also a strong personality, yet Jack is more obsessed with the thrill and savagery of the hunt, as opposed to keeping order and making the best efforts to be rescued.As the novel progresses, we can see the sanity and rationality of the tribe slipping further down the rabbit hole, particularly from the perspective of Simon, one of the children who was more of a friend to Piggy and Ralph than to Jack. He is the only one of the children to discover \\"the beast\\", a rumored boogeyman-type character that the littler children fear. He is also the strongest connection to the title of the book, which essentially is loosely translated to mean \\"Beelzebub\\", or the devil. Simon has the deepest understanding of the evil that runs rampant on the island.Golding has stated that he wrote the novel as a character study of how we as a human race have struggled to rise above our primal needs for centuries, yet we don't realize just how quickly and easily we can return. In a matter of weeks, the children's goal of \\"having fun\\" turns into survival and for some, that's a tragic goal that is never reached.This book will hold your interest strongly throughout and can be appreciated for the basis of such island-based entertainment as Lost or the title of Rob Reiner's production company, Castle Rock Entertainment. (Stephen King enjoyed the book so much that he included the title of the climactic mountain setting as fictional town in his books. Rob Reiner, in turn, was inspired by King's books and took the name for his company.)\\"Lord of the Flies\\" is an excellent read and has been part of the school curriculum's literature requirements in many schools across the country for generations. In such a well-written novel we can examine the human mind and analyze human behavior with the luxury of descriptions such as Golding's, as opposed to picking up a psychology book.--unless that's more your thing, of course."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies, the classic tale by William Golding about the dark side of human nature, is explained throughout this wonderful novel. It shows a great distinction of survival of the fittest and the structure of law and corruption of power. The book talks about how culture that was made by man fails, Golding uses a group of British schoolboys stuck on islands who try to govern themselves as an example. The only conflict is that this ultimately comes with catastrophic consequences. The main topic themes that the story revolves around are the controversy of human nature and individual welfare versus the common good. It was very descriptive and entertaining throughout every page, the author would keep you on your toes of what would happen next. The book has a lot of suspense as well as a concept of realization of how we as a civilization of man function and fall."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I just finished this book for English, and I felt it nailed its message pretty well. The symbols and deeper meanings are really an early attempt at exploring the true nature of children vs. their morals under survival situations. It is sad seeing how young boys can do this to each other, but it is very realistic in its psychological views, and shows how anyone has the ability to give into power and impulses under the right circumstances. The ending just pieces everything together, and shows the true impact the actions have caused these boys emotionally, even though it is a little anti-climatic. In the end, the basic moral is to not give in to your natural impulses so quickly and not to be quick to judge other people. It also teaches you that anyone has the ability to turn evil when given power, but there will always be those with morals who continue to fight on."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"There are quite a few negative reviews on \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" and of course I had my own complaints with the book too.But I still give it 5 starts because this is an instance where the whole is greater the sum of its parts.Wasn't crazy about the author's prose style. It felt clumsy, jarring and often times I had to re-read entire paragraphs. But, at the same time, the chapters were so intriguing, enthralling and gripping.Golding's attention to detail gives the reader a complete sensory experience."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is Sir William Golding's most ingenious insight into human-nature and group political psychology.The pessimistic truth: when faced with the prospect of striving and attaining a higher-potential ..or merely settling for an easily acquired base commonality (for whatever dubious reasons), ...what path will MOST people take?Suddenly marooned on a small tropical island, a group of British school-boys find themselves confronted by a survival situation. Their plight soon renders them a microcosm of any tribe, community, or nation in flux.No adults survived the shipwreck. The two most intelligent and responsible boys, Ralph and \\"Piggy\\"(real name not revealed), logically assess the situation. They realize that through discipline, hard work, cooperation, and organization, the boys can survive on this small island until they are rescued. There is just enough food to eat, if they are careful. By adhering to a regular program of foraging, maintaining shelters, and manning a sentry-post to watch for the rescuers, they organize their people in an impressive effort. They establish a rudimentary system of democracy, with regular mandatory meetings for all, to address the immediate and potential concerns of the group.Unfortunately, amongst the survivors, is one Jack Merridew, the leader of a choir group. Jack, who is probably not as intelligent as Piggy or Ralph, has the advantage of being a natural charismatic-leader, and therefore, a natural \\"politicain\\". Of the many subcommitees, he volunteers his choir-boys to be the designated hunting-party and \\"security-element\\" of the survivors.Jack openly opposes the rigorous program of foraging and labor. He preaches \\"promises\\" of turning the island into a hedonistic \\"Peter-Pan\\" paradise. His ever encroaching domination of the group threatens the order established by Ralph and Piggy.The political game we have all seen played out eternally, soon takes its predictable course:-One side states a need for hard-work and discipline for the betterment of all, the other side refutes this with promises of leisurely \\"better-living\\" WITHOUT any such sacrifice of effort whatsoever.-Who do you think the electorate will vote for?-How many people will mindlessly join one faction or another, purely based on the side that appears to be \\"winning\\"?-How many times have we seen charismatic \\"leaders\\" sacrifice everything and everyone, ...just to be the \\"one in charge\\"?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Why I Thought Lord of the Flies was a great bookBy Gage McMullenWhat if all the rules were taken away,There were no adults,No guidelines.A plane crashes on the way to a fieldtripwith only 1st graders and older middle school kids,the pilots and teachers are dead it's just them.What would happen?At the beach, in my bed, at the caf&eacute; I could just not put down Lord of the Flies! I thoroughly enjoyed this book because the author was not afraid to write about dark, horrible, and gruesome things such as death and violence. For instance when he explains a baby pig getting chased down and stabbed with several spears then having his throat slit by the hunters, it made me want to yell out \\"stop\\" right there in the middle of my room. If you think that's dreadful, there is a part in the book when the opposing tribe takes a large rock and throws it at a boy named Piggy, he gets hit in the head and bleeds to death while falling to the water. It is so horrible and sad but without it the book just wouldn't be the same.My favorite part of the story was when the chief of one side of the island (Ralph) is being hunted like a pig by the other tribe. He tries to run and find a place to hide, when he finally finds a good bush to hide in they light the forest on fire forcing him to run out into the open! You think he's doomed but a ship sees the smoke and comes to rescue the kids. This book seriously sped up my heart and kept it going.But this book isn't just about kids on an island it truly is about what would happen if the rules were taken away, if we had to start from scratch, would we rebuild civilization or would we revert to our inner animal? Who would rise to the top the strongest and toughest, the smartest but shyest, or the handsomest and most outgoing? What would be your job in the tribe make fire, build forts, hunt? What would happen to you would you rise to the top or sink to the bottom? This book really got me thinking so I kept enjoying Lord of the Flies even after I was done. I really loved this book, Lord of he Flies by William Golding."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was an excellent book which teaches a hard, but important lesson about human nature. When I read this book I thought it was a well thought out book with plenty of action, suspense, and disturbing turns that keeps you hooked like a horror movie or rollercoaster. Golding made a literary master piece when he wrote this story and I recommend it to anyone without a queezy stomach.The book is basically about a group of British school boys who gets ship wrecked on a deserted island, and over time the kids stop being British school boys and become vicious savages. The main character Ralph was a leader that wanted law and order. But as the kids revert to savages Jack becomes the leader and under him the kids do horrible and aweful things. Which eventually lead to the end of two children's lives. I really liked Golding's use of symbolism, such as the conch representing law and order or the Lord of the Flies representing the devil, this book is full with symbolism. The book has human turn to beast, the very thing they fear throughout the book.[...]The idea that humanity can have a dark side is very important to the growth of any kid. If we can learn that we have these instincts and there are sometimes consequences if you follow them. Then maybe we can become better at controlling them. Its also enjoyable to read if you are the type that like being scared"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I first read Lord of the Flies during an English Literature class I hated it. I thought that it was dry, boring and more than a little irritating. Then when I reread it more than 10 times over the course of two years and studied every single character and happenstance in depth, I began to appreciate the scope and vision of this literary masterpiece. There is no question that Golding has written one of the greatest novels in the history of time.The Lord of the Flies is at first glance a simple story of a group of boys stranded on an island who get carried away and grow \\"wild\\". Yet upon a second glance we see that it is truly a tale of \\"the end of innocence\\" and \\"the darkness of man's heart\\" (found on the last page as Ralph grieves). Golding explicitly illustrates the primeval power of human nature, a surging, uncontrollable force that let loose from its bindings of society and order, and laws, can run rampant and revert to the way it was in the beginning: complete chaos.Golding masterfully uses metaphors and symbolism throughout the book. A few important examples include the fat boy, Piggy, ridiculed by so many of the boys on the island, is depicted as \\"the voice of reason\\", while Simon, a shy and insightful boy, is depicted in a saint-like manner, a crusader for peace, a Jesus-like character who possesses the only means to bring revelation to the boys. Early on in the book, the boys find the conch, a fragile symbol of societal law and order.We eventually find that Piggy is killed, crushing the voice of reason, as is Simon, crushing hope and goodness, and the conch is smashed, relieving the small society of law and order. With all these three things gone, then darkness rages throughout the island. And who is responsible for the destruction of those three important symbols? None other than Jack, the totalitarian ringleader of his island faction, a Hitler-like representative of corruptness, greed, domination, and overall a person totally given over to the dark side of human nature.Those are just a few of the symbols that are introduced in Golding's book, throughout the novel there are a plethora of many more that require an inquisitive mind to unlock their secrets and achieve a higher level of understand of the constant battle of our existence. This is without a doubt a masterpiece. Golding has created a work of fiction that is not just suited for a younger generation of readers but also for an older generation. At any age, his darkly compelling story is enough to provoke the deepest of thoughts and introspective self-reexamination."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is not just a book about a group of boys on an island, but a story about the weaknesses and evils of mankind that have caused trouble and conflict in our world throughout history. At times the story is frightening and disturbing because of it's harsh and blunt truth,but the beautiful language and symbolism make this book a must read. It is a perfect example of a book about a topic that should learned and understood by all."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, it should be warned, is by no means an adventure story of a group of boys stranded upon a desert island. Rather, it is an attack upon our own civilisation, and just how shallow this is.The storyline, as with most great literature, is very simple: A group of boys are left to their own devices on a desert island following a plane crash. Too begin with, the boys manage very well for themselves, keeping themselves in order, making plans for rescue and providing for each other and the community as a whole. Thimgs begin to go wrong, however, when following a series of incidents the group splits down the middle and one group shows itself to be decidedly more powerful and influential than the other. Murders, riots and fires follow, showing the one group to have returned to their roots of animal instincts to eat and to stay alive. Golding successfully presents civilisatin as a farce that could fall apart at the simplest hiccup in the grand scheme of things.The book is a chilling question of human nature, that raises very serious questions about human life and nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's tale is a parody of R.M. Ballantyne's adventure yarn - &quot;The Coral Island&quot;, in which Jack, Ralph and Peterkin, despite being shipwrecked and cut off from civilisation, never lose sight of the public school values and rules in which they were raised. They remain young gentlemen throughout the novel. Golding borrows the names Ralph and Jack for his two principal characters and rivals. But most of the similarities end there. Like all great novels, the Lord of the Flies can be read on several levels. It can be seen simply as an account of the way a group of schoolboys descend into savagery after their plane crashes on an island. They are cut off from civilisation and freed from the controls of parents and other adults, with results that would surprise no teacher who has ever left a third form class unattended for a few minutes. (One can only assume that Ballantyne never taught third formers). More seriously, the novel explores the formation and disintegration of social groups, leadership and the legitimate basis of authority, the appetite for and exercise of power, the results of blind obedience and the way people who are &quot;different&quot; can become outcasts and scapegoats. Piggy, the fat bespectacled asthmatic and staunch supporter of Ralph, is from the first the subject of Jack's taunts and sneers. Piggy's murder signals the death of reason, and the rapid and uncontrollable plunge into savagery. For me, the novel is a reminder that the most civilised society is, at best, only a few good meals away from anarchy and collapse."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is one of the few rare thought provoking books I have ever read. It is about a group of young boys who stranded on a deserted island during WWII. Realizing their predicament, they begin to create their own \\"society.\\" At first everything is great. There is a leader and then there are followers. However, as the book progresses, another one of the \\"children\\" feels that he is better suited for power and a struggle begins. The two \\"kids\\" both want control over others and their differences split community into two. It is at this point that evil begins to take over. The innocent children have now become savages. Violence, hatred, and even murder can be found. Golding has truly written a masterpiece novel. However, this book has to be examind carefully and cannot be taken at face value. It is a reflection on the evils of human nature and society: greed, the need for power, and the need to destroy. No doubt the violent and gruesome activities of WWII played a role in Golding's attitude. There also several biblical and mythical allusion included. If you haven't read this book, you need to and if you have and didn't like it, you need to reread and examine it. It is truly fascinating"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought that this book focused primarily on the flaws of society through the actions of the stranded young men. I thought that was a unique an interesting way to show people how awfully crude our society can be, but the rest of the book was horrid.

Otherwise, steer clear."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's &quot;Lord Of the Flies&quot; is an absolute masterpiece. It is a fantastic story of a group of school boys stranded on an island. However, with close reading an allegorical underlying meaning surfaces. Golding masterfully creates a miniature society with the boys and proceeds to depict it as corrupt and depraved, using Jack as a violent and tyrannical politician-like figure. When my english teacher first informed my ninth grade class that we would be reading this potentially boring book, I groaned along with my peers. However, within a few pages, I was enthralled. I could not get enough of the lovable and heroic Ralph, the endearing complaints of Piggy, the epilictic visions of the ill-fated Simon, or the evil manipulations of the nefarious Jack and his hunting hooligans. By the end, I was in complete awe and forever raptured by Ralph.

If I did, I probably would rate this book at a lower score. Anyway, I always had known the basic plot, so I while back I picked it from the library. I now know why many teachers make this book required reading. Golding puts his view of human civilization with Freudian philosophy in what first appears to be simple story of English boys on an uninhabited island. In the beginning, that is how the novel seems, and it has a cheerful mood. But Golding's main point is that civilization is fragile, and without government people are asking for chaos. He brings Freudian concepts into play, like id, ego, and superego(Jack, Ralph, Piggy). Adults here are represented like government figures, but no adults on the island mean no government. The boys do their best to work together at first, but soon after there is manipulation and mutiny. Symbolism packs this book, not only in inanimate objects, but the characters. Jack(agression), Ralph(order), Piggy(reason), and Simon(consolation that was never realized). All the while the island is presented as a paradise and a lonely piece of wilderness at the same time. Golding puts his message across clearly, and at the same time puts out a good adventure novel. I only had two main problems with Lord of the Flies. One is that overall, the island seemed to be very small and needed more decription of it's physical features, and two, Golding should have put the boys' average age a few years ahead. But those aside, this novel is a good one, being rightful to earn classic status.

I think the authors purpose for writing the book was to show how people can turn savage in a short period of time without anyone to enforce the rules.I do agree with his message, because society's do need rules or else things like what happened in the book, will happen every day. In the book I think that the author handled the characters very well.There were many characters,and he described them and their personality very well.I think Golding is a great author.

To read this book and completly usnderstand this novel you should and almost have to be a very intellectual person and you have to be a deep person. There is some symbolism that is very difficult to understand and without a teacher or someone who understands the book telling you what it is about it could be very confusing. The book, however, had very good discription and was very well written. It made you feel like you were actually there with them and feeling their struggles and difficulties. I felt their frustration with each other. Can you imagine if you were stranded on this island and you had no adults, no parents, and no sense of government? I felt as if the book was never ending and it dragged on way too long. I didn't enjoy reading it therefore I really didn't put a lot of energy trying to figure out what the author was trying to say. I also am not a girl for ficton books and I usually don't like books that we have to read in school. If I were to read this book I would deffenitly go in with a different mind set. I would go in with the mind set that this book is very difficult to read and that I have to foucs a lot to see the hidden symbolism, and theme within the book. I enjoyed the scenery that was set up and the discription used to describe events. I recommend this book to anyone who has great understanding finding hidden symbolism and picking out the theme.

Be intense while reading this book!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of the slowest-starting books in the history of man. It takes a few pages to get yourself acclimated to Golding's writing style, which mixes stream-of-consciousness elements with traditional narrative in order to better portray the young, impressionistic (and impressionable) psyches of the children. That being said, the book hardly qualifies as boring. The statement it makes for the inner savagery and essential evil of man is quite strong, and never before this book had any other novel or work explored the subject in quite so provocative a manner. Yes, there is violence, murder, all committed by young men. They have reverted to their &quot;natural state,&quot; shucked off civilization and become what Golding argues to be the essence of man: selfish, violent, and covetous. For any who dislike the disturbing imagery - that does not negate the importance of the book. If anything, that should only prove how effective it is. It disgusts you because it makes you wonder if you are capable of it yourself. Four stars - a classic, but not a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"'Lord of the Flies' was written to show that no matter how civilized the human race thinks it is, it is all an illusion created for our own safety. We are all animals in soul, if not in mind. I was drawn into the book, I thought of the characters as real people, with real problems, and real personalities. I feared for the characters lives, for Golding's one-in-a-million writing style brought the story to life. 'Lord of the Flies' had to be one of the most believable books I've ever read. With an exciting, realistic plot; well-thought out characters; excellent imagery; and superb symbolism. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to see the hidden side of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Although it is quite a gripping adventure story, there is far more to this book than a bunch of boys running about on an island. Golding himself designed it as a critical allegory illustrating the potentially dark nature of mankind and the importance of the individual in controlling society. However, it could easily be interpreted differently - as an illustration of the corrupting effect of society, as a reflection of the conflicting components of the human soul, etc. Truly a fascinating novel."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"LORD OF THE FLIES is a true modern masterpiece, a disturbing look at human nature and the decay of civilization. In this extraordinarily well-crafted book, William Goldman expertly and effectively uses symbolism to develop his themes. It is fast-moving, but my no means a &quot;light read&quot; and will almost certainly change your thoughts about civilization and human nature. The one thing I cannot understand, however, is why this book is required to be read by so many middle and even early high school students. Although the story is about pre-pubescent boys stranded on an island, it is NOT a book for children, who often find LORD OF THE FLIES boring (as shown by the fact that the overwhelming majority of negative reviews for this book are written by schoolchildren). Although LORD OF THE FLIES is not a difficult book to read, it takes a much greater degree of maturity and knowledge to be able to fully comprehend the themes (that man is inherently evil, etc.) and appreciate the use of symbolism in the book than most children under the age of 16 or 17 possess. However, for those who can appreciate the magnificent job that Goldman has done with this wonderfully disturbing parable, LORD OF THE FLIES is a life-changing work that is not easily forgotten. Enthusiastically recommended."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One cannot fully appreciate &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; without first acknowledging the sheer volume of levels on which it works. The plot is, at the very least, engaging. Yet the novel's overall power lies in its structure; as it is through structure that the seeds of its meaning (and appreciation) can be unearthed. Once discovered, all else begins to fall into place.Consider that he sets the story on a remote Pacific island and makes his characters children. The island is the ideal setting from which to convey Golding's idea of the universality of evil, as it is untouched by civilization and is therefore open to the emergence of evil on an organic level. The setting reinforces the theory that evil exists in all of us, regardless of locational, political or cultural conditioning. He uses children rather than adults to reinforce the setting, as they are at the point in life whereby Man is at his most honest, and least likely to enter into a new, stark reality wearing the masks he has created for himself over the years. (The irony here being that masks are created in the novel; but as a result of regression, rather than growth. By having a child regress, the natural unconscious state of Man is realized.)As the island is a microcosm of the world, and the boys a microcosm of mankind, the notion of the universality of evil flourishes from this context. Golding suggests that man, by his very nature, is a sinner. Once we had fallen from grace (just as the boys fall from the sky), we condemned ourselves to a life whereby finding Eden is impossible. Our fates seem to be sealed. Early on in the novel, the reader learns through the discussions of the boys that atomic warfare is taking place in Europe. Golding sets the novel against the invisible yet looming backdrop of war so as to suggest that Man's inherent flaw is its allowing evil to dominate his world. This is because mankind at its ugliest (as represented by Jack) is incapable of acknowledging, and in turn controlling his dark side. Yet Piggy can control it, as he is a manifestation of the Freudian idea of the superego. Ralph is the ego, as his dichotemy is evidenced by his waivering back and forth to maintain control and reason. This is because Ralph finds himself slipping into the realm of the id, which of course, is Jack. As the book unfolds, clearly the id wins out, as chaos, aggression, violence and murder permeate the boy's so-called utopian word, just as is the case in the world of &quot;civilization&quot;. Man's fall from grace transcends time and space.The macrocosm/microcosm principle of the universality of evil is further reinforced through the novel's organization. Golding expertly structures the movement of the plot on two parallel plains. Note that the entire novel transcends slowly from a world of order, unity and comraderie into one of chaos, fragmentation and ultimately, bloodshed. This wholistic movement of order to disorder is replicated on the small scale through the intra-chapter movements themselves; each chapter begins ordered and ends in chaos. In other words, the physical structure of the novel replicates the thematic structure of the universality of evil. Note, though, that that the only two exceptions in the novel in which this physical parallelism does not occur are in the chapters pertaining to Simon. His chapters in the novel end in a tone of tranquility and spirituality. The first being the chapter entitled &quot;Huts on the Beach&quot; which closes with Simon, engrossed in quiet meditation under the silence and darkness of the forest's canopy. The second is at the end of &quot;A View to a Death&quot;, after his murder. Yet the tone is quietly elegant and luminous in its description of the water and sky upon his death.I suspect that Golding made these two structural inconsistencies to denote a message that in fact runs consistently, yet is never directly articulated in the novel. The clue to our own rescue; to our own freedom from the chains of the id, and from a world without faith lies in Simon, the whispering mystic. He is the only one that understands the beast in the shape of the lord of the flies, and can therefore communicate with him. This is because Simon understands that the beast is us. And perhaps from a literary standpoint, it was necessary that Simon be killed. It would suggest that for as long as we our governed by the beast within, without recognizing and controlling it, then we will never be ready to understand and experience salvation from ourselves. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; teaches us that without psychological and spiritual balance, we are ultimately doomed."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Talk about eerie.

My teacher said that it related to man's inner self, and she led discussions how Golding is trying to portray that man is inherently evil and killing is man's natural instinct. I feel that this is rather a bleak and completely pessimistic view of humankind, and I do not believe that a group of children, or people of any age for that matter, would behave as savagely as Golding suggests. I did not agree with the themes of the book and did not enjoy reading it at all."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book, Lord of the Flies, is a story about a group of kids getting stranded on a deserted island and how they survive without adults. I didn't like the way that many of the kids went crazy. I know you are stranded on a deserted island but i don't believe that you would just go crazy like that. I know that being on an island like that would probably make you alittle crazy, but not enough to brutally kill two of your peers. They all knew that in order to be survive, they needed to maintain order. I don't believe they would just betray their elected leader just to have some fun. As for the characters, I like Ralph. He handled himself well in the situtation. I did his best to maintain as much order as he could. You could tell that Ralph was had the potential for a good leader. Jack on the other hand, I did't like. At first he seemed like he was a nice kid but then he turned on Ralph and formed his own tribe. I couldn't believe when kids actually followed him. Then he got everyone to turn on Ralph who was just trying to keep order on the island. At one point Ralph gives in to Jack and goes to have a feast with him. They then kill Simon because they thought it was the monster running down the beach. Jack just made things out of control with his new tribe. He turned everyone into killers. I like Piggy for one reason, because he was the only one to stay with Ralph. This eventually got him killed, but he was loyal to the leader that he elected. Beside that he was that great of a character. He seemed like he would get on your nerves after awhile. Thats mainly the reason I didn't like his character that much. The ending of the book was horrible. I was expecting something more to happen than for them to just get rescued.

I think the author had a great idea on his hands when he decided to write this. Perhaps the author had trouble getting it on paper? I know some of my classmates feel the same when I say it wasn't as well-written as it could have been. I'm not saying he didn't use big enough words! He was extremely wordy, and a little too descriptive at times. I have nothing against words, as I love books myself. But, there was a point in the book (and I don't want to spoil this for people who haven't read it,) where he discussed things about blood staining sand, and the beast being dead, and 3 pages later which were FULL of description, we see, &quot;and Simon's dead body drifted out to sea,&quot; or something very similar. And all he would have needed was that last sentence! He didn't NEED 4 pages of blood and gore! But, alas. It isn't like we can have all the books turn out how we want them.

I was not required, but chose to read this book. I thaught that it would be somewhat interesting... I was dead wrong.First of all, Golding is one of the dullest writers ever. For example, he could explain how the tide of the beach would move, or how the sun sets and rises for 2 pages (this isn't exaggeration). Yet he can sum up one of the boy's death in less than half of a page.Second, if you've got something to say about society, don't use teenagers to say it. He obviously knows nothing about the way that real children would act. For example, when the savage boys kill one of the main characters in the story, they don't say anything like, \\"Oh my gosh we've just killed somebody!\\", they do say things like, \\"See what we did? Thats what we'll do to you!\\"He explains about a monster, \\"The Beasty,\\" very briefly. You never get to find out what it is, why it's there, or even what it represents.Even if you are some kind of deranged man who likes to read about the deaths... no... killings of little children, I still wouldn't recomend ths book for you. It is too dull to keep up with.Don't think of me as some bratty little kid just trying to bring the score of this book down either.

I really don't think of it as a great novel. I have read better. It depends on what your taste in novels are I suppose. I know that this isn't a good review on this novel and I am sorry if this misleads you. Well, I suggest to read it before you decide whether or not you like it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book Lord of the Flies, written by William Golding is a very well written book. The genre of the book is historical fiction. The setting of the book is on an uncharted island during the WorldWarII era. The book is mainly about a couple of schoolboys who crash-landed on an uncharted island that they are stranded on, without any adults. I think the theme of the book was to show that society cannot run correctly because of the natural, sinful nature of man. Some of the main characters are Piggy, Ralph, and Jack. Piggy and Ralph first meet when they when they wake up next to each other after the landing. Piggy is a chubby, little bossy kid, while Ralph on the other hand is a mellow and relaxed, cool kind of kid. They call together all of the kids that are on the island including a boy named Jack. Jack is a stuck up kid who is a prefect at his school and is the captain of his choir class. While the short lived bond of Piggy and Ralph's friendship becomes weaker, Jack and Ralph, who are both leaders seem to get along very well. Piggy and Ralph were friends, but when a person like Jack shows up a more strong, leader-like and Ralph-like kid is up to be Ralph's friend, Ralph quickly ignores Piggy to become Jack's friend. But as Jack and Ralph's friendship grows the contest for leadership of the tribe of kids grows even more. Even though the kids already voted for Ralph to be the chief, Jack is starting to show that he could be a better chief. I believe this because all Ralph has ever cared for is to keep the fire going, and keep the hope of being rescued alive. While Jack, a more ferocious boy, focuses on staying alive most of the time, and hunting for the hard to get meat. I think that this book is best recommended for older teenagers because most of the words in the book are very complex, and because of the violence that happens. The book, Lord of the Flies, is a very interesting book. Even though it has some very confusing words and hard to understand material, it should be given a try."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Thrilling and heart stopping, William Golding's The Lord of the Flies is wonderful book to read. The book is wonderfully written, filled with non-stop action, dynamic characters, and wonderful imagery.About young boys who have crashed onto an uninhabited island, The Lord of the Flies is a story that describes how the boys react and live without the presence of an adult. What makes the book really exciting is that things are always happening. Golding does drag out the story with long narrative descriptions. Instead, he ensures that he keeps the reader's interest by always events occurring on the island. The island is always filled with activity whether it is hunting for food, building shelters or conflicts between the boys. As the conflict begins to escalate among the boys, the story further grasps onto the reader's interest.The plot is not some basic storyline, but focuses on human nature and the structure of society. Golding emphasizes how the boys were content to set up some sort of governing structure. Unfortunately over time, the boys reverted back to primordial states- no longer abiding by the moral rules of conduct set by society. Golding reveals how structure and order are needed to live peacefully among other people.The characters each have his or own identifying personality, which allows readers to connect with at least one character. The characters are interesting and dynamic, contributing to the exciting plot.Golding also creates wonderful scenery through his imagery. The island is depicted as a wonderful paradise, but also a place of fear and disorder. Golding is able to make that great shift between paradise and a dangerous place.If you want to read an exciting book filled with wonderful imagery and characters, The Lord of the Flies is the way to go."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Imagine yourself on an isolated island with a bunch of naked boys... no not like that, um... with a bit more clothes. Better. That is basically the environment of William Golding's novel. The entire story takes place on a stranded island, where a plane carrying a load of boys crash lands.Starting off as a band of nave schoolboys, the youths face reality and come to accept their fate on the island. Soon afterwards, they set up an organized system to follow, but before long, the boys' paranoia gets the best of them, fracturing the boys in half. As they begin to lose their civilized nature, the increasingly savage boys become both vicious and merciless. At the conclusion, the boys finally realize their innate barbarity.The cast of the story consists of a series of dynamic characters. Ralph, the protagonist, originally serves as the leader and catalyst for the boys, until the greedy and power hungry Jack attempts to usurp his power, which ultimately fails and leads to the creation of his own band of boys. The soft-spoken and moral Simon is the embodiment of Christ within the story, as he is the first and only to notice the growing savageness prevalent throughout the boys. Other characters include Piggy, the representation of rationalism, and Roger, the representation of sadism.The microcosmic depiction of our world perfectly captures human brutality on a small scale and the futility of government. Not necessarily hard to understand, the novel creates a deeply suspenseful mood that remains over the course of the story.If you want an easy read, but meaningful book, I greatly recommend this book. Not many other high school caliber books can provide such deep meaning, yet still produce an outstanding story with naked guys."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I wonder if this book is in the vein of other dystopian views of the world that were published in the mid-20th century, such as Brave New World and 1984. Sure, Lord of the Flies isn't necessarily directly predicting a bleak future for humanity, but it does present a bleak view of human nature, in my opinion. In the following statement I am probably making an oversimplification that doesn't do justice to the complexity of Golding's classic or Golding's thinking in general: trying to portray human nature via the behavior of a handful of main characters and a few of their followers can't possibly capture the diversity of human personality and behavior. Maybe Golding assumes that these few kids are representative of the sample of ALL kids, as a statistician might say. In either case, an interesting read that will remain a classic.

When I started reading the book I wasn't interested right away. I thought the book lacked any action, and I couldn't identify with any of the characters, personally. Honestly, I kept reading because of obligation. Eventually I realized it was a good book. Towards the second half of the book the author added action and the characters evolved. Arguments took place among the boys which started fighting and drama. When the story started picking up it had me excited until the very end. Overall, I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a great adventure book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding 5/5I first read Lord of the Flies in high school, as do many Americans, and recall being the only person in class who actually enjoyed the book (and also the only one who disliked Frankenstein). I picked it up off of my shelf a few days ago (cracked binding, faded glue, and all the pages falling out) and finally reread it: I still like it. It's the story of a group of English boys trapped on a deserted island. In an attempt to be rescued, the boys being to cultivate their own civilization with structure and orders. This all to quickly falls apart. Lord of the Flies is a short masterpiece of children's lives mirroring the adult sphere and, like so many other books lodged in the annuals of high school literature, too often is read at an age when a person is most likely to lack the understanding of the full implications of the book. A splendid read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'll admit i'm a late fan of this novel, never having the enjoyment of being assigned this in school. However i'm pleased in my adult life to possibly have a greater appreciation of it. This is truly a timeless story of the savage within us all and how even without a civilization, all different aspects of a society can be portrayed, even in the innocence of shipwrecked children. Ralph serves as our center, imperfect at best, yet constantly trying to do the greater good. Jack is his id, a leader by worth but not in ideology or action, our ego. Piggy is our brain and conscience, however fragile and annoyingly persistent. Roger is our wrath. An unleashed, unsympathetic, unbridled purely sickening rage. Simon is our curiosity and independence, He carrys our emotions and our feelings.The story itself begins with Ralph as the elected leader of the group of young children, however, the lead hunter, Jack eventually finds no solice in this decision and it becomes 2 camps at odds on an island. Thats the short version, which does no justice to the complexity of the story nor the incredible imagery given by the author. In this story, children do terrible things to children, yet the degeneration into savages is so gradual you can understand there blind lust for adventure and victory overall else, especially when that same idea has been behind every war known to man.I titled this review after a line from the novel, because i think it secretly underlined alot of what the story was about. Some Rules may not be fun, but the consequences without are far worse. This can be applied to so many aspects in life.

Stranded on the island after their plane crashes the boys must battle the harsh realities of human nature while they strive to be rescued from a ship. The book not only tells an exciting adventure story, though, it also describes on a deeper level, the thin line between civility and sanity, and violent insanity.The book opens with a group of children choosing a leader among themselves and deciding on a group of laws to live by. At first the boys get along fairly well with their appointed chief Ralph. When one of the older children named Jack, is not chosen leader and is very jealous, he begins his own rebellion and attracts many fellow rebels. As the story develops, Jack and his band begin to disobey the rules, and eventually form a completely separate community. As the two communities develop, Jack's group becomes more uncivilized, and eventually his group murders a member of the other group out of blind hate and insanity. AS the story progresses the conflicts between Jack and Ralph grow until the boys are rescued by a British ship.Through this story of innocent young children who become dangerous, Golding teaches the lesson that even young people, however innocent, can become insane as a result of a lack of authority, government, and civilized neighbors to guide them.By: Tyler Stewart"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"An airplane full of prep-school boys is attacked in the air, causing a crash.

William Gerald Golding created a master peice when he wrote &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot; This book has made me think beyond any normal person would think, I asked myself what would I have done on that island? Or what tribe would I have joined? Several questoins that will always be left unanswered.The boy's are flying home from military school and their plane crashes into the ocean. Only to find out that no adults have survived. They now have to live and depend on eachother to survive as hopes of ever seeing home descends dramatically. Now all eyes look upon the oldest to survive.The main character Ralph is a great leader, he's smart whitted has very good commmon sense and is a nice guy to the others. Ralph tries day in and day out to get him and the others off the island. Tension builds as more and more rebel from Ralph's orders and create a new tribe. I thought Golding did a great job with adding &quot;spice&quot; into this novel. Heat rises between the two tribes as the satanic Jack (the leader of the other tribe) gets so agressive death rises upon the kids.From the steller descriptions of the atmosphere to getting up close and personal with the kids, I think that this book deserves a 4 out of 5 only because the ending left me with a lot of unanswered questions.I highly recomend this book to any who likes thrills, adventure, humor or to someone who just wants a quick read.

He was an English novelist who won the Nobel Prize in 1983. He was educated at Marlborough Grammar School, which was where his father taught, and at Brasenose College in Oxford; he graduated in 1935. He became a schoolmaster in a school in Salisbury and joined the royal navy in 1940. After the invasion of France, he began teaching again until 1961. He published Lord of the Flies in 1954, Free Fall in 1959, The Spire in 1964, Darkness Visible in 1979, Rites of Passage in 1980 (won the booker prize) in addition to its sequels Close Quarters in 1987 and Fire Down Below in 1989. He was knighted for his accomplishments in 1988, and died 5 years later in 1993.The main idea that the author is trying to present deals with society. Golding is trying to convey that without the principles, conditions, or standards of society, individuals lose these values; without order, there can only be disorder. Thus, without rules, the ability to differentiate between right and wrong is lost, leading to chaos.The novel takes place during a war, which is unmentioned. A plane that is carrying a group of British students is shot down somewhere over the Pacific Ocean and crashes. The pilot dies and the children find themselves alive on this uninhabited island without any adults. Ralph, one of the oldest of the survivors, along with his friend Piggy, find a conch shell. Ralph blows the conch, and gathers the survivors and the novel begins from there. Events lead to the death of Piggy and Jack, one of the choirboys, to take control of the group of children. The boys start hunting Ralph, and Ralph runs to the beach where a naval officer arrives with a ship. The boys then get to go home after the officer thinks they have been playing games.As I said before, the author is stating: without the rules brought by society, the difference between right and wrong is clouded. I agree with the author because his novel was the perfect example of his message. It seems as though society is represented through a conch the characters carried around with them. After the conch was broken, society diminished from the island and the boys resorted to violent ways of attaining order; the hunters and the hunted. When the naval officer arrives, society's rules are again present on the island, and the boys become civilized again. This whole novel is a fair representation of what can go wrong without the standards of society. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a novel that deals with human nature and survival, because it so graphically and accurately depicts it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In high school, I remember thanking my lucky stars that I didn't have to read this. My friends all whined about it, and I considered myself lucky that I didn't have to endure the torture. Now that I've read this book, I feel like I missed out. I would have enjoyed reading and discussing this book in high school.Lord of the Flies is the story of a group of English boys who are planed wrecked on an deserted island. The oldest of the children are around 12-years-old, and the youngest around 6-years-old.It amazed me how so many of the boys didn't even realize what was giong on. I realize they are children and it probably seemed like an adventure, but it seems like they would have been aware that they had an accident. They seemed so &quot;unaware&quot; of what happened. At first, the boys saw their getaway from the adults as an adventure, but as the story progresses they start to delve into the &quot;darkness in their heart&quot;.I don't even know where to begin with this books. There are so many themes that could be adressed. You could look at humans innately animalistic nature (that doesn't make them much better than animals), you could look at how the boys &quot;society&quot; paralleled the war-stricken world they lived in, or you could ponder on the &quot;loss of innocence&quot;. Golding managed to pack many themes ranging from psychological matters to the relationship between people.I truly enjoyed this book. It's one of those books that you have to read more than once (or once very slowly) to grasp the many different elements presented to you. The only thing that I didn't like about this book is how Golding seemed to sometimes ramble about the landscape. Don't get me wrong. I wanted to know about the island, but he seemed to go on and on about one thing, and I would wonder if it would ever end."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies dives deep into and remains inside the collective psyche of a group of stranded children. The downward spiral they go into is gradual and frightening to behold. Certain children are representative of adult personalities found in the real world.You have Ralph, the moral compass. It can be argued that he was the only one on the island to hold true to what he believed in without fail. A natural leader, Ralph is chosen as chief by the other children at the beginning of the novel.Piggy is an ignored conscience. He says logical things that would help the group, but is made fun of because of his annoyingly nerdy, fat appearance. A lot of people probably know people like this.Jack is another leader. But unlike Ralph, he rebels and does what he wants. The other children see things in Jack that they inheritanly think is cool and want to emulate.When Jack becomes fed up with piggy and Ralph's logic, he starts a new camp. Eventually everyone but Ralph and Piggy are in Jack's group.Jack's clan becomes caught up in the idea of a 'beast.' The thing that does not exist exists in the minds of the children as an unseen evil that will attack at any time. The beast is the one driving force that keeps Jack and his group going, and it is enough to cloud there judgement, eventually driving them to kill.Ralph and Piggy hold strong while everything goes wrong. Jack and his group ignore their mistakes and pretend like nothing happened. Jack makes things up and his clan automatically excepts it as truth.The last moment of the book is a powerful climax. Jack and the childrens' primal savagry comes to a head as they chase Ralph through the forest. They have let go of all hopes and truths that the outside world contains. The fire on the island reflects off their eyes. But when they witness a rescue soldier dressed in uniform, everything that had built up inside them collapses. The fire leaves their eyes and they seem to immediately forget all the things that were important to them on the island. Ralph is the only one that seems to understand that finally it is over, and that he alone did not falter.This book has a great theme and a wonderfully frightening atmosphere. However, I did not particularly enjoy the style of writing, and I thought the symbolism was gratuitous. All in all, a worthy read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Are we born basically good? Or are we born basically bad? William Golding seems to have the answer. In this novel, The Lord of the Flies, we enter the a world of darkness and violence. All spawned out of the hearts of very young men.The bible says, \\"There in no one who does good, no not one.\\"And, \\"All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.\\"The hard fact of the matter is that man's natural bent is turned in toward himself.This self centeredness is a mild transgression...that creates all kinds of deeper more insidious types of evil in the hearts of men. What is stealing, but the selfish desire to possess something we can't buy? What is jealousy, but the selfish desire to be better than someone else? What is murder, but the selfish want to supercede someone else and take their place in the world from them? All of these evil desire spawn out of a natural inclination toward selfishness.In the Lord of the Flies we see the way in which a \\"normal\\" human being spirals quickly down into a life of total depravity. The \\"feel good\\" sociologists and psychologists will try to convince you that man is born basically good. But if you look at the actions of man and novels such as Golding's you will clearly see that man has the capability and natural inclination to turn utterly savage in a heartbeat.In this compelling story we meet a group of school boys stranded on a remote desert island. The boys work cooperatively for a time. Soon the trappings of society and order break down. The boy's rudimentary attempt at establishing a government crumbles and is rabidly devoured by the voracious appetite of self centeredness.There are two main power centers in this book:* Ralph/Piggy- who try to run a civilized society ruled by common sense and order.* Jack- the leader of a group of hunters who are ruled by sensual desires and to satify their basest needs.These two power centers clash brutally just like we do in our own minds, when we battle to keep down our strange desires. Like the concience battling the selish nature. Ralph/Piggy are a civilized concience trying to keep things orderly and good. While Jack and his hunters are untamed desire, ruled by their stomach and lust for violence.The hunters quickly decide to battle with the idea of organized society. They soon splinter off into a tribe ruled by the concept of \\"might makes right.\\" Ralph and Piggy try to hold onto the frayed edges of society and order only to be sucked into the endless void violence and uncontrolled selfishness.This book is timeless. You can easily apply it's message and themes throughout your life and experience. It plays out true everytime. True in that it frighteningly mirrors human nature unbound...Read it if you want to take a long hard look at yourself, and to examine your own thoughts and motivations in it's light. You may see how close we all are to becoming savages.Golding's novel can be very dark and disturbing... but let it take you in, by all means. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book starts out pretty quickly, and anyone reading it could probably catch on pretty quickly. There has been a plane crash, and the only survivors are a number of British boys ages 4 to about 14. Soon after they realize that they are on an uninhabited island, and that they must rely on themselves to survive and to get rescued. Upon arriving at the island, they have a group meeting, and when Ralph is voted chief of the island, Jack is left as an also-ran. That's something what I liked about this novel, the whole idea of children being captive on an island, living of pigs and fruit, and trying to maintain a civilization with order and authority all by themselves.However, I am surprised that I actually finished this book. This book is beyond the most boring and dull book in the world. It seems as if William Golding spend weeks on each paragraph and dialogue just to sound so 'absolutely intellectual to the highest extent'. From the looks of it, I'd say that he tried way too hard to impress his Oxford college friends. Unless if you are really into the symbolism or if you have a master's degree with an English major, then you would have been able to understand everything in this book. From every significant event, to every detail expressed about the children's actions or their surroundings, it is better to have Cliff Notes by your side if you wanted to catch every little segment of symbolism and importance."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I hated this book! It was full of blunt, unequivocal sybolism. I think that is one of the major problems; every few sentences you discover a new oddity that is supposed to directly link itself to the majority of underlying human disposition. However, I found that most of these allegories just didn't quite manifest as true on the whole. Golding has taken simple facts and drastically over-exaggerated them. My second point is that the characters seem underdeveloped and because of this I found myself wishing they would all die off and then just maybe a more interesting story could arise. Perhaps I had more trouble relating than others might because of the fact that i am not living in the time period of the book and that all of the characters were boys younger than myself. You see, I am in 10th grade and had to read this book last year for my english class (and by the way I read many, many books in my spare time). I found all of the main personae in this book caustically unlikable (as I said before I found myself wishing they were all dead). I also think it is sad that this book is so repetitive, through the whole book the troupe was splitting... then there was one, well the rest couldn't have that so they try to kill him and aside from actually saying who went with which group and when and why, the boys' monologue seemed to be 'what is the other tribe doing?', 'what will we eat tonight?', 'when and how can we be rescued?', etcetera. This did not fit well with the consistent symbolism and was not very well integrated into the story. Ok, well, all grumbling aside, the last two chapters were at very least full of action but of course i was dissapointed that they didn't all perish in the end of the book. I suppose though to each thier own, because this is definitely a love it/ hate it type of book. I do not recommend this to anyone who likes to relate to books in any way, but if you must read it at least it is fairly short..."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In my opinion, this is one of the most boring books ever written. Sure, Golding is trying to make a point about power's effect on social stability and structure, but it is lost in the mumbo jumbo style that he writes with. (The movie is also a pathetic depiction of this clich&eacute;-ish message.) There are so many books out there that deal with this same topic, and because of this common subject matter, a novelist needs to be truly inventive to create a real masterpiece. This book should not be ranked anywhere near the top 100 novels on the Modern Library Association's list of the best novels of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Perhaps it is because of my age, I'm nearing 23, that I find this work so, to quote someone from the board, atrocious.This book is absolutely boring and hadn't it been for my friend's reference, I would not have bought iT!!! The setting is an island; the cast is a bunch of stranded 6 to 13 year olds. The major characters are Jack Merridew (the bully), Piggy (the dweeb) and Ralph (The chief and someone in between).Lord of the Flies is a journey of civilised minds turning savage. Everything starts off hunky dory as the children realise they have the whole island to themselves and that no adult is there to govern their behaviour. Everything begins in a civil manner: a leader is chosen (Ralph), the hunters are elected (Jack is the leader of the hunters) and priorities are set (that of making smoke so that nearby ships may spot them, and obtaining meat).Of course, these are nascent minds deprived of a social structure, technology and a family system and so they eventually succumb to savagery.This could have been a fantastic psychological story; one that I feel could have attracted a reader from any generation. Unfortunately, more ink is spent on giving visual descriptions of the island and rocks and reeds than it is on the actual story. Coming to the descriptions, they are fantastic and perhaps the only feature of the novel worthy of merit, though I did think sometimes that Sir Golding should have let my imagination fill in some of the bits too.No matter how much sophistry one may use, no matter how much we may wish to incorporate Freud and Jung and whomever else, I feel the story rushed too quickly. Sir Golding did our work of visualising the island but burdened us with the responsibility of making all the important decisions regarding character developments.Take, for example, the killing of a beast/a pig. The reader was deprived of the feelings the youngsters (Jack, Roger etc) must have gone through when they were contemplating killing a beast, skinning it, stabbing it and running the sharp tools across its throat. They are children for God sake, they wouldn't just go out there and start killing. What would have driven children to kill another animal? Not much stress was placed upon hunger, the driving force behind all of this.This is just one example but the readers will find other examples too, as they go through the chapters.I feel this story could have tapped into something spectacular but with 120 thousand words...maybe not. Perhaps Sir Golding had youngsters as his target audience and so I would not come into this at all..."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies showcases the idea that we are empty canasters being filled by environments and echoes the haunting statement that children are capable of immoral acts. Perhaps it uses the Robinson Crusoe idea of isolation.I do think, as inspirational as Lord of the Flies has been, that it's an overblown, overrated affair and that Golding wrote other more powerful works, such as Darkness Visible. The problem for me lies in the difficulties of using children as main characters while writing from an adult point of view. Difficult to relate to, harder to realistically decribe a child's feelings and emotions because, psychologically, the author is on another level (even though the novel's fiction). On the other hand, Golding's style is attractively fluent in that you want to find out what happens next and that's always a good sign for a classic read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I have recently went through the extremely torturous chore of reading this novel in my eleventh grade English class. I hated this book so much that I went up to my teacher and told her exactly what I thought of this abysmal piece of work. Guess who wasn't too happy. I've heard so many great things about this book, so I just couldn't wait to start it. &quot;Yeah, Lord of the Flies, great!&quot; From the first page, I hated it. This book is so hard to follow. I read a page. Then I think to myself &quot;What the heck was that?&quot; I read the page again and only got a vague impression of what was going on and struggling to figure out what William Golding was trying to get across to the reader. Sure its possible to figure it out, but how can you really enjoy a novel if you have to strain your brain to be able to get the badly told story into your mind and keep it there. I disliked this book so much that I removed the cover and glued it on upside down before I gave it back to my teacher."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was assigned to read this book for english class and found this book grossly overrated. I don't have the slightest clue how this work of garbage ended up on the top 100 books written this century. Considering the amount of time a person wastes reading this book, say three hours, and the amount of people who have and will read it, all the time squandered away adds up to hours , days, years, centurys and eons that have been wasted for nothing. It's spellbounding."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"While Golding is correct in that there is a dark side to human nature, he is a fool for having created such an implausible plot.Boys of that age rarely attack people under any circumstances.Instaed, they use more subtle forms of psychological warfare.They could only have acted like that if they had had to eat each other to survive. To expect boys to shrug off social conditioning in such a short time is, however absurd."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Hated it.

Like the author. Purchased for a grand kid. Had it sent directly to them. I am satisfied"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"About every ten years, since the early 1980s, I've returned to this masterpiece. I'm fifty years of age, now, and it gets better with each reading. Mr. Golding's little book is not simply a story of young boys stranded on an island, but a complex allegory about males descent into primal urges and needs. The major characters, Ralph, Jack, Piggy and (somewhat) Simon, each represent certain aspects of the human condition. The story is brutal, spare in its prose and without a smidgen of humor. If you want to understand what is at the core of why people go to war or insist on seeing evil in others, \\"Lord of the Flies\\" spells it out for you in vivid horror. Simply one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A planeload of British schoolboys crashes on a desert island in the Pacific during the early part of World War II. No adults survive the crash and the boys settle in to \\"have some fun\\" and await rescue once their parents realize what's happened. Ralph, one of the older boys at around 13, is voted the leader of the group (which includes young children as well - \\"littluns\\" and \\"biguns\\"). Ralph is aided by a nearsighted and overweight boy callously nicknamed Piggy, who suggests he blow a conch shell to gather everyone together. Initially they all agree on some rules, and most help out, but there soon becomes a division in the group as another boy, Jack Merridew, challenges Ralph's rules.I was never assigned to read this in school and didn't really have much interest in it. All I'd heard was that it was a dark and disturbing tale, and something about the boys eating each other (they don't, though). But when my son was assigned it in school I thought I might read it, too, since he usually likes to discuss such things with me. And I'm glad I did - it was a fascinating story. (My son also loved it).My two favorite books areRobinson Crusoeand Jules Verne'sThe Mysterious Island- both stories of castaways - and the thought of being on an island and the way they overcome the challenges always fascinated me. In both those stories the castaways build up a society of sorts (even though it's only one person in Crusoe's case) that prospers and flourishes. Lord of the Flies is quite the opposite, where the group degenerates into tribes with disastrous results.But the characters add depth to the story, as well. Ralph, the natural leader, is so happy at the beginning that he stands on his head and sees it as a chance for fun, but recognizes the importance of building shelters and maintaining a signal fire. Piggy is the most intelligent boy, but is picked on by the others for his weight, glasses, and asthma. But he's the voice of reason and supports Ralph's leadership, and his glasses become essential for starting fires. Jack, on the other hand, while also a natural leader, soon grows to resent Ralph's authority and seeks a more blood-thirsty role for his group (of choirboys, ironically) as hunters. It's Jack's acceptance of violence that undermines the democratic order. But it's this idea of law and order that forms the basis for the book - without laws and rules society falls apart. When members fail to fill their role (such as keeping the fire going, or helping to build the shelters, etc.) it affects everyone - especially the most vulnerable (littluns). And without that order maintained by the rules, chaos results.I listened to the audio book read by the author, William Golding, and he offers a few interesting observations at the beginning and the end. I found it to be a very well-written book and full of meaning on multiple levels. It might be a bit dark and disturbing, but it was also compelling and I couldn't stop till I was done. I highly recommend it for those who appreciate a book with some depth."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was a very good book. Lord of the flies told a story about kids on a island and how they would surive. I liked how Golding showed how the kids struggled for survival. Golding also showed how most kids act and treat eachother. Overall it was a great book to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'm 14 years old, and I had to get this book for my 9th grade english class. It's one of those books that you can really get into, and it can make you think. It's a cool book, and it's pretty fun to read. I'd recommend it to anyone over 13 years old, because although it's a great book, it might not be the best book for a younger kid to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In Lord of the Flies, Golding explores how various aspects of our psychology drive our social behaviour. Psychological components thats play major roles in the story are: power-lust, shame and pride, social status and authority, mob-logic, goals and values, the conflict between immediate pleasure and long-term salvation, sense of morality, and various forms of fear.It's brilliant how Golding uses all these components of our nature to tell a convincing and enthralling story about how peace can degenerate into outright war.I must admit I felt the story was a little boring at the start. But once the drama began to unfold, I couldn't put it down.Whether you're after an entertaining read, or after a perceptive take on human nature, I'd recommend this one to you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"With total disagreeance to all of those who say that this book has little to no meaning, I'd like to counter that statemnt. Being a perfectly vivid book with deep meaning and descriptive plots, the author, William Golding, puts deep meaning to this book in a most subtle way that immature ro inadequate readers cannot truly appreciate or find.FOOTNOTES:The deeper meaning of this book ladies and gentlemen, is actually an allegory, a piece of writing that means or symbolises something by using character use or plots. In this book, the group of boys stranded on the island symbolises the human race. Jack is the major antagonist and symbol of the darkness and th interior rages and evilness that we hold within each and every one of us. Ralph symbolises the good within ourselves... But it's not my job to help you all with your reading homework."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"*Spoiler Alert* This review does give away the ending.In the book Lord of the Flies, Ralph and Jack are the two main characters struggling to gain leadership. They have many different views on how to best live on the island. Jack thought hunting would be the best way to survive on the island. Ralph's idea was to start a fire on the top of the island so that they might get the attention of any passing boat and be rescued. Ralph also wanted to keep things as civilized as possible while Jack preferred to start a tribe and live like the Indians would. After Jack captured some of Ralph's most loyal companions, Sam and Eric, Ralph goes to save them. When he gets there, the twins, Sam and Eric, are covering the side of Jack's island that Ralph approaches. Sam and Eric tell Ralph that everyone in Jack's tribe is going to hunt him, so Ralph runs after being chased across the island. He sees a Naval Officer on shore that rescues all the kids. The Naval Officer saw the fire and Ralph's civilized ways saves them all.Ralph's character is strong-hearted, smart and always trying to help others. Another character like Ralph is Zech from the book series A Land Remembered. Ralph is strong-hearted and always tries to stick through hard times just like Zech. Both are smart and both try their best to help others. Ralph will lead the kids of the island and help them off the island. Zech would rather ask for something for his horse Ishmael than for himself. The two characters would probably get along well if they could learn to respect each others opinion. If both were put on the island, they would help each other because the island converted to Jack's tribe since no meat was being collected. Zech would know how to capture pigs since he has herded cows with his dad and company.The Lord of the Flies is a book that shows how people push themselves to do what is best. Ralph tries to show the ways of civilization and how to get saved. Jack tries to find ways to get meat and take over the island. This book is great for testing your mind and for considering which decisions you would make. To figure out how the decisions the boys made played through, people should read the book and find out.Overall, one through five, with a five being the best, I would give this book a four. I would recommend this book to a reader that needs to know in perfect detail the setting because this book is great at describing the setting. The book also has some long chapters, so if you do not like the author giving two paragraph chapters this is a good book for you. It is also great for readers that like adventure and some action. This is not a great book if you like romance and love stories because this book doesn't have any romance at all. Overall, I would recommend this book for many young readers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I really enjoyed this book; although, I would not recommend it to the faint of heart. William Golding's Lord of the Flies is the story of a group of school boys that crash land on an island and are stranded with no adult supervision. This story that begins so innocently soon takes a turn for the worst. At first glance this novel is a story of children gone bad but with careful thought it becomes a concept much bigger than the children themselves.Many say this is about the psychology of children when no one is around to supervise them but I feel this explains, through a story about children gone wrong, the necessity for a central government. I think the story, that seems very crude, is actually our society and history in a nutshell. A group of people do like there government, so they break away. This in my opinion is a fairly simple concept but put into a story people think of it as some horrific thing. However, it is a fairly natural reaction. Whether or not this is how William Golding intended it to be understood, I think this is not supposed to be a story of children that go stir crazy on an island but a depiction of society.I definitely think this should be taught in schools. Firstly, it is an idea that most children have thought about, and it is an interesting story that captures the minds of the readers. Secondly, it gives you a different perspective of our society as a whole; something that seemed so normal but put into a story is actually a scary thought. This is a very valuable lesson to be taught and I believe all people should be exposed to different perspectives."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had some issues with the e-book when I changed the font size. The last paragraph on the page would either repeat itself on the next page or there would be missing text. But when I changed it back to the presets, everything worked fine."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a novel filled with imagery. Probably the most significant of these symbols was the conch. The conchs characterized several things, including independence and stability on the island, and possibly, even for a short time, harmony between the boys. One of the most motivating characteristics to the conch was the fact that Piggy couldn't use it. This shows a deficiency of control or power on Piggy's part. As the tale progressed, this routine shrank more and more, until the isle was a dwelling of broad chaos and mayhem.I love its break down and build up in society. I love books like this and enjoy the psychological thinking that must be modified in order to do this. I find as I grow older the simple way a belief system can be created in a community...is fascinating. Lord of the Flies is THE most classic example of this procedure."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I hadn't actually read this book, just seen the movie so I decided to go back and dive in. unfortunately though the book does seem to be more heart pounding and graphic, the narration really takes away from what is a terrific spotlight on what civility really means and how little it takes to break it down. The acting in the movie was really good comparatively to the trite contrived redundant dialog in the book but the slightly more adult oriented graphicness and realism of the books plot like more than makes up for it.A must read, but don't know if it's really worth going over more than once."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book was excellent.

The book was sent in just a couple of days after purchasing and was in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I've been a teacher for over seven years now but only in the past year have I been getting more and more interested in the history of pedagogy. Through my master's studies, two names have struck me as both progressive and extreme: A.S. Neill (1883-1973) and Anton Makarenko (1888-1939). While progressive education may be not suitable for nationwide schools, some lessons gleamed from the case studies can be implemented. Before reading Lord of the Flies, I channeled my humanistic educational theories to sort out the misconception of the brutality of childhood through the theories of Neill and Makarenko.Rear cover synopsis:\\"A plane crashes on a desert island and the only survivors, a group of schoolboys, assemble on the beach and wait to be rescued. By day they inhabit a land of bright fantastic birds and dark blue seas, but at night their dreams are haunted by the image of a terrifying beast. As the boys' delicate sense of order fades, so their childish dreams are transformed into something more primitive, and their behavior starts to take on a murderous, savage significance.\\"------------Inspired by Scottish author R. M. Ballantyne'sCoral Island(1858), William Golding turned the tables on the way children react when left by themselves. In Coral Island, three boys were stranded in the south pacific and got a long quite well... until the adults intervened: pirates, inhabitants, and missionaries. By themselves in their childish world they led an idyllic life, but conflict arose when they were confronted by world of the adults. Golding takes a different stand on this theme and sees the children as hopeless without adult supervision; the nature of the child as a barbarian.Golding is a Cornish author while Ballantyne was a Scottish author. These are facts often better left to historians, but one more character needs to come into play in order to reaffirm my position: the Scottish progressive educator A. S. Neill. Neill believed that children carried the same tacit ideals of what it means to be a good human being; children have the innate ability to govern themselves and discipline themselves. When adults assume their self-appointed role as governors over children, Neill believed that the children were then subjected to all the psychoses in the adult world, which steals the essence of childhood away from the children. Neill's Summerhill School offers an education like this.As an educator myself, I read The Lord of the Flies through the eyes of A. S. Neill and his Soviet counterpart Anton Makarenko, both believing in child self-sufficiency. Much of the symbolism and many of the incidences on the island can be attributed to the psychological distress the boys endured when under the rule of the adults and how some struggle to hope with their childhood nature. The conflicts arising from the adult-ish characters (Ralph and Piggy) contrast the overbearing childish attitudes of the rest (Jack and Roger) with the \\"littluns\\" displaced from the power struggle between Ralph and Jack. Though frightened and largely ignored, the \\"littluns\\" are the only children on the island to be spared the awkward suspension of responsibility between childhood and adulthood. The rest are victims of their inadequate understanding of their adulthood misconceptions and their own miscarriage of upholding their childhood values.The central symbol of adulthood misconception is the conch, a tool used to gather around the subordinates like the children experienced at the airfield when they were gathered by the megaphone. While initially successful, and with much disdain displayed by Jack, the conch is accepted as a symbol of unity and law. However, the mere idea of using the conch to symbolize the megaphone shows that Ralph and the children are ill at ease with their new found freedom. Abiding by the rules of adulthood they experienced in school has ill equipped them for the freedom they should be experiencing on the island--a time for growth, a time for the children to be children.To see the awkwardness of the life they were experiencing in England (under the yoke of adult governors) versus the life they can experience on the island (where the children can be children, even Golding writes in Chapter Four, \\"...the northern European tradition of work, play, and food right through the day, made it impossible for them to adjust themselves wholly to this [the island's] new rhythm\\" (74).Piggy and Ralph both obviously carry the largest burden of adulthood to the island. Their intrinsic need for conformity and law drive a stake through the fabric of the childhood experience for the rest of the children. When a schism arises between Ralph and Jack, it's Jack's childish notion of having fun that tears him away from Ralph's sect; Jack's need to experience the hunt, to have what he considers fun, establishes the rift which separates his cave-dwelling clan (what boy doesn't want to build a fort?) from Ralph's stricter beach sheltered clan. This schism between the clans of adulthood and childhood manifests itself in hopelessness and savagery.The savagery experienced through the eyes of Ralph is that through the eyes of an adult. The children, the clan of Jack's cave, simply see their bloodlust actions as uninhabited self-governance--those who disallow their childish ambitions are persecuted, albeit beyond Neill's and Makarenko's idea of kind justice. Even then, the savagery isn't realistically experienced by all of Jack's clan with one death being attributed to honest fear and another death being attributed by the action of one. The ultimate hunt at the end is seen as bloodthirsty through the eyes of Ralph and Roger, whereas only Roger really sees the violence as necessary to regain the equilibrium of his clan's childish motives. Jack is Roger's vehicle of madness, his key to the door of his warped fantasies... adult fantasies not shred among the rest of Jack's clan (what happens to the twins at the end of chapter 11?).The fear of adulthood manifests itself with the arrival of the dead airman. When the children are begging for the presence of an adult, one arrives in corporal yet corrupted form, and the children vilify the corpse. They assure themselves there is no beast yet they later confirm its very existence. This fear stays with them even after the corpse itself is flung to sea. At the conclusion there's an air of unwelcome acceptance, calm hostility, or belittling realism.So, the savagery of childhood that is commonly associated the Lord of the Flies isn't part and parcel with childhood itself; rather, the brutality is only a symptom of one character's (Roger) nonacceptance of childhood and the most of the scenes of violence can be explained by the children's inadequate understanding of both their own childhood nature and their misconceptions of the adult world which they try to implement, failingly, in their own world. It's not childhood that's brutal, it's the misconstrued conveyance of adulthood to children (through education, advertising, entertainment, etc.) that is manifested in the child's actions that is brutal. Children aren't born with hate... they're taught."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is perhaps my personal favorite book of all time. So much is symbolized within the novel that it is truly mindboggling (I did spell that wrong, dont judge). Now I do believe that this novel is not for persons under 15 (thats my age). On the surface this is an interesting novel that tells of several boys decent into madness and savagery. This is all a younger child will see. They will also see pointless violence and deaths. However, in this novel, everything is done for a purpose (how it hates me to say those words dont ask why). Each character symbolizes something or someone, each place, each scene has its own importance that truly adds too the novel. Another complaint is that the novel is boring. I do not really understand how it is boring. It is thoroughly intriguing and entertaining. Another complaint is that the novel is altogether too gory. I personally believe this is an overstatement, however i do read fantasy and sci-fi commonly so I do have some experience with gore and am not particularly bothered by it. For some reason i feel like those reviewers typically enjoy romances. The final overall complaint is that the novel is too dark. This i cannot really fault this argument, for the novel does border on mild horror at some points (psycologically). Yet it all is important in desplaying the darker side of human nature. Overall this is a great novel, that deserves acclaim even if read in English class. i recommend reading it alone before you read it with your teacher. Yet this is my opinion."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The cover of my copy of Lord of the Flies says that over 6,855,000 copies are in print, and my copy is old. Countless thousands more have likely been printed by now. Hosts of school children have read this book for class (or at least skimmed an online site describing the book), but I hadn't even opened the cover until this year.Lord of the Flies is a classic in every sense of the word. It is popular, it is memorable, and it incorporates a number of elements essential to a great story.For those not familiar with the book, Golding creates a world in which a group of schoolboys are stranded on an island, alone and without adults, and Golding depicts the rapid decline from civilized friendship to animal behavior as the boys realize they may never escape. Unlike the children in Ender's Game, these boys weren't selected for any striking intelligence, and unlike Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, Ralph and Piggy, the protagonists here, never achieve greatness by lifting themselves to a greater moral height.No, on this island, the fair-skinned British boys quickly regress into tanned savages, trading their humanity for survival. One boy, Ralph, becomes the early leader by group vote, and he struggles to maintain teamwork and civilized behavior among the group. But Ralph quickly finds that the deepest instincts of the boys drive them not to civility but to savagery.William Golding wrote this book nearly sixty years ago in a different intellectual climate. Today, characters aren't written with a natural depravity; they're written with an innate potential for greatness. America loves Katniss Everdeen because she went from ignoble poverty to national fame and leadership. The world first fell in love with Harry Potter for his innocent greatness, not because Rowling peered into the darkness of his soul.Golding, however, perceives that human nature contains more than sunshine and untapped potential; he admits our natural weaknesses and predilections without writing narrowly depraved characters. The boys are compelling not because they fit into our preconceived stereotypes but because they mirror the dual nature we find within ourselves. The boys first taste desperation, praying that adults will save them, knowing they need the outside help. Slowly, as time passes, the boys attempt to create a small society, as they realize salvation may not ever come. But each, in their own time, begins to taste the darker temptation to hunt and kill rather than cooperate and share.As a result of that progression, darkness and death mark the latter half of Lord of the Flies. The story is not depressing, as Golding often understates the violence and weight of the story, but the book does not provide satisfaction for anyone looking for an hour or two of light escapism in its pages. I enjoyed the story and see the benefit to familiarity with a classic tale, but I closed the book with a shudder. Golding has painted a picture of humanity outside society, and the reality of depravity is not a pretty thing."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Great preview into what William Golding thought of the children of his generation. Truly makes you think about how things can change; are our children more compassionate now, even boys, or would they succumb to the violence and societal pressures of living in a self governed system, like these boys did?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I've heard a lot about The Lord of the Flies throughout my life, but this was my first time reading it. It was surprisingly short and fast;it didn't quite live up to the hype in my mind but it was still well worth a read. It certainly can be interpreted as an allegory for the base nature of man and especially of the power of 'the mob.' Overall I thought Golding's descriptions and the way he kept the narrative moving was very effective; the characters evolved from typical schoolboys into something fierce, raw and unscrupulous. However I felt that I needed more character development and background in order to really care about these characters and therefore feel fully horrified at what happens to them."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was a fairly interesting book, which is VERY famous. A group of schoolboys is stranded on an uncharted island when a plane crashes. At first, with no adults around, they celebrate their freedom and hope for adventure. They can do anything they want this far from the civilized world. And they are indeed far from the civilized world, for the situation quickly deteriorates into madness, when strange howls echo in the night, order collapses, and terror begins to grip everyone. The hope of being rescued gradually fades as well. This book had a very interesting premise, and I particularly liked one instance. Throughout the book, the boys are lighting a fire, hoping that the smoke will signal a passing boat to come rescue them. But then as no boat comes, Ralph, the \\"leader\\", gradually has to be reminded what the smoke was for in the first place, by \\"Piggy\\", one of the other boys. It was quite chilling. As is the slow descent into madness and uncertainty.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I liked this book because it had a good plot line: A group of boys stuck on an island, and their society is breaking down. This book contains a lot of symbolism, yet I liked it because it is fairly easy to read and doesn't get boring. It is interesting enough that it holds your attention the whole way through.It has a lot of violence, and I don't recommend it if you are sqeamish. It is very graphic. It is mostly easy, but some places get a little confusing. It isn't the happiest book ever written; it gets sort of depressing. I would say it is 10th grade level, because that is why I read it in the first place."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Way cool! I am going to start teaching Lord of the Flies right after fall break. I have been previewing this audio version on may long drive to and from work (about 30 minutes each way.) I was so impressed with Golding reading his own book! I must say I cried at the end when Ralph breaks down---Golding made this book come to life! I also like Golding's commentary at the end regarding the meaning of the book. I would tell you, but you need to hear it for yourself!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book while I was in high school and thought it was just OK. I just reread it on my own and now that I'm an adult, it touched me more deeply. The bullying and cruelty these boys exhibit, the casual schadenfreude that escalates into violence, had a greater impact on me this time around. I'm glad I reread it, appreciated the message, but did not enjoy it. Some facts of life aree too awful and I prefer not think of them."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I couldn't remember if I had read this book at an earlier age so I downloaded it and read it again. I enjoyed this book. What can I say that hasn't already been said. If you haven't read this book, I encourage you to do so. This isn't a book you want to miss."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book begins a little fuzzy, but by the end of the first few pages the explanation for the boys' current situation is revealed: A plane carrying many British schoolboys crashed on a tropical island, and only some amount of them survive. There are no adults. Sounds like your typical survival-on-a-desert-island beginning, right?In a way, it is. For the most part, this book details the boys' struggle to survive under the leadership of Ralph and his intelligent friend Piggy. Ralph attempts to lead the boys under a sort of democratic establishment, and it works, for a while. But the \\"model boy\\" of the school, Jack Merridrew, gains a crazed obsession with hunting. Soon his target becomes a \\"Beast\\" of the island and, aided by his fellow hunters, begins committing criminal acts such as beatings, robbery, and murder in an attempt to \\"kill the beast\\". The boys desert Ralph and Piggy and join Jack's society of madness, believing in the misguided leadership of Jack. However, all that's well ends well, as all the boys are eventually rescued. That's the end of the story, right?Wrong. The true meaning of the book is much, much deeper than that. What you thought was an island adventure is revealed to be an insightful look into the reasons why men do what they do, why certain societies fail, how fear and darkness penetrates man, and what humans do when they are desperate. It also explores the boundary between human reason and animal instinct, all on the brutal playing field of adolescent competition.This book will appeal to adventure-seekers and philosophers alike. It is gripping enough to hold your attention and fascinating enough that you will still recall it months later."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I love this book, but I wasn't halfway through the introduction when I realized how painful it would be to have the author read it to me. He sighs and breathes heavy in the middle of sentences, speaks in a monotone voice, and makes all the characters sound the same, which makes it hard to tell who is saying what during the book's argument scenes.Overall, great story that deserved a professional voice actor to read it - somebody who could have made the story come alive. Any nuance the author could have added through his own insight into the story was lost in the lackluster presentation."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was read by the author which normally can be a concern. However he was an excellent reader and all in all a good listen.

A group of school boys land on a isolated island because of a plane crash. The boys are happy because they have no adult supervision. The boys quickly generate some rules and group leaders.

I would recommend this books to anybody who is entering the 9th grade."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A group of British private schoolboys ranging in age from six to twelve end up stranded on a deserted Pacific island after a storm-caused plane crash amidst an atomic war. Handsome, twelve-year-old Ralph; his on again, off again sidekick, brainy, bespectacled, asthmatic, husky \\"Piggy;\\" and tall, skinny redheaded hunter-extraordinaire Jack aka \\"Merridew,\\" who has become the de facto leader of a group of choirboys, are among the major characters. They vote Ralph in as chief, apparently due only to his looks and ability to locate and sound a conch shell. The survivors survey the island, set rules for speaking during meetings, start a signal fire, and build shelters. Ralph makes a proclamation: they (p 35) \\"want to have fun\\" and \\"want to be rescued.\\" Things rapidly spiral out of control after the children split into two groups: one aligned with Ralph, the other, with Merridew. The adversarial relationship between the tribes worsens as does the members' behavior. With a fire gone out of control, the presence of wild pigs, the appearance of a ship, an unwelcome guest, and rumors of a beast, the boys live in a constant state of unease, worry and fear. Eventually, they are forced to choose: hunt or be hunted. Their world becomes increasingly savage and chaotic up to its perfectly written, climactic ending. Lord of the Flies is a terrific, truculent, troubling tale. Also good: I am Legend by Richard Matheson."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book Lord of the Flies, written by William Golding is a very well written book. The genre of the book is historical fiction. The setting of the book is on an uncharted island during the WorldWarII era. the book is mainly about a couple of schoolboys who crash landed on an uncharted island that they are stranded on without any adults. I think that the theme of the book was to show that society cannot run correctly because of the natural, sinful nature of man. Some of the main characters are Piggy, Ralph, and Jack. Piggy and Ralph first meet when they wake up next to each other after the landing. Piggy is a chubby, little bossy kid, while Ralph on the other hand is a mellow, relaxed cool kid. They call together all of the kids that are on the island and they meet a boy named Jack. Jack is a stuck up kind of kid, who is a prefect at his school and a captain of his choir class. While the short lived bond of Piggy and Ralph's friendship grows weaker. Jack and Ralph, who are both the leaders, seem to get along very well. Piggy and Ralph were the two friends, but when a person like Jack shows up, a more strong, leader-like and Ralph-like kid is up to be Ralph's friend, Ralph quickly ignores Piggy and makes Jack his new friend. But as Jack and Ralph's friendship grows the contest for leadership grows even more. Even though the kids voted Ralph as cheif, Jack is starting to show that he could be even a better cheif. I believe this because all Ralph has ever cared for is be keep a fire going and keep the hope of being rescued alive. While Jack, a more ferocious boy, focuses on staying alive most of the time and loves to hunt for the hard to get meat. I think that this book is best recommended for older teenagers because most of the words in this are very hard to understand and there are some violence in the book. The book, Lord of the Flies, is a very interesting book. Even though it has some very confusing words and hard to understand material, it should be given a try."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I just finished reading Lord of the Flies in my gr. 11 English class and I wish that this book was not required to be read in school, because I do not recommend it. Although it was thought provoking, and at times you really felt for the characters, it was too grim a look at mankind. I entirely disagree with Golding's idea of mankind being inherently evil, and that made it hard to get into the book and also made it hard to believe. This was fairly well written, but I have read books that challenged my intelligence more. It is obvious that Golding wrote this book as a way of getting his point across to people, and you can see this because the reading comprehension is pretty simple and most people can breeze through it. I felt that it was borderline propaganda, and I actually regret that i have read it, but I didn't have much choice in the matter."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a worthwhile book that could have used an editor with just a little more aggressiveness. The first hundred ninety-nine pages are excellent. Golding has wonderful insight into the human condition, and he applies it with rare grace and tact. And then we get to the final page, which would be best ripped out. It's impossible to go into detail without spoilers, so suffice to say this novel's ending is the single largest letdown in all of literature. Disappointing enough to knock a full star and a half off the rating. ***"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was a well-written book. I will admit that. But it was boring for most of the book. SO you think I contradicted myself? Okay, it's well written in a sense that it has good language use, and lots of symbols (I seemed to like it more after we talked about it in class for English), but when I was reading it on my own over the summer, I thought it was EXTREMELY boring, and I could not concentrate and would have to read chapters again and again because it was one of those books that your eyes are reading but your brain isn't absorbing. It only got interesting until (sorry to spoil it), but when people start killing each other, and that was about chapter 10 (out of 12).THIS BOOK was rather DULL but if you like symbols and such then read it for the sake of that, but NOT for ENTERTAINMENT purposes."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am very disappointed about the book &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot; I am currently reading it (I'm almost to Chapter 8 now), and I've found it extremely boring from just about the beginning of the book to where I am now. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; was assigned to me as a summer reading assignment (I'm taking English Honors at school, so we're expected to read books like &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;), but I think it was a poor choice as a book for students to read over the summer. I have heard that the ending is the most interesting part. I surely hope so. I'm finding it hard to pick this book up and finish reading it. The book probably could have been about half as long as it is. How many times did the author describe the pink rocks or the way the sun was setting? In Chapters 6 and 7 all that is discussed is finding the beast that the boys are looking for. We as readers at this point know that there really is no beast! This part is definitely too drawn out. There is way too much description in this book. I usually enjoy imagery in writing (it allows the reader to envision the scene just as the writer did when he or she was writing the book), but I think this book has so much imagery that it is actually confusing. I even find the dialogue confusing sometimes, because I'm not sure who's talking at certain points. I could go on and on about my opinions of this book. I really hope that this book gets a lot more interesting soon, because it's really boring me!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the innocent childhood of boys, the difference between savagery and society need to not only be learned but used. In the parallels of adulthood and childhood mistakes must be made, which shows the other side of humanity. Boys' contemplation of adults often differ from their intellect but change to their natural instinct. When intellect fails and is replaced by instinct, survival gets lost in the fray of primal needs of power and the hunt.In this book, intellect struggles to survive amongst the power of instinct. The decision of survival can last only as long as the next idea pierces the thought of those who have any power. This theory proves why those chosen to rule must make decisions carefully, even if he needs to rob the use from a born leader. In this book reason turns into overreaction. The lesser people can still instigate fear among the powerful; an example of overreaction this book has to present. The largest problem is that overreaction has consequences. From fear comes destabilization. Once destabilization comes, uprising follows.This book shows how conspiracies children think up can show in even the most civilized society in this era. Dissent is common. This book proves that responsibility can be found only among the responsible, and when left to rule the irresponsible make mistakes. If modern society discarded religion, law, technology, and sophistication, what would happen? Would we soon find reason among instinct? No. We are animals; as are every living creature on this planet, and we would act accordingly. Our primal instinct would guide us through another period of time until reason is found and right is separated from wrong.If we were to go back to a primal state would we be allowed to call ourselves superior to other men? If law is not upheld than man is nothing more than an animal. William Golding probably made this book to enlighten the human race that primal instinct does eventually override every natural human sense.After a plane full of English children falls onto an uninhabited island two boys rally the children by blowing into a conch shell, making a harsh note that the other kids investigate. After a short assembly the boy who found the conch, Ralph, is chosen to be chief, over Jack Merridew, the leader of a choir. Ralph decides to make Jack and his choir the hunting committee. He did not see the mistake in this. Ralph naturally would be a rebel, because of his natural leadership.They decide upon a few hunters to maintain a fire so they could signal for a ship or plane to see so they could be rescued. A few days after, the primal instinct takes over ensnaring the bored, scared, unruly, and senseless into a need for the hunt and envy for fresh meat. Almost the only thing the hunters talk about is their own personal lusts of blood. This lust soon carries the hunters to hunt, leaving the fire to flicker out of existence. This was a huge loss because as the fire died a boat passed by and left no one but the hunters to blame that they would not be rescued. After a short shouting match, the tides turn leaving Jack and Ralph to become enemies. Days later Jack becomes unruly and says that he should replace Ralph as chief. The tribes yearn for the hunt and want to become savages and use their primal instinct, but obediently the people vote in favor of Ralph, further angering the already angry Jack causing him to leave to create his own tribe.A few hours pass and Ralph soon realizes that some people are missing. They take Jack's words to mind and know that the boys have left to join the other tribe. Soon more people leave and he realizes the only ones left in his tribe are Sam, Eric, Piggy, and himself. He knows that not much can be hoped for in the passing dawn and he prepares himself for an eternity on this island. They have too few people to maintain the fire and that means they can't be rescued. He looks on to what his future will be and remains uncertain.You'll have to read the book to know what happens next. This is an amazingly philosophical book. This outstanding book needs some time to really understand but I found, and hope you will find reason in this book which may compel you to enjoy it as it did for me. I find this book interesting and enjoyable, which is why I rate it a 4.4. If you find interest in intellectual writing you may decide to read this book as I did."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After reading this book, I think William Golding is a sick, sick man.

Yet this book is more then just a book of Crusoe survival. In fact, this could be Golding's sociological view of youth when tested. Of course, this is solely fiction.Either way though, this story of cohesion and division can touch one, but then it can also frighten. Now whether that skill is attributed to the plot or Golding's writing is debatable, although it's probably both.Like I said though, this is a classic for all, espesically the middle-schooler."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book for English Class.

A wonderfully crafted, resonant work, not of hope or warning, but simple and dark statement of the way things are, have been, and will be, an exploration of the nature of the world and those that inhabit it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The story starts out showing how children are left to fend for themselves and try to make adult decisions. A fire is started and kills one of the children, showing how no matter what the circumstance a child is left to act like it only knows how to. The counch shell is also introduced and will be a &quot;telephone&quot; for the children and also a sign of power later in the novel. I wasn't to impressed with the slow developments of the first 2 chapters, there was alot of focus put on the children and not enough time spent describing the setting. The characters were highly detailed. Piggy is introduced almost as the adult figure, while there is Ralph who is more the neutral party, and Jack who is the complete opposite of Piggy. They introduce Simon to be like the conscience figure of the group stating how the only beast on the island was the boys themselves. It seems as though Golding attempts to show us almost a battle of good vs evil though out the book until the final chapter as we see the counch being destroyed and Piggy the only one with intelligence being killed. Ralph dodges numerous attacks through out the end chapters to be saved by a navy officer who comes to the island after seeing the smoke. I would have liked to see something happen at the end to the boys who were part of Jacks tribe, or at least see something happen to Jack. The story ends with alot of answered questions in my mind on what happens to the boys, having something to show us what later because of the boys would have been very nice. The story was fairly easy reading with some exception to the early chapters. There was a definate lack of interesting material. The later chapter from the point of the beating death of Simon to the last chapter was much more action packed and really does a good job of filling your imagination. I would have given it a higher rating but the slow begin is why I give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book Lord of the Flies in my opinion is a very interesting book to read.

It is however complicated to the under educated person, so i can understand why some people could find it a little boring. The book took the time to develop the key charictors while still leaving some of the charictors to the imagination. Golding really does have a great imagination."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Takes place on a deserted island, a group of boys struggle to survive the harsh nature of the island and moreover,their own avarice. This masterpiece reveals the natural instinct of every living thing under desperate circumstances; the symbolic factor is too strong for even Golding himself to fully grasp. From the glasses of Piggy to the wild &quot;beast&quot; , this is an excellent choice for all readers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is exceedingly well-paced and well-written, almost tailor made for class discussions. However, I didn't like it for a simple reason: its message is profoundly disturbing. Golding's view of mankind may be correct, which is even more scary."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I saw the movie and read the book. I thought it was realistic but horrible. It is gruesome, and the details of the killings are unnecessary. I rated 2 stars because it was a realalistic and made good conversation in my religion class. Send your comments of my review to my email please."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is one of those book with many hidden meanings that you need to think about while reading. Unlike many books done like this, Golding accomplished it well. The only reason I didn't give this novel 5 stars was because of the unrealistic way the author presented the boys in the novel. If all these boys had landed on an island, at the age under 10, with their parents dead, would they not breakdown? You cannot expect children after this traumatic experience to immediately call order and behave accordingly. Yes, I agree with the chaos part, but that should have came first, then the order. That is what would happen with real children in real life. Thank you"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I found this book to be very well written. I did not want to put it down until I had finished it. However, I don't like violence very much and there were scenes in this book that were so vividly described that I wanted to close my eyes. Anyone who has read a book knows this doesn't help very much.Overall, I found it very thought provoking in its exploration of the nature of man. I wonder if women would behave differently?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was surprisingly a great book. I expected a dull and dragging book which is probably the exact opposite of what I got. It was gripping and it kept me reading. It can get boring ,of course, when your English teacher feels the need to analyze every line. That did help, in the long run, for me to understand the depth of the book. I'd reccomend this to anyone who enjoys reading."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I just finished reading this book in my 8th grade English class. Golding is a fantastic writer, but the book was not my type. There were to many gory detales, but it really made me think. I would recommand this book to anyone who likes to really think about what they read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is an amazing book that has everything a good book should have. Golding shows the progression of the kids in the book with brilliance. This book is disturbing, so get ready to brace yourself, and try not to rip the book apart. If you want to read a great book, definetly pick this book up."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I never read Lord of the Flies in high school, so, I finally got around to it, near to my 30th birthday. It is a novel of great depth and symbolism. The characters all represent a portion of leadership: Jack- the warmonger; Ralph- the diplomat; and Piggy- the brain behind the diplomat. Some may say that this book is just a cynical view of human nature. But I believe it is just realistic. After all most of the boys that Jack scares into becoming a part of his tribe are young and therefore ignorant. This shows how most despots keep control, by denying their population with any real higher education (except for the privileged few) and intimidating them to stay in line. The outcome of the novel is tragic, yet a lesson in survival and civility: when might makes right, there is no progress and only fear."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"...The main character is Ralph.He is a military boy that gets stuck with other military boys.On their way home from the military the plane crashes on a island.None of the boys know what to do,some cry.There are about 16 boys.Ralph wants to get rescued the most.There is one boy named Piggy whos overweight and wears glasses.

This book is for thinkers that like peering into the savage part of our nature. Besides, it's about seriously messed up half naked British boys. This book has a great plot because it's about a bunch of psychotic kids killing others. This book was extremely intersting and had great symbolism. I gave this book 4 stars because it was a really good book but not the best."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is, in my mind, one of the greatest novels in the Englsh language. It is an errie combination; it delves into the dark philosophical content of Heart of Darkness in context of a childhood adventure story reminiscent of Peter Pan, and it blends the two perfectly. This confuion of innocence and evil adds a singular flavor to the book, which simultaneously chills and entertains the reader. Lord of the Flies is an absolute must-read for anybody of relatively mature age who is interested in examining the animal side of human nature. The book is thought-provoking, memorable, beautifully written, and entertaining. It carries my unqualified recommendation."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this is most definetely the best book i have been required to read in high school. \\"lord of the flies\\" symbolizes the evil within everyone of us and survival with no rules. this novel is defenitely worth reading- but not for children. this book hints at a different form of reality- where there are no rules, no compassion...only survival. it will make you doubt yourself and help you to see things differently. it's a very enlightening and insightful book, and i loved it!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Imagine you are stranded on an island with a large group of boys. What would you do? Well, that is exactly what the boys in The Lord of the Flies have to ponder. Four leaders emerge, but in different strengths and the best leader is elected. One leader knows what the people want, another one knows what is good for everybody and what should be done, another one is always helpful, and the last one who is elected knows what the people want and also what is good for them. The story starts out well with all of the characters loving the place, but then it is turned upside-down. There are divisions in people and what they should do which starts discrimination. Each group becomes independent and hates each other. Lord of the Flies represents every character as a real life person in a real society and shows how we are all born evil. Our society will never work out because of our human nature and our natural sin. The end, or the termination of society is extraordinarily gripping and powerful and dreadfully true. This book should be read and analyzed as it is read. In other words, this book is not to be read as an adventure book, for it is a very bad one, it is read to portray a very potent theme."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you have ever read &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell,then you will enjoy &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is a book that demonstrates how society deals with war, and also serves as a warning bell to society to show people what could happen if they don't react more civilized in a time of crisis. Golding symbolized this situation with children stranded on an island forced to live by themselves and under their own rules. This is a great book if like political/war novels or if like Goerge Orwell since both authors deal with the same topics."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is William Golding's best-written novels of all times. He captures your mind and attention right from the beginning and keeps you reading till the end. His descriptions and attitude helps you visualize a mental picture of the characters. It is extraordinary how Golding grabs you with his words and makes you feel like you are sucked into the novel. Golding's novel is a combination of horror, drama and adventure all in one. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and in suspense on what will happen next. The author makes you firmly hold the book as you read just in case something jumps out at you.It is a brilliant story about young boys stranded on an island after a horrible plane crash. They have to learn to survive on an uninhabited island with no adult supervision. It is left up to a group of boys to establish order and a civilization until they are rescued.Golding shows symbolization of Christianity through his character Simon, a choirboy. Golding moves on to show you evil also exist within the group through Jack and his followers. This group clearly demonstrates cruel and devilish intentions.It is such a descriptive piece that you can visualize and get a scents of feeling about the island and the characters. You feel the events as if they were occurring right before your eyes. It is spectacular how Golding keeps the reader interested until the end and even after that the reader wants more. I recommend every one who loves adventure and a thriller to read Lord of the Flies. It is an interesting novel that sends out messages about human ways to live life, along with the message of evil verses good."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am quite sure that I skipped this book way back in school when I was asked to read it for english class...well I was mistaken. 10 years post high school I finally decided to give it a try and I was wonderfully surprised...Not only was this a great adventure story of a group of 30 young 'castaways' who forage, fight, and fail to form any semblance of order, but it is also a great symbolic lesson of what happens when we deny the presence of evil and think that we humans can survive on our own without rules, regulations, or a religion that teaches us how to combat the 'beast' or the 'lord of the flies' that exists within each of us. We can only hope that we are rescued by the proverbial navy captain before we are hung on the double pointed stake."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"well i had to read this book for school and we went over and over and over the little details such as the metaphors and hows its a microcosm etc. I think that if you just read the book through once and then if you want to go over the tons of subtle details, this book is OK but beware of going too deeply into it! i found this book to be quite true of human nature and what humans do when left without the restraints of law and order and society. I give this 3 stars!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I have to admit when I first picked this book up and read through the first 2 chapters or so I was extremely turned off by the British writing style of Mr. Golding and his peculiar sentence structure at times. However, as I explored this novel further I became more comfortable with the style and learned to appreciate everything this book has to say. The theme of basic human nature leading to the destruction of a society is illustrated very strongly in this novel, and I like how the author presented this. Despite the fact that all the characters are children, Golding has managed to create strong and interesting characters that paralllel many people in politics we see today. A worthy read and an instant classic, the only reason for the 4 stars is that some people may not appreciate Mr. Golding's writing style."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is quite interesting and does indeed depict society to a great extent. its point to the fact that given a small population isolated form external influences will bring out the primeval and basic instinct with which we are all born...in other words we revert to forming our own society, based on our so called strength at the time aka aggression. In &quot;polite&quot; society today this is largely masked and the aggressor does not literally kill the weak, but subdues, dominate etc by economic power."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book for summer reading, so of course, I waited until the last minute and had two days to read it and get it. I didn't want to read it so that affected my opinion on it at the time. I think that if I would have had more time and chosen it myself, I would have enjoyed it thoroughly. Overall I think it was very interesting looking at how Piggy and everyone formed friendships or enemies and how everyone evovled."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is one of the great masterpieces of english literature.

Tells of survival and what happens when the worse comes."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I cannot say enough about this book. There is so much depth in it and so much ot think about. There's more than just an innocence lost thing in it -like the choir leader, Jack, becoming the most evil on the island. I think Golding meant to imply that innocence is an illusion, as shallow as the choir boys' outfits. Being a substitute teacher for both high school and middle school, I would vouch Golding's implications hold true even for kids who aren't lost on desserted islands. Ultimately, the island signifies a pre-adolescent's experience, as being cut off from the world while admist a wild sway of new emotions. I'm glad this book exists, because peopel need access to eloquent articulation of youth's experiences."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I read Lord Of The Flies a few weeks ago, I was expecting something of GRAND proportion. I had read review after review and heard nothing but wonderful things, I picked the book off of the shelf with excitement. When I read it however, I felt like it was missing something. Don't get me wrong! This book was wonderful, a great ending full of suspense and drama, but it did fall short on how the boys got on the tropical island. More detail in that area would have given this book a five, no doubt"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a novel that is truly the basis for so many things in our society today. It repeatedly reoccurs throughout our pop culture, in television and film, etc. I am not sure if Darwinism came before or after this book, but the principal idea is what happens when several human beings have to survive on a remote island far removed from society. The book begins with a plane crash of school children, and the surviving children attempt to establish some form of order which quickly disintegrates. What happens from there is indicative of William Golding's impression of the true, primal nature of humanity. Definitely a classic, which everyone should read. If not, there is a really good b&amp;w film which follows the book pretty accurately."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Vivid and mysterious Lord of the Flies is one of those uncommon books which is susceptible to several levels of interpretation and analysis. It has this characteristic because it deals honestly and profoundly with human beings under stress, and because its author, William Golding, has a sympathetic and intense vision of the problems facing modern man, the varied reactions of different types of people under similar conditions, and the internal tension experienced by human beings forced to face new a difficult situations. Through its portrayals of human beings and human problems, this novel illustrated important general principles of human behavior and human relations. Lord of the flies is a thought-provoking novel authored by William Golding in 1954. The book describes in detail the horrific exploits of a band of young children who make a striking transition from civilized to barbaric. The Lord of the Flies commands a pessimistic outlook that seems to show that man is inherently tied to society, and without it, we would likely return to savagery."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a story, which leads the readers deep into a boys mind during the time of World War II. Golding's book starts out with a group of boys from Britain who are shot down from their plane and is stranded on an island. What these boys do not notice is there is a &quot;beast&quot; on the island. This beast is known as fear and the greatness in evil. Golding wanted to illustrate in this novel the dark side of human nature and make the point that each member of humankind has this dark side. Golding uses the boys' fear of a mythical beast to illustrate their assumption that evil arises from external forces rather than from them-selves. This fearsome beast initially takes form in their imaginations as a snake-type animal that disguises itself as jungle vines; later, they consider the possibility of a creature that rises from the sea or the more hazy body of a ghost. When they spot the dead paratrooper who has landed on the mountain, the boys feel sure that they have proof of a beast's existence. In fact, a beast does roam the island, but not in the form, the boys imagine."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Great read on several levels. Quick, manageable to finish, but the story sticks to the mind long after it's finished, begging to be peeled. The story seems overfamiliar in today's world, especially with 11 year-olds shooting others and tying small children to railroad tracks. When it was first published, it must have been mind-boggling."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a must read book for all 5-9th graders. The story about a buncha kids trapped on a island teaches you about society in general. Its violence, brutality, etc. Makes you wanna be work together instead of fighting each other. Very entertaining and interesting"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Although I read this some time ago I still remember the impact it had on me. &quot; Lord of the Flies&quot; must be read by the masses and loved. Though they are school boys Golding introduces a great glimpse of adult thinking. The boys become wild and they even have a desire to kill. The worshipping of the Lord of the flies is very well explained. You there, READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's notorious masterpiece calls into question everything we are conventionally led to believe - from the inherent goodness of children to the corrupting influence of society.A group of young boys, stranded on a desert island with no means of outside contact, serve as mirrors of the conditions of both human society and man's nature - at the beginning, democratic and virtuous, in the final pages living in anarchy and reduced to vicious savagery and violence.Never loses its sense of realism, the Lord of the Flies is a compelling portrait of the darkness of man's heart."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I first had to read this book for my GCSE English course, I thought it would be another dull and boring study text. This was not the case.The book centres around a group of English school boys who become stranded on a desert island. Even though it first seems that the story will follow the typical 'Coral Island' format, where all the children will have a fun time and become great friends, the novel actually develops into the opposite end of the spectrum.Being away from civilisation and morals enables the boys to gradually enter a primative way of life, which develops until nearly all of the children unite to become a savage tribe, and lose all form of individual identity. They turn to an animal like way of life, which leads to tragic and harrowing events.What I particularly appreciated about this novel was the way that Golding used the example of the school boys to explain the darkness in man's heart, and human evil. His ability to decribe events and emoti! ons makes the realisation that the savages are just little boys, even more horrible.Although this book can take time to understand (due to all the religious symbolism), I would highly recommend it to anyone from the age of fifteen upwards. Although this novel is not something to read if you want cheering up, it is interesting, insightful, and gives controversial ideas to the reader about religion and human behaviour."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book for class I'm taking in the fall. Because this was required reading, I expected to be blown away by the story. Unfortuantely I wasn't. I thought the messages he was trying to convey were indeed, profound, but I was not at all moved. It did not bring out any emotions in me at all while reading it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book two times- first of all, because i liked it very much, second- 'cause only this way you can see the most important details and symbols, and you begin to understand it. And, the third reason, i wanted to read it in other language, to compare it.This book is not a simple story of some boys trying to make it on a wild island. This is a very deep, psychological and symbolic book. It shows both the real nature of human, the process of &quot; going back to rooths &quot;, and the way the world is made. It has also very specific symbols, like the most obvious- the conch, or piggy's specs,but also more enigmathic, like the water spilled on piggy's hand, when passing the conch to ralph.If you start thinkink, how the British boys, proud of the fact being Brits , because &quot; British are best at everything&quot;, turn into Hunters-or rather animals,how they personality is forgotten and covered by paintings, how civilised little boys-children !-start to escape fr! ! om humanity and responsibility into mindless tribal dance, and manslaughter in the name of the &quot;community&quot;, you discover the truth about men. It is really scary, when at the final scene you realise, that Jack- the Main Hunter, the vicious Master-is a 11- old child !! This is a very, very good book. I loved the style - one day of reading-and the language, and some unknown elements. You really should change your poin of viev while reading this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In Lord of the Flies, Golding not only tells a story of British schoolboys stranded on a tropical isle during WWII, but he also studies the darkness found within the human soul. This allegory examines the most unspeakable side of humans- the evil that dwells within everyone. Don't read this book at night, for it may result in chronic insomnia. Even so, I highly reccomend it for anyone seeking a psychological thriller."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book as a young adult and found it to be very violent and disturbing. Now I can see how a simple story of a group of people trying to survive on the bare minimum in the wild, turn to savagedry, and how it reflects our society."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is not only an exciting adventure story, but a chilling parable for the depths of human nature. I hope all school schildren get the chance to read annd discuss this graet novel as I did. Keep your eye out for great literary devices!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i think the author's message of this book is very clear. He is telling about how mean, cruel, and uncaring people can be, no matter what age. I definately agree with this because of all the horrible things that are seen on the news, it's supports my theory. I think the author used characters best in the book because, in the book, from beginning to end, he analzyes and builds up every character. This is good because it lets you know who you're reading about. This book was pretty much believable, excpet for the fact that the kids were a little too young to be doing what they were doing. Which incidentely, in my opinion, is the only flaw in this book. If i were the author, i would have simply changed the kids ages by making them a couple of years older. If this was done, it would have been much better and more realistic. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"During my last year in High school I was asked by my English teacher to read and review the book Lord of the Flies.I had high expectations since it was a suspense novel. The book did not completely let me down. It had a plot that for the most part kept my interest. At certain points I felt that it dragged on instead of flowing smoothly. All together it is a book I would recommend to others that like suspense with a little fantasy and mystery thrown in.The part that I was particularly interested in was when the boys had their first assembly. It showed that without adult influence they could still survive. This part is interesting to me because how the boys were able to create a sense of order without adult guidance. The scene when the boys are rescued is just as exciting to me. This part shows what they had become. They realized that even after they gave up hope of being rescued they could still learn to survive. A great message to all readers not to ever give up hope.As I continued my reading I came across my least favorite part of the book. That is when Simon is killed. It shows that they have become heartless.What is truly sad is that not all of them realized what they have done. This means that they don't care. I have trouble understanding how the boys can go from order to complete anarchy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The two boys we meet on the first page of \\"Lord of the Flies\\", Ralph and Piggy, are as freshly minted as Adam in the Garden or the earth/ice gods of Greek and Norse mythology. Born full-formed, they are pre-modern, utterly unsurprised by their own existence. They are no more plausible as 12-year-old boys than the usual totemic first humans of \\"creation myths\\" from cultures around the world. Plausibility is not the objective of myth; moral instruction is, and \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is plainly intended as a morality tale illustrative of human nature, which is depicted as innately savage, held in check only by authoritarian social structures and above all by \\"rules\\".Reading \\"Lord of the Flies\\" as a version of Genesis does make the story clearer, though I make no claim that such clarity was William Golding's intention. But: A) they're in a garden paradise; B) \`Woman' has not yet been created; C) fratricide, the Cain and Abel story, is central; D) Yahweh, in the form of a Grown-Up British naval officer, makes his judgmental appearance in the end.\\"Lord of the Flies\\" can also be read as science-fiction. Most critics have taken it as an apocalyptic parable, an \`end of the world' scenario, with the boys as the only visible survivors of a world war. End of humankind, beginning of humankind, take your choice! Of course, without girls, without Eve, humankind wouldn't amount to much. If, indeed, the boys were being transported to the island, or to some other custodial location, the reader will have to puzzle out the survivalists' intent. If, on the other hand, these boys -- all British but of mixed ages -- were on a flight somewhere and were stranded on the island by a crash, the questions brim up faster than the tide. Why didn't any of them know where, why, how, or what? On a plane of the size Golding could have imagined, wouldn't they have at least noticed each other while boarding? The \`creation myth' reading eliminates some of those questions; the boys popped into existence on the island without real-time antecedents, even though they were created with the illusion of prior-life memories.Implausibility in the cause of plot development is one of the constant weaknesses of second-rate science fiction. \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" is riddled with implausibilities small and large. My guess is that William Golding had less than no experience with the outdoors, other than English playing fields. Let's get persnickety for a moment: 1) The boys start a fire INSTANTLY with sunlight through the lens of Piggy's glasses; Hah! I'd like to see that done! 2) The naked or nearly naked boys, with their tender English feet, scamper over coral and volcanic rocks all a-jumble, and through palm and bramble thickets, at the speed of thought on the typewriter keys; Golding had clearly never attempted hiking off-path in his life! 3) The island is straight out of Disneyland! If it's big enough to support a population of wild hogs, to have running streams of fresh water, and to feature a peak as high as described, then the boys COULD NOT possibly cover the territory they do in the time they're allotted, any more than Jack Bauer could drive from edge to edge of Los Angeles during a commercial break! If the island is as small as it has to be for the final \`hunt' to make sense, then it's too small for any other item of the story to compute. There are also some ecological illogicalities, the strangest of all being the presence of those pigs without any history of human settlement. Honestly, as a narrative of \`survival' in a hostile or indifferent environment, \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is less realistic than \\"The Hatchet\\", Gary Paulsen's classic for young readers.In short, William Golding knew absolutely NOTHING about nature! And knowing nothing about Nature, how can his depiction of Human Nature be considered meaningful?That's the burning question for me, in reading this rather childish portrayal of the innate bestiality -- the \\"original sin\\" -- of our species. Frankly, I think \\"The Lord of the Flies' is fatally dated; it's a specimen of the mindset of the year it was published, 1954, at the beginning of the Great Fear of nuclear destruction. It dates from an era when the implications of evolution were just beginning to dawn on middle-class literary Joes like Golding, but long before any combination of ethology and evolutionary psychology had begun to probe the roots of social-ethical behavior.Is it still worth reading? Yeah, it's kinda fun. Does it have depths of insight in the human dilemma? None that I can take seriously. Should it be a standard reading choice for school children of any particular age, as it has been? Is it actually a book intended for \\"young readers\\"? I'll have to leave those questions for teachers to consider."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies comes from the word Beelzebub meaning devil. With this novel William Golding Justifies that even the most innocent of beings can be corrupted by the devil and become a monster.Marooned on a desert island a group of British, school kids discover that their only hope of survival is to stick together and build a fire. Ralph, a level-headed 12 year old, is burdened with the responsibility of chief much to the disliking of Jack Merridew. All things seem to be going well until Jack and his appointed hunters, get their first kill and talk of the beast start to stir. Ralph starts getting more and more obsessed with the fire as Jack starts getting hypnotised with hunting and killing. As the ties of civilization get further away so do the ties of sensibility. Jack breaks of from the others to form a new tribe, promising things Ralph cannot provide. As many of the older ones fade away to the opposite end of the Island Ralph is left with his wise and trustworthy friend Piggy and the quietly troubled Simon. Ralph believes all is lost but is uplifted by prophesised words from Simon.On the other side of the island Jack and his sinister side-kick, Roger slowly spread chaos across the island no longer much sense of humanity. They are blood thirsty savages.As a storm gathers terror spreads into everyone and terrible things start to happen.Golding conjures a shocking tale that makes us realise that in everyone there is a dark side waiting to emerge and no matter how many times we deny it, it will always be there tempting us.This book chills you to the bone as Golding's words drag you onto that island and subtly yet effectively shows you even in the darkest hour hope can be found.His use of language helps to keep you on your toes as his narrative skills capture every little moment.A truly, intoxicatingly troubled book indeed."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding is a deeply symbolic novelist who relies, especially in this novel and in The Inheritors (1955), on ideas from the viewpoint of evolutionary biology and anthropology. The central symbol of The Lord of the Flies is that of a pig's head upon a stick stuck in the ground, a totem in the making perhaps, but seen by Golding as Beelzebub, the \\"lord of the flies,\\" the devil, a head of rotting flesh enveloped by flies.The central idea is that without civilization we will degenerate into predatory animals ruled by superstition, the will to power, and the primordial need to survive. When Piggy's glasses, which symbolize the tools and knowledge of our culture are broken, it signals the degeneration, the return to the wild in which, as Thomas Hobbes has it, there are \\"No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\\"That a group of English school boys could degenerate so quickly after crash-landing on a deserted island may be seen as a bit fanciful, or more exactly, as the artifice of the artist; nonetheless, the premise of this extraordinary work may well serve as a cautionary note for our times. Should we, through nuclear warfare, a runaway greenhouse effect, sectarian violence on a global scale, or through the exhaustion of the fossil fuels that power our civilization, regress to the state of savages, we have this warning.Instead of the noble savage, instead of a return to the Garden of Eden, instead of the Swiss Family Robinson or Robinson Crusoe, Golding takes us step by step from the world of the boy's school to life and death power struggles and a fascination with savagery to the beginnings of tribal warfare. As in The Inheritors, Golding sees not the good in humans, but the viciousness. In The Inheritors we homo sapiens murdered the gentle Neanderthal, here we children become gangsters of the island, on our way to becoming tribal chieftains as murderous and vengeful as the God of the Old Testament. I understand that Golding wrote the novel in part to answer the pollyannaish naivete of R.M. Ballantyne's The Coral Island (1857), which I haven't read.Clearly cruelty is one of Golding's main themes. Left to their own devices and without the restraint of civilization's justice, humans will be cruel sometimes just to be cruel and sometimes as a means of gaining power. The boys Ralph and Piggy naively try to set up a democratic sort of government, but are defeated by the brutality of Jack and his will to savagery.The loss of innocence that the boys experience is seen as not the loss of something they intrinsically had, but of something superimposed upon them by civilization. In reality, Golding is saying, there is no innocence in children, that is only a fairy tale idea to which we romantically subscribe.This is one of those novels that has found its way onto the high school or even the middle school curriculum because it is easy to read and because it is easy for young people to relate to. But the strength of this novel lies not only in its theme and readability but in the fine characterizations of the individual boys. As in all great works of literature, it is the combination of character and story that compels us to turn the pages, and invites our admiration.It should be noted that Golding deliberately left out one of the central drives of humans, probably because he did not want to muddy up his theme of savagery, or perhaps because he felt the task too great or perhaps because he didn't find the task palatable. I am referring to the lack of sexuality in the novel. Not only are there no girls on the island, but the boys do not, at least overtly, involve themselves in sex. We can see that Golding's artistry anticipated this criticism since it can be argued that the boys in this situation and at their tender age are not yet ready to express themselves sexually. I wonder if postmodern psychology would agree. Certainly Freud would not.Bottom line: a great read, a terrific adventure, but not a book in my opinion that should be read by preteens, in other words, you need to be older than the characters in the book in order to read the book without fear of nightmares."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the novel Lord of the Flies, there is a direct correlation to the way the boys attempt to set up a form of organized government, and todays world. Ralph and Jack, the main characters, both seek to accomplish complete power of the island. Although they have a different opinion on how to run the island, each boy wants to be the leader and in complete domination.Ralph is set up to portray the \\"good guy\\" or the protagonist of the story. He is voted the first to be in charge of everyone on the island and through the beginning of the novel tries to run the island through a democracy. But as the book continues, he begins to lose control and a more anamalistic behavior takes over. At the same time, Jack is competing against Ralph to turn all of the little children against Ralph to feed his hunger for power.Jack is the obvious symbol of evil and wrong doing in the novel. As the book continues, Jack begins to feed more and more off of the power he recieves. Jack tries to turn the island into an anarchy. Ultimately Jack gains all of the power, out of pure fear from the little ones. The chronological order of the book also covers the necessary toics needed to show the rise and decline of the different leaders."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was written excellentally by Golding expressing the overall problems of society. The destruction of innocence and rationality helps to improve his theme. The overall twists in the plot and storyline make it an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is extremely easy to read, mostly fast paced, and very insightful. Golding has many points that he makes in this novel. To name just a few:1. The form of government does not matter so much as the character of the individuals being governed. The best government in the world will fail if those being governed have poor character. A democraticly ruled island of criminals will likely be worse off than a country of well-to-do people ruled by a dictator. Ralph's government fails, not because it is necessarily a bad form of government, but because of the character of the boys on the island, who easily fall prey to the ideal of Jack. Golding is saying that the problems in our society are not due to the form of government that we have, but to the moral character of the citizens of our country.2. The decay of belief in rationality. Piggy represents rational thinking. His glasses are broken part way through the book, and he can no longer see clearly. In the end, the school-boys turned savages kill Piggy, signifying the death of rationality. Goulding was mourning the slow decay of rational thinking in the West, and it can easily be seen that it has now decayed beyond what Goulding was appaled at, as postmodernism has openly rejected rationality.3. The Freudian concept of ego, superego, and id. Other reviewers have already explained this, so I will not simply repeat what they have said.In conclusion, this is a classic for a reason: it is well written, and expresses the philosophy that Goulding pulled out of the 1950's. It is a very well written tragedy, and deserves to be read.Overall grade: A."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Given the current state of the world, and especially current events as of this writing, it's hard to say that LORD OF THE FLIES is shocking. But it is, in its own way, and hopefully will remain so. In this Golding novel, society is held up for us to look at, through the actions of a few stranded boys on an island. Metaphors abound, and for good reason: Golding is trying to teach us something by putting our own society's evils on display via a group of gone-wild adolescents. And it works. The unfortunate thing is that we, as a society, seemed to not have learned the lesson Golding was trying to teach. This is a classic, stellar book with a superb message--if only we would listen. Would also recommend two other books as we read them in lit class: CANNERY ROW by Steinbeck, BARK OF THE DOGWOOOD (I think this one's getting banned), and OF MICE AND MEN."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by Sir William Golding is about a group of boys trapped on an island in the middle of nowhere because their plane crashed. Lord of the Flies described how the kids dealt with life on the island with no adults and no sign of rescue in sight.Lord of the Flies is an interesting book. It has great interaction among the characters, especially between Ralph and Jack. Ralph is an athletic kid. He believes in order and building a civilization on the island. That is why Jack and he fight. Jack is a strong-willed kid. He believes that the best way to run the island is just go hunt, and turn in the rest of the castaways into savages. Ralph was the original leader of the tribe Jack, however, did not like how Ralph was leading, and he started his own tribe. The two tribes did not get along and that made the story interesting.I enjoyed the way the boys learned to survive on the island by hunting and getting their own food. Jack's tribe hunting the boar down was quite exciting. However, I did not enjoy the ending of the book. The story ended too abruptly and almost ruined the book for me. The book also would have been better if it had told more about the happenings. All in all, Lord of the Flies was good book, but because of the ending was disappointing. That is why I rate it 3 out of 5."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is an important book of what happens in a society when there are no rules or any guide lines to follow. Ever since the boys were placed on the island they were destined to fail at creating their own perfect environment. The setting they are in starts out as a good fun environment to them but by all of the boys hunger for power it turns them against eachother and turns this so called \\"good\\" island, into a \\"bad\\" island.Jack is a representation of evil by how he thirsts for blood and meat as a opposed to being rescued. He would let the fire go out which is their only chance for survival just to cut open a pig. Ralph represents good by trying to create order, shelter and a way to be rescued. Jacks group takes over the island creating the human motivation for evil and hunting. Ralph being the only one left his motivation is forced into surviving as opposed to creating order. The whole island turns to chaos when just one person takes control. This person represents the devil figure and he takes down everyone on the whole island except for Ralph. This book shows how important rules and order are in a society today. It also shows how human motivation can completely take over the whole human body and let barbaric things happen that would not happen in a normal oderly society today."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I remember reading Golding's novel as a teenager for some English class I didn't care about. I had a littlun's attention span then, and never really understood the work.So I gave it a re-read. This time, I may have grasped a few more things.Why are there no females on the island? The presence of females would have turned the novel at best into a pulp teen romance novel, at worst into a Survivor episode. Teen and pre-teen romantic entanglements on a remote island. Yikes. Their absence is to me striking. I think Golding chose to leave them out because, like in real life, girls only complicate things.It seems unlikely as well that dozens of young boys would end up on a remote island by themselves. Something like a Gilligan's Island, English boys-only school field trip? I understand it had to happen like this in order for the story to develop, but I wonder how all the adults could be killed and somehow small boys survived a terrible boating accident.It is obvious that the novel is a social parable seen through boy-play. It mocks human superstitions and fears (the beast) and stupid clan alliances. It explains how we humans, with all our modern technological inventions, are only an instant away from devolving into savages. We need authoritarian symbols (the conch in the story) and rules to stay the decline. The conch in the story always calls the boys to order, up until the first human sacrifice of Simon.The boys engage in ritualistic-like pig sacrifices, where they chant Kill the pig! Spill the blood! Slit her throat! in a savage mantra, and proceed to devour the meat after the killing. Ralph, representing law and order, takes part in the ritual by eating the pig flesh; he is hungry even though he is disgusted by the ritual. The sacrifice ritual eventually devolves into human offerings, with the killing of Simon. We know who is next, because Piggy (the despised intellectual) predicts he is. And then the final act is to attempt to destroy Ralph, who represents all law and order. Ralph is only rescued in the end by the Naval Officer, ultimate adult authority.It is significant that the youngest boys exclaim that the beast lives out in the sea, after a search on the island fails to uncover any monster. The bodies of the human sacrifices, Piggy, Simon, even the Pilot, are washed out to sea in a symbolic offering to the unknown Sea-monster.Some reviewers have criticized the work for being overly simplistic. I say good chefs boil their soups down to concentrate the flavors. The symbolism is rich and potent in this text, and many are the modern writers in need of this advice."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's disconsolate tale of a couple of young boys trapped on an island after a terrible plane crash is exciting and powerful. It all starts when a young boy named Ralph sets out to search the island for any other people. He finds a boy named Piggy (another boy from the plane crash) and a couple of other boys. Everything seems to be going well on the island until they discover the body of a dead pilot and mistake it for a terrible monster. I would not recommend this book for children under the age of ten due to its complex descriptions of its characters and settings that at some times I couldn't understand. I think the way William Golding made the book similar to what can happen without a good government and what it is like living in a state of nature was a good way of explaining it to teenagers who read this book. I would recommend this exciting and powerful book to other people."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Stumbling through the jungle, the fair-haired boy makes it to a beach and finds a chubby boy. After crashing on the island, they're surprised to see each other. Ralph along with a handful of other boys are on a plane evacuating a war area and get shot down. They crash onto and island where they are scattered among the island. No adults are found to have survived so Ralph and Piggy find a conch shell in the water on the beach and use it as a horn to call the other survivors. They all meet up on a rock ledge with fallen trees, conveniently placed, for benches. Ralph is decided as leader and immediately appoints Jack as head of the hunters. They decide that the first thing they'll need is a fire as a signal in case any ships are nearby. Everyone runs off to get wood and eventually they create a huge bonfire. It gets out of control and burns down a good amount of the jungle. The hunters are requested to get food while the others build shelters. Everyone slacks off except Ralph, Jack, and Simon. Eventually Jack convinces everyone that Ralph being leader isn't going to work and they all turn on him. Ralph escapes into the jungle. The boys that stuck with Ralph and Ralph go to try and reason with Jack and his followers but they don't listen and start throwing spears at the others and once again, Ralph escapes, but this time by himself. He sprints to the beach and faints. When he wakes up, there's a British Officer standing above him and Jack and his followers come running out of the jungle. They all realize how they've turned into horrid monsters and cry. Then they all board the ship and are off to a civilized and safe location. I enjoyed reading Lord of the Flies. It was full of brave, sane, and strong boys. Though the boys were only 12 years and younger in age, they still formed a semi-civilized \\"government\\". There was also the twist where Jack pulls everyone away from Ralph and turn on him. One fact that I found interesting yet disturbing was that they started reverting to cannibalism to survive.Ralph was almost immediately chosen as leader and not surprisingly. He did find the conch and call everyone to a meeting and got them organized. Even of age 12, he was reasonably intelligent and also appointed other positions such as head of the hunters, Jack. Ralph did a great job and kept his sanity even when everyone began doubting whether or not they would ever be rescued. He kept them sane too, for the most part.When Jack convinced most of the boys that Ralph wasn't doing a good job being leader, I thought that Ralph would be thrown out of power, which he was, and he would be forced to obey Jack. Instead though, he kept some of the boys on his side including Piggy and tried to reason with Jack and the others. Because Jack was stronger than all of his followers and had better leadership skills, he made them run Ralph and Piggy off even if they had to kill them. Piggy was killed but Ralph escaped. Jack continued to pursue Ralph with the others. It was truly a surprising twist and made me want to read even more.The one thing that bothered me the most was that the boys reverted to cannibalism to survive because they couldn't catch any pigs on the island. It was mainly Jack's group that reverted to this though. All of Ralph's followers were subject to cannibalism while only Ralph escaped it.I was never bored with this selection and I would encourage all people that aren't disturbed by any of the facts that have been shown here to pick up Lord of the Flies and read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a very enjoyable book. It is a book that you would enjoy reading if you like analyzing day-to-day life in your litature. The way Golding makes the boys on the island symbolize people and actions in the real world is what makes the book so good. I origianly thought the book was gooing to be boring and hard to catch on to but after I got into the book I wanted to know more about the characters and what was going to happen next. If you dont like putting yourself into your reading then you would not like this book. The plot in this story is always changing, because right when you thilnk something predictable is going to happen ,golding puts a spin on how they characters act or what their next action is going to be. Overall I thought Lord of the Flies is a good book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book Lord of the Flies was a pretty good book. I liked it because it was very interesting and you always wanted to know what happens next so you couldn't put the darn book down. It was also very interesting and had quite a bit of action in it with things happening that you would never think would happen. The reason i didn't like this book is because one its a book and i hate reading but another is beacuase when it starts in the first chapter it starts out way to boring but overal once you get passed the first chapter it is a very good book and i liked it. I would recomend this book to people like like tho read first of all and i would also recommend this if u like guessing books where you dont know what is going to happen next."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I liked how this book, \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is an allegory, which has an attemt to relate the island to the actual world that we live in. Mostly everything in this book, has a double meaning, or stands as a symbol for something else in the world. Even the characters in the book, if you think about it, stand for some kind of person or some kind of stereotype of a person. The island that they crash land on is an allegory, or a symbol of the world. I think that the conch shell stood for authority, and in the world, would have been the government. This is an awesome book for people who like finding the deeper meanings of things, and for people who take the time to analyze novels. While you are reading this book, I would suggest that you take the time to analyze and think about the comparisons the author is making."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In my opinion,I thought this was a real interesting book. One of the things I enjoyed most about this book is that everything has a deeper meaning then you think. You have to try to thinik beyond what the words say and you have to have a big imagination. The only thing I didn't like about the Lord of the Flies is the deaths that occur in the story. I say this because I prefer to read happy and cheery books and the deaths in the story sort of brought me down.I think other people would also like this book. I say this because most readers like to read books that they can relate to, and in this story there are a wide variety of people that anyone can compare himself or ferself to."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book was really boring and some parts were hard to understand for me.But the book was overall a very interesting book. It talks about the defects on human beings and it makes you think that if you were on the boys' shoes which side of you would come out:the evil or the good. Or if you would become a savage just like they did.But in the end you realize that ,that's how the real world is."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think that Lord of the Flies is a very good book it has a meaning and has very neat relations to our world .When you stop and think about it Lord of the Flies teaches you a good lesson about the way we live and it shows that when you stick people in dier situations their true character comes out. I mean it is crazy how the boys are fighting and what saves them is a killing machine, its almost like its a continuous circle.I really like this book it kept me on the edge of my seat. How mean some of the boys were made me mad. I thought it was really sad that ralph told everyone the fat boys name was Piggy and you never really find out his name through the story. If anything in this book bugged me it would be the fact that it doesn't continue on and tell you what happens to everyone. The part in the book that stuck out to me the most was the death of Simon because it was intense, I thought it had such meaning and depth, because it was the death of all reason. I loved that when simon died Golding said the trees and water drained color, becuase it was such a great personification. I would say all the similes, personifications, and metaphors as well as the main plot and what the story stood for really caught my attention. I wonder if this book would be re-written in about 20 years if anything would change? i wonder if the nature of people would change? This book is great and I would give anyone the advice to read it because you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is my favorite book. This chilling tale of human nature is one of the best books written. read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is one fabulous book full of great themes, motifs, and symbols. Golding, although it is apparent that he really hates humanity and is a bitter man, is such a wonderful writer and makes this story come to life in more than one way. This book's reference to Christian Iconography is so great that it gives this story so much more depth. His symbols are also one thing that show us what human nature is really about and how it actually is.This book is about a group of choir boys that get stranded on an island during a war. They try to establish rule and order but eventually find themselves trying very hard just to stay alive while their hope for being rescued is floating off on the horizon. With all the adventures that show us what humanity is really like, this is one read that everyone should enjoy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you are a William Golding fan, or you desire a novel jam-packed with action and excitement from cover to cover, you will love Golding's most famous novel, Lord of the Flies. In this literary masterpiece, Golding takes an imaginative look at the life of young boys in an extraordinary situation: without rules, boundaries, or a defined social system. His boundless sense of imagination, and his unparalleled creativity allow him to form a lifelike environment in which the reader can capture a sense of reality on such a seemingly bazaar topic. Set on a small deserted tropical island, thickly wooded by rain a forest, and a harsh jungle, the boys often have trouble in their fight for survival. One may ask... How did the boys find themselves on this island?During a nuclear war, at an unspecified time in future, a plane carrying British schoolboys crash-landed, the boys found themselves alone and helpless. Golding did not set a specific time period in which the story takes place. By doing this, he allows us, the reader, to put the story in the time we desire - making it more enjoyable to its variety of readers. The boys had crash-landed on their new home; and few other people would ever believe the story of this place should the boys ever return to Britain one day to tell it. The perseverance, and leadership of a few twelve year olds, kept the majority of the six to twelve year old bys occupied and leading productive lives away from the civilization they were accustom to. William Golding tells the story of the boy's interminable stay on this otherwise - despondent piece of rock. Golding stresses their trials and tribulations on this undiscovered place, and how boys become savages when culture and pressure are not present in someone's life. The boys' primitive instincts reared their ugly heads while they were living on the island - they had never lived in such a way ever before. .The novel begins with two boys, Ralph and \\"Piggy\\", who at first are alone - no other boys are present. They are looking at the destruction of the jungle caused by the rough descent of their plane. Eventually the boys begin to congregate. Showing a great sense of maturity, Ralph takes charge - and assesses their situation. The boys range from six to twelve years old, and at first it seems like there is no way to keep order. Ralph decides that they are going to run their island as a democracy - the boys vote to keep Ralph as their leader, though many of the boys stay loyal to Jack. A few of the biguns (or older boys) were fighting for control of the island. Jack, another boy of twelve, rivals Ralph for leadership throughout the novel - Jack quickly becomes the leader of the hunters. Previously, a group of choirboys, the hunters became a savage faction. They collected pigs and other forms of meat for the boys to eat in addition to their regular diets of berries.Ralph, despite Jacks competition, was able to maintain control of most of the boys for the better part of the story. His own minor digressions into savagery however, put his leadership into question - and Jack eventually took control of the island. Golding's last fifty pages, depict an island in utter chaos. His satiristic attitude of the adult world, mock the political and militaristic disputes in our world now. He shows how a small group of boys can sum up our entire society with both political rivalries, and groups battling each other for control. Lord of the Flies is a great novel! William Golding really struck gold on this one! Take a journey unlike any other - a planeload of preteens, lost on an uninhabited island. A fight of their own accompanies their fight for survival on this small-unknown isle. Will they ever get off?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies, lucidly written by William Golding, tells of the terror and adventure that befalls a misfortunate group of young boys. The story takes place in the future at the outbreak World War III, which the author predicts will occur. The first page of the novel describes two of the main characters, Ralph and Piggy, exploring a jungle on the island where they had just crash-landed, discussing their plane crash. Ralph, Piggy, and a plane full of other children are headed to an orphanage-like facility when their jet goes down on an uninhabited, tropical island. For the rest of the novel, the fate of the surviving boys will become the author&#65533;s main focus.Ralph and Piggy gather the boys on the island. Ralph, being a natural leader, creates basic rules for the children to follow and a strategy for survival and rescue. Immediately, one of the older boys, Jack, is highly confrontational with Ralph and his authority. Ralph&#65533;s main priority as chosen leader is to build a signal fire that will continuously produce smoke in order to get the attention of passing ships. Ralph and Piggy do their best to maintain order, law, and a functioning community. Jack and many others no longer wish to be part of Ralph&#65533;s tribe, with all of the rules, jobs, and responsibilities. Jack becomes chief of this own tribe and incessantly harasses Ralph. The two warring clans are forced to deal with one another and well as a mysterious beast that lives on top of the island&#65533;s mountain. Throughout the book, all of the characters face both external and internal conflicts.In the first chapter of Lord of the Flies the setting of the story is meticulously described. While reading Golding&#65533;s portrayal of the island&#65533;s climate, I almost felt sweaty and fearful of poisonous jungle creatures. Golding is an expert in the art of showing the idea he is expressing, not literally telling the reader.&#65533;[The boy with fair hair] had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him&#65533;the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily around the creepers and broken trunks&#65533; (page 7).I extremely enjoyed reading this novel. It is psychologically fascinating, providing a rarely discussed insight to the savagery of the human mind. This is not a light read; rather it is a book to seriously read two or more times in order to fully appreciate it.There is a clear connection between Lord of the Flies past and current tribal warfare, political factions, even the business world. Another similarity between this book and reality can be found in adolescent social situations. In many schools several group leaders emerge and compete for students to follow them. When this struggle occurs in schools, it is of course not as violent or blatantly aggressive. It also does not result in deaths, with the exception of a few rare occasions.William Golding&#65533;s Lord of the Flies is timeless and a tremendous read. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the human mind, or is just looking for a book that stays with you long after you have put the novel down."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Unlike the book \\"Robinson Caruso\\", or the movie \\"Castaway\\" where they need to rely on supplies they have to gather from the wreckage of a boat or a plane to survive, the island in which these children are stranded on is a small Garden of Eden. Like the biblical Eden, man is once again shown to be imperfect and filled with original sin. The boys live on an island where it seems they have no worries. Fruit is available in plenty. The weather is great. There are no predators except themselves. Their fall from grace then comes when all this is shown to be not enough for them, and they kill a mother pig for meat. There is no god, or devil on this island however, only man. Ralph represents the good in man. The descriptions of him are even godlike or golden, but Ralph is just a man (or boy). Jack is described as the devil, but once again he is just a depiction of the worst of what is in man. Simon and Piggy who represents man's wisdom fall in-between these other two individuals representing man himself, and both are flawed and killed. The \\"Beast\\" which the children are afraid of first takes on the form of a serpent or snake and later the form of a \\"Great Ape\\" up on the mountain, but in each case the real danger comes from within however, as man is the one shown to have a heart of darkness. When Simon talks to the \\"Lord of the Flies\\" it is all explained. \\"Fancy thinking the beast was something you could hunt and kill!\\", \\"You knew didn't you? I'm part of you? Close, close, close!\\". They can't hunt and kill the beast because they are the beast. There is also no salvation. When the children ask for a savior, or sign, what they are given was a dead Man (paratrooper). It is all man. This is not a book of hope. Even in the end when the children are rescued there is still no hope, as the naval officer who rescues them is still just part of a greater war between men, and the Garden of Eden they leave behind has been turned into their own hell filled with fire. I believe William Golding uses a lot of psychology in this book and each image takes on a deeper meaning. It is not known how long the children are on the island, so it seems kind of timeless. The number of children is also vague, which I think is deliberate. They are also at times faceless children. I thought it was wonderfully written and deserves to be listed as one of the best books ever written. Even if it is a little depressing, it made me think."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel has become a hoary old standard of high school literature classes, but it deserves everyone's attention. In it Golding brilliantly develops the stranded childrens' point of view, enlarging it to the scale of a mythic struggle between civilization and savagery. Don't be put off by this grandiose theme: each of the main characters is a sharply drawn individual even as he represents an idea, and the prose is stunning--a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought that the book lord of the flies was a unique and realistic portrayal of human nature. I thought that the way the boys adopted to their surroundings was phenomenal. If i could symbolize this book in one line i would say that when it comes down to it every living organism on earth is interested in one thing and one thing only, its own survival.I thought that a little bit of it may have been extreme with the killing of eachother and everything but i think that being on that island long enough might have driven people to do things like that.One thing that i realized in the book was that you never actually find out where the island that they are on is located. My theory to why you never actually get to see this information is because William Golding was actually trying not to pay to much attention to detail because this story was about something as general as human nature.I think that the contrast and conflict between the characters is so intriguing and the transformation of these characters throughout the story from nice english boys to nasty savages is completely fascinating.I think another theme that i can derive from this book is survival of the fittest. This is Darwins theory at its best it is the show survivor but with no cameras and real danger. Instead of getting voted off you really die.I also think that even though it seems like a lot of the boys are against eachother that they could not have survived without eachother. Even though it seems like Jack was made for this stuff if he was put there alone instead of being almost excited about being a leader he would be in a state of panic and i dont think he would last too long.Overall i thought that this book was very intriguing and it is a good look at what is going on in the brain of a man who knows a huga amoung about human nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I liked in Lord of the Flies by William Golding how the kids disagree about how to survive on the island. I liked both Ralph's and Jack's opposing personalities. I believe if this situation were to actually happen, kids could act this way. William Golding's book is believable.The theme of Lord of the Flies is decision-making affects your future. Ralph's conservative, hard work ethic is a good philosophy if getting off the island is the goal. Yet Jack is a liberal, spontaneous soul with no other goal than to have a fun time on the island. At times I have to make vital decisions just like the older boys. On one hand they can decide to build a fire for smoke to signal to ships passing by and also make huts for shelter. Or they could spend their time hunting, feasting, having fun and hoping for a ship to fortuitously come rescue them. William Golding makes the story believable by revealing all the younger boys and most of the older boys to be impulsive. I feel that real boys probably would behave the same way in this situation. When all the \\"biguns\\" except Ralph and Piggy decide to hunt instead of make huts, it isn't what I would do. But many of the boys I've known would take Jack's philosophy. I have seen people take foolish risks and I have seen people not take enough risks. Some of the former have lost the desire to do well in sports in which they had great potential. While the latter have lost friends from isolating themselves.The book is average until about two-thirds of the way in. There was one part of the book that hooked and reeled me in when Jack confronts Ralph's leadership ability. The one line that made the book great in my eyes is on page 127 when Jack angrily asks, \\"Who thinks Ralph oughtn't to be chief?\\" This line sets up the way the book plays out and it got me really thinking about what was going to happen next. I would highly recommend this book to others because in the beginning it just seems like an average book and then it gets exciting, worrisome and hard to put down."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Like most people, I had to read this in school. For me it was highschool. I didn't like it very much then but I've sinced realized why that is. I like thinking about the books I read but I don't want to write three essays on a part of it I don't care about. I'm sure many of you agree with me.Anyways, this book is thought provoking. I've seen the movie too and they are both good.It makes you wonder what life was like many years ago and how we have evolved. (NOTE: This has nothing to do with creation vs. evolution, even if you believe we were created, we have still evolved since we were first put on this earth.) It's about savages and human nature.A similar book that I would recommended for older teens and adults would be Second Nature by Alice Hoffman."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is an amazing story of a journey that goes awry, and of the growing menace that confronts those who survive--a menace from within as well as without. What begins in a spirit of cooperation turns dark as betrayal and temptation overtake our little protagonists. The diminutive leader and his chubby sidekick are good-hearted but unsure that they are fit for this quest, and encounter those who would rather ignore their responsibilities and enjoy life while they can. The wilderness that the Fellowship must confront is hazardous enough, but envy and spite gnaw away at the heart of one who travels with them, who would take the Ring for himself. This was J. R. R. Golding's first novel, and undoubtedly his finest."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was required to read this book for school in my Honors English Class(9th grade), I found it very hard to follow and too symbolic. This is the book of dreams for any English teacher who loves to get their students to read between the lines. Personally, I enjoy a book that is a challenging read, but in this book, every little detail meant something &quot;deeper&quot; and it gave me a headache trying to interpret the aspect of society the detail was trying to depict. I understood the book, but, it was not enjoyable for me and if it were not a required reading, I would not have read the book otherwise. But, if you like books to give you a headache, then this is perfect for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I first starting to read this book I thought it was very boring but at the end it was so exciting and I caouldn't even put the book down it was so good I loved it. I liked how the author told the story I think they could of put I better begining. I advise people to read this."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I read the book Lord of the Flies I thought it was a very realistic book. When you put a group of people on an island you are going to have the one that wants to be the leader with rules,laws, and punishment. And there will be one who wants to have anarchy, freedom, and no violence. When the kids were put on the island they had everything in order until one person started to get ahead of the pack and wanted to do things his way and start his own group.... they either go with the one who is smart or the one that wants to go live wild. The book didn't realy catch my attention until I had to read it for school. Thats when I started to think of it and pay attention to the book. After we read the book in class, we watched the movie. It wasn't as good as the novel, but it gave me more of an idea of what the island and kids looked like. Many of the actions taken in the book were wrong and taught kids that its ok to hurt or kill someone. When the little boy was stabbed to death the night of the feast it was alright because they thought it was the beast. But when they found out it wasn't the beast they still had no feelings or regrets. When piggy was trying to get his glasses back from the Ralphy's group he was crushed with a bolder and killed. The kids intentially killed this boy and had no regrets. Many of these kids even turned to Ralphy when they saw he had food and shelter. The kids left the good group to go to the bad one and tryed to kill there old leader. At the end all the kids turned against the good and tryed to kill him and he was saved by a man who took him away from the island, but the book I gave four stars just for the simple fact that its suppoesed to be for kids and yet its telling you its ok to kill. Other than that the book is great and easy to read. There isn't that many big words so its kool."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book Lork of the Flies was an ok book. To me I thought there was too many stories going on at the same time and there was to many charcters that the author talked about. Yet it had good adventures I was not really thrilled about this book. If you are looking for an adventure type or survival book then this book is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is displayed as a remarkable novel. The plot shows suspense, adventure, and thrills. As the novel slowly uncovers itself, each of the character's inside personality also slowly reveals. The novel shows the extent of action humans would take for survival and the wide and vague diverse personalities different people contain within.Once the reader picks up the book, they would be enthralled in the novel and would feel trapped within. The words are used so intensely that the reader will often feel as if they are part of the story. This novel is beautifully written and the plot is presented in a unique manner.&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is a rather tragic and frightening novel. The protagonist goes through never-ending adventures for the hope of survival. The antagonist does whatever it takes to get rid of the protagonist and would go far beyond imagination. Even though the protagonist was a static character, unfortunately, the antagonist is thought to be a dynamic character that turns evil through a twist of fate."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think that the authors purpose for writing this was to send a message that there is evil in all men. I agree with him because the boys expressed it after they lost respect for eachother. They all showed some kind of evil on the island. The literary element that the author showed was symbolism. He handled it very well because it made you want to keep reading to see if his symbolism was true or not. In my opinion, this book was believable because imagine being on the for six to nine months. the boys went crazy thinking about how long they were going to survive which of course made the evil come out in them. The book was less than perfect in the ending. I probably would have had some cops investigate on why some of the boys that were dead looked the way they did. That would have been my way of changing the flaws."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A LOT MORE THAN JUST A GREAT SURVIVAL STORY...IT DEALS WITH POWER STRUGGLES, GROUPS, AND CAN RELATE A LOT TO THE SURVIVOR SHOW! (BUT MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The closest comparison to The Lord of the Flies is probably Animal Farm. I think the Lord of the Flies is better then Animal Farm (also a classic) because the lord of the Flies can be an Allegory to several different things. Among them are: What people behave like in groups, how childred act without proper supervision, how people act in desperate situations etc. It could be studied in a Sociology class just as easily as in an English class.A real eye opener"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I really don't get how people can say that this is the worst book that they have ever read? At first I was completetly lost because I had no idea about anything about the book, but once I got the idea of it I was thoroughly interested. It portrays a side of human nature that I never thought of, but now can stop thinking of. I beieve that this may happen if the right opportunity were presented and the right people involved, yet I think that the chance would be one in a million. The quote that really awed me was &quot;...a stick sharped at both ends...&quot; At first I was bewildered to think what it could mean, but once I realized I was both horrified and intriuged by it. It was an interesting, yet somewhat grotsque book that anyone who likes unusual books and adventure would enjoy... GO SOUTH LYON LIONS!!!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I don't know how somebody could live with themselves if they believe the message of this book. Lord of the Flies is brilliantly written and chocked full of symbolism. Hell, its probably really worth reading too, but certianly not for entertainment. Goldings ultimate message at the end of the book is that the human race is hopeless and detructive and that civilazation means nothing and thats simply not true. mabye i'm a wimp but i like to read uplifting things that make you feel good. Dickens for example. Anyway, the books are depressing especially if you like to look for the good in people. I couldn't decide weather this deserved 1 or 5 stars so i gave it three."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, was an interesting book. I enjoyed the book because I like adventurous books, and I like the plot of the book. If you don't like stories with only children characters and an outdoor setting I don't recommend this book. The book is set on a deserted island. A plane crashed and stranded a whole bunch of kids on a small deserted island with no adults. The kids make an adventure out of the situation and form a tribe and pick a chief. The kids build huts on the beach and hunt for pigs, which are the best source of food on the island. I especially like the fact that Golding had added symbolism into the story and it was very interesting to me. Some of the symbolism that stood out to me was the conch as a symbol of authority and bought the whole group together. Piggy as a symbol of intelligence, Simon as a symbol of imagination. Throughout the book, there is one boy who is ridiculed at every chance, and only one boy tries to defend him. There is a constant battle for power between the boys named Ralph, who is sensible and only concerned with getting rescued, and the boy called Jack, who is a savage and only thinks of hunting pigs and having fun. After heated arguments that split the boys in two tribes. A hunting tribe and a tribe to try to get rescued. Ralph was clearly always the more rational of the two as he constantly focused on trying to have people build shelters, and a fire, which he hoped would eventually be what saved them. Jack had a strange desire for hunting and no care with what happens to them on the island. Piggy seems like a bright child with good ideas, but because of his silly appearance he receives no respect from the other kids. Again I enjoyed this book it kept my attention thought the whole time I was reading it. It was a great story to read and be apart of I would defiantly recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As I began to read &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; by William Golding I immediatly thought that this book would not be able to keep my attention. As I read-on I became more and more interested in this book. There were times that I was not able to put it down because it was so intriguing to me. The thought of this group of young boys on an island all by themseleves without any parents just fascinated me. I didnt know what would happen and I beleive that's part of the reason this book kept my interest.I thought that the most interesting part of this book was when Jack turned against Ralph and decided to take charge of his own tribe. I really never saw it coming and when it did; I couldn't put the book down. This book revealed what I thought was &quot;inner human&quot; evil. I thought that it was very interesting reading about Jack and his crew members wanting to kill these other boys that they were friends with not so long ago.I would defiantly recomment this book to anyone. It was a great read for anyone that likes adventure. This book kept me on my toes the entire time; I was always wondering what was going to happen next. I did think that the beginning of the book started off sort-of slow, but I beleive it was just so that the needed information to understand the story was brought forward. After the first chapter though, it was a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, was an interesting book. I enjoyed the book because I like adventurous books, and I like the plot of the book. The book is more high school level then Jr. High because the vocabulary is kind of difficult. If you don't like stories with only children characters and an outdoor setting I don't recommend this book.The book is set on a deserted island in the late 1990's. A plane crashed and stranded a whole bunch of kids on a small deserted island with no adults. The kids make an adventure out of the situation and form a tribe and pick a chief. The kids build huts on the beach and hunt for pigs, which are the best source of food on the island and only the only other large mammal. The book is interesting in how it shows how kids group each other in different positions and the order of power among them.Ralph is one main character and was appointed chief. He also got a conk shell and blew it so that all the other kids gathered around. That act gave him the popularity to be appointed chief. Another main character is a boy named Jack whop also wanted to be chief. Eventually Jack forms his own tribe and the two tribes become enemies and starts all sorts of trouble. The violence and differences in the tribes lead to the death of two young boys, one from each tribe."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought this was an excellent book.

It is easily understood plot wise, a group of young school kids are stranded on an island. But the book is far more complex because it truely explores the dark hidden depths of human nature, and what people would do if there was nothing around to hold them resposible for their actions. I read this book before it was ever assigned to me, and I loved it then, and I still love it today. Everytime I read it I find something new and different that I did not catch before. A truely wonderful book, and one I highly reccommend."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'll tell you the anwswer. Becuase of its lessons that are used tiem and time again, even today. The story of the plane crash of British schools and their journey afterwards isn't merely a childs tale of survival, but rather a much broader theme of animal instinct vs. human behaivor. Much of the book discusses the two primary characters, Jack and Ralph, and their journey of rule. Jack has an autocratic system of rule, while Ralph relies on a more democratic system. I guarantee this book to anyone looking to have a good read, or even if they are looking for something deeper than that."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book really teaches you something. When the boys were living without the rules of adults, they tried to make their own rules but as always, there was someone who did not agree with them. Ralph was the one who wanted to make the group follow the rules in order to keep order and Jack was the one who did not care about the rules and wanted to do his own thing. The constrast between these two boys tell us the differences between the norms within a society and animal behavior."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought this book was great albeit a little slow in the beginning. This book has joined my list of all times favorites including 1984 and Animal Farm. This book had weaved political, pyschological and sociological themes intwined with the very plot of the book which add another dimesion to it. Great read I recommend it!!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Although I found this novel tedious at times, I believe it is well written and held my attention the majority of the time. Golding definately knew what he was talking about. The situations in the book are realistic. I can imagine young boys turning into savages after spending enough time on an island... without grown-ups. The theme of this novel is not purely political or social. It deals with the capacity for evil in all humans. Even in &quot;civilized society&quot; there is corruption. By the way, there is no cannibalism in this novel... I don't know why that rumor is so widespread, but it's not true. This is not the novel for you if you're looking for something light-hearted and simply enjoyable to read. It is a serious novel that deals with moral issues that are still relevent today."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I first heard abuot this book, it was in my grade 10 english class, and I assumed that like so many of the books we read, this would be just another boring novel to be tested on. As there was to be a quiz on the first and second chapter, and I figured I wouldn't bother with the book, i read the Sparknotes version. Well the sparknotes version definetly caught my attention, and made the book seem more interesting than I originally assumed, so i decided to actually read the assigned pages. The only problem was that once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! i was finished the book within 2-3 days while the class was still on the fifth chapter or so, i couldn't believe how good this book was! To this day, it is still one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I first read this book at a young age. I enjoyed it very greatly then. Not as an allagory for anything or as anything of that sort but as a story of adventure and survival. Recently I have read it with my english class and explored the symbolism and allegories. I think that the lord of the flies is a very strong book with a strong message that can be understood at many levels and I think that this is a book that ever family that enjoys reading should own. The Lord of the Flies can be enjoyed and reread by people of all ages and spending an hour to read up on the symbolism in this book is well worth it as it enriches the story alot and provides a whole new meaning to the book. 5/5 for a great read for all ages."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Ever fantasize that you are on an island free from the restraints of society? William Golding has taken that scenario to the nth in this story of a bunch of English boys, plane wrecked on an island during WWII.We see the fabric of society slowly and most assuredly ripping as the rules are discarded one by one. Golding is very graphic in his description of the demise of pigs and plants.One will never look at fun and games in the same way.Lord of the Flies: Essential Art House"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Technically the best piece of fiction that I have ever read! Despite knowing that the novel is a full-blown allegory, the characters and the emotions involve the reader in their world so perfectly that one can almost feel the book come to life before himself. The settings and the environment is very beautifully described, especially the phrases concerning the descriptions of various sounds, fire and the heavens. No work of writing can be perfect, but this one is as close to it as it can get. Perhaps that is the reason after all why Golding won the Nobel Prize for Literature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After reading Catcher in the Rye, I was on the lookout for similar kid adventures with more meaning than say, Harry Potter. This tale about a band of lost boys marooned on a remote island while the adults wage war across the human civilisation is very entertaining and a swift read.A small novel, it starts off with how a bunch of disorganized kids install a council for the safety and sufficiency in their island refuge and the unanimous leader Ralph is envied but accepted by a better behaving marching troop's leader - Jack.The conch is the symbol of power and authority vested in Ralph. The conch is passed to whoever wishes to speak and everyone listens. With such a good start you would expect them to get better. But these are human children with their innate savage instinct. And now with an island to explore and rule on they get initiated into barbarism with the hunt for a pig, supported by a hunting song, killer's dance and more.There is lot more to it than children's games here. There might be a monster on the island. Ralph and Jack will of course compete in this new hunt to prove bravado.Deaths of kids are mentioned with good subtlety in this novel and mystery is created with simple scenes/words. With the eventual break up of the council and savagery rampant in the island it is up to Ralph to restore normalcy and his rightful place as the leader. The mindsets of different kids is shown through their actions.A great parable for human wars and human nature, this book may leave you depressed even though the ending is safer than the kids' island adventure."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Why I Thought Lord of the Flies was a great bookBy Gage McMullenWhat if all the rules were taken away,There were no adults,No guidelines.A plane crashes on the way to a fieldtripwith only 1st graders and older middle school kids,the pilots and teachers are dead it's just them.What would happen?At the beach, in my bed, at the caf&eacute; I could just not put down Lord of the Flies! I thoroughly enjoyed this book because the author was not afraid to write about dark, horrible, and gruesome things such as death and violence. For instance when he explains a baby pig getting chased down and stabbed with several spears then having his throat slit by the hunters, it made me want to yell out \\"stop\\" right there in the middle of my room. If you think that's dreadful, there is a part in the book when the opposing tribe takes a large rock and throws it at a boy named Piggy, he gets hit in the head and bleeds to death while falling to the water. It is so horrible and sad but without it the book just wouldn't be the same.My favorite part of the story was when the chief of one side of the island (Ralph) is being hunted like a pig by the other tribe. He tries to run and find a place to hide, when he finally finds a good bush to hide in they light the forest on fire forcing him to run out into the open! You think he's doomed but a ship sees the smoke and comes to rescue the kids. This book seriously sped up my heart and kept it going.But this book isn't just about kids on an island it truly is about what would happen if the rules were taken away, if we had to start from scratch, would we rebuild civilization or would we revert to our inner animal? Who would rise to the top the strongest and toughest, the smartest but shyest, or the handsomest and most outgoing? What would be your job in the tribe make fire, build forts, hunt? What would happen to you would you rise to the top or sink to the bottom? This book really got me thinking so I kept enjoying Lord of the Flies even after I was done. I really loved this book, Lord of he Flies by William Golding."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"easily one of my favorite books of all time, particularly in the fiction category. the author gets across his point about human nature being basically animal in a humerous and even sometimes gripping way."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of The flies is a good book that has many suspensful conflicts. A British plane crashes and there ARE CHILDREN FROM AGES 6 TO 12 that have survived. They create a civilized group of people, but there are problems ahead.

This a a very good book if you like suspense and action books."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's novel of a couple of young boys trapped on an island after a terrible plane crash is an exciting suspenseful mystery filled with lots of action. It all starts when a young boy named Ralph sets out to search the island for any other people. He finds a boy named Piggy (a boy from the same plane crash) and a couple of other boys. Everything seems fine on the island until they discover the body of a dead pilot and mistake it for a beast. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the TV show Lost. It presents some of the same themes in the book that are in Lost, except the characters in the novel are between the ages of 6-12. I recommend this book to anyone who loves suspenseful books filled with a lot of action."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This spectacular classic demonstrates the state of nature when a group of young boys crash on a desolate island in the middle of the ocean in the 1950's. The Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a great thriller that tells a story of how power can overcome a soul and how quickly horrible things can happen. After happiness and hope turn to violence, Ralph is left with no power and turned against by his friends and hunted down.I thought this book was incredible because of the characters and how they acted on the island. I began to wonder what it would be like to live on an island with forty other kids my age and no adults, I came to the conclusion that it would be terrible and it would be grand chaos. I would recommend this book to teenagers and adults over the age of twelve because it has very intense action and hard language for a small child to understand."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Imagine you are trapped on an island with a group of boys. What do you do? How do you survive?William Golding's novel \\"Lord of the Flies\\" was written in 1954. It is an action/adventure book about a group who suffer a horrific plane crash, and the boys are stranded on an island during the World War II era. The tale involves the struggle of power between two boys. Ralph is just your average male just looking for law and order. Jack on the other hand, is a constant slave to power.Just imagine what boys would do when stranded by themselves. One thing they do is paint their faces, and turn into savages. The book brings you on a journey of boys trying to survive, or will they just be boys and play, forgetting about the fight for survival?Golding shows us that everything has a good and evil side. The book does have its twists and turns and some things will surprise you. Despite all of the entertainment, I felt this book was very predictable. What else could you get in a story about people stranded on an island? This does not necessarily mean it is not a good book though. I guess you can only judge it by reading it for your self."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a good book overall. There is a little brain power used by the island people, but the primal instinct of killing overcame most of the islanders. There was only one thing the book was missing: cannibals.

GREAT BOOK"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was forced to read this book, but surpisingly it was better than I thought it would be. On the outside, its a novel about a group of english boys who have crash landed on a island that is void of any adult contact. But on the inside, its a deep look into society and human nature. After some time on the island Simon,one of the english boys, meets the LOTF. The LOTF tells Simon that he is in him and all others on the island. Refenceing from the Epiloge p.205, the LOTF translated means Devil or Satan. In my opinion, based on this book, all human beings are naturally evil and that we are driven by self-intrest. I liked this book and think you will too."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book in my opinion is a decent book for a adventure sotry or for a exotic novel. But what it is good at is opening a eye to what our society is really like. Lord of the Flies is about about 20 or so english kids who crash land on a deserted island that know ones knows about. The actual LOTF means Devil or Satan if translated. The Devil in this book sads for the boys evil in killing a pig and putting its head on the stake so the \\"beast\\" won't kill them. It goes on for a while and then the boys split up and become savages killing 2 kids. This book represents all the flaws in society and how all men (and women) are truly evil at heart. I hope you liek this book and I think you would enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a very interesting book about a group of English school boys who are stranded on an island. The book takes you through the journey of these boys. They have to deal with the fear of the beast in the dark forest, the fear of each other, and the fear of no escape. The book shows how normal boys can turn into savages and turn against each other. The two main characters, Jack and Ralph, start off friendly but as the story developes tension rises, and things take a turn fot the worst. In the novel, William Golding uses suspense and mystery to keep the reader interested. I would recomend this book to everyone. Golding's descriptive novel will keep you interested from start to finish. It will also keep you in suspense about whether ot not the boys will get off the island."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In william golding's novel, Lord of the Flies, he presents a very dark story with a dark theme, even if the setting of the novel isn't. What happens is a group of young british schoolboys crashland on an uncharted island. We don't know where they were going and what they were going to do when they get there, but I think they were being sent to a bording school where a war that was going on couldn't reach them. The whole theme of the story is about why these boys degraded to total savages, and why they were no longer caring about the modern civilized world when they did become savages. As all of this goes along, there are many symbolic things in the story itself, like one of unity, of rationalism, or of intelligence. So as the story goes along, these symbols either become unimportant or are raised in importance. Golding did this to show us examples of what happens when we lose these symbols."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When their plane is shot down the boys are deemed with the task of getting off a deserted tropical island. A boy by the name of Ralph is chosen to be their leader and he appoints Jack to be the leader of the hunters. Throughout the book the boys attempt ways to be found, many of them not working. There are basically four main characters in this novel, Ralph, Jack, Simon and Piggy. All of them have unique traits which lead to conflicts throughout the novel.A twelve year old boy by the name of Ralph is the chosen leader of the civilization. Throughout the book Ralph has to fend off the other boys attempt at his power. Jack, elected leader of the hunters by Ralph is the opposite of Ralph. Jack is a savage like boy that wants total power and will do whatever it takes to be at the top. Simon is said as the only naturally \\"good\\" character on the island. He is nice to all the younger boys on the island. Piggy is Ralph's \\"lieutenant\\" who is an innovative inventive child. His intelligence leads to the development of the Sundial, which the boys use to tell time. They are all given things to do in order to be found, some more challenging than others.The first thing Ralph wants the children of the island to do is start a signal fire. They use Piggy's eyeglasses to start the fire, but the fire quickly ignites the forest. When Ralph realizes that the Signal Fire is out he is upset at Jack. When Jack gets back from hunting he has caught something for the first time and Ralph's fury gets lost in the mix. Throughout the novel a conch shell serves as a symbol of power. Whoever has the conch shell controls everything; the kids, the island and most importantly the civilization. As the adventure goes on the little boys or the \\"littluns\\" are becoming terrified of being on the island.Later on in the novel the hunters go into the mountains of the island to look for monsters. The littluns are having nightmares about there being monsters on the island. From a distance the hunters see what they think is an ape hanging from a tree. It is really a parachutist that was killed hanging in a tree. A character by the name of Roger is beginning to become a factor at this point in the story. Roger is Jack's \\"lieutenant\\" and is just like Jack. Cruel and a savage type of boy. Sides between the groups of children are being formed. Jack's hunters versus Ralph's people. Roger rolls a boulder down a hill and kills Piggy and shatters the conch shell. In spite of all this fight between the groups a ship saw the fire that was started and arrived at the island. A British Naval Officer saves the children.If I had the choice to read this book again I would because it is a very good book. If you are the type of reader that likes adventure and not knowing what is going to happen then this is the book for you. At every point in this novel, you could just stop at the end of the chapter you had to keep reading. If I had to grade this novel on a scale of one to ten, I would give it a nine because it was a great book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book takes place in the middle of a furious war, with a plane evacuating a group of schoolboys from Britain is shot down over a deserted island. After the plane goes down the boys realizing they will be their for a while and set up a government. They also elect a leader and, make a plane to be rescued. They choose Ralph as their leader, and Ralph appoints Jack to be in charge of food.Ralph, Jack, and another boy, Simon , set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return, Ralph says that they should light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys ignite some dead wood by reflecting sunlight through the lenses of Piggy's eyeglasses. The boys are playing rather than monitoring the fire, and the fir engulf the forest. One of the youngest boys in the group disappears during the fire never returning, presumably having burned to death.One day a ship passes and, Ralph and Piggy notice, that the signals fire which, had been the hunters' responsibility to maintain has burned out. Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and scolds the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as the littluns have had nightmares from, the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea. Not long after the meeting, some military planes battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts down on the mountain. Sam and Eric are responsible for watching the fire at night, they are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous shadow of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror. Jack and Ralph, travel up the mountain.. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt of a pig a violent, slaughter followed by sowing the head to a stick as a offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist. Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the middle of a chaotic revelry when they see Simon's shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal.. Ralph collapses in exhaustion after being chased out of the forest, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer's ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well.I enjoyed reading this book it was very interesting and had a lot of action in it. I liked how the ending began with the plane going down and the boys being stranded on the island. Another favorite part of the book was towards the end when all the boys break up and they are fighting. Overall this was a good book to read and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is kind of confuseing and one has to somethimes read a part more than once. However the way William Golding writes teaches many of lifes lessons in an realistic adventure. I would not recomed this book to someone eho dosen't read a lot and/or wouldn't put in the effort to re-read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is an imaginative novel that I recommend to all patient readers. I believe in this novel, like others I have read published in this period, has a slow paced plot that does not have incredible amounts of action. In this book, it is sometimes necessary to read two chapters before something exciting accure. For this reason I feel the book may leave something to be desired among the new generation of readers. However, I feel that William Golding does a great job of creating the beautiful, yet traitorous terrain and characters on the island. Overall, this book deserves its crown as one of the best books of its type in the 20th Century."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a very well written book. At first and for the most of the way through the book it is slow and just informs you on whats going on. Not many things are going on to the point where it almost gets boring, but just when your starting to get fled up with the books slow pace everything goes crazy. Poeple start dying and some other poeple start freaking out. William Goldings very descriptive writting brings some very graphic images to mind. The way Golding adds many hidden meanings in the book alsoo makes it very interesting. You start to realize that the book is more than just a common story of boys deserted on an island and what they do to survive. The book has much more meaning that and if you can figure it out it actually makes the reading fun. All in all this book deserves 4 stars at the very least."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is one i will revisit all throughout my life. It is, i think, one of the most important books in history because it represents human nature. Okay, i don't want to psyche 101 all you guys, but this book challenges the theory in of the \\"naturall goodness of man\\", a theory rationalized in its similar predecessor, Coral Island. Golding suggests that maybe, just maybe, man alone is not good, and there may be a part of him that will always be evil in its own way (the id, for all you Freudians out there) It suggests that sooner or later, everyone would have been consumed by this primordial and savage part of oneself, all except Simon, the Christ Figure, to whom nothing bad would ever happen, besides having the fate of a martyr. So not only can most situations in this book be almost directly related to a Freudian analogy,even the characters, but you will also see that anything in the book he mentions more than once does have some kind of symbolic meaning in the book, and you can find out what it is. The book also lets some wiggle room, enough to include your own perspective and ideas. Bottom line:a must-read!!!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Gerald Golding clearly stated in Lord of the Flies that man is, by nature, evil. He also shows that he is VERY pessimistic. But even though reading the whole novel felt like being in a torture chamber, it was worth something.The one trait that really stood out about this book was the fact that Golding used biblical references to help stand behind his statement. For example, the little boy Simon was a representation of Jesus Christ himself. And you pick that up as he describes a few things that happens to him. Simon hits a tree and bleeds in the middle of his forehead. We all know that is a flashback to when Jesus was on the cross and had the wreath of thorns placed on his head. And what about the pig's head talking to him? Matthew 5 tells about Jesus being tempted by the Devil, which is symbolized by the pig's head, the \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"I give Lord of the Flies 5 stars because it clearly states why Golding says man is evil by nature. People don't agree with the negative style, but Golding is just expressing an opinion and does it \\"with grace.\\""},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a great quick book that delves into the essential nature of man. The setting is a uncharted island where a plane full of schoolboys survive a plane crash and end up on an island with no adults. As the pages turn, you will find their newly learned civility wither away and vanish into wildness. Great psychology study as well. Even if you've read it before years ago as I had, you'll enjoy your return trip to the island."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the flies is a book based on survival--the strong overcoming the weak. A bunch of boys crash into a deserted island and slowly become very primitive. When Jack separates the boys into two different tribes, they transform from civil to barbaric. The two groups begin to turn on one another. Farther into the book, the fighting increases and the tribes really start to break away from one another.The point of this book is that mankind thinks that their society is civilized, but it is still very primitive. The world today is still based on survival; the strong overcome the weak. Even now, one angry word and our society becomes barbaric. Sometimes wars start and friendships end just by saying the wrong words. As each day passes, the boys start to destroy one another. Simple words between some of the boys end up agitating the tribes, and battles ensue.The Toronto School Board banned this classic from all its schools, citing that it was racist for use of the word &quot;niggers.&quot; As I was looking at all the banned books, I noticed how many are banned for their language. I understand some of this language is harsh, but that is how society acts. These words help to express the anger the tribes are feeling. Without these words the reader will never fully understand the hatred between the tribes."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was absolutely awful until I reached the notes at the end of the book. I was bored by the lack of theme to the story and much of the visual descritpion was unnessecary. I was also confused by the absence of important information. Not until the end of the book did I realize that the story took place during World War II. Also, I could not decipher who the boys were and why they were all together yet did not know each other for some time. Once I reached the reflective notes at the end, though, I was very impressed by the symbolism and hidden ideas in the book. I would only prefer to find them myself in the reading, rather than be told them at the end. For instance, I made no connection as to how the sow was killed to rape because the killing was not vividly described, and no resemblance was obvious. The notes told me that, and I understood the total point the author was trying to make more, but I was still disappointed that I could not have made the connections myself."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book has too much symbolism if you can't think deep enough. The book is mainly about human tendencies. It could be read on a political level, but that takes too much brain power. There is some killing and graphic violence. Above all, the book is one of the best books period."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i just completed reading the novel, Lord of the Flies. I am a 12th grade student at North Penn High School. At first i was bothered with the fact that i had to read the novel because i had so many other things i'd rather do, however after i did finally complete the book i saw a very interesting point behind it. this novel is a very true story about human civilization. it makes you really think about how people change because of society and also how people fall into other peoples traps by manipulation, just like Jack manipulated the boys. the book has a lot of symbolizm in it which can sometimes be hard to understand, but once the point is seen, the book is actually a good one. overall i dont think that this novel is all that bad. it is actually kind of interesting and i'm not so upset that i was forced to read it!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The author's, Golding,s purpose was to show the need for civilization. I agree with him because some of the boys died due to lack of rules and discipline. They needed civilization on the island. Also, I think that Golding handled the art of symbolizism best. The spactacles, the conch, and all of the other symbols made the novel a little bit entertaining. I think that the novel, Lord of the Flies, was believable because without rules and authority figures young teenagers will act in that manner, uncivilizied. There is nothing to my knowledge that Golding could have changed. I did not like it when Piggy died because he was my favorite character. I do know that without such an important event as Piggy's death the novel would not of had as strong of an efect on me."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's Lord of the Flies is so brilliant because it manages to succeed on two separate levels of writing and tell two completely different tales at the same time. The first way to look at Lord of the Flies is to view it as a dark adventure story about shipwrecked young boys struggling to survive on an island in hopes that help will find them. If Lord of the Flies was only about this idea it still would be a very good novel, but like all the great novels of the century, Lord of the Files takes us beyond a simple tale of adventure in to a symbolic, surrealistic parable dealing with the inner world of the human condition.The story, on its surface is very simple. A ship is wrecked and many young British schoolboys are abandoned on an unknown island, far away from any adults. The main characters come off as realistic, never over the top, but completely grounded and hold true to form throughout the novel, even if they do change and evil envelopes some of them.We have Ralph, most likely the main character of the book. He is the protagonist, but a deeply flawed individual. He has spasms of pride, anger, and fear, but he seems to be the most in control of himself. He is, at first elected chief of the island, but soon social order breaks down and chaos emerges. Jack is our antagonist, but it is a slow regression. At first, Jack is likable enough, but because of his pride and jealously, it ultimately leads into his dissention down to evil. Jack becomes the leader of another tribe of boys, basically Golding uses these to boys to separate good and evil. There are other vital characters as well. Simon is a confused and good spirited child, but eventually stress overtakes him and he begins to hallucinate and lose his mind. Tragedy also strikes him in one of the most eerie scenes in the novel. We also have Roger, who seems almost sinister from the get go. Golding uses words to symbolically describe Roger and the negative influence he will have as the novel progresses. Finally, we have Piggy. He is your typical outsider. Piggy is a boy that a school class would make fun of. He wears glasses, but is outspoken instead of withdrawn, as we might typically expect from people similar to him. He is one of the most complex, intelligent characters in the book, even if his backbone is not sturdy. There are other characters in the story, but these five are the anchors.Lord of the Flies is not so much concerned with story as it is with symbol and its characters. The story really doesn't exist. The boys get stranded, fight over who should be king, hunt for food, try to survive, and eventually cave and crumble under the stress of the situation they are in. The boys act and think a bit old for their age, but that is expected in a parable such as this. I don't believe Lord of the Flies was written mainly for plot and story, but to expose the idea of humans left to their own devices with ultimately result back to being carnal and evil without a proper environment to shape them. Although this is the main idea, I believe, Golding is smart enough to let us know that this is not the condition that ultimately will happen to humans left on their own, but rather what could happen. Otherwise, why would we still have characters in the book that never do result to being carnal and evil, such as Ralph and Piggy?There are many things to admire in Lord of the Flies. One is its hypnotic, descriptive imagery. One reads this novel more like a dream, a nightmare, than a straightforward tale. There are multiple references to the heat, the sun, and the cliffs, all which serve as underlying symbols. Apart from that, the struggles described here concerning the boys are astounding. One of the landmark scenes is Simon's hallucination with the talking head of a boar which foreshadows things to come. This is a completely realistic portrait of what it might be like to go insane. That is one amazing scene. The closing scenes when Ralph is running and fleeing are scary and tense, and it is hard to remember that we are dealing with just boys. There are two deaths that occur in the novel. They are graphic, painstaking, but at the same time mixed with a level of profound solitude and depth that are vacant from most novels. We feel everything going on here: the sadness, the joy, the loneliness, the fear, the isolation, the frustration. Golding does a superb job of allowing the readers to feel these emotions rather than telling them they should. Good books always do that: allow their reader to think freely and make up their own minds about ideas presented and give the reader emotions to remember. Lord of the Flies follows this pattern to perfection.People who take Lord of the Flies as just a simple adventure story are missing the big picture. This is a book that requires more than one reading. There is so much depth, so many symbols, and so many ideas about the very nature of humans it is a lot to take in, even though it is only a 200 page story. A story that reads like a dizzying nightmare, but at the same time feels so vivid and realistic. Lord of the Flies is one of the most well written, dark, frightening, and enthralling books I have ever read and I know that it will be re-read again sometime in the near future.Grade: A"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I actually read this book as a seventh grader and for some reason found it way beyond my comprehension skills lol. Techinally I read it as a class assignment but never actually finished reading the book if you can believe that! Well its been over 5 years since I last looked at it and decieded that it was time to finish it. And i've been happy with my decision ever since.The book is about 20 or so british children (mostly under the age of 13) who are stranded on an uncharted island with nothing but the clothes on there backs. There plane was damaged durring a storm and basicly crashed on the island. The oldest of the survivors is the main character \\"Ralph\\" who becomes the appointed leader. Ralph's main goal is to get of the island alive. A goal that was dire to the survivors at first but over time it becomes less and less important. Ralph becomes over thrown by \\"Jack\\" another boy his age who feels that meat is more important than a fire signal. Jack's charater is sort of wild and will go to any measure to gain power over the younger boys. Jack's test of power is measured when he finially kills a pig to prove that he could do it. And as time goes on, his power to kill spreads so that anyone who defies him will be delt with or killed.The only thing that I didnt like about the book was the ending. I would have liked to know more about what happened to the boys mentally after they were rescued. Like were they able to cope with what they had become which was almost like animals. But I did like the main point of the story. Which is, to me, that anyone would do anything to survive.I loved this book so much that I read it in 2 days and I strongly suggest that you do the same. Trust me you wont be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies tells the story of a group of English boy who get marooned on an island after their plane crashes during war time. None of the adults survive so they are left there to survive on their own. One of the boys, Ralph, is quickly chosen as the chief leader of the group over the book's antagonist, Jack. At one point, while exploring the island, the kids see something they believe is a beast. Later, Jack, Roger and Ralph see something that they believe is a beast, and so, there becomes an emphasis to find out exactly what it is. The fear of the \\"beast\\" is probably one of the main issues in Golding's work, because it creates the breakdown of their ability to work towards rescue. Eventually Ralph's authority over the others diminishes, and he cannot control the malevolent tendencies of Jack, who, impatient with Ralph's ideas, eventually breaks off and forms his own \\"tribe.\\" Two of the boys, Piggy and Simon, stay loyal to Ralph while one by one the others leave Ralph's group. While Piggy is intelligent and Simon is individualistic they both have trouble enforcing leadership, and so Ralph's cause to keep the fire going becomes less and less important to the others. Jack's group gets more and more brutal and rebellious, hunting pigs and using clay to look the role of a tribe. Chaos and disorder ensue, and the brutality of individuals without rules surfaces.While this story is more symbolic than anything else, what was refreshing was Golding's ability to create well-rounded characters. Each of the main characters (Piggy, Ralph, Simon, Jack, Samneric, Roger) are depicted effectively both from the dialogue and writing style. Golding is not the type of author that is just going to come out and tell you something about a character or situation; many times you have to make up your own judgment and inferences about motives and dig for some type of meaning.What also makes this book powerful is the several poignant issues it brings up. First of all, Golding examines the issue of what it would be like to have to survive in a situation where you are surrounded by peers, where laws are not part of the society. He seems to be making a pessimistic inference about how we operate when we let chaos or fear control ourselves, rather than being rational and objective towards common goals. Some of us may have at one point thought of the idea of being stranded somewhere and how we would react: this book addresses that idea and the difficulties that arise when one or more people rebel against individuals. On the surface this book may just seem like a story about kids not getting along, but in an allegorical and symbolic sense, there is something much deeper taking root which displays the darker side of human nature in individuals.I found that this book was more meaningful and enjoyable the second time I read it. I admittedly wasn't that much into it the first time, but the parts that we a bit unclear made more sense the next time I tried reading. If you can get past some of the British slang and keep pushing yourself, the book's second half is well worth it, especially Simon's experience with the \\"Lord of the Flies.\\""}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],G={key:0},F={key:1};function j(s,e,n,c,r,i){const f=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",q,[(t(!0),a(m,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(t(),b(f,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",F,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",G,"See more"))],8,W)):p("",!0)])}const H=u(S,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-f9277e64"]]),J=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/35.md","filePath":"library/35.md"}'),E={name:"library/35.md"},P=Object.assign(E,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{J as __pageData,P as default};
